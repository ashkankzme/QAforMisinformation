The diagnostic could prove particularly useful in infants and young children. Rather than testing for the presence of bacteria or virus, the researchers looked at the first tell-tale signs of infection: the cytokines produced by the patient’s immune system in response to pathogens and other injury processes. Additionally, within the patients identified with central nervous system infections, the CSF cytokine fingerprint was different in cases of viral infection compared to those with non-viral pathogens, such as bacteria or fungi. “Infants and young children have an especially high risk of meningitis and encephalitis and the related, often serious sequelae,” said Dr. Curtis. “Being able to rapidly identify a central nervous system disorder as infectious can be crucial in rapid response.”

“In addition, the test could distinguish viral from non-viral infections, a distinction that could spare a child with a viral infection from an unnecessary course of antibiotics, and tailor the care toward antiviral and supportive measures as needed,” said Dr. Curtis.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The benefits described are put in some numerical context. The results might show the presence of an infection, or something else (like tumors or autoimmune disease). It’s seemingly innocuous, but for young children and babies, who can’t describe their symptoms, such a tissue test could be beneficial, as the release explains.
However, it would have strengthened this release to explain why some cytokine signals (and which ones) might be better indicators than others, and to what extent based on the small sample size.
Another thing that would have been helpful to explain is the fact that cytokines can also be inappropriately released (without infection, etc). This is a rare occurrence but we’d still want to know that this distinction could be made as well.

Now, a smaller study that asked people with melanoma and those without the disease to recall their use of NSAIDs has found that taking these drugs - particularly aspirin - at least once a week for more than 5 years may have offered some protection against the deadly disease. The findings are interesting, but should not lead people to conclude that popping a few painkillers will reduce their risk of skin cancer, cautioned Dr. Maryam Asgari of Kaiser Permanente Northern California and the University of California San Francisco, who co-authored the 2008 study. “I think the jury is still out.”

There’s reason to hope NSAIDs might offer some protection against this type of cancer, however - earlier this year, a review found that people who use painkillers such as ibuprofen on a regular basis may be less likely to get bladder cancer. Unfortunately, the technique — comparing people with melanoma to those without - is fraught with potential problems, said Asgari. She and her colleagues found no evidence that taking NSAIDs had any effect on risk of developing the deadly skin cancer.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story adequately explained: “..more than 40 percent of people who were cancer-free said they’d been taking NSAIDs at least once per week for more than 5 years, versus only 28 percent of those who developed melanoma.”
More importantly, it quoted one expert, “I wouldn’t recommend (taking NSAIDs to reduce melanoma) just based on this” new study.

The move was part of a comprehensive plan the agency announced last summer to regulate tobacco and nicotine, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said on a call with reporters. That plan marked a major shift designed to give adult smokers a wider range of alternatives, including potentially less harmful e-cigarettes. The FDA is seeking additional research and data for public review, Gottlieb said, as it tries to develop a nicotine product standard. Gottlieb said the FDA was also seeking public opinion on whether a product standard should be implemented all at once or gradually. The FDA will seek public input and scientific research on the role that flavors such as menthol play in tobacco addiction, and for the regulation of premium cigars, Gottlieb said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story informed readers that the FDA’s own analysis predicts “would help 5 million smokers quit within a year and prevent more than 33 million teens and young adults from becoming regular smokers by the year 2100.” We think more could have said about the data this was based, but we address that below, in evidence quality.

After 13 minutes, patients who got CPR at the scene continued to have better survival odds but the difference was no longer statistically meaningful. “Early CPR saves lives, and the lack of CPR efforts from bystanders could result in significantly decreased chances of survival,” said lead study author Dr. Shahzleen Rajan of Copenhagen University Hospital in Denmark. If the ambulance took more than 13 minutes, the survival rate was 3.7 percent in the CPR group and 1.5 percent for the others - a difference that wasn’t statistically meaningful. The study is observational and doesn’t prove bystander CPR increases survival odds, the authors note in Circulation. “When someone does not have that knowledge, they tend to be more reluctant to act and may fear making things worse.”
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job of giving exact numbers of survivors who did and didn’t receive CPR in the study. It provides exact survival times for ambulance arrivals at 5, 10, and 13 minutes. These statistics are provided both in terms of percentages and ratios.

"The possibility of getting almost all patients nearly clear and able to live their lives without the burden of this disease impacting them every day is getting close to reality." The disease affects nearly 3 percent of the world's population, according to the World Psoriasis Day consortium, but about half of all patients with psoriasis do not get any treatment, Dr. Gordon said. The new drug works by blocking a protein specifically implicated in psoriasis, called interluekin 23; older drugs affect the immune process more generally. "By doing so, we are able to build new treatments that specifically target the immunological processes of psoriasis while leaving even more of the normal immune system intact." This study was supported by Janssen Research and Development, the manufacturer of guselkumab.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release is fairly clear in this regard, reporting that 81 percent of patients taking a 200-milligram dose of guselkumab reported “minimal” or no psoriasis symptoms after 40 weeks of treatment, compared to 49 percent of patients taking adalimumab. The release doesn’t note that patients taking 200-mg doses of guselkumab did only slightly better than patients taking a 100-mg dose, and that the 100-mg dose fared slightly better at various points during the first 40 weeks of treatment. But that’s a level of detail that perhaps we can’t expect.
The release would have been better if it specifically noted that further study will be needed in order to find out if the observed benefits last longer than a year. The release also could have noted that the patients in this study were overwhelmingly white (91%) and male (71%), so it remains to be seen if a more diverse patient population would get similar benefits.

Such results are why the treatment is on track to become the first gene therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration. And childhood leukemia is just the start for a field that has attracted intense interest in academia and industry. Many of them took part in the clinical trial, and all have gotten extensive training by Grupp and others. And although checkpoint inhibitors are off the shelf, with every patient getting the same drug, CAR T-cell therapy is customized to an individual. The article that appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine in August 2011 created a “firestorm,” June said — one that brought them new resources.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This is satisfactory, but barely. Here’s how the story addresses benefits for the CAR T-cell treatment: “In the pivotal trial testing the therapy in almost a dozen countries, 83 percent of patients went into remission. A year later, two-thirds remained so.”
That information would be much more useful if it placed those numbers in context. For example, how many patients were enrolled in the study? 83 percent could be 13 out of 16 patients, or it could be 1,328 patients out of 1,600. And how does 83 percent compare to standard treatment?
Similarly, is the story telling us that two-thirds of all patients were still in remission a year later? Or did it mean that two-thirds of the 83 percent were still in remission a year later? Contextual information would have provided some much-needed clarity here.

Those who got the therapy also had significantly more improvement in other measures of symptoms, according to the study that will appear today in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Some neurologists remain unconvinced about the benefits of the therapy. Nausieda said much of the benefit found in the study could be due to a placebo effect. Beyond that, doctors need to do a better job of optimizing drug therapy, he said, noting that there are thousands of potential combinations of drugs that can be used to control symptoms. In a sense it's a field of science that works backward: Stimulation is applied to the brain, some people get better, and doctors try to figure out why.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story does an adequate job of quantifying the benefits, using hard data to indicate the duration of the study, the number of patients involved and the most signficant outcome. 
The reporter also does a good job of quantifying the side effects, which it does with even more specificity.

The massive National Lung Screening Trial enrolled 53,000 current or former smokers to try to settle the debate. The actual number of deaths averted was fairly modest - 354 died in the spiral CT group over the eight-year study period compared with 442 deaths among those who got chest X-rays. It is most often diagnosed at advanced stages, and the average five-year survival rate is just 15 percent. Many smokers already had sought out spiral CTs, even though the American Cancer Society hasn't recommended the test - citing a lack of clear evidence that they work - and most insurance doesn't cover the $300 to $400 cost. Nor is it clear if the study results are applicable to all smokers.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: 



This story does a better job than some others in how it portrays the potential benefits of CT screening for lung cancer. The headline and lead report that deaths were reduced somewhat. The third paragraph of the story notes that among the 53,000 participants there were 20 percent fewer deaths among those offered CT scans compared to those offered chest x-rays, but that the “actual number of deaths averted was fairly modest” (354 in the CT group vs. 442 in the x-ray group). This way of presenting the results helps readers put the results in perspective. The story also notes that the National Cancer Institute said “it’s not clear that all smokers should get the scans.” However, the story could have made it more clear that the reduction in lung cancer death rates was seen after five years of folllow-up, which leaves open the question about whether that difference will persist over a longer time frame.
It would have been helpful for this story to tell readers that 300 smokers had to be screened in this trial in order to extend the life of one of them.

But experts said the results are promising, and should prompt further studies. Besides false alarms and unnecessary anxiety, the implant itself can cause problems. Still, Mehta agreed that the technology could prove helpful to some people with epilepsy. An implanted device like this could also give patients and their doctors more information about their epilepsy, he added. The study was funded by NeuroVista, the Seattle-based company developing the technology.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story was appropriately cautious in describing the potential benefits based on what was observed in only 15 patients.  The limitations were clearly presented.

The intravenous biotech drug met the primary goal of the study as almost 40 percent of patients who received the 6 milligrams per kilogram of weight dose of Stelara achieved a clinical response — defined as a 100-point reduction in the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) — after six weeks of treatment. “It’s effective in the patient population that has the greatest unmet need at this point in time,” Sandborn said of patients who do not respond to anti-TNF drugs. He said a 100-point drop in the CDAI was clinically meaningful to patients. Clinical remission was defined as a CDAI score down to 150. Patients in the study on average started at 320 or 325 on the CDAI scale, researchers said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The study presented lots of numbers and defined the scales. We appreciated the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) thresholds for clinical response and remission, the subjects’ baseline CDAI scores, and the explanation of what a 100-point drop feels like to patients. Bravo for including these points and for mentioning that the study met its ‘primary goal.’ Great facts for readers to consider that are often left out of news coverage.

Scientists from the University of California San Diego, University of Verona in Italy, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, and the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, collaborated on the project. The research findings were published in Acta Neuropathologica Communications. Early and accurate diagnoses of these brain disorders is essential for developing treatments and identifying patients eligible for clinical trials. Byron Caughey, Ph.D., a senior investigator in NIAID’s Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, is available to comment on this study. This research was supported in part by NIH funding awards ZIA AI001086-08, AGO5131, and PHS P30-AG010133.

“Although the randomized controlled trial is the gold-standard methodology in comparing between conditions,” said Thomas G. Brown, an assistant professor of psychiatry at McGill University, “it washes out a factor that may be important in potentiating A.A.’s benefits, namely patient choice and preference.” In other words, having a patient choose the form of treatment, rather than being assigned to it as in most studies, could be an important factor. Despite the largely negative findings, John F. Kelly, a clinical psychologist at Harvard, said he still believed that A.A. and other 12-step programs were effective. The review covered only carefully controlled trials. “Obviously, a randomized trial cannot address that question. But observational data can.”

It is unlikely that substance abuse experts will widely reject A.A. on the basis of these findings.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story provides no quantification of benefit of A.A. and 12-step groups as treatments, however, the story discusses a metaanalysis comparing 12-step programs to other psychological forms of treatment for alcohol dependence. The story notes that 12-step programs were not superior to other interventions to reduce alcohol dependence, and in genereal, about one-fifth of alcoholics remain sober without any treatment. A.A. and 12-step self-help groups may not be an improvement over other psychological interventions for reducing alcohol consumption, but they are an option for people who prefer mutual-help groups.

"For the past decade, the importance of fish oil and the omega-3 fatty acids have been stressed to patients," explained Wu, who was not involved in the study. However, the findings only showed an association and did not prove that fish oil pills caused healthier growth in children. According to Dr. Jill Rabin, co-chief of the division of ambulatory care, Women's Health Programs-PCAP Services at Northwell Health, in New Hyde Park, N.Y., "In pregnancy and beyond, adequate intake of fish is important for normal human development, and this paper certainly adds to the literature." But Rabin, who was not involved in the study, did add a few caveats about the findings. The report by Bisgaard and colleagues was published online Sept. 4 in the BMJ.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story explains the benefit this way:  “At age 6, children whose mothers took fish oil supplements while pregnant had a 395 grams higher total mass, 281 grams higher lean mass and 10 grams higher bone mineral content than children whose mothers who took olive oil during pregnancy, the findings showed.”
This is sufficient, but the story could have provided some context on whether these numbers are clinically meaningful. Is 395 grams (less than a pound) a big deal? What about 10 grams more bone mineral content? Is that change big enough to reduce fractures, for example?

The hope is to find more melanomas sooner. "The diagnosis of melanoma is the most serious one a dermatologist makes, and we have sleepless nights worrying about it," said Pariser, who consulted for the device's maker, Mela Sciences Inc. of Irvington, N.Y., on its presentation to FDA. For now, experts say MelaFind will help dermatologists make better decisions on which moles to remove. Another concern was that doctors could misinterpret the device's feedback, particularly error messages when a mole cannot be scanned. The agency also worried about its use by general doctors not accustomed to identifying suspicious skin moles.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story shows that the device is fairly effective at finding cancerous lesions. “In a company-sponsored study published last year involving around 1,300 patients, some with multiple growths, doctors reported that MelaFind correctly suggested biopsies on 125 of 127 melanomas that doctors had removed.”

Dr. William Abraham, co-lead author and director of the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, presented findings from the study at the recent European Society of

Cardiology Congress in Rome. In the randomized study, 151 patients were implanted with the device. Between six and 12 months of follow-up, all patients received the neurostimulation treatment. About a third of patients in the treatment group reported therapy-related discomfort that was resolved with some reprogramming of the device. The study was funded by Respicardia.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: We were glad to see absolute numbers and not just percentages used to quantify the benefits of the study.
“At the six month evaluation, the device reduced CSA events per hour by half or more for 35 of the 68 members (51 percent) of the treatment group. Only eight (11 percent) of those in the control group achieved the same reduction.”
A bit more discussion on how the device might impact future quality of life or how long the benefit might be sustained — provided the data was available — would have been useful context.

Novalar and some dentists who advise the company said it might be useful for children, who can injure themselves by biting their lip or tongue without knowing it. With about 300 million anesthesia injections given by dentists each year, company executives say the drug could easily achieve sales of hundreds of millions of dollars a year. “It is reversing the epinephrine.”

The label for the hypertension drug phentolamine contains warnings about heart attacks and occlusion of blood flow to the brain. In the clinical trials there were no serious side effects, Novalar said. Those patients would be expected to have lingering pain, and should not get Oraverse, Dr. Moore said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The article does a good job describing the clinical trials and the results.  Kudos for including both relative and absolute differences.

Still, the findings could help smooth the way for regulatory approval, wider use of the drugs by doctors and possibly reimbursement by insurers. Analysts say the drugs will have billions of dollars in annual sales and will be taken by millions of people who cannot lower their cholesterol enough using statins alone or cannot tolerate statins. (However, the PCSK9 drugs are taken by injection every two weeks or four weeks, which could deter some users.) But merely looking at cholesterol levels can be misleading. By a measure known as the hazard ratio, the risk of cardiovascular events was reduced by 53 percent.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story did a good job of clarifying the risk of cardiovascular events in each study. For evolocumab, the article said, “After one year, 0.95 percent of those in the group that received the drug had suffered a heart attack, stroke or other cardiovascular problem, compared with 2.18 percent in the group that did not take the drug.” The article went into the same nitty gritty for alirocumab: “After one and a half years, the rate of cardiovascular events was 1.7 percent in those who received the drug, versus 3.3 percent in those who received a placebo.”
We applaud that the piece reported the raw percentages, since it puts the benefits into perspective. But high up in the story, it cites the figures in terms of relative risk reduction, making the benefits sound more impressive: “Both drugs reduced the rate of such cardiovascular problems by about half.”
We encourage stories to report benefits in absolute terms so that readers have a clearer idea of what “risk reduction” really means. And since many readers will not read a long story in its entirety, we encourage journalists to put that information somewhere that readers are likely to see it. If an eye-popping relative risk figure is mentioned high up in the story, it should be accompanied by immediate discussion of what that means in absolute terms.

"What all of these analyses have found is there is very limited data that allows us to determine which of these approaches in the best approach," said Dr. Durado Brooks, director of prostate cancer for the American Cancer Society. Men and their doctors need to consider what the tumor looks like under the microscope, which can help gauge how aggressive it may be. Finally, patients and their doctors should weight the potential debilitating side effects of the treatments, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction, against how comfortable the man is with holding off on treatment, experts say. For those methods, too, there was too little research to say with confidence which method was superior in preventing deaths from prostate cancer, the researchers said. Proton beam therapy in particular is expensive, but according to this report, there isn't enough evidence to show it's any better than other option.

The report is published in the July 15 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, and was sponsored by Arena Pharmaceuticals, of San Diego, Calif., which used its own doctors as part of the study group. It helped patients in clinical trials lose as much as 13 percent to 15 percent of body weight. For the lorcaserin study, Smith's team randomly assigned 3,182 obese or overweight people to lorcaserin or placebo. "If weight-loss drugs are tailor-made to hit only the right receptor, based on physiological knowledge, it seems to be possible to develop weight-loss medications that do not possess any serious adverse effects," Astrup added. However, one expert was not sold on this new drug.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story did give weight loss amounts for people in the study.  We wish they had calculated the number needed to treat – how many people would have to take the drug for how long in order to have one benefit.  The one truly independent voice in this story, Dr. David L. Katz, says "What’s most impressive about this two-year clinical trial is how unimpressive it is." Instead of going on to attribute all of the analysis of what that is to Katz, the story could have gone the extra step of seeing if others shared that view and really bearing down on the numbers to see how strong the results really are. By our rough count, by the second year, they were dealing with a trial consisting of fewer than 500 people.
Nonetheless, because the story met the minimum standard for this criterion, we’ll judge it to be satisfactory.

“New York City was progressive and they enacted restrictions on trans fats, but no one looked to see if this made measurable changes to outcomes,” said study lead author Dr. Eric Brandt, of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. After three years or more, the combined rate of hospitalizations for heart attacks or strokes was about 6 percent lower in the counties with trans fat regulations. Brandt told Reuters Health that New York City was also pushing other public health initiatives around the same time. Still, the study can’t say the trans fat restrictions caused fewer admissions in those counties. “Here we find on a population level when we restrict them, it benefits society by reducing heart attacks and strokes.”

The findings suggest the FDA’s action will lead to health benefits across the country, he added.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The reader is offered both percentage and absolute numbers to describe the decreases in hospitalization for heart problems. The story also makes clear what differences are or are not statistically significant. Lastly and importantly, the story makes clear that the study established an association, not a causal link.

Why The Research Is Interesting: The United States is facing an opioid epidemic with almost 500,000 individuals dying from opioid overdoses since 2000. Authors: Andrew K. Chang, M.D., M.S., of Albany Medical College, Albany, New York, and coauthors

Results: After 2 hours pain was less in all participants, without any important difference in effect between the four groups. Study Limitations: The results apply only to pain after two hours. About 1 in 5 patients required additional medication to control their pain. The following related elements also are available on the For The Media website:

The editorial, "Opioid vs Nonopioid Acute Pain Management in the Emergency Department," by Demetrios N. Kyriacou, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Editor, JAMA, Chicago; Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This is a tough one, since the release does not quantify the extent of the pain reduction. The release notes only that “After 2 hours pain was less in all participants, without any important difference in effect between the four groups.” There were differences between the groups, but those differences were not statistically significant. However, given that we often call out news releases that make a big deal out of statistically insignificant differences, we approve of the way that issue is handled here — thus the satisfactory rating.

The current study reports clinical trial results for optimal use frequency. The first trial showed that activation of the HSR produced a large therapeutic effect. In the researcher's next clinical trial, 60 obese patients with type 2 diabetes from both genders were given a 12-week treatment with the belt-shaped MES+HS medical device. This determined the most effective treatment frequency. Improvements in chronic inflammation, fatty liver markers, renal function and lipid profile were also shown.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release provides quantification of the benefits of the device but would have been a lot stronger with a better description of what some of the numbers mean. It states:
“The reduction in the visceral fat area was 5.37 sq. cm in the 2 treatment per week group, 14.24 sq. cm in the 4 per week group and 16.45 sq. cm in the 7 per week group. Declines in HbA1c were 0.10%, 0.36%, and 0.65% in the 2, 4, and 7 treatment-per-week groups respectively.”
It also stated, “About half of all subjects (52.5%) achieved less than 7.0% HbA1c, which is a treatment goal for diabetes” in reference to the first study. (HbA1c refers to glycated haemoglobin (A1c), which identifies average plasma glucose concentration.) But the release doesn’t explain the relationship between lowering of HbA1c and improvements in heat shock protein, an important underpinning of the research. The information detailed in the graphic, while related to the basic research, is confusing since it relates to the animal and not the human research described in the release.
A statement from the lead investigator appears premature. Dr. Kondo commented: “Even in patients who have difficulty exercising, such as those who are overweight, elderly, or have some form of disability, this device can be expected to provide acceptable treatment in addition to conventional diabetic medical care.”

In addition, many patients need to continue blood thinners and medications that control irregular heartbeats after the procedure, she explained. Ablation was successful in 74 percent of patients, Arbelo said. Atrial arrhythmias in the first three months after ablation were classified as early recurrences and not considered as failures, Arbelo said. He said, "Relief of symptoms in patients with atrial fibrillation can be challenging." In certain patients, catheter ablation may reduce symptoms, improve quality of life and increase exercise capacity, though the impact on death and hospitalization risk is still being evaluated, he noted.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This story does provide a numerical picture of the data analysis. It states: “Ablation was successful in 74 percent of patients, Arbelo said. These patients had no atrial arrhythmias–irregular heart beats–for three to 12 months after the procedure.” This means that nearly three out of four patients benefited in some way by having the surgery, although it was not a permanent solution.
However, the story didn’t mention that the success rate fell to 66% when you considered the entire 12 month period, including the first 3 months.

In the second phase of a drug trial, half of participants wearing the highest dose “peanut patches” for a year were able to consume the equivalent of four peanuts without reacting, researchers reported Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology. Consuming even trace amounts of a food allergen can cause a reaction. At the end of a year, 50 percent of those wearing the high-dose 250 microgram patch were able to tolerate consuming at least one gram of peanut protein. The same dose worked for nearly 54 percent of kids, 6 to 11. The skin patch — intended to desensitize patients to peanuts by exposing them to tiny amounts of the allergen — may be particularly appealing to children who are too frightened to try oral or under-the-tongue therapy.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The level of specificity in the description of benefits in this story is laudable. The text makes it clear that the highest dose intervention desensitized half of the allergic participants by a relatively modest amount, enabling these individuals to be exposed to a gram of peanut protein without reacting. The story also goes on to explain the value of this modest change: this desensitization level may permit allergic individuals to manage “chance” encounters with bits of peanut that can contaminate food products.
Since this was a placebo-controlled trial, however, we wish that the story had provided details about the placebo response rate, as that would have made it clear that the patch was more effective than the placebo. In addition, the take-home message from the headline and first sentence seems less careful than the clearly stated benefit in the story body. As a result, readers may infer a greater benefit than the study actually describes. One could easily conclude that the patch can provide complete protection from an allergic reaction, and that simply is not the case.

Program, researchers in Madrid implemented a three-year healthy lifestyle intervention for 3 to 5 year olds that used their school, teachers and families to promote cardiovascular health through healthy diet, increased physical activity, understanding of the human body and managing emotions. The largest positive changes in body fat were seen in the 3-year-old group that received three years of interventions. Interventions less than two years were not successful at reducing body fat. In an accompanying editorial, Deepak L. Bhatt, M.D., M.P.H., executive director of interventional cardiovascular programs at Brigham and Women's Hospital Heart and Vascular Center and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said the program is groundbreaking, and follow-up studies to further pinpoint the exact mechanisms by which the program achieved positive effects on young children's health will be vital for implementing the program in other areas and informing the design of future global programs. The study and editorial are part of a comprehensive Population Health Promotion issue of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology focusing on issues that broadly impact public health and the prevention of cardiovascular disease and related conditions.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release does quantify benefits – but it leaves readers a bit underwhelmed. The numerical differences shown are rather small for the conclusion that the release trumpets. We would have liked some context to justify the excitement about this study.
Children who received intervention scored 5.5 percent higher in “knowledge, attitude and habits” than the controls, after the first year. However, that difference lowered to just 4.9 percent after the third year of intervention. We suspect that quantifying the “knowledge” of a 4-year-old is tricky and perhaps a bit more subjective than a blood test or other study data.
Children who received the intervention had obesity rates of 1.1 percent in the group compared to 1.3 percent in the control group. The release should have explained why the authors believe the difference of only 2/10 of a percent qualified as “groundbreaking.”
In addition, we’d note that the release touts reductions in body fat, measured through skinfold measurements, as a positive outcome. But skinfold measurements are a questionable marker of body fat given not only risk of inter-, but intra-operator error in terms of landmarking the exact same skinfold location for repeated measurements.

That has led doctors to feel most at ease giving very aggressive treatments to almost everyone. The drawback of that study, Dr. Glick notes, is that it was not a large prospective randomized clinical trial, the gold standard in medicine. What if some women with estrogen-fed tumors do benefit from chemotherapy? And while some, including Dr. Winer, predict that the use of chemotherapy will almost certainly decline in the years ahead, for now most doctors are sticking with the current guidelines, waiting for expert advice from national panels on what to do. In many cases, it is patients who want the most aggressive treatment.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Again, Dr. Berry’s subgroup analysis of several large chemotherapy trials, published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, was mentioned but the story didn’t give quantified details. The combined absolute benefit of chemotherapy for disease free survival at 5 years was 22.8% for estrogen-receptor-(ER) negative women compared with 7.0 % for estrogen receptor positive women treated with tamoxifen. The 5-year absolute survival benefit of chemotherapy for women with ER-negative tumors was 16.7 % vs. 4.0% for ER-positive women treated with tamoxifen. Nonetheless, the overall quality of the discussion warrants a satisfactory score.

A study last year estimated that more than 1 million men in the United States alone had been needlessly treated for prostate tumors that likely would never have killed them. The Progensa test looks for a genetic material called PCA3. The test had a sensitivity of 49 percent, meaning it correctly identified 49 percent of cancers. This is far less sensitive than PSA, which catches 87 percent of tumors, but if the two tests are used together they can help rule out the need for unnecessary surgery or radiation. The test was approved for use in Europe in 2006 but is not yet approved in the United States.

This is the first study that evaluates whether walnut consumption can cause changes to micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNA), the nucleotides that are involved in altering gene expression. Tumor growth rate was also significantly slower in the walnut group compared to the control group. As this study was conducted on animals, results cannot yet be implied for humans. CWC is an equal opportunity employer and provider. Cancer Causes Control.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The research on a small group of mice showed slowing of the growth of colon cancer tumors. The research proved that tumors in mice fed walnuts had “10 times the amount of total omega-3 fatty acids, including plant-based alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), in the tissue compared to the mice fed the control diet.” Although the quantification here is limited, we’ll give the story credit for accurately reporting the outcomes in broad strokes. The detailed results of what happened in a mouse study have limited use for the average human reader anyway.
But while the release does not state that the mouse study could lead to prevention for humans, we’re worried that a normal reader may see the suggested effects of an enhanced walnut diet — increased anti-inflammatory activity, reduced angiogenesis, increased protective lipid content — and assume that these affect actual cancer outcomes. Set aside the major caveat that it is an animal study for a moment — the release says that walnuts “may” slow the growth of colon cancer.  It also equally may not.

The treatment has two advantages over spinal cord stimulation, McCarthy said. The goal of this study, he said, was to judge the effectiveness of the therapy over a long period. Among the participants, 17 had the device for over a year. One pain specialist not involved with the study saw the benefits of this procedure. It shows long-term data that patients experienced significant pain relief and functional improvements, she said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story makes this claim high up:
The [DRG] therapy, which targets the root ganglion nerves, is more effective than other spine stimulation procedures because it places tiny leads precisely at the area where pain originates, unlike other devices that provide more generalized stimulation, the researchers said.
While there are theoretical reasons why DRG stimulation may be better than spinal cord stimulation, only studies directly comparing these treatments can determine this, and there is no mention of such studies in this piece.
Based on the study findings that are discussed, it may have helped some patients, but the story needed to make it clear that we can’t know from this one study if it’s better than alternatives. It’s also unfounded to speculate that it may reduce the use of opioid drugs.

“In virtually all the responders, the changes are frequently what anyone would call dramatic,” said lead study author Dr. Terry Smith of the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor. This eye condition usually lasts one to two years and often improves on its own, according to NIDDK. More people who received the drug had sizeable reductions in disease activity and reductions of 3 mm or more in eye bulge compared to the placebo group, the researchers note. The typical treatment for Graves’ eyes is glucocorticoids, which are not always effective and also have side effects, the study team notes. The duration of response to the autoimmune inflammatory disease, along with the quick response to initial therapy, suggests fewer infusions may be just as effective, “but future studies will sort that out,” Smith said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story clearly states that 43 percent of the patients who were given teprotumumab in this trial experienced a reduction of “at least 2 millimeters in eye protrusion by the sixth week compared to 4 percent in the placebo group.”  One of the researchers is quoted as saying, “That’s something that we almost never see in someone who’s manifested the degree of disease one needed to have in order to get into the study.”  The story also points out that this level of reduction “is similar to that reported after decompression surgery.”

While rTMS has ardent supporters, its effectiveness is still debated, and there is little evidence showing how long the results last. Experts differ over whether it’s smart to cover new techniques if they haven’t proved superior to established methods. One key measure — known as the “number needed to treat” — found that one patient became symptom-free for every 12 who were treated. There’s a huge range in my clinical experience.” Carpenter, a physician, says research has not found any safety issues for patients returning for additional treatments, but cost is a factor. That 19-member panel voted 10 to 5 last year that studies of the treatment showed it to be as good as or better than usual care for depression.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The use of statistics in this piece was generally appropriate, and we were pleased to see reference to the Number Needed to Treat — an intuitive measure of a treatment’s real world effectiveness. If there’s one area in which we think the story could have done a better job, it’s explaining that the benefits reported with rTMS, though larger than those associated with a placebo/sham treatment, are small in absolute terms. This could have been accomplished with less optimistic framing of certain study results. For example, the story notes that “up to 17 percent of patients” were symptom free after treatment in one study — “about twice as many as those treated with a sham rTMS machine.” The story could have qualified this by adding that the vast majority of even rTMS-treated patients (83%) were not symptom-free. In another study, rTMS was “four times as likely to get patients symptom-free as was a sham procedure,” according to the story. But again, the absolute number of patients who benefited was very small —   14.1% for active rTMS vs. 5.1% for the sham group. The authors of that study concluded that “…the overall number of remitters and responders was less than one would like with a treatment that requires daily intervention for 3 weeks or more, even with a benign adverse effect profile.”
Note: the AHRQ review referenced in the story concludes that the evidence in insufficient to determine the effects of ECT vs rTMS but the limited evidence suggest no difference.

Using hepatitis C-infected kidneys would expand the organ pool and save lives, said lead researcher Dr. Peter Reese. This is partly due to organ shortages, researchers have reported. New, less toxic treatments for hepatitis C opened the door for transplanting infected kidneys and then successfully treating the infection, Reese said. The potential cost savings could be significant, he added. But the cost effectiveness of using these kidneys versus remaining on dialysis would be significant, he noted.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story reported the main benefit of using infected kidneys, which is shorter wait time for a transplant. It said that the average wait time for a non-infected kidney is more than two years, compared to eight months for an HCV-infected kidney.
The story also said transplanting infected kidneys and then treating recipients for HCV resulted in a “100 percent cure rate. Half were evaluated six months after their transplant and the others a year after.”
It quoted the lead researcher, Peter Reese, M.D.: “And we found that these kidney transplants were working as well as kidney transplants from uninfected patients.”
We’ll rate this as satisfactory. However, we’d note that the story didn’t point out that we don’t know much about long-term benefits or overall survival at this point. Do these patients live as long? Are their rates of liver problems the same as those who receive uninfected kidneys? It will take much more than one year of follow-up to learn the answers to these questions.

For some patients, eliminating these co-prescriptions could involve some tough trade-offs. For one, emergency room visits and inpatient admissions for opioid overdoses likely aren’t a perfect one-to-one proxy for overdoses that didn’t involve a trip to a doctor. And since the research relied on patients who were continuously insured throughout the study period, it’s possible the findings don’t exactly apply to people with spottier coverage. (Although sensitivity analyses in the study for people who had lapses in insurance produced similar results.) Still, it’s well established that benzodiazepine and opioids compound each other’s overdose risk.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job conveying the risk increase of combining drugs versus using opioids alone, and we especially like its use of a bar graph to give a visual representation of the added danger. The story states that eliminating concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid use could reduce the risk for an opioid overdose–related emergency room or inpatient visit by 15 percent. Further, it says the study found that among all opioid users, concurrent use of benzodiazepines more than doubled the risk of an ER or inpatient visit for a drug overdose.
One quibble: It wanders into sketchy territory by extrapolating deaths: “If that reduced risk applies to overdose deaths as well, eliminating concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine use could have prevented up to 2,630 opioid painkiller–related overdose deaths in 2015.” This is an interesting perspective, but we’re wondering if it’s valid to assume that deaths would decline proportionally to hospital visits. An independent expert source would have been helpful here.

"Current studies are focusing on which subjects are more likely to benefit from spinal manipulation, exercise, or other therapies," he added. More than 6,000 patients were included in the compilation of results, which the study authors said were sparse in data indicating participants' overall recovery, quality of life and ability to return to work. But which treatment is right for any patient depends not only on their specific pain, but their doctor's recommendations and their own comfort level with various options, said Stephen Perle, a spokesman for the American Chiropractic Association. The cost of SMT sessions varies widely depending on the region, Perle said. "With low back pain, there are many reasons people don't get better," added Perle, also a professor of clinical sciences in the College of Chiropractic at the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: 
The article offered only broad characterizations about the treatment effects of spinal manipulation for chronic low back pain. It did not attempt to quantify the treatment effects in terms of pain relief or functional improvement.
However, the systematic review that served as the focus of the article is complex and somewhat difficult to decipher, with outcomes including pain and function at different time points.
And the story did provide the reader with a reasonable summary. Manipulation appears as good or bad as other treatment options—and it may lead to more rapid pain relief.

Losing muscle fat improves glucose and lipid metabolism so this finding is particularly important for people with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, says lead author, Dr. Hana Kahleová, Director of Clinical Research at the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine in Washington DC. Both diets were restricted by 500 kilocalories per day compared to an isocaloric intake for each individual. The vegetarian diet was found to be almost twice as effective in reducing body weight, resulting in an average loss of 6.2kg compared to 3.2kg for the conventional diet. However, subfascial fat was only reduced in response to the vegetarian diet, and intramuscular fat was more greatly reduced by the vegetarian diet. However, we also showed that a vegetarian diet is much more effective at reducing muscle fat, thus improving metabolism.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This release describes the weight loss benefits of a vegetarian diet in terms of average weight lost. It states that participants in the vegetarian diet group lost an average of 6.2 kilograms in comparison to participants in the conventional diet group who lost an average of 3.2 kilograms. It also claims those on the vegetarian diet lost more subfascial and intramuscular fat than those on a conventional diet.
The release never tells us how long the study lasted, you have to go to the published report for that. When we did, it wasn’t clear whether the weight loss was maintained at 6 months and beyond. It is very common for weight-loss studies to show that initial weight loss is greater than later weight loss, especially when there is no blinding involved.

The new study, which appears online Oct. 10 in the Archives of Neurology, is among the first to show the effects of an anti-amyloid drug in humans with Alzheimer's disease, but experts caution that while promising, more research is needed before this drug can be deemed safe or effective. There are approximately one dozen therapies, including vaccines, for Alzheimer's disease that are currently in the pipeline, Lyden noted. That said, these experimental drugs carry the potential for serious side effects, including causing the immune system to go haywire. "This is problematic in that use of these treatments may carry a very high risk for neurologic complications, thus necessitating heightened monitoring, and diminishing its applicability as a treatment for a larger patient population such as the Alzheimer's disease population," she said. The need for a drug to delay the onset or slow progression of Alzheimer's disease can't be underestimated, Aggrawal said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story adequately described the responses of study participants at different dose levels. And it clearly established that “it’s by no means certain that reducing levels of amyloid plaque would stave off memory loss and other mental declines.”

The findings, reported in the American Journal of Epidemiology, support the theory that estrogen offers some protection against colon cancer. But they point to a need for further study into the different effects of HRT on specific organs, write the researchers, led by Dr. Katherine DeLellis Henderson of the City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, California. Over the next decade, 442 women were diagnosed with colon cancer. Henderson’s team also found that the beneficial effect of HRT was stronger among women who had had a first-degree relative diagnosed with colon cancer. Family history of colon cancer is an established risk factor for the disease, but only one study, according to Henderson’s team, has looked at whether family history affects the link between HRT and colon cancer risk — and it found no evidence that it did.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: 
Of the 34,433 HRT users, 193 were diagnosed with colon cancer during the study period; that compared with 151 cases among the 13,778 women who had never used hormone replacement.
HRT — with either estrogen alone or a combination of estrogen and progestin — was linked to a lower colon cancer risk even when the researchers accounted for the women’s age, weight, exercise levels and race.

Treatment is accompanied by a moderate intensity diet and behavior modification program. All patients at the 15 study sites also underwent 25 minutes of lifestyle therapy administered by a blinded registered dietitian every three weeks. Balloon-treated patients had nearly 25 percent excess weight loss. Six months after the balloons were removed, 89.5 percent of the average total weight lost during the treatment period was maintained. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) reported significant improvements in the safety of metabolic/bariatric surgery due in large part to improved laparoscopic techniques.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: We will give the release a satisfactory rating because it notes that after one year patients receiving the Obalon balloon and counseling had lost about 7 percent of their total body weight (or about a quarter of their “excess” weight) compared to a bit less than 4 percent total weight loss for those given a sham balloon and counseling. However, since other intragastric balloons are already on the market, most people would want to know how the Obalon device compares. The release should have noted that because the trial did not include competing devices, there is no evidence that indicates whether the new device is any better or worse than other devices.

For the clinical trial, the Johns Hopkins team enrolled 25 patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed multiple myeloma, although three of the patients relapsed before they could receive the MILs therapy. One year after receiving the MILs therapy, 13 of the 22 patients had at least a partial response to the therapy, meaning that their cancers had shrunk by at least 50 percent. Noonan says the small trial helped her and her colleagues learn more about which patients may benefit from MILs therapy. Noonan says the research team has used these data to guide two other ongoing MILs clinical trials. The researchers say the trials also have shed light on new ways to grow the MILs.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release does a good job of spelling out the results of this phase 1 trial by providing data showing that MILs can target and kill cancer cells. It shows that in more than half of the study’s patients, their cancers had shrunk by at least half. In 15 of the 22 patients, their cancers did not progress for nearly a year after the MILs therapy. This wasn’t a controlled study, so it’s unclear how these patients would have fared without the MILs treatment, and the release could have attempted to provide some insight on that point. But we’re pleased that the release focuses appropriately on the apparent safety of the approach, rather than trying to make claims about survival benefits that aren’t supportable by this kind of small, uncontrolled study. The release also explains that the research provides information suggesting which patients might benefit best from this approach, and that other research at this cancer center is centered on testing this approach on different forms of cancer.

The scientists focused on patients who were already taking medications to control blood pressure, cholesterol and potential clotting. In the study, researchers focused on a group of more than 4,800 Dutch heart attack patients between the ages of 60 and 80, slightly more than three-quarters of whom were men. All had experienced a heart attack at some point in the decade leading up to the study, and all were taking blood pressure medications, anti-clotting drugs and statins. It is during this acute post-attack period, he explained, when patients are most vulnerable to a subsequent event. And they're also not just looking at preventable fatalities but all heart-related events that follow.

Of the initial 19,066 participants with a negative initial LDCT scan, 444 (2 percent) were diagnosed with lung cancer at the time of the last available follow-up. An additional 75 patients (0.4 percent of the initial negative group) were diagnosed with lung cancer between the first and second annual screening. The researchers determined that eliminating the first annual screening after the initial negative test might have resulted in, at most, an additional 28 lung cancer deaths in the LDCT group (186 vs. 212 deaths per 100,000 per years) over the course of the study. "Our analysis suggests that annual screens may not be warranted for patients who have had an initial negative scan, and future risk prediction and cost-effectiveness models could incorporate these data to improve screening guidelines," Patz said. He added that improving the accuracy of LDCT screening for lung cancer would also significantly reduce the number of annual screens.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: A thorough discussion of the absolute numbers affected gives a good sense of the magnitude of the benefits. The release noted, “In the first year after a negative screen and before the scheduled first annual screen, 17 patients (0.9 percent of all initial negative LDCT participants) were diagnosed with lung cancer.”
Another benefit described is the potential to dramatically reduce the number of false positive tests. According to the release, almost 40 percent of the entire group of patient volunteers (26,231 people) in the 7-year National Lung Screening Trial were given a false positive study result.

This means that many currently available drugs simply won't affect it. If this chain is interrupted, cancer cells don't have the necessary tools to repair themselves. This may not seen like very long in either group, but for this serious a cancer, it is impressive, the researchers noted. "Phase 2 was quite positive, but we really don't know if this is going to end up benefiting patients until we get to phase 3." In the meantime, she pointed out, a woman walking through a clinic door who is diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer shouldn't panic.

A new cold and flu test can precisely diagnose a dozen winter ailments and reduce unneeded use of antibiotics, says the company that sells it. Physicians say the test is accurate and the most comprehensive available, but some say its long processing time limits usefulness in emergency rooms. The test is expected to be used mainly in hospitals and emergency rooms, but doctors can send the swab to a local lab. The downside is that the test is expensive, about $300 to $400, but is covered by most insurers. And patients will have to wait at least six to seven hours -- maybe a day or two depending on staffing at the hospital laboratory.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story presents several benefits of the xTag test.  It is 1) more sensitive and more comprehensive than currently available tests and diagnostic procedures, 2) it can address the problem of under-diagnosis of the flu in vulnerable populations, such as children and the elderly, 3) it can inform treatment decisions by potentially reducing the inappropriate use of antibiotics while indicating when they might be beneficial.   An important caveat is that it is not known whether diagnosing these viruses improves outcomes, i.e. decreased use of antibiotics, fewer hospitalizations, fewer deaths.

The study hints at the potential for widespread health benefits from an upcoming nationwide ban, the authors and other experts say. Hospital admissions for heart attacks and strokes in those areas declined 6 percent starting three years after the bans, compared with counties without bans. The results translate to 43 fewer heart attacks and strokes per 100,000 people, said lead author Dr. Eric Brandt, a Yale University cardiology fellow. Alice Lichtenstein, a heart and nutrition specialist at Tufts University’s Boston campus, said the results are encouraging but that other changes could have contributed, such as smoking bans and mandatory calories on menus. Dr. Mark Creager, former American Heart Association president, said the results echo previous studies “and are consistent with the thinking of most scientists” on potential benefits of these bans.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

The study showed that the rate of laparoscopic procedures increased from 24.8 percent in 2000 to 84.3 percent in 2013. "Subsequently, the rate increased, but 15 percent of all anti-reflux operations were still being performed through an open approach in 2013. "We found that laparoscopic surgery is associated with significantly lower costs. Paula D Strassle, MSPH Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC also participated in this study. Citation: Comparative Analysis of Perioperative Outcomes and Costs Between Laparoscopic and Open Antireflux Surgery.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release summarized how minimally invasive techniques reduced the length of hospital stay and complication rates for patients.
“Researchers also found that, on average, the minimally invasive approach reduced length of hospital stay by approximately two days, and open operations were more than $9,000 more expensive than minimally invasive procedures.
The researchers also found that laparoscopic procedures were better for patients in terms of fewer complications. Laparoscopic anti-reflux operations were less likely to result in postoperative blood clots, wound complications, surgical site infection, esophageal perforation (which can be life threatening), bleeding, cardiac failure, and death.”
We rate this satisfactory, but just barely, for citing cost differences between the two types of surgery and the average reduction in the number of days a patient must remain hospitalized.  We do wish the release had delved more into the specifics of reduced complications. How common were the surgical complications in each surgical method?

It's important to note that statin drugs are generally safe, and harms are uncommon. Anywhere from 50 to 200 healthy people need to take a statin daily to prevent a single heart attack for five years, so even small harms may outweigh the potential benefits, the Swiss scientists say. But that test, which Grundy says is available for about $100, is controversial among some physicians. They worry that it will trigger overtreatment of conditions that the scan will pick up, but which don't require urgent attention. And it is only useful as a screening test for people who haven't had heart disease.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: We learn that “anywhere from 50 to 200 healthy people need to take a statin daily to prevent a single heart attack for five years.” That’s helpful information. It also notes that the observed benefit is less for older patients.
The story could have added that even those numbers might disputed by some experts who perceive no meaningful benefit. For example, one review found being on a statin does not help people with low risk for heart disease live longer.

The study's lead author, Dr. Paul M. Palevsky, said the results may lead to a large savings in U.S. health care costs, estimated at $100 million to $250 million a year for this type of patient. Throughout the study, patients remained in intensive or less intensive therapy, although as their clinical conditions changed, they could change forms of therapy, Dr. Palevsky said. "When a patient transitions from one therapy to another, the dialysis dose is unlikely to be equivalent," he said, adding that results could be affected by different methods in the high-intensity and low-intensity groups. Dr. Bonventre wrote that the study had "a predominance of male patients," so there is a question of whether its results can be applied to female patients. And, he said, the results cannot be simply applied to patients with chronic kidney disease, who then have acute kidney injury, since the study excluded any patients with advanced chronic kidney disease.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story did mention that the two approaches to treating acute kidney injury did not have different outcomes and specifically mentioned death rates, recovery of kidney function and rates of other organ failure.  The story also mentioned a death rate in one health care system of 50-80% from acute kidney injury.

The vaccine is being developed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and GSK against the Zaire strain of Ebola — the one circulating in West Africa — and the first doses for a larger trial arrived in Liberia last week. The early-stage Phase I trial of GSK’s vaccine was primarily designed to test safety, but Adrian Hill, who led the work at Oxford’s Jenner Institute, said it was “encouraging” that the shot also prompted responses from the immune system. The data, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, were from 60 healthy volunteers given the vaccine in Britain between Sept. 17 and Nov. 18 last year. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust charity which helped fund the trial, said it provided “good initial evidence that the GSK vaccine will be safe to use in people”. “That’s why trials in West Africa of this, and the other vaccines in development, must begin as soon possible.”
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story provides a well balanced and thoughtful presentation of the benefits seen in the trial.  It notes the study was a phase 1 trial designed to identify safety.  We liked the caveats given in the story.  “It is safe and generates an immune response, scientists said on Wednesday, but larger trials are needed to see if it protects and if a booster is needed.” “…the immune responses are okay, but not great…” “However, the antibody response was weaker than was found in a trial of the same Ebola vaccine in macaque monkeys…” The reader gets a good overall impression of the study results and the need for additional information on the efficacy of the vaccine and that repeated dosing may be needed. The last sentence summarizes the study well, “…we still don’t know whether it will provide protection against Ebola infection in a real-world situation.”

The paper from a team led by Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) investigators describes patient outcomes an average of seven years after proton therapy for medulloblastoma, a fast-growing tumor that develops in the cerebellum at the base of the brain. "Proton radiotherapy is still not widely available in the U.S. or around the world, but it is increasingly recognized for its potential to reduce the side effects of treatment, particularly in the pediatric population," says Torunn Yock, MD, MCh, MGH Department of Radiation Oncology, lead and corresponding author of the report. "At experienced centers, proton therapy has a proven track record of treatment success and safety." All had previous surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible, and all received chemotherapy before, during or after proton therapy. Study participants were tested for hearing, a variety of cognitive functions, levels of important hormones and height and weight at the outset of the study and at several follow-up visits for up to eight years.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release quantifies some outcomes, as in this statement: “Of 59 patients who enrolled, 12 died from their tumor during the study period and one from a traumatic brain injury. Significant hearing loss was seen in 12 percent of patients three years after treatment and in 16 percent at five years, which compares with around 25 percent reported in studies using photon radiotherapy.” The release later indicates that key outcomes are comparable to photon therapy: “Survival rates and the incidence and type of tumor recurrence all were similar to what has been reported for photon radiotherapy.” We’ll call this good enough for a Satisfactory rating, although the release certainly could have provided more detail on what previous studies have found with respect to photon therapy.

This amount is in line with current Canadian health guidelines. The researchers found that higher doses did not provide any additional benefit -- at least not in terms of bone development. While there were no significant differences in body composition across the different dosage groups, the researchers found children who had vitamin D stores above the threshold recommended by the Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) averaged around 450 grams less body fat at 3 years of age. Further analysis also indicated a correlation between lean muscle mass and the average level of vitamin D in the body over the first three years of a child's life. The only other factor found to make a significant difference to the children's amount of body fat was their level of physical activity.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: We’ll give this a borderline Satisfactory rating because the release provides a number associated with vitamin D supplements —  450 grams less body fat. However, the release presents some of the findings in a confusing way that could be misleading to readers. It confuses blood levels of vitamin D with doses of vitamin D supplements and it reports that children with higher blood levels of vitamin D averaged around 450 grams (1 pound) less body fat, but the headline says supplements reduce body fat. The researchers clearly stated, “This long-term follow-up of a vitamin D supplementation study in children demonstrates no difference in body composition across any dosage groups (400, 800, 1200 and 1600 IU).” The release notes that “there were no significant differences in body composition across the different dosage groups”, which makes the headline claiming that vitamin D supplements reduced body fat incompatible with what the researchers actually reported.
The release does report that physical activity also made a difference, but did not offer any comparison to the claimed effects of vitamin D levels.

As a blood pressure monitor squeezed snugly around his arm, the pharmacist counseled Thomas, 49, on his diet and stress level while checking his blood pressure. She then helped Thomas find a medication better suited for his body. As part of a study, these health services were provided at his barbershop and others across Los Angeles County. "To a certain extent, I was surprised by the magnitude of the effect of the intervention," said Ciantel Blyler, a clinical pharmacist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles who was a co-author of the study. Additionally, more research is needed to determine whether similar study results would occur on a national level, since the study was conducted only in the Los Angeles area.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story clearly states that men in the intervention group experienced a much greater reduction in their blood pressure readings as compared to the control group. It included this quantified statement, “It turned out that, when the guidance was coupled with medication, a blood pressure level of less than 130/80 was achieved among 63.6% of men who participated in the study’s program, versus 11.7% of those who didn’t.”

And there is evidence that excess calcium can increase the risk of heart disease, the group wrote. With that as a standard, 80 percent of the population would be deemed deficient of vitamin D, Dr. Rosen said. But, the committee concluded, a level of 20 to 30 nanograms is all that is needed for bone health, and nearly everyone is in that range. Such studies have been misleading and most scientists agree that they cannot determine cause and effect. It is not clear how or why the claims for high vitamin D levels started, medical experts say.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story was mostly concerned with discussing the lack of benefit from taking extra vitamin D and calcium. And in this area it excels. While the story does lack precision when it suggests that adolescent girls should be getting more calcium (it never specifies how much they are getting now, how much more they’d need to meet the recommendations, or what benefits they might expect from this increased intake), it would be difficult for a journalist to come up with any sort of quantifiable benefit or harm estimate from the IOM report. The story captured the overall gist of the problem, which is that the evidence base is complex and still inadequate.

Giving school children access to chilled, self-serve water may help chip away at childhood obesity, a new study of more than one million New York City school students suggests. The study, published in JAMA Pediatrics, analyzed data collected from 1,227 elementary and middle schools across New York City - some with and some without "water jets." The editorial, entitled "Power of a Simple Intervention to Improve Student Health: Just Add Water," said the study's findings are significant. "Sometimes, a very simple intervention can have a powerful effect," wrote Lindsey Turner, of Boise State University, in Idaho, and Erin Hager, from the University of Maryland School of Medicine, in Baltimore. "The study by Schwartz and colleagues in this issue of JAMA Pediatrics adds to a growing body of evidence supporting the importance of providing drinking water access in schools.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The CBS story does a good job quantifying the benefits in absolute terms, when the lead researcher points out that water dispensers were associated with “a one percentage point reduction in the likelihood of being overweight for boys and a little over half a percentage point reduction for girls.” The article translated this for readers as “a modest weight drop among students.”
The piece also notes that water jets were linked with “a decrease” in the amount of half-pints of milk students bought, but it does not give any specific numbers. Specifically, researchers found a 12.3 decrease in the number of all types of milk purchased per student per year.
We think the quantification of benefits in absolute terms is enough to merit a Satisfactory rating here.

The treatment also “nearly universally eliminated” the need for preventive infusions of clotting factor a few times a week, the scientists said. The results, published Wednesday online in the New England Journal of Medicine, represent “another example of the gene-therapy renaissance,” Matthew Porteus, a pediatrician at Stanford University, wrote in an accompanying editorial. Still, he noted, the study has some limitations. In addition, he said, researchers need to find ways to provide the therapy to a broader group of people, including children, and to figure out how to reduce the costs involved. Still, the therapies can produce at least some offsetting savings.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story summarizes the outcome of the small, 10-person trial that dominates this narrative:
Lindsey George, the lead investigator and a hematologist at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said that nine of the 10 men in the trial didn’t experience any bleeding episodes after the gene therapy treatment. The one patient who needed clotting factor because of bleeding used 91 percent less than before, she said.

But she added, “I don’t want to go on the record saying this drug ‘can’ cause respiratory issues, that should be a ‘may.’ ”

Lazy Cakes appear harmless, even amusing, with swirly purple packaging; Kush Cakes have a tie-dye-printed wrapper. Of melatonin, Dr. Seres warned, “If you take it while you’re driving a car, you will find yourself in a ditch.”

Maybe. For me, it’s to get a good night’s sleep.”

Yet the products, intended for adults only, are being marketed as a novel way to relax in a stressed-out, wired world. Dr. Lewy dismissed the idea that harm might lurk in a melatonin-laced brownie. That said, he would not advise eating Lazy Cakes, partly because he was not sure that their other purportedly sleep-inducing ingredients like valerian root work and partly because food delays rather than hastens the absorption of melatonin.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story is clear that – despite the claims made by some who stand to profit – there is no quantifiable information about benefits documented about these products.  And there’s this closing skepticism from Dr. Lewy: “he was not sure that their other purportedly sleep-inducing ingredients like valerian root work and partly because food delays rather than hastens the absorption of melatonin.”

The study is a step forward in a field in which a lot of approaches have been tried in animals and preliminary human trials, but none has been approved for widespread clinical use for heart patients. The research, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, were part of a phase I study that set out to show safety. The phase I results from 53 patients are not definitive proof that the treatment is effective, but do suggest so, Hare said. An area of improvement would be making the stem cell treatment more efficient, he said. This method of intravenous injection means that the procedure theoretically could be performed in a doctor's office or clinic, increasing the accesibility to patients, Karp said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Since the study is designed to prove safety, there are no credible benefits data to report. 
The report does allow sources to make general claims of benefit based on that preliminary data, but the reporter shows restraint by not plucking benefits data points from the study. 
On a close call, the story earns a satisfactory rating.

The anticipated cost of the vaccine, administered in three shots over six months, is $300 to $500, a possible impediment to widespread vaccination campaigns. It affects more than 50 percent of sexually active adults. "This is certainly a wonderful, good step in addition to our screening processes" in helping eradicate cervical cancer, said Dr. Monica Farley, who heads the advisory panel. Merck said the drug is not intended to do that. Also, the drug does not protect against infection from the many other virus strains not included in the vaccine.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story does explain that the vaccine is effective against 70% of HPV infections, potentially saving 3,500 deaths from cervical cancer per year. The story should have provided more context. In order to realize the purported benefits, every eligibile individual would need to be vaccinated and the vaccine would have to be 100% effective. These are both unrealistic because women in lower socioeconomic groups have a higher incidence of HPV and lack access to healthcare.

Patients can do it at home. It’ll cost $37,000 a year but the drug’s makers, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi, have stressed that’s the wholesale price and make a point of saying there will be programs to help people pay for it. “Scratching leads to swelling, cracking, weeping clear fluid, and finally, coarsening and thickening of the skin.”

There are many treatments out there now, from simple skin lotions to steroid creams and immune suppressant drugs like tacrolimus. Dupixent is for the hard-core cases that aren’t helped by anything else. “The Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC) of Dupixent in the United States is $37,000 annually.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story states that studies in about 2,000 people showed injections “resulted in clear skin or nearly clear skin for about two-thirds of those who tried it, and it reduced itching sharply in 40 percent.”
This is enough for a satisfactory rating, but the story should have mentioned that close to 10 percent of patients on a placebo saw the same improvement in their rash. It also would have been stronger if it had explained how the benefits were measured (how is a “sharp” reduction in itching measured?), how much time it took to achieve the results, and if the results were sustained.

Both drugs are "immunotherapies," which work by boosting the immune system's ability to spot and destroy tumor cells. One cancer surgeon who reviewed the findings was impressed. "Based on this study, it appears that patients with advanced melanoma who have their disease completely removed by surgery should go on to receive additional therapy with Opdivo," said Dr. Gary Deutsch. The study is scheduled for presentation Monday in Madrid, Spain, at the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology. She said any advance in the care of aggressive melanomas is welcome news for patients.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story clearly defines the benefit (survival without recurrence of the cancer) and offers clear numbers: “After a year of treatment, 71 percent of patients in the Opdivo group were alive without any recurrence of the disease, compared with 61 percent of those treated with Yervoy. And at 18 months, the rate was 66 percent for Opdivo and 53 percent for Yervoy, the findings showed.”
One detail we think would have been good to add–“recurrence-free survival” doesn’t tell you how many patients are actually living longer specifically because of the treatment. It’s just telling you how much time elapses before recurrence.

The 18-site study should settle a debate that originated when several retrospective studies seemed to indicate that children had exacerbations of their asthma when receiving Tylenol for pain and/or fever. The study enrolled 300 children 1 to 5 years old with mild persistent asthma. (The asthma therapies were given in varying order as part of a concurrent randomized trial, making this, in effect, a "trial within a trial.") Of the original 300 children, 226 (75 percent) completed the study. While the study was modest in size, it was powered to detect any clinically significant differences, more so than past retrospective studies, Phipatanakul notes.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: One of the questions the study attempted to answer was whether ibuprofen is a safer drug than acetaminophen in children with mild persistent asthma. This release does a laudable job laying out the figures for the number of asthma exacerbations for each group. It also includes quantitative data for the percentage of days with full asthma control, use of “rescue medication” and unscheduled healthcare visits. It also used the term “significant” correctly, stating that there “were no statistically significant differences between groups” (a common mistake we’ve seen in other releases).
Due to all these factors, we give the news release a Satisfactory rating here.

The study was published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Lead author Dr. David Jenkins, Canada research chair in nutrition and metabolism at the University of Toronto and St. Michael's Hospital, had previously shown the effectiveness of a cholesterol-lowering diet when all the meals were provided to participants. To put the diet to the real-world test, participants received a one-hour counseling session with a dietitian and an illustrated study booklet at the outset and, later, received a 30-40 minute follow up session. In addition to the soy protein, nuts and whole grains, participants in the diet were encouraged to eat peas, beans and lentils. Both groups lost about four pounds over the six months.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story tells us how much the diet reduced cholesterol, providing the actual values from the lab report. It could have also estimated the expected reduction in 10-year cardiovascular risk that this would correspond to.

A study of a cross-section of adults enrolled with a health-management organization in southern California shows that the vaccine provides protection for many older adults without many side effects. "It does bolster our confidence that it's effective in the real world," said Dr. Bruce Hirsch, an attending physician in infectious diseases at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., who was not involved with the study. But the vaccine can cost a couple of hundred dollars, he said, perhaps making it out of reach for those with limited resources. "This study helps me in terms of advising patients and prioritizing," Hirsch added. The CDC has more on the shingles vaccine.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: 



Interestingly, while other stories about this study touted the finding that vaccination cut the risk of shingles by more than half, this story points out that compared to many other vaccines, a 55 percent reduction in relatively risk is a weak performance. The comment from one individual that the vaccine is “better than nothing” also helps readers put the benefits into perspective. The story does include endorsement of vaccination and descriptions of the terrible pain shingles attacks can inflict. It also points out that this study provides information about a reduction in the risk of serious eye problems caused by shingles that was collected by the clinical trial that led to the vaccine’s approval.
The story reports the absolute annual shingles attack risk figures of 6.4 per 1,000 among the vaccinated participants versus 13 per 1,000 among those not vaccinated. We would have like to also see the story mention that the results indicate that about 71 people need to be vaccinated to prevent one from suffering a shingles attack. And since the story reported relative risk reduction statistics for ophthalmic herpes zoster cases, it should have also told readers the absolute numbers.
The story should have pointed out that the study looked at a limited time span and that the researchers can’t say whether the effects of the vaccine persist through later years. That’s an important caveat, since a 60-year-old who had chicken pox as a child is at risk for a shingles attack for the remaining decades of life. If the vaccine cuts the risk of attacks in half, but only for the first few years after vaccination, then the lifetime reduction in risk would be much smaller.

Also, the final quote from an expert saying “the benefit, I think, is overwhelming” may overpower all the statistics, leaving readers with an unbalanced summary of the benefits of this vaccine.
So, while overall the story had a mixed performance on this criterion, we’ll give it a satisfactory score.

Anderson's department of health disparities and the study's principal investigator here. The findings, published in today's Journal of the American Medical Association, are a setback to the hope that better diets can prevent breast cancer recurrence. The study focused on more than 3,000 women — average age 53 — who had been treated successfully for early-stage breast cancer. Previous research into diet and breast cancer has shown mixed results, but the authors of this study said the earlier ones were not rigorous. But he also acknowledged the results so far were a surprise.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story not only provided the information that the two groups did not differ in terms of rates for breast cancer recurrence or death, but included the estimates of this from the study summary.

The researchers found that the two advanced minimally invasive techniques led to similar results, and both appeared to be generally superior to the traditional open procedure. However, this minimally invasive approach also calls for significant training on the part of the surgeon to overcome challenges such as the counterintuitive movements involved in working from images on a TV monitor. The robotic equipment provides better three-dimensional vision, increased range of motion and intuitive, downscaled movements, while adding a few thousand more dollars to the procedure’s price tag, the authors note. “However, if the surgeon is skilled enough to do the hysterectomy without the robot by laparoscopy then the outcomes will be similar.”

Nezhat further noted that while robotic assistance can be a good “enabler” for a minimally invasive approach, surgeons should have at least the basic knowledge of regular laparoscopy too, as there may be times when the robotic equipment doesn’t work. More research is needed to be able to compare long-term outcomes, wrote the researchers.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story summarized the findings succinctly: the robotic and laparascopic surgeries: “took around the same time and resulted in similarly long stays in the hospital. However, about half as much blood was lost when robots were enlisted than with standard laparoscopy. Both minimally invasive techniques resulted in longer-duration operations than open surgery. But both also led to shorter hospital stays and, in the case of robotic surgery, less blood-loss. Further, the average number of lymph nodes removed was about the same in the robotic and open procedures, suggesting that both approaches result in about equal surgeon accuracy in staging endometrial cancer.”
However, we would have liked to have seen a bit more discussion on the issue of blood loss. Although the amount of blood loss seen in the patients who underwent a robot-assisted procedure was statistically lower, there was no difference in the patients’ need for a transfusion. The 8 studies also had dramatically different blood loss in all three groups. The range of blood loss in patients undergoing a robot-assisted procedure was almost 3 fold (66.6ml in the Veljovich study as compared to 166 in the Bell study).

The study included 508 women who were given eribulin and 254 women who received treatment of the physician's choice, which was defined as: any single-agent chemotherapy, hormonal or biological treatment approved for cancer treatment; radiotherapy; or symptomatic treatment alone. The study, known as the EMBRACE trial, was funded by Eisai Inc., which markets eribulin. Dr. Javier Cortes, of the Vall d'Hebron University Hospital and Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology in Barcelona, Spain, and colleagues published the findings in the March 3 online edition of The Lancet. "This global phase 3 study establishes a potential new standard treatment for women with heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer, for whom there was previously no chemotherapy treatment with proven survival benefit," the authors wrote. "It would be interesting to see if the drug offers the same benefit in women that have not been treated with multiple drugs before exposure to eribulin," she added.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The benefit of eribulin over various treatments chosen by the physicians was clearly stated in the article.  “The researchers found that among patients whose cancer had spread, those who took the drug (eribulin) lived a median of 2.5 months longer than those who received a physician-chosen treatment — 13.1 months versus 10.6 months.”

Prior research on antidepressants and weight change was limited to one year or shorter. "So it makes sense for doctors and patients to choose antidepressants on the basis of their side effects, costs, and patients' preferences--and, now, on whether patients are overweight or obese." Bupropion should be considered the first-line drug of choice for people who are overweight or obese, Dr. Simon said. But patients should consult their doctor about which medication is right for them, before making any changes, including starting, switching, or stopping medication. Grant R01 MH083671 from the National Institute of Mental Health funded this research.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release states that “After two years, nonsmokers lost an average of 2.4 pounds on bupropion–compared with gaining an average of 4.6 pounds on fluoxetine (Prozac). So those who took bupropion ended up weighing 7 pounds less than did those on fluoxetine.”

"This might discourage people, and legitimately so, from using this drug for prevention because of the weight gain, but hopefully it won't discourage study" of other drugs. The new study was intended in part to clarify the trade-off between the risks and the potential benefits of preemptive treatment. The scale rates severity of more than a dozen symptoms, including suspiciousness, grandiosity and bizarre thoughts. From 20 to 45 percent of people who score high on the scale go on to develop full-blown psychosis, in which these symptoms become extreme, researchers have found. But by then, more than two-thirds of the young people in both groups had dropped out, making it difficult to interpret differences between them.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Provides some quantification of the benefit of taking Zyprexa to delay psychosis after one year of treatment, but this difference was marginally statistically significant, which is also mentioned. What the story does not report: After the medication was stopped, these patients showed more severe psychotic symptoms than when they were first recruited for the study, suggesting that while symptoms were blunted, the disorder progressed despite the use of anti-psychotic medication.

These findings appear online in the Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology and Therapeutics. In addition, T is essential for overall health and well-being and for the prevention of osteoporosis. In the non-treated control group, there were 21 deaths, 19 of which were related to CV events. According to the researchers, long-term TTh in men with hypogonadism appears to be an effective approach to achieve sustained improvements in cardiometabolic function and reduces the risk of CV events. "The low CV events observed in the T-group compared to the untreated (control) group strongly suggest that TTh is protective.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The text does a good job of describing the differences in cardiovascular outcomes between men receiving testosterone treatment and those who chose not to. But the release never tells us how many people were in each group or what the event rate was, which makes it difficult to make a comparison. And, as the release alludes, the observational design of the study means the cardiovascular outcomes are not conclusive.

Although the scans looked promising, the companies needed to show that what they revealed was the same as what a pathologist would see on autopsy. That was what Avid demonstrated with its study, presented Sunday by its medical director, Dr. Christopher M. Clark. Pathologists in Montreal analyzed the brain slices with a computer that counted plaques. Neither the radiologists nor the pathologists knew whether the patients had dementia. And the data showed that the scans were completely accurate in ruling out Alzheimer’s pathology: unlike doctors, they never said people had Alzheimer’s pathology when they did not.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION:  The story reported that the study found the test was able to correctly assign people into categories of having or not having Alzheimer’s disease in 34 out of 35 cases.  It was much less clear about how accurate diagnosis in terminally ill patients (as defined as being in hospice) translates into benefit for these patients.  The tests of young people without disease was still not compelling that this test will be able to parse out less severe cases correctly.
The story did mention that it was not yet known if the test could be used to identify cases earlier in the course of the disease.

The reason was that the results were overwhelmingly compelling — men taking the drug were not getting prostate cancer. But, as Dr. Scardino pointed out in an editorial five years ago in The New England Journal of Medicine that accompanied the study, it appeared that 6.4 percent of the men who took the drug got fast growing, ominous-looking tumors. The concern was that the drug might be preventing cancers that never spread. Maybe, they thought, by shrinking the prostate, the drug was just making it easier to find aggressive tumors. Now, though, prostate cancer specialists have a new problem: How can they change the drug’s image?
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Mixed grade on this criterion.  The story provided both relative and absolute risk reduction figures – although it gave more space and prime real estate (the beginning and end of the story) to the more impressive-sounding relative risk figures. But, with some hesitation, we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt.

“I think this study shows that yes, (marijuana) may help with spasticity, but at a cost,” said Corey-Bloom, of the University of California, San Diego. “Spasticity is a big problem for many people with MS, and the current medications don’t necessarily work for everyone,” said LaRocca, who was not involved in the new study. People with MS are already at some risk of “cognitive changes,” LaRocca pointed out, so the potential for lasting effects from long-term marijuana smoking is a concern. Both LaRocca and Corey-Bloom said there were limitations to the current study. But another limitation, she pointed out, is that the study looked at the effects, and side effects, of marijuana over only a few days.

Researchers measured four different types of ceramides in the blood at baseline and combined the values into a 12-point scale. Patients were grouped into four risk categories according to their ceramide levels: low (0–2), intermediate (3–6), moderate (7–9) and high (10–12). Overall, 5.1 percent of patients had a major cardiovascular event each year. Mayo Medical Laboratories collaborated with some of the original researchers who established the role of ceramides in cardiovascular disease and Zora Biosciences Oy, a diagnostics discovery company based in Finland, to develop and refine the test. The present study is also the first to test its clinical utility in a U.S. population.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The primary benefit of the test is that it might enable doctors to identify people who are at higher-than-normal risk for heart attacks and strokes even though they have normal levels of cholesterol and show no evidence of heart blockages. The news release does a good job of explaining the likelihood of having a cardiac event for those with low versus high levels of blood ceramides. In particular, it reports both absolute and relative risk, noting that, among individuals with low LDL (bad cholesterol) levels, cardiovascular disease occurred in 3.7% of those with low ceramide levels but in 16.4% of those with high ceramide levels.

In the intent-to-treat population, Grade 3 or higher, non-hematologic adverse events were similar across all organ systems, including cardiac, gastrointestinal, general systems, metabolic disorders, musculoskeletal, nervous system, respiratory, skin and renal. Based on these results the company expects to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) for VYXEOS with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) later this year and submit a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the first quarter of 2017. "The successful outcome of this Phase 3 trial represents an important advance for AML patients, their families and clinicians," said Scott Jackson, Chief Executive Officer of Celator Pharmaceuticals. VYXEOS was also granted Fast Track designation for the treatment of elderly patients with secondary AML. Furthermore, approximately half of those patients are considered suitable for intensive treatment.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release gave extensive data on median overall survival (9.56 months compared to 5.95 months for patients receiving 7+3, the standard treatment) and the “percentage of patients alive 24 months after randomization” (31.1% in the treatment arm compared to 12.3% on the 7+3 arm).
It also, helpfully, added the “sixty-day all-cause mortality” as 13.7% versus 21.2%, in favor of patients treated with the intervention drug. The release notes that the treatment gives a Number Needed to Treat (NNT) of about 7, which is very good. (NNT is a measurement of the impact of a therapy by estimating the number of patients that need to be treated in order to have an impact on one person.) The median survival doesn’t look as good. In about half of the patients, there is a four month or less increased survival. This implies that there is a group that has much longer survival. To see that there is a clinically important survival benefit (14% absolute increase) does make a difference.

"In order for it to be valued by clinicians we would need to get to 90% accuracy in detection," she said. Patients who returned a positive result would still need a biopsy to confirm the blood test and determine how far the cancer had developed, Ziman said. The Australian team believe theirs would be the first to detect melanoma. For potential sufferers in remote areas, away from skin specialists, diagnosis can be especially tricky, he said, making a simple blood test an easy alternative to identify those at risk. Over three years, the research team identified a combination of 10 types of antibodies that best signal the presence of a melanoma.

Of course, there is an assumption that the test–if proven to be validated–would reduce deaths from melanoma due to early detection. That will take a lot more research to determine. “Early detection saves lives” is not always true.

You should consume modest amounts in your diet, if possible (and for most people that is quite possible), or in the form of supplements if you can't get enough via food and drink. But somehow we've arrived at a point when some physicians are prescribing large doses of Vitamin D supplements for their patients in the hope of preventing cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, autoimmune disorders and other maladies, despite a lack of evidence that this works, according to a new commentary in the Journal of the American Medical Association. This practice isn't totally harmless. So how did we get here? I think there's a general perception that if some is good, more is better.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story talks about vitamin D-rich foods and supplements (including high-dose supplements). Are there benefits? Yes, and the story addresses (some of) them. The story makes clear that vitamin D is an essential nutrient for bone health, and that if you cannot get enough vitamin D from your diet (or from exposure to sunlight), then supplements can help you reach your target vitamin D consumption goal — which is 600 international units (IUs) per day for men and women between the ages of 1 and 70. The story could also have mentioned that vitamin D is involved in a variety of other health functions, including “modulation of cell growth, neuromuscular and immune function, and reduction of inflammation,” according to the CDC.
Another strong point of the story is explaining that many of the purported health benefits of high-dose vitamin D supplementation — for example, prevention of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer — have not been based on strong scientific evidence.

Newswise — COLORADO SPRINGS, CO – Shoulder instability is most common in the young, athletic population, bringing a focus to how these injuries are best treated. The study examined 121 patients at an average of 51 months post-surgery. “However, this study shows a substantial benefit for athletes undergoing surgery to prevent recurrent instability down the road.”

The research data was collected between 2003 and 2013 from eight fellowship trained surgical practices, with patient ages ranging from 16 to 30 years old. Surveys given to patients during follow-ups asked for information such as test for shoulder functionality, whether patients returned to sport, postoperative instability events, and if further surgery was required on the shoulder. “While young athletes and parents may be wary of surgery, our study shows the advantages of this treatment approach,” commented Marshall.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release encapsulates the differences observed: “The study examined 121 patients at an average of 51 months post-surgery,” it says. “Of this group, 68 patients had experienced their first dislocation, while 53 had recurrent dislocations after being initially treated non-operatively. After treatment with an arthroscopic bankart repair, the postoperative dislocation rate in the first-time injury group was 29%, compared to 62% in those who did not have surgery after their initial injury.”
And 7% of those with surgery after the initial dislocation vs 32% after a recurrent dislocation had to have another surgery, according to the release.

“The idea that unless you’re very, very ill, you’re not going to benefit from treatment does not appear to stand up” when looking closely, said the study’s lead author, Robert Gibbons, from the University of Chicago. Still, not everyone in the studies improved — on average, about five people had to be treated with one of the drugs for one person to feel better, and the benefits seemed to be diminished among some of the oldest patients. The benefits were seen regardless of how severe patients’ symptoms were before starting treatment. If five or more patients need to be treated with an antidepressant for one to substantially improve, most don’t get much out of it, he pointed out. Still, Gibbons said that the improvement in symptoms for the average patient wasn’t insignificant.

Those with the disease make barely any dystrophin, a protein necessary for muscles to function. Eteplirsen, which Sarepta says has shown no side effects so far, is vying with a similar drug being developed by GlaxoSmithKline to become the first medicine that works by directly countering the cause of the disease. Eteplirsen could also be the first drug to reach the market for Sarepta since it was founded 32 years ago. While the company excluded those boys from its analysis as outliers, the Food and Drug Administration might not do so. That could make it harder for the Sarepta to win approval for the drug based only on this small trial, something the company hopes to do.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story provided just enough caveats to the positive aspect of the study results.  “The study measured how far the boys could walk in six minutes. Those who received the higher dose walked an average of 21 meters farther after 48 weeks of treatment than at the beginning of the trial, a gain of about 5 percent. The boys in the placebo group walked 68 fewer meters at the end than at the beginning, a decline of about 17 percent.  One possible reason for skepticism is that two of the boys on a lower dose of the drug rapidly lost the ability to walk, even though the level of dystrophin in their muscles increased substantially.”
The story added a key piece of information at the end, “Eteplirsen actually turns off just one part of the dystrophin gene, known as exon 51, which contains a mutation that in some patients stops production of dystrophin. By skipping over this exon, muscle cells can produce an imperfect form of dystrophin that nonetheless is at least partly functional.

For the first time, scientists have precisely identified and targeted an area of the brain which is involved in "hearing voices", experienced by many patients with schizophrenia. They have been able to show in a controlled trial that targeting this area with magnetic pulses can improve the condition in some patients. TMS uses magnetic pulses to the brain, and has been shown to be effective in several psychiatric conditions. This is the first controlled trial to show an improvement in these patients by targeting a specific area of the brain and using high frequency TMS. To move this into treatment, controlled trial such as the one by Dollfus and coworkers are important.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release states that “researchers found that 34.6% of the patients being treated by TMS showed a significant response, whereas only 9.1% of patients in the sham group responded.” Of equal importance, the release clearly defined what “significant response” meant: “a more than 30% decrease in the Total Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale score.” In addition, the release quotes one study author’s qualification of the finding: “treatment with high frequency TMS makes a difference to at least some sufferers, although there is a long way to go before we will know if TMS is the best route to treat these patients in the long-term.” That’s good context.

Now, using data on more than 113,000 individuals, researchers have been trying to sort out the relationship between aspirin and NSAIDs, duration of treatment, and colorectal cancer rates. On the other hand, merely having taken aspirin did not alter the colorectal cancer risk, they reported in Annals of Internal Medicine. Nonaspirin NSAIDs were also protective against colorectal cancer with consistent long-term use, “and there was some indication that even non-continuous use of these agents may be (marginally) effective for the prevention of colorectal cancer,” Dr. Friis said. They didn’t include patients who made over-the-counter purchases of the medicines. Dr. Friis emphasized that people should not start taking aspirin or NSAIDs on the basis of the new findings.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story cites a 27 percent decrease among low-dose aspirin users who had taken the drug for five years or more. It also notes the incidence of the disease among different populations, and even gives readers a link to a risk calculator to determine their individual risk.
Of course, we almost always prefer stories to use absolute risk reductions over the relative risk reduction reported here (technically an odds ratio — not a “risk” reduction per se). But in a case-control study such as this one, the issue can be complicated. We’ll give the benefit of the doubt.

Sage’s drug is designed to change the traffic patterns in the brain. The drug has a “very, very short half-life” in the body, Jonas said, meaning that it can be metabolized quickly. One of the drug’s most promising features: It appears to work quickly — some women in the study started experiencing relief after 24 hours. The only other treatment for postpartum depression is talk therapy. SAGE-547’s apparent speed is what’s getting the most attention in the psychiatric community, Baker said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: We will give the story a satisfactory rating because it specifies that 7 of 10 patients given SAGE-547 reported significant improvement in their depression within 60 hours, which persisted for up to 30 days.
However, the story did not tell readers that the depression questionnaire used in this study, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), has been criticized as placing greater emphasis on sleep than on suicidal thoughts, so that the scores of some patients may improve even if their thoughts of suicide increase.
Readers should have been told that the form of the drug used in this trial is given as an IV solution and that it will not be known if a pill can produce similar results until separate trials are completed.

Clearly, these considerations matter when trying to determine the optimal speed. Even if we dismiss the possibility that running harder is worse, it is probably useful to note that running harder or farther doesn’t seem to be better. However, I’d argue that the comparisons the studies make among runners are still valid. We may tend to attribute the health of this group to their running habits. Nothing in the data suggests that running more — farther, or faster — will do more to lower your risk of death.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The sole benefit discussed in the story is percent reduction in risk of death in a given year. The story explains this clearly, so it gets a satisfactory. It would have been more interesting — but significantly more complicated — if it had discussed the ways in which cardiovascular exercise reduces the risk of death. Which health risks are addressed here? Heart disease? Hypertension? Also, the story doesn’t look at some of the other benefits of running or jogging, such as possible quality of life benefits. Most runners, for example, actually enjoy running. Still, that wasn’t the focal point of the story.

Novartis is considering trying so-called risk-sharing with some health plans, meaning it might charge more if the drug really does keep people out of the hospital and less if it doesn’t. Patients in both groups of the study could also take other drugs, such as beta blockers, as their doctors saw fit. Novartis said that about 2.2 million Americans would be eligible for the drug, which was approved for patients with so-called Class II to Class IV chronic heart failure with so-called reduced ejection fraction. Novartis is sponsoring another study to see if the drug is effective for those with preserved ejection fraction, which accounts for half of heart failure cases. Blacks and those with a previous history of the condition were at increased risk, it said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story gets a hesitant satisfactory score here. Now, we know that reporters rarely, if ever, write the headlines. But somebody at the Times must take responsibility for the confusion caused by this headline, which states that the drug is “Said to Cut Death Risk by 20%.” This starts the story off on an uncertain note, since it’s not clear who said this or where this information is coming from. In the second paragraph, the story cites results from a clinical trial showing “a 20 percent reduction in the risk of death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for worsening heart failure.” So, it seems that the drug is not cutting the risk of death by 20 percent, but the risk of death or hospitalization for worsening heart failure. Then again, if you go to the study itself, you learn that there was indeed a 20% reduction in the outcome of “death from cardiovascular causes,” although this doesn’t seem to be the figure that the headline is referring to, since it’s not mentioned in the text. In terms of overall death from any cause — the outcome that most closely resembles the “death risk” mentioned in the headline — the study shows that there was a 16% reduction.
But that’s not the whole story. Much lower down in the article, we learn that this was actually a relative risk reduction — patients in the clinical trial who took Entresto were 20 percent less likely to die or be hospitalized than patients who took a competing drug called enalapril. This sort of risk reduction is not the same as absolute risk reduction, which provides a more meaningful view of the benefit. The story does get credit for eventually providing the absolute risk of hospitalization/mortality in both groups (21.8 percent of those taking Entresto vs. 26.5 percent for those taking enalapril, or  a 4.7% difference), but putting this information far down in the story, after a confusing headline, is less than ideal.

Though too early to call it a cure, the procedure has enabled the young people, who have Type I diabetes, to live insulin-free so far, some for as long as three years. For now, the new treatment does not apply to the nearly 20 million Americans with Type 2 diabetes, reports CBS News medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook. In addition, Ross said that the study should have had a comparison group to make sure the treatment was indeed better than standard diabetes care. Burt, who wrote the study protocol, said the research was done in Brazil because U.S. doctors were not interested in the approach. Burt and other diabetes experts called the results an important step forward.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story does quantify benefits, e.g. 13 out of 15 patients were able to stop taking insulin.  And even though these results look promising at first glance, the story provides cautionary statements that these are just preliminary results.

The results of the phase III randomized, controlled trial will be presented Saturday at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting in Chicago. The study was selected for the society's "Best of ASCO," an effort to condense the research "most relevant and significant to oncology" into a two-day program to increase global access to cutting-edge science. "Our findings will change the standard of care for women newly diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer," said principal investigator Atilla Soran, M.D., M.P.H., clinical professor of surgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, and breast surgical oncologist with UPMC CancerCenter. Dr. Soran began the trial in 2007, ultimately recruiting a total of 274 women newly diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer from 25 institutions. The study received scientific advisement from UPMC and assistance with statistical analysis from epidemiologists at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release does quantify the benefits, but we have concerns with how the release states: “At about 40 months after diagnosis, the women who received the surgery plus standard therapy lived an average of nine months longer than their counterparts…” This is a difficult sentence to follow since 40 months was the median survival (with a range of 20-51 months). The sentence might be interpreted by some readers that most women lived to at least 40 months, which was not the case.

While the number of sessions can be streamlined by increasing the dose given in each session, data on the safety and tolerability of highly escalated brachytherapy doses are still relatively new and therefore limited. All patients received a single, 19 Gy fraction of HDR brachytherapy. At an average of nearly three years following treatment, cancer control rates were favorable and the toxicity profile was highly favorable. Three patients experienced recurrence or progression, yielding an estimated three-year cumulative biochemical control rate of 93 percent. “This study illustrates that a potentially curative dose of radiation may be delivered safely to the prostate entirely in a single administration,” said Dr. Krauss.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The main benefit focused on a vaguely described “biochemical progression,” which means that there was some evidence that prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels increased.  PSA is a protein produced by both cancerous and noncancerous tissue in the prostate. Determining PSA progression is more complicated following radiation because it takes time for the PSA level to stabilize (unlike following surgery to remove the prostate) before you can determine whether the PSA is rising.  Biochemical progression is also a surrogate measure and does not imply that the cancer is–or will–clinically progress.
The researchers did acknowledge that the actual benefits are unknown, saying that “as the follow-up interval lengthens, 19 Gy dosing in a single fraction may or may not be sufficient to result in cure rates comparable to historical standards.”

But these methods alone don't give reliable results. Of course, the ultimate goal of this test is to find cancer in people who haven't already been diagnosed. First, he notes, the Hopkins team will need to demonstrate that the test will be useful in patients without symptoms. Then the researchers will need to show that the rate of false alarms remains very low, otherwise people will be sent on needless and expensive medical odysseys. An effective screening test would hold lots of potential for cancer patients, Prasad says.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story makes the two key results of the test quite clear. First, that the 1,005 people tested already had been diagnosed with one of eight common cancers, and the blood test was able to detect cancer in about 70 percent of them. Second, the test was also given to 812 people without cancer and only a false reading for cancer less than 1 percent of the time.
Including the additional finding that the test was only able to detect cancer in about 40 percent of the patients with early cancer (ie. stage I) was a thoughtful way of introducing the relevant issue of falsely negative tests.

The dose is the same as dermatologists currently employ to treat actinic keratosis. Neither the veterans nor the examining dermatologists knew who received 5-FU and who received the placebo. In his clinical work, Weinstock said that for particularly high-risk patients, he has recommended 5-FU treatment. Based on the study results, it could be that patients need to renew their regimen with the cream every year. He and colleagues are planning further studies, including one to determine the cost-effectiveness of 5-FU treatment.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release clearly states:  “After the first year, 20 of the 464 veterans in the control group developed a squamous cell carcinoma that required surgery, but only five of the 468 veterans who got 5-FU did, a statistically significant 75 percent reduction in the risk, according to the study. For the subsequent three years, there was no longer a significant difference between the two groups in the number of patients who required surgical treatment for an SCC.
There were six outcomes measured and only the difference in squamous cell carcinomas at one year was statistically significant while the other five were not. This suggests that the one statistically significant difference could have been caused by chance alone or that there truly is a difference but only in this one period of time.

The prospective Phase II single arm, multi-center study tested the safety and effectiveness of injectable contraceptives in 320 healthy men ages 18 to 45. During this time, the couples were instructed to use other non-hormonal birth control methods. The contraceptive method was effective in nearly 96 percent of continuing users. "Although the injections were effective in reducing the rate of pregnancy, the combination of hormones needs to be studied more to consider a good balance between efficacy and safety." The study, "Efficacy and Safety of an Injectable Combination Hormonal Contraceptive for Men," will be published online at http://press.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release states that hormone shots were effective at reducing sperm count to less than 1 million/mil within 24 weeks in 274 participants and was effective in nearly 96 percent of continuing users, with four pregnancies occurring among the men’s partners during the efficacy phase of the study. It also stated that more than 75 percent of participants reporting being willing to use this method of contraception at the conclusion of the trial.
That’s the plus side. One omission from the release was the absence of a control group. Without a control group it’s not possible to accurately calculate the effectiveness. The study reported four pregnancies among the men taking the injection. How many pregnancies would be expected for a similar group not getting the shots? The news release doesn’t say.

HPV testing is more sensitive than the Pap test for detecting precancer. However, reports of rare HPV-negative, Pap-test-positive cancers are motivating continued use of both tests (cotesting) despite increased testing costs. The accumulated evidence supports inclusion of HPV testing in screening; thus, the main choice moving forward is between cotesting and primary HPV testing alone. Researchers were searching for realistic performance data to quantify the additional benefit of the Pap test component of cotesting, as the costs of intensive screening of all women using two screening tests are substantial. Given the rarity of cancers among screened women, the contribution of the Pap test to screening translated to earlier detection of at most five cases per million women per year.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release is comparing two different screening methods, which both have benefits, to using either one of them alone.
We were especially pleased that the release included a clear description of the benefit using absolute, rather than just a relative, risk number.
“Given the rarity of cancers among screened women, the contribution of the Pap test to screening translated to earlier detection of at most five cases per million women per year. Two-thirds (67%) of women found to have cancer up to 10 years of follow-up at Kaiser Permanente were detected by the first cotest performed.”
Besides this number, the release included specific numbers for benefits of each test.
“HPV-negative/Pap test-positive results preceded only small fractions of cases of precancer (3.6%) and cancer (5.9%); these cancers were more likely to be regional or distant stage than other cases.”

A three-year randomized controlled clinical trial has found that two topical creams are effective in most primary, low-risk superficial BCC, comparing favorably with photodynamic therapy (PDT), as reported by investigators in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology. There are over two million cases a year in the U.S. and the lifetime risk of developing a BCC before the age of 85 years is one in five people. "The main advantages of noninvasive treatments are good cosmetic outcome, preservation of surrounding tissue, and potential for home application of either creams," explained lead investigator Marieke Roozeboom of the Department of Dermatology, Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands. Consequently, there is no consensus in international BCC guidelines on the first choice of noninvasive therapy for superficial BCC. "When choosing a treatment for an individual patient with a superficial BCC, other factors like age, compliance, and patient preferences should always be taken into account.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release gives us lots of data — a total of 601 patients with a superficial BCC participated in this study: 202 patients were treated with methylaminolevulinate photodynamic therapy (MAL-PDT), 198 with imiquimod cream, and 201 with fluorouracil cream.
And then it gives us the results: “Around 80% of patients with superficial BCC were tumor free after imiquimod treatment after three years. The clearance rate was 68% for patients treated with fluorouracil and 58% for individuals receiving PDT.”

The drug, called Keytruda, takes a new approach to treating cancer by stopping tumor cells from cloaking themselves against the normal, healthy immune system response. New data about to be released to a meeting of cancer specialists shows that 40 percent of the patients who have been taking the drug are still alive three years later. That compares to about 5 percent of patients given the standard therapy, interleukin, the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) says. About 15 percent of these patients have what’s called a complete remission, meaning there is no trace of their tumors. It was bad enough for 8 percent of patients that they stopped taking it.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: We’re given the total study population of 655 people with advanced melanoma, and how the average patient lived 2 years. The story also notes a 3-year survival of 40%, which the headline teases, and notes a 15% “complete remission” result. We’re also glad the story was frank about the fact that 60% of patients didn’t live three years.
The story does a nice job putting those numbers into perspective by quoting Tim Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation, who notes people with a similar diagnosis typically only live 11 months.
Although no study can account for all variables, a doubling of lifespan with limited side effects is worth writing home about.

But doctors are free to use devices off label. ) Part of the reason the device has made inroads during these strapped times is that doctors don’t buy it outright, but pay per use. The fat enters the lymphatic system, and is eventually used as energy, Dr. Maloney said. Hourlong treatments are best spaced out by two months, said Dr. Dover, who charges $700 per spot. That said, a doctor with a Zeltiq device isn’t hard for patients to find.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story duly reports that unpublished research showed Zeltiq resulted in 22 percent body fat loss in targeted areas. It reports that published, funded research showed patients lost an average of 3.5 inches after six sessions of Zerona laser work. 
Given the thin body of research, this is adequate reporting of benefits.

On the basis of this review, clinicians from surgery, anesthesia, critical care, and palliative care were notified of the patient’s frailty and associated surgical risks; if indicated, perioperative plans were modified based on team input. The magnitude of improvement among frail patients increased at 180 and 365 days. “The ultimate cause of the survival benefit is likely multifactorial, including changes in preoperative decision making, intraoperative management, and postoperative rescue,” the authors write. “This study reveals the feasibility of facility-wide frailty screening in elective surgical populations. It also suggests the potential to improve postoperative survival among the frail through systematic administrative screening, review, and optimization of perioperative plans.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This is a very strong point for the release. It states clearly that absolute reductions were seen before and after the intervention:  i.e.:  “overall 30-day mortality decreased from 1.6 percent (84 of 5,275 patients) to 0.7 percent (26 of 3,878 patients) after FSI implementation. Improvement was greatest among frail patients (12.2 percent to 3.8 percent), although mortality rates also decreased among the robust patients (1.2 percent to 0.3 percent).”

He led the study and gave results Monday at a meeting of the American College of Cardiology. To the surprise of the researchers, both groups fared about the same: approximately 19 percent had a heart attack or died within seven years, adds LaPook. Also, the clogs treated with angioplasty are not the really dangerous kind. The new study shifts the argument from which type of stent to use to whether to do the procedure at all. Neither treatment proved better for any subgroups like smokers, diabetics, or older or sicker people.

But the MarginProbe is another tool that might help reduce the odds of needing a subsequent surgery, she said. In June, the radiation-free device won the blessing of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel. Looking at the volume of tissue excised, the researchers said not much more tissue was removed when the device was used compared to tissue removed in the initial and subsequent surgeries among the control-group patients, Boolbol said. If the results are repeated in larger studies, it could be a welcome addition to doctors' techniques, she said. The expected cost of the MarginProbe in the United States, if approved, is not yet known, said Michael Graffeo, a spokesman for its maker, Dune Medical Devices.

The women were matched on such factors as age and breast density, a risk factor for cancer, with higher density increasing risk. The interval cancer rate was 3.6 per 1,000 screenings in those with a history and 1.4 per 1,000 in those without, the investigators found. It points to the need, she said, for women to remain vigilant about screening after their breast cancer treatment -- and to report any symptoms to their doctor immediately. Dr. William Audeh, medical director of the Samuel Oschin Cancer Center and the Wasserman Breast Cancer Risk Reduction Program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, described the findings as "not at all surprising." And though mammography did not catch all cancers in the women with a breast cancer history, the study still points out the value of the test, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: By quantifying the benefits of screening mammography for women with a personal history of breast cancer in absolute numbers, the story presents this information accurately and in a useful, understandable way for women with breast cancer.

“With standard aggressive chemotherapy, we only see about 20 to 30 percent of these patients achieving remission, which is the critical first step to have a chance to cure patients with additional therapies. The current study involved 116 patients treated with decitabine at the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes-Jewish Hospital, and at the University of Chicago. This year, an estimated 20,000 people living in the U.S. will be diagnosed with AML, and at least 11,000 deaths will be attributed to the disease. “We’re now planning a larger trial to evaluate decitabine in AML patients of all ages who carry TP53 mutations,” Welch said. “It’s exciting to think we may have a therapy that has the potential to improve response rates in this group of high-risk patients.”

The research is supported by an AML-SPORE grant and the Genomics of AML Program Project grant, both from the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), grant numbers P50 CA171963 and P01 CA101937.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release describes the benefit of the preliminary trial in sufficient depth and with appropriate cautions. It relates that each of the 21 patients with TP53 mutations had a remission, compared to 46 percent of the entire trial group of 116 that achieved some remission following treatment. According to the release, standard treatment typically induces remission in about 20 to 30 percent of patients with TP53 mutations.  While the numbers look good from this trial, the researchers note that larger studies need to be done.

And putting the chemotherapy on top of tumors should be more effective than systematically delivering it through the bloodstream. One randomized trial done more than a decade ago involving 105 patients in the did show a striking benefit. But 8 percent who got the surgery and Hipec died from the treatment itself. “It’s maximally invasive,” said Dr. Sugarbaker, who often removes the “spare parts” — organs a patient can live without, like the spleen, the gall bladder, the ovaries and the uterus. One lost much of her abdominal wall to infection and just died in misery.”

Another risk is that the surgery may be done unnecessarily.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story explained:
“One randomized trial done more than a decade ago involving 105 patients in the Netherlands did show a striking benefit. The median survival of those getting surgery and Hipec, plus intravenous chemotherapy, was 22.3 months, almost double the 12.6 months for those getting only the intravenous chemotherapy”
That being said, the story also included the proviso that newer drugs are now available that have been shown to increase survival.

Two highly effective contraceptives—the intrauterine device (IUD) and the implant—actually last much longer than they are currently recommended, according to new research. Still, the failure rate was similar to the failure rate of the IUD when used during the five-year period (which is under 1%). The benefit of being able to use the implant and IUD for a longer period of time is that it could reduce costs for individuals and insurance. That doesn’t mean you should extend your own use of the contraceptives without talking to your doctor. The study is still continuing, and it could be quite a long time before any changes to clinical recommendations are considered.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The benefit of effective contraception during the study is explained. The story notes that “By the end of the trial period, none of the women using the implant were pregnant and there was one pregnancy among the women using the IUD.” The story mentions that additional benefits of using the device for a longer period include cost reduction and convenience.

It's a mind-controlled robotic arm that has pressure sensors in each fingertip that send signals directly to Copeland's brain. That makes it very challenging to perform simple tasks like grasping a foam coffee cup without crushing it, McLoughlin says. "But the brain hasn't lost its ability to feel." Of course, mind-controlled robots are still years away from consumer applications, McLoughlin says. And there's no good way to control them without implanting electrodes in the brain.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story doesn’t overstate the benefits to this one patient. It explains that the benefits seen here–the sense of “touch” provided to this paralyzed individual through a brain-computer interface–does not replicate what most of us might think of as a complete sense of touch. For example, one quote says “we’re really not at the point where we could, say, get him to feel the difference between silk and burlap.” We did feel the headline strays over the line a bit, by claiming “implant restores sense of touch.”
What is needed here is more qualification that this is just one patient, and given the variability in spinal cord injuries, it’s really unknown how this will play out for other people. We also took issue with the ending quote of the story that states we’re “on the verge of something here that’s going to transform lives.” This needs to be hedged with the reality of the slow pace of the scientific and medical research process.

The ideal study would randomly assign women to have mammograms or not. “This is the first time researchers used real populations to compare the effects of treatment and mammography in the modern era of treatment,” Dr. Kramer said. The question was, Did the program of mammograms and optimal new treatment with coordinated teams of surgeons, pathologists, oncologists, radiologists and nurses lower the breast cancer death rate? Two percent is an estimate, Dr. Welch said. When the study was planned, the scientists expected that screening would be even more effective than it was in studies from decades ago.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: 


This story uses several different statistics and expert perspectives to explain what the researchers found in their examination of the effects of mammography screening. It not only include the relative risk reduction (10 percent) and an absolute risk reduction statistic (among women in their 50s, a decade of screening would boost the likelihood of avoiding a fatal breast cancer from 995.6 out of 1,000 to 996 out of 1,000), but it also offered comments from different experts about how they would personally value effects of that size.

The international study, led in the UK by Dr Nicholas Turner, from The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, updates the results of a major phase III trial published last year. The new research, published today (Thursday) in The Lancet Oncology, shows that even women with specific genetic changes conveying resistance to hormone therapy can benefit from the new drug combination. The trial was funded by Pfizer. We hope our results lead to the adoption of this drug combination in breast cancer, where it delays the need to start chemotherapy by an average of nine months. This trial is an exciting example of one of the most promising approaches to overcoming drug resistance, by combining drugs with different mechanisms of action to block off cancer's escape routes.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release clearly lays out the advantages of the drug combination over the alternative of fulvestrant with placebo. The primary endpoint of time to progression is reported accurately. The benefits are summed up with these statements:
“Some 67 per cent of the 347 women in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group showed clinical benefit – either a reduction in tumour size or control of disease for at least six months – compared with 40 per cent of the 174 women in the placebo plus fulvestrant group.”
“Some 19 per cent in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group had a decrease in tumour size compared with 9 per cent in the placebo plus fulvestrant group.”

Results: A small improvement in breast cancer survival was associated with radiation plus lumpectomy for DCIS. The absolute risk reduction was 0.27 percent, making it necessary to treat 370 women to save one life. Related Material: The invited commentary, "Systemic Effects of Radiotherapy in Ductal Carcinoma In Situ," by Mira Goldberg, M.D., and Timothy J. Whelan, B.M., B.Ch., of McMaster University, Ontario, Canada, also is available on the For The Media website. To Learn More: The full study is available on the For The Media website. Every article is free online from the day of publication.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The summary gives an absolute risk reduction percentage of 0.27% for patients who received radiation compared to those who did not. It also includes the number needed to treat (370) to save one patient. This is good detail, but we would also have liked more context on the controversies of DCIS treatment. A HealthNewsReview.org podcast provides a deeper look here.

If there is a similarity, it may explain why H1 viruses are vulnerable to urumin's wrath. "A majority of the peptides were antibacterial and some of them kill the things that make milk go bad." "When the skin is injured or the frog is alarmed, they release large amounts of the peptides to protect the skin." "As an amphibian biologist concerned about the loss of amphibian species around the globe, it is important to note that they may hold important secrets useful for human medicine and they should be preserved," she said. Ferrets are next, then possibly humans

A challenge to possibly using frog mucus as a flu-fighting treatment in humans is figuring out how to get the urumin peptide to attach to flu virus cells in the human body, Jacob said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This was a tough call. The story reports that the peptide killed all of the H1 versions of the influenza A virus that it encountered in laboratory settings. And the text sends up a cautionary flag early in the story that the peptide has not yet been tested in human beings. In fact, the next step appears to be testing in ferrets.
But, it doesn’t really say much about the mice research. How did they determine that it worked? Did it clear infections? We were somewhat unclear on that aspect of the story.
Again, though, because the story didn’t oversell the findings, we’re leaning toward Satisfactory.

Twenty-three subjects of that group did eventually have the operation. The authors of the study are less sure. The ultimate lesson of The New England Journal study is almost certainly that more science on the subject is needed. treatments, says Dr. Duncan Meuffels, an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam and lead author of The British Journal of Sports Medicine study. But large-scale, randomized controlled studies, the gold standard of medical research, may be difficult to orchestrate, in part because people with shredded A.C.L.’s can balk at being denied surgery.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: (As noted, some of the measures in these studies can be considered either benefits or harms, depending on how you look at it.) 
This piece provides the absolute changes for each treatment group, and then tells us the key outcome: the results weren’t statistically different and demonstrated non-superiority. The piece reports the relative proportions of each group who tore their meniscuses. Qualitatively, it tells us about stability outcomes. The controversy surrounding the importance of these measurements is explored and sometimes implied; it would’ve been clearest for the author to explain (or wonder aloud) the meaning of increased mensical tears and instability in light of equivalent scores on the primary outcome. This story mentions that in the 2009 retrospective study, all subjects eventually developed similar and high levels of early-onset arthritis. 
The piece also provides some analysis of other outcomes, such as two "almost identical" results in the 2009 study. While quantified results are scant overall in this piece, that seems justified given that the comparisons between results often showed no statistical differences, which is clearly the important message. Of importance was the story’s exploration of the controversy surrounding the meaning of outcomes in stability and meniscus tears.
As mentioned in our introduction, this study raises the question of treating all ACL injuries as if patients are pro athletes. On that note, in an environment where we see pros jump at surgical therapy, one facet of the decision that would’ve been nice to raise is the recovery time. What are the outcomes, expectations, and/or trade-offs for getting back on the court sooner? The piece reports study outcomes 2 years after surgery.

Could Worms In Your Gut Cure Your Allergies? He talked to many people who were using an unlikely tool to treat their problems: parasitic worms that live in your gut — permanently. It could be that the whipworm larvae weren't prepared correctly. It may depend on a person's genes. He says the benefits of the worms definitely didn't outweigh the bad side effects.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: There don’t appear to be quantifiable benefits associated with this treatment because it hasn’t been well studied in humans, and we are told this much: “The controlled trials, thus far, in a variety of different diseases including childhood allergies and asthma have not been positive.” Also, the patient interviewed experienced a negative result. With no proof of benefit and plenty of risks to ingesting parasitic worms, we’re left to wonder why this story emerged and was run on NPR with a headline that hinted there was potential for this treatment.

“While it is still very early days, these findings represent a positive step in the search for a vaccine against this common and distressing disease that is increasingly resistant to antibiotic treatment,” said Robin Gaitens, a spokeswoman for GSK, which owns the product that contains this meningitis component. Why would a vaccine designed to protect against a strain of bacteria that causes meningitis also prevent gonorrhea infection? That may explain why the B vaccine appears to offer some protection against Neisseria gonorrhea. “A lot of these vaccines have been used widely globally,” Petousis-Harris said. But the same component is one of several in the Bexsero vaccine, which was used in Quebec when the government decided to vaccinate against meningococcal B disease in a part of the province with a high relative rate of cases a few years ago.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story just passes the bar, giving actual numbers far down in the story. It states researchers “found people who were vaccinated were 31 percent less likely to be infected with gonorrhea than those who hadn’t received the meningococcal B vaccine.”
We would have liked to see that data higher in the story. Instead, the story states in the third paragraph that the gonorrhea rate was “significantly lower” among those who were vaccinated. The story doesn’t give the overall risk of getting gonorrhea, so it’s hard to tell whether a 31 percent drop amounts to a significant benefit for individuals.
The study itself states that the findings provide preliminary evidence of “moderate” cross-protection, and we think that should have been given more discussion so people get a better sense of how little is known about the efficacy compared to other vaccines.

The study, published recently in the Journal of Pharmacology, analyzed data from an annual survey conducted by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health that measures substance abuse in relation to mental illness. Only two population studies to date, this one included, specifically address the relationship between mental illness and psychedelics. In recent years, some scientists, such as this study’s lead researcher, Peter S. Hendricks, have been pioneering innovative treatments to help decrease the suicide rate. A lack of resources and funding is a hindrance to continuing studies, however, as psychedelics are still classified as schedule 1 narcotics in the U.S. and criminal offenses accompany their possession. Additionally, the effects of psychedelics on the developing brain are still largely unknown, meaning they could pose a threat to people with a predisposition to schizophrenia.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story cites “about 27,235 people” who said they had used “classic” psychedelics, which it identifies as magic mushrooms, DMT, mescaline and LSD. And it lists the reduction in the odds that these people had exhibited psychological distress in the prior month (-19%) or suicidal thoughts (-14%) or suicidal attempts (-36%) during the prior year. But it does not give total numbers of individuals for any of those categories.
As a side note, we’d point out that the study technically reported on the “odds” and not the “probability” of exhibiting suicidal thoughts or attempts (the latter being language used in the story). A small point, to be sure, but we think these details matter.

"In almost all solid-tumor surgeries, there's a question of margins," said Dr. Boppart, who also is a medical doctor. The diagnosis is made based on subjective interpretation and often other pathologists are consulted. "For the first time, this study demonstrates the use of OCT for imaging tumor margins within the tumor cavity, in the patient, during surgery," Boppart said. The researchers will continue clinical studies with the OCT device, looking at other types of solid-state tumors. Diagnostic Photonics, a start-up company Boppart co-founded that also collaborated on the study, is commercializing the OCT probe technology for broader use.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release describes the accuracy of the device as follows:
The study found that the OCT device analysis identified the differences between normal and cancerous tissue with 92 percent sensitivity and 92 percent specificity. They also found that the way that OCT spotted cancer in the removed tissue was closely correlated with the results from the postoperative pathology reports, which often came days later.
It also quotes the study author who says:
“For the first time, this study demonstrates the use of OCT for imaging tumor margins within the tumor cavity, in the patient, during surgery,” Boppart said. “It is likely better to check to see if any residual tumor cells might be left behind, rather than checking the tissue mass that was taken out. Then, the surgeon can intervene immediately.”
We’re inclined to give the benefit of the doubt given the story’s good-faith attempt to use some numbers to describe the device’s accuracy. However, we think the study itself had many details, not communicated in the release, that would have added to the release’s credibility, understandability, and potential impact. It would have been very useful to know more about how many of the 35 women participating in the study had mastectomies, for example, how many had invasive cancers, in situ cancers, or ductal cancers; and how large a range the tumors covered.
For the sake of background, we’d add that breast cancer surgeons used to go after wider margins (i.e. more healthy tissue at the edge of the removed tumor) than they do today. There is a large body of evidence that demonstrates that wider margins do not translate to better outcomes, and the SSO-ASTRO margin guideline statement is now fairly well accepted, noting that “no ink on tumor” is sufficient in many cases of invasive cancer; of course this may not apply to all cases. As more physicians adopt the 2014 guidelines, the utility of these devices may be called into question.

The foundation for the "watchful waiting" treatment recommendation instead of taking drugs is based on this and previous studies that did not have very many children under age 2 in the clinical trials. One of the strengths of both studies, Rosenfeld said, is that the researchers took the time to make a solid diagnosis. In treatment outcomes for pain, there was no difference, he notes. Rosenfeld says it's never wrong to prescribe an antibiotic for a well-diagnosed ear infection. Rosenfeld believes these latest studies reinforce an important message: "It's an opportunity for a conversation with your pediatrician."
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Although a bit more detail would have been useful on the findings from both studies, the story does provide an account of the absolute rate of symptom relief after 7 days for antibiotic (80%) and placebo-treated (74%) patients, which is the expectation for this criterion. It also provides valuable expert commentary on how parents can put these benefits into context vs. the risk of harm and the likelihood of spontaneous recovery in children who don’t receive antibiotics.

For growing numbers of people suffering from digestive ills, the answer is "yes," at least for a while. If giving up some foods might lessen that misery, many people are game, she says. Medications, probiotics, fiber supplements and other approaches still have roles in treating IBS, and no one approach works for all patients, Chey and Lacy say. It’s not known if the diet leads to any nutritional deficiencies or keeps working in the long run — especially for patients who get little support from doctors or dietitians. “Physicians are largely administering the diet by giving patients sheets of paper with foods to exclude,” Chey says.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story looks at the big picture here, and it does do a pretty good job quantifying the benefits, when relevant. For example, one recent study in the United States gets detailed attention in the story. In it, patients on the low-FODMAP diet perceived better relief from pain and bloating than did patients on a less restrictive diet. We’re told both the percentage of subjects who reported “adequate relief,” hovered around 40-50% for both diets. The story quickly follows that by explaining there was no statistically significant difference.
The story also highlights another study in which the low-FODMAP diet fared no better than another, less restrictive diet. “The data are not overwhelming,” notes one scientist. And the story, while mentioning that the 2014 American College of Gastroenterology guidelines stated that the diet showed promise, also quotes the organization as indicating that the quality of the evidence is “very low.”

With high blood pressure the leading cause of disease burden worldwide, it's expected the findings published in JAMA will change guidelines globally. Dr Ruth Webster, of The George Institute for Global Health, said this was a major advance by showing that the Triple Pill was not only more effective than standard care, it was also safe. The Triple Pill could be a low cost way of helping countries around the world to meet this target. The George Institute is now looking at strategies to maximise uptake of the study results. This includes examining the acceptability of the Triple Pill approach to patients and their doctors, as well as cost-effectiveness which will be important for governments and other payers to consider.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The target blood pressure (BP) for this study was below 140/90 (or below 130/80 in patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease).
The news release states that: “70% (of subjects) reached blood pressure targets with the ‘Triple Pill’, compared to just over half receiving normal care.” (Normal or usual care is defined in the release as “their doctor’s choice of blood pressure lowering medication.”)
It should have been made more clear this was measured after 6 months in the study. And as a result, the effect on cardiovascular (CV) risk reduction of the combination is unknown.

The finding, reported in the journal Nature on Sunday, offers early proof that a new treatment approach called RNA interference or RNAi might work in people. But getting the treatment to the right target in the body has presented a challenge. Other teams are using fats or lipids to deliver the therapy to the treatment target. Tumor samples taken from three people with melanoma showed the nanoparticles found their way inside tumor cells. Davis could not say whether the therapy helped shrink tumors in the patients, but one patient did get a second cycle of treatment, suggesting it might be.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Three sentences from the end, the story says the lead investigator "could not say whether the therapy helped shrink tumors." For that, we’ll give the story a hesitant satisfactory grade on this criterion. 
Yet, at the top, the story said this was "early proof that a new treatment approach…might work in people."  Indeed, there isn’t much you can say at all after tests on three tumor samples.
One thing you can say is that there isn’t any evidence yet of an impact on outcomes that people really care about – impact on longevity or quality of life, for example.  For comparison, a story on The Scientist.com placed this high in the story in the third paragraph:

However, half of the 417 children in this latest study who had sleep apnea and were bedwetters stopped wetting the bed after they had their tonsils or adenoids removed. Premature birth was the greatest predictor of continued bedwetting after surgery. There are many other causes of bedwetting, Lakshmanan said. "About 5 to 7 million children are bedwetters, and the causes fall into three main groups: bladder issues, sleep-related problems and the kidneys," he explained. "The children in this study wet the bed due to sleep-related problems."
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Right in the lead, the story quantifies the benefits, saying, “Half of children with sleep apnea who also wet the bed might stop their bedwetting if their tonsils or adenoids are removed, new research suggests.” The story satisfies our criteria of absolute risk reduction. However, we would have liked to have seen more details, such as the average length of time it took for half of the 417 children to stop wetting. And, do the researchers mean COMPLETELY stopped wetting, or went from wetting most nights to wetting rarely, for example.

An emerging treatment for a common hospital-acquired infection could be (slightly) less gross in the future. Kao is one of the authors of the paper and a gastroenterologist at the University of Alberta. Other efforts to take the “poop” out of the poop pills—to just include the bacteria thought to be behind the benefits—have failed. But most importantly, the study found no difference in effectiveness between the two therapies. Though the procedures were done in a Canadian hospital, the FMTs delivered by colonoscopy cost nearly $500 USD more than the capsules, which cost about $300.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This was a close call. Early on, it says the pill was 90% effective for treating recurrent Clostridium difficile infections. Later on, the story explains that both were equally successful in treating the Clostridium difficile infections. It would take a bit of deduction to figure out that the 90% treatment rate applies to both the pills and colonoscopies. And the study puts this figure close to 96%.
But we’ll give the benefit of the doubt and rate it satisfactory.

In a systematic review published by The Cochrane Library, British scientists found that while cutting salt consumption did appear to lead to slight reductions in blood pressure, that was not translated into lower death or heart disease risk. The Cochrane review attracted sharp criticism from nutrition experts. Francesco Cappuccio, head of the World Health Organization’s collaborating center for nutrition at Warwick University, said it was “a surprisingly poor piece of work.”

“This study does not change the priorities outlined worldwide for a population reduction in salt intake to prevent heart attacks and strokes, the greatest killers in the world,” he said in an emailed comment. Simon Capewell, a professor of Clinical Epidemiology at Liverpool University, said the review was “disappointing and inconclusive” and did not change public health consensus that dietary salt raises blood pressure. While previous trials have found there is a blood pressure benefit from cutting salt, research has yet to show if that translates into better overall heart health in the wider population.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news of this piece is that, not withstanding the recommendations of many guidelines and experts,  the recently published Cochrane review failed to demonstrate that a small reduction in dietary salt intake decreased the chance of developing heart disease or dying prematurely.

"This [new] drug has a lot of advantages over warfarin." With apixaban, patients can use a standard dose that doesn't need monitoring and adjusting, Ansell said. Ansell expects drugs in this class will have a major effect on how atrial fibrillation is managed in the future. Commenting on the latest study, Dr. Gregg C.

More than 10 million American adults have osteoporosis, and 80 percent of the people being treated for the condition nationwide are women, according to the Society's Endocrine Facts and Figures Report. The women were between the ages of 50 and 70 when they were recruited for the decade-long study. After 18 months, the women who received the placebo halted the injections. More than half of the participants had fractured bones prior to the start of the study. The study, "Effect of Growth Hormone Treatment on Fractures and Quality of Life in Osteoporosis - A 10-year Follow-up," was published online at http://press.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that the rate of bone fractures among study participants declined by 50 percent over the 10-year course of the study and provides an absolute measure of that benefit: 56 percent of participants had experienced a bone fracture before the study, and 28 percent had a bone fracture over the course of the study. We’ll give credit for the quantification, however it must be noted that this before and after comparison is seriously limited in what it can tell us about the benefits of growth hormone treatment — something addressed below under the “Evidence” criterion.

This led researchers to further develop a risk prediction tool to better identify which patients undergoing a hip replacement may be at higher risk for dislocation, and then implement a treatment algorithm to help reduce that risk. Beginning in 2016, surgeons used the standardized risk prediction model and treatment algorithm developed at NYU Langone, which factored in data collected from preoperative imaging taken while the patient was sitting and standing, and other measures that might affect risk for dislocation, including presence of a previous lumbar fusion. These findings represent a six-fold decrease in the rate of dislocation in the high-risk group. All patients who undergo hip replacement at NYU Langone Orthopedic Hospital now go through the risk assessment screening and treatment algorithm prior to surgery. This exhibit in greater details demonstrates the treatment algorithm, patient cases, and the success with use of the standardized stepwise risk assessment and treatment algorithm to address dislocation risk in patients with spinal deformity.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This study was done in two parts.
Part one: a retrospective review of 1,082 conventional (not dual cup) total hip replacements (THRs), over 2 years, in which the dislocation rate was 1.8% (19 patients). We’re told about a third of the total cohort (320 of the 1,082) had “spinal disease and deformity” on imaging scans. In this group of 320, 10 patients (3.1%) had subsequent dislocations.
Part two: Beginning in 2016 researchers began employing their risk assessment tool — pre-operative sitting/standing scans of the hip, and factoring in other risk factors like previous spinal fusion — and identified 192 of 1,009 patients (19%) as ‘high risk’ for dislocation. About three-fourths of these patients received dual cup transplants with only 1 having a subsequent dislocation (0.5%).
The news release gives us the absolute rate of dislocations in both high-risk groups (3.1% vs. 0.5%), which is vital information to understand the scope of the potential benefit. And on that basis we’ll award a satisfactory grade here. However, we note limitations under the Evidence criterion below that have a bearing on these statistics.

For the study, 120 children and adolescents with Dravet Syndrome between the ages of 2 and 18 years were randomized across 23 sites in the United States and Europe to receive either CBD 20 mg/kg or placebo added to their existing treatment over a 14-week period. The new study confirms results from a December 2015 open-label expanded access program led by Dr. Devinsky that reported reductions in seizure frequency. In that program, both the researchers and patient's families knew they were receiving CBD, which may have introduced a bias into the results. This new, randomized, controlled clinical study eliminated those concerns as participants and their physicians did not know if they were on CBD or placebo, say the study authors. Judith Bluvstein, MD, and Daniel Friedman, MD, also served as co-authors at the NYU Langone site involved in the study.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release describes benefits in clear terms, and provides numbers to add context. It states:
“Specifically, seizure frequency dropped in the CBD-treated group by 39 percent from a median of nearly 12 convulsive seizures per month before the study to about six; three patients’ seizures stopped entirely. In the placebo group, there was a 13 percent reduction in seizures from about 15 monthly seizures to fourteen.”
It also notes that the difference in the degree of seizure reduction between the CBD group and the placebo group was “both statistically significant and clinically consistent.”

“Fibromyalgia is so common, and we have such a difficult time treating it effectively. “It’s hard for some patients’ families and their doctors to get their head around what it is and whether it’s real. The fibromyalgia study involved the yang style of tai chi, taught by a Boston tai chi master, Ramel Rones. Dr. Solomon and other experts cautioned that bigger studies with other masters and approaches were necessary. “The mind-body connections set it apart from other exercises,” she said, adding that doctors are seeking “anything we can offer that will make patients say ‘I can really do this.’ ”
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story presents the evidence in relative terms. It would have been nice to see the absolute numbers. Still, it’s easy to calculate roughly what one third of 33 would be and one sixth would be. Essentially about 11 people stopped taking drugs after tai chi, and 5 or 6 stopped using other therapies. That’s not a huge difference, but, because there was any improvement, the researchers and the journal were understandably curious and hoping the study might spark more research.

Dr. Avner Hershlag, chief of the Center for Human Reproduction at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., called the new research "innovative and exciting." Simultaneous advances in cancer treatment and reproductive medicine have made these scientific leaps possible, he said. The women's average age when the tissue was removed and frozen was nearly 30. For three of the mothers, more than 10 years had passed since the ovarian tissue transplantation. And no cancer developed in the transplanted tissue, Jensen said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story arguably overstates the impact of transplantation, allowing a researcher to claim that “many” women who survive cancer will be fertile because of this surgery — when the story clearly states that less than a third of the women in this tiny study had a good outcome.
But since the main thrust of this criterion is numbers, and the story does provide them, we’ll give the benefit of the doubt here. However, we wish that the story had pushed back harder against this framing — “some” or “a minority” of women would have been a better descriptor here than “many.”

Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said market expectations had been for a mid-to-high teens percent reduction in complications. There was also concern that Victoza did not appear to lower heart risks in American patients monitored in the study, despite doing so in other parts of the world and producing a solid result globally. The Victoza trial, known as Leader, had been designed to show Novo’s drug did not increase heart risk, so its superiority is welcome news for the company, especially as Sanofi’s (SASY.PA) rival Lyxumia failed to show heart benefits in an earlier test. Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, Novo’s chief science officer, said the results should encourage doctors to use Victoza earlier, since they could now see it offered “life-expanding” treatment. The Leader study was funded by Novo and the U.S. National Institutes of Health.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story’s key figure, which features in the headline, is a 13% reduction in the risk of heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular death. Unfortunately this figure only measures the relative risk reduction; i.e. the change in risk for patients who got Victoza as a percentage of the actual risk of heart attacks, strokes or cardiovascular death for patients who didn’t get Victoza.
However, the story does also give actual risk figures for the treatment and placebo group (13.0% vs. 14.9%). This allows a keen eyed reader to calculate the absolute risk reduction: a less impressive sounding 1.9%. Because of this, the story rates Satisfactory on this criterion. It’s worth nothing the news release didn’t include the placebo group reductions.

The study focused on the most common way that children become infected with hepatitis B, an incurable viral infection that causes liver disease and cancer, which is through infection during the perinatal period. “We believe that these findings will not only save many lives, but could also help to eradicate hepatitis B nationally and abroad.”

The study was conducted in five locations in China, where HBV infection is endemic. Treatment effectively reduced the viral load of the pregnant women, says Pan. “This study provides strong evidence on how best to care for women infected with hepatitis B during pregnancy and reduce the rate of disease transmission,” says Mark Pochapin, MD, the Sholtz/Leeds Professor of Gastroenterology and director of the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at NYU Langone. Moving forward, longer term, observational studies are needed to confirm the safety of fetal exposure to tenofovir treatment, says Pan.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release clearly says that 68 percent of women receiving the drug reduced their viral load while only 2 percent of the women in the control group had that success. It also says that the transmission of hepatitis B from mother to newborn dropped from 18 percent to 5 percent, an important clinical outcome.

Zeitzer's latest study, published Monday in the Journal of Clinical Investigation , could make treatment easier by providing light exposure during sleep, before the trip, without changing or interrupting your routine. The treatment "exploits biology in the eye" to speed up the brain's adjustment to time changes, he said. "The previous study was proof of principle: Can we elicit these kinds of changes and can we do it without interfering with sleep?" This time around, researchers tried to further optimize the process. There's still more testing to be done before the technique is available to the public.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Details on the benefits are minimal but we do get a sense that two different groups of volunteers were tested with different light exposures (continuous vs. intermittent flashing) and those with the intermittent flashing light had “two hours of change in circadian timing, compared with 36 minutes for those exposed to continuous light.” Changes in “circadian timing” is not explained.

That's better than the only other approved treatment for such advanced cancers. The primary mystery is how Provenge extends life, since it doesn't shrink prostate tumors, as far as anyone can tell. The theory is that the custom-made vaccine incites patients' immune cells to attack the cancer. Nobody yet knows just how to explain these results. But, after all, Provenge is just the first cancer immunotherapy on the market.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: In a broad overview comment, it’s sufficient for the story to have stated "men with prostate cancer that no longer responds to hormone therapy (basically, chemical castration) lived about four months longer if they took Provenge than if they got placebo treatment."

What's the difference between Tylenol, Advil, and aspirin? (Ibuprofen also has potential side effects; more on that below.) This is why aspirin has its place as a protective agent against strokes and heart attacks for people at a higher risk. If the research community seems to have sided with ibuprofen for pain, is acetaminophen good for anything? Fever is another area where acetaminophen can help, said Moore.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The article takes a close look at the drawbacks and benefits of each drug. For example, while the experts said acetaminophen is less effective than ibuprofen in treating pain (and carries more risks than the others), it is beneficial in treating fever, especially in children age three and up. Ibuprofen is deemed less toxic for pain relief but it carries the risk of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract and kidney damage. There’s also a reasonable amount of quantification provided by an expert source, Dr. Andrew Moore, who says: “If you’re talking about aspirin in doses of 500 to 1,000 mg or two tablets, 30 percent of people get relief from acute pain. For acetaminophen at doses of 500 to 1,000 mg, about 40 percent have a success. For ibuprofen, in its normal formulation at something around 400 mg or two tablets, about 50 percent have success.” The story would have been even stronger had it provided links or additional details regarding where this expert obtained his estimates.

The research group plans to treat four more patients with CLL before moving into a larger Phase II trial. The treatment appears safe, but researchers said more study was needed. To deliver the gene therapy, the researchers used a virus that can only infect cells once. In addition, the long-term viability of the treatment is still unknown. Further study will show whether the latest results “reflect an authentic advance toward a clinically applicable and effective therapy or yet another promising lead that runs into a barrier that cannot be easily overcome,” Urba said in an NEJM editorial.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: As in the WebMD story, this story stated that, “Two participants in the Phase I trial have been in remission for up to a year. A third had a strong anti-tumor response, and his cancer remains in check.” The WebMD story provided more details, though.

The patients underwent a minimally invasive interventional radiology procedure in which, with the help of CT imaging, a needle is guided to the location of the bulging disc and nerve root. Of the 80 patients treated, 81 percent were pain free one year after a single 10-minute treatment session. Six patients required a second pulsed radiofrequency session. Ninety percent of the patients were able to avoid surgical treatment. "Evolving technologies like this image-guided treatment may help a substantial number of patients avoid surgery."
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release addresses benefits with this statement: “Of the 80 patients treated, 81 percent were pain free one year after a single 10-minute treatment session. Six patients required a second pulsed radio-frequency session. Ninety percent of the patients were able to avoid surgical treatment.” This would imply that 65 of 80 patients had pain relief at one year.

“Statins are a vital medicine for people with — or at high risk of developing — heart disease,” he said. While statins might combat some of the toll that fatty foods take on cholesterol, there’s a lot they can’t negate: “sodium content is high, fibres are absent, and caloric load gargantuan,” Messerli said of the fast food the authors looked at. “Although no substitute for systematic lifestyle improvements, including healthy diet, regular exercise, weight loss, and smoking cessation, complimentary statin packets would add, at little cost, one positive choice to a panoply of negative ones,” the scientists write in their paper. Francis’ team — who worked independently and had no funding from the drug or food industries for their research — used data from a previous large study to quantify how a person’s heart attack risk increases with their daily intake of total fat and harmful trans fats. “It makes sense to make risk-reducing supplements available just as easily as the unhealthy condiments (such as salt or ketchup) that are provided free of charge,” Francis said in his report of the research.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION:         
A balance was struck between the claims of the study author and those of several unaffiliated experts.  While the study centered on the cholesterol lowering effects of a statin condiment, the negative effects of a high fat, high sodium, high calorie diet were highlighted providing a balance to the story.  
The story mentions that "A study in June in the Archives of Internal Medicine suggested, in fact, that statins do not save lives in patients without heart disease, although they may prevent some non-fatal heart attacks." But this wasn’t the only study to come to that conclusion, and, in fact, the drug company’s own research backs this claim up, as has been well documented in previous news stories.
We wish the story had clarified whether the research team was suggesting popping a single statin pill in response to a single cheeseburger, or whether they were suggesting a regular regimen of statin use.  This is a key point, and is relevant to any discussion about the quality (or lack) of evidence, and about potential harms and benefits.

A common blood test could help diagnose cancer earlier, according to research suggesting a high platelet count is strongly associated with the disease. But it remained unclear whether the condition could signal an increased risk of all cancers, and how it ties in with factors such as age and sex. That, say the researchers, makes testing for raised platelet count a valuable tool, and could speed up cancer diagnosis by at least three months for thousands of patients a year. “This is an excellent study that demonstrates the potential for a commonly used blood test to identify some patients with cancer earlier,” he said. “Measuring platelet count in patients who don’t otherwise warrant a blood test is not necessarily a good idea.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story’s author did a good job of describing the numbers of patients whose data were drawn from a national database, and the percentages across ages and genders who were identified with some form of cancer within a year of a high platelet count, compared to percentages of who were not diagnosed with cancer. It also noted the rate of cancer diagnosis in the general population overall as a comparative factor. There were also data given about the types of cancer most diagnosed and the potential impact for early diagnosis. The thoughtful reader will come away with the notion that even if platelet counts are utilized widely, they are not going to serve as markers for most cancers that arise in adults.
One thing the story needed on this note was better framing on how these results differed by age. Our concern is there may be unnecessary anxiety for some people to pressure their doctor into performing a platelet count beginning at a young age that may not be necessary.

That is, long-term users have a risk of about a tenth of 1 percent. "So although we believe there is an increased risk of these unusual fractures, it doesn't outweigh the benefit" of taking osteoporosis drugs. For instance, they started out with a history of more fractures, so the comparison isn't valid. Still, the accumulating evidence that there is a risk of these serious, unusual fractures associated with bisphosphonates is getting a lot of attention in the medical community. The idea is that perhaps they'd get the osteoporosis benefit without the risks of osteonecrosis and unusual fractures.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story did a good job explaining the tradeoffs of benefits and harms and quotes a doctor who worries that fear of rare events may be preventing women from taking drugs that could save them from the typical hip fractures.
If only the article took the extra step by talking about treatment benefits in absolute terms, rather than relative. The competing Reuters article tries to put the absolute benefit in perspective by noting that about half of people with osteoporosis will have a fracture in their lifetime.

The study, involving nearly 900 women who were treated at 115 sites across the country, found that those who did have their lymph nodes removed were no more likely to survive five years after the surgery than those who did not, the researchers reported in a paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Based on the findings, the researchers said, women who fit the criteria of those in the study probably do not need to undergo the additional surgery. In an accompanying editorial, Grant Walter Carlson and William Wood of Emory University in Atlanta called the study an "important contribution" that represents the latest development in breast cancer treatment, which has steadily been moving toward less-aggressive options, sparing women from unnecessary surgery and follow-up therapy. The study provides "strong evidence" that many women can safely forgo lymph node removal, they wrote. In a telephone interview, Gary Lyman of the American Society of Clinical Oncology said the findings will probably prompt the group to revise its recommendations for breast cancer patients accordingly.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The potential benefits were included in the article.  The “five-year ‘disease free’ survival rate was 83.9%…” for women who did not have the more aggressive surgery “…compared with 82.2% in those who did…”  Because full axillary lymph node dissection did not decrease mortality or decrease disease free survival, this may no longer be the standard recommendation.

The new study discrediting the test, coupled with persistent questions about how useful prostate screening is for most men anyway, add up to a whole lot of discussion points patients should take to their doctors. The test in question is called "clinical staging." Even so, Andriole says, the findings may not make too much difference in the real world. They say what's really needed is a set of tests that classify prostate tumors by what genes are turned on or off in the cells. Once this is sorted out, doctors treating prostate cancer will be less like the blind men who try to guess what kind of creature they're dealing with when they grasp the elephant's trunk or tail.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story covered a study that raised questions about clinical staging being “worthless.”  The story made clear that there were serious new questions about the absence of benefit.

An early online version of this paper detailing the findings has been published and is scheduled for publication in the July 7 issue of the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease. To bypass this issue, the UTMB team analyzed data from the medical records of 2,644 patients who received organ transplants and must take calcineurin inhibitor-based medications, such as Tacrolimus or cyclosporine, for the rest of their lives to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ. Among Americans over 85 years, 32 percent had dementia, although we did not have any patients in this age group with dementia." UTMB's Cristiana Rastellini, Professor in the departments of Surgery and Microbiology & Immunology also was an author on this paper. This research was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the Mitchell Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: We’ll reward the news release here for providing data taken from the published study that quantities the benefits. It helpfully gives the absolute rates of dementia in those taking the drugs and in the general population. That makes the numbers easy to understand and gives an accurate sense of the size of the effect. Having said that, however, the language used in the title and the comments from the senior author go beyond what the study is capable of determining. We’ll discuss that shortcoming below under the “Evidence” criterion.

Experts generally recommend that people at average risk of colon cancer start screening tests for the disease at age 50. Positive results on the screen prompt a follow-up colonoscopy to investigate the source of the blood. Immunochemical FOBT is now largely replacing the older test. But as far as cutting the risk of death from colon cancer, stool testing is similarly effective, according to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. A screening colonoscopy averages around $3,000.

The report, published in the Dec. 23-30 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, supports the findings of earlier, smaller studies. These results remained the same regardless of sex, age, race or education, the researchers noted. "Further, the subjects in the study were not monitored for certain cognitive parameters until several years after the trial began, creating difficulty in determining accurately whether they experienced a decline in cognition or not. This age group is not typical of the age of both healthy people and those with mild cognitive impairment who use ginkgo for improving mental performance." No measurable effect from ginkgo is seen on cognition, Schneider said.

More people in the bypass group had complications right after the surgery. More of those undergoing lap-banding, however, needed repeat surgeries (13 percent vs. 2 percent). There are various theories to explain why gastric bypass may be superior, including one that attributes the success to changes in hormones that control the metabolism of blood sugar. And certain procedures may still be preferable for certain patient populations, added Roslin, such as bands for patients with lower BMI who don't have so many metabolic challenges. An editorial accompanying the studies noted the results should be interpreted with caution since longer-term data is not yet available.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: A little bit better job with the numbers than the LA Times. The same weight loss data are provided in absolute terms, but this story also attaches a figure to the number of patients whose diabetes resolved after bypass compared with the band procedure. The LA Times called the results here “far better” for gastric bypass, but HealthDay notes that improvement or resolutions was seen in three-fourths of bypass patients and half of band patients — a more precise characterization.

Bottom Line: The investigational anticancer therapeutic abemaciclib, which targets CDK4 and CDK6, showed durable clinical activity when given as continuous single-agent therapy to patients with a variety of cancer types, including breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), glioblastoma, and melanoma, according to results from a phase I clinical trial. Journal in Which the Study was Published: Cancer Discovery, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research. How the Study Was Conducted and Results: Patnaik, Shapiro, and colleagues enrolled 225 patients with a variety of types of advanced cancer in the phase I clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of abemaciclib. "The results of the trial supported the FDA decision to grant breakthrough therapy designation to abemaciclib (previously known as LY2835219) for patients with refractory hormone receptor-positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer," added Patnaik. Shapiro served on an advisory board for Lilly during the conduct of the study; reports receiving personal fees from Lilly, GI Therapeutics, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, and grants from Lilly for work other than reported here; and is an investigator on several trials using other CDK4/6 inhibitors, including palbociclib and ribociclib.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release is appropriately restrained in its description of the potential benefits of a drug just starting the long process of trials in patients. It specifically reports the number of trial participants whose tumors appeared to respond or at least not advance during the test, without making premature claims of effectiveness. However, we would like to see news releases about early trials of cancer drugs go further, to state explicitly that signs of partial responses or stable disease do not imply potential cures or even extended survival. More emphatic cautionary statements seem particularly appropriate to releases like this one that point out an experimental drug has been given “breakthrough therapy designation” by the FDA, which is a technical definition that the FDA notes is frequently misinterpreted by the public and even health care professionals. Since it referenced “durable response,” it would have been nice to see the release include a definition. In brief, the term refers to the length of time that a partial or complete response is observed as a result of treatment.

The improvement at six months was still present almost a year after the study's start. But a key takeaway is that the medicine gets at a root cause of cystic fibrosis in some people rather than just relieving their symptoms. And the drug hasn't been submitted for review by the Food and Drug Administration, though Vertex expects to do that later this year. But these results, even with plenty of caveats, suggest the drug is on the right track. The effectiveness of VX-770 looks "best case," he wrote.

The test by Decode Genetics of Reykjavik, Iceland, a respected pioneer in genetic research, promises to determine a woman's risk through a simple blood sample or cheek swab. While welcomed by some patient advocates and doctors, the $1,625 test raises concerns among others. "I fear for many women the results could be quite misleading." The test comes as concern has been rising about the proliferation of genetic tests. "Without an external review, the consumer -- be it the physician or the patient directly -- is not going to know which ones have been validated."
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: It is not clear how this test improves on these current practice as there was no evidence presented about it. The story appropriately expresses caution when presenting the value of this new test to predict a woman’s lifetime risk of developing cancer.  There is a wide range of experts interviewed, all of whom express concern about the current available evidence for the predictive value of this test.  Most experts advise against women taking this test, and the American Cancer Society does not promote the test.

While there are drugs for the secondary symptoms of autism, such as irritability and aggression, doctors have nothing yet for the core symptoms in the areas of language, social interaction and intellectual deficits. "There's no doubt that oxytocin has a big effect on social interactions in anyone. There were, however, wide variations in individual responses, the team noted. "It's not clear whether this would be effective at all in children or in young adults who had intellectual problems," warned Young. Also, scientists would need to come up with a different method of delivery, Young said.

In the second double-blinded trial, researchers were primarily concerned with testing how accurate C-Tb was in HIV-positive patients and in young children--populations in which the accuracy of the TST and the IGRA is known to be compromised. Dr. Ruhwald said another advantage of C-Tb is that the measurement of infection, a 5mm or larger induration, is universal across patients with different risk factors, including HIV infection. In contacts, mirroring the findings with QFT-GIT, there was a strong trend in increasing C-Tb test positivity with M. tuberculosis exposure (figure 1). These phase III trial results demonstrate that C-Tb is safe, has comparable diagnostic performance to QFT-GIT and addresses the problem of false positive TST results in BCG vaccinated persons. The field-friendliness and high specificity offered by the C-Tb test could allow for improved targeted treatment of M. tuberculosis-infected persons in also in resource-constrained settings, where IGRAs are too complicated to implement.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release provides information that the new test — the C-Tb — is almost as effective as the IGRA, or interferon gamma release assays, which are more expensive, require blood samples and complicated lab work. It also explains that C-Tb is less prone to produce false positives than the TST in BCG-vaccinated individuals. News releases on diagnostic tests should also address the balance between sensitivity — which is how good the test is at positively identifying people who actually have the problem – and specificity – how good the test is at ruling out people who don’t have the problem. This release addresses the specificity issue, stating “The specificity of C-Tb, unlike the TST, was not impacted by the BCG vaccine, the partially effective vaccine that many residents in the developing world receive. TST specificity in this group was only 62 percent. The sensitivity of C-Tb was comparable to the IGRA in confirmed TB cases (77 percent vs. 81 percent), indicating similar abilities to detect infection.”

But diagnosing allergies can be tricky, and kids can outgrow them, too. In Jula's case, her allergists at National Jewish Health in Denver, Colo., repeated the standard allergy blood tests last summer. "If the symptoms were treated with just Benadryl or another antihistamine, they were considered mild or moderate. As we've reported, people sometimes misinterpret the symptoms of a condition such as lactose intolerance for a food allergy. It's become the gold standard test to rule out an allergy.

Two existing drugs, in combination, have shown significant promise in promoting weight loss, according to a new report. The study was funded by the pharmaceutical company Vivus, which combined the two drugs into one pill called Qnexa, and petitioned the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval in October 2010. According to the report, there were specific concerns about each drug's safety individually; specifically Topamax, which is reported to cause some psychiatric and cognitive side effects and may cause clef palate birth defects if taken while pregnant. According to the manufacturer's study, the two drugs, when taken together, and at controlled-release doses, were very safe. The drug could be a good option for some people, but it's most likely not a silver bullet, said Dr. Melina Jampolis, CNNHealth's physician nutrition expert, who is not connected with the study.

As author, Dr Antonello Bonci (Scientific Director, National Institute on Drug Abuse, and Adjunct Professor, John Hopkins University, Baltimore) said:

"Despite the fact that more than 20 million people worldwide suffer from cocaine use disorders2, there are no effective neurobiological treatments for patients with this devastating condition". We need to replicate the work in a bigger group of patients using sham-TMS as the control condition. As far as we know, this work represents the first clinical report indicating that rTMS treatment results in significant reduction in cocaine use. It is also important to emphasize that, in this study patients were seeking treatment for their cocaine addiction in a hospital setting: the group studied, albeit small, was a "real world" sample. It is important that this is taken forward to a larger trial.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release does an adequate job of pointing to improvements in both a reduction of drug cravings and an apparent reduction in cocaine use, based on regular urine tests. In addition, the release points to a greater relapse rate among those in the control group versus those who received the brain stimulation — using absolute numbers to describe the differences.
The study is promising and exciting, but the findings are only a suggestion and not a conclusion. We think the news release makes the distinction clear.

But a new study this week reflects the continued view of many physicians — that screening does help to catch tumors earlier. Now, a new study looks at government data and finds that, without PSA testing, the U.S. would have three times as many patients each year diagnosed with advanced-stage prostate cancer — and the vast majority of those cases would be fatal. The new study reflects a broader divide in the medical community, between public health experts who have largely turned away from PSA screening, and many practicing clinicians who feel the test has helped their patients immensely. It’s saying that, for most men, the (albeit small) risk of sexual dysfunction and urinary leakage from eventual treatment is not worth it, given the even smaller chance that PSA testing could save your life. And, as the debate over PSA testing shows us, early diagnosis is only useful if early treatment can help patients live longer and healthier lives, preventing progression to advanced-stage cancer down the line, but without increasing the risks of other health problems too much in the process.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story does quantify the purported benefits of PSA screening as described in this recent study. And it at least made a stab at questioning the basis of these projected benefits – and the statistical modeling study that was just published.

The practical value of the tests depends critically on details like their sensitivity, meaning the proportion of tumors that are detected, and their specificity, meaning how many of the positive results are in fact false alarms. But in the real world, the tumor DNA must be detected in stool samples, even though almost all the DNA comes from the bacteria of the gut. Although such a detection rate sounds far from perfect, it can be effective if the test is given on a regular schedule. The specificity of the Exact Sciences test is 88 percent, meaning that 12 percent of the time the patient will be given a false alarm. Proponents of each test note possible weaknesses of the other.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story did a decent job comparing data presented on two new competing tests. It does not, however, compare the benefits to existing colon cancer screening tests.  We will dock points for this in our final criterion on “comparing the new approach with existing alternatives” but will give it the benefit of the doubt on this one.

"Our study demonstrated that the four pulses emitted from this device twice daily reduce the frequency of headache days by about three days per month, and 46 percent of patients had at least 50 percent or less migraine attacks per month on the treatment protocol. This data is clinically significant. Based on the current study and prior studies in acute migraine attack treatment, sTMS not only helps to stop a migraine attack, but it also helps prevent them." "The sTMS may be a great option for these patients and allow doctors to better meet their unique needs." The U.S. Food and Drug Administration already had approved the sTMS device for the acute treatment of migraine with aura.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release states that twice daily, self-administered TMS reduced the frequency of headache days by nearly three days per month. Also, just under half the patients had at least 50% or less migraine attacks per month with treatment.
The release reports that patients had nine migraine days per month at baseline and this was reduced by 2.75 days with TMS treatment. This earns a satisfactory for describing the benefit in numerical terms. However, quantifying the improvement at followup would have been more helpful for readers wanting to assess TMS as a treatment option.
The release would have been improved had it included what the baseline severity and frequency of the 95 volunteers headaches were, and that claims of benefits were self reported. Furthermore, there was incomplete information regarding the concomitant use of pain medications during the 3-month study period.

The presence of PD-L1 on a patient's tumor has been considered a potential biomarker to guide treatment. Overall survival will be analyzed in conjunction with the Phase II portion of this clinical trial, which provides nivolumab or a combination of nivolumab plus the immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab. Ipilimumab was the first drug ever shown to extend the survival of patients with metastatic melanoma. Long-term follow up shows 22 percent of those treated with the drug survive 10 years or longer. The U.S. FDA approved atezolizumab, which blocks PD-L1, for these patients.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release does a pretty good job here, explaining that: “This Phase I/II clinical trial treated 78 patients: five (6.4 percent) had complete responses, 14 (18 percent) had partial responses, in which tumor burden shrinks by at least 30 percent, and 22 (28.2 percent) had stable disease. Thirty (38 percent) patients had disease progression.” Later, the release states that “At a median follow up of 213 days, 33.3 percent remained on treatment, and 45.6 percent of patients survived for at least one year, which [one doctor] noted ‘is better than anything we’ve seen in the past.'” The release also places analysis of survival in context by noting that “Overall survival will be analyzed in conjunction with the Phase II portion of this clinical trial, which provides nivolumab or a combination of nivolumab plus the immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab.”

The findings suggest that by narrowing the focus of prostate cancer screening to those whose genes put them at most risk, doctors would catch more cancers early as well as reducing the potential for costly and damaging overdiagnosis. “Although these are early results, it appears that (prostate cancer) screening is reasonably accurate at predicting potentially aggressive prostate cancer among men at higher risk of the disease due to a genetic predisposition,” said Ros Eeles, who led a research team from Britain’s Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and Royal Marsden hospital. The study found that the predictive value of screening these men — expressed as the number of cancers detected relative to the number of tissue samples taken — was 48 percent, far higher than the 24 percent achieved in population-wide screening. The ICR-led study is aiming to find out whether screening men who have genetic variants that increase their prostate cancer risk could lead to earlier diagnosis. But fears about overdiagnosis, which can lead to treatments such as surgery, radiation or hormone therapy that can cause serious side-effects such as impotence and incontinence, have so far dissuaded many European countries from nationwide screening.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story reports the results in a way that is typically rare in journalism – using the positive predictive value of the test. This is a much more helpful way to present the information to consumers than other measures commonly used in screening tests, such as sensitivity/specificity. At the same time, the heart of the PSA screening controversy remains. Even if one improves on the performance of the PSA test to detect more prostate cancers early, we still don’t know if the potential benefits in terms of mortality reduction outweigh the known harms of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. The ability to one day differentiate the indolent prostate cancers from the aggressive cancers will be key. This study did not do that, despite the comments from the author.

This information is essential for making rational guidelines for aspirin in primary prevention. That’s ironic because aspirin is ubiquitous and most patients perceive it to be safe and harmless. Here’s the problem: The lower an individual’s risk of a future heart attack or ischemic stroke, the less he or she will benefit from taking daily low-dose aspirin. That means for some low-risk individuals, taking daily aspirin could do more harm than good. As I showed in a commentary in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, when combined with a statin, aspirin’s net benefit in primary prevention is almost completely lost.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

A new study from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis offers strong guidance on the best way to reduce the infection risk. The researchers argue that the evidence is strong enough to change standard skin-prep practices for C-sections. The average cost of treating those cesarean-related infections in the hospital is $3,500 and may be much higher for severe infections. But according to Tuuli, the unique circumstances of a C-section — that bacteria come from both skin and vagina and that a woman’s immune system is altered during pregnancy — mean the results of these studies may not apply. Although the new study was conducted at only one hospital, the researchers said the patient population was racially diverse and that more than 60 percent received public insurance.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story quantifies the benefits well, explaining that a randomized-controlled trial showed “patients in the chlorhexidine-alcohol group developed significantly fewer infections than patients in the iodine-alcohol group. Those who received the chlorhexidine-alcohol combination had a 4 percent infection rate, which is nearly half that of the patients who received the iodine-alcohol combination — 7.3 percent.”
The news release includes both relative and absolute numbers — a big plus. The absolute numbers included the number of women who developed infections after being treated with either chlorhexidine-alcohol (23) or iodine-alcohol (42) and the size of their co-hort (572 vs. 575).

A mere sip would leave her vomiting and gasping for breath. Today, however, Reagan, 9, of Ellicott City, can drink as much milk as she wants and eat anything. No one should try the approach on his own, because the treatments themselves can trigger potentially life-threatening reactions. The strategy is being tested in a handful of small studies that are part of a surge of research in a field that for years showed little progress. It remains far from clear, however, what proportion of children will benefit, how long the benefit might last and what proportion will need to continue to consume at least some milk or peanuts every day to maintain their protection.

Italian researchers writing in the journal of the International Menopause Society, Climacteric, said they had found the first robust evidence that low doses of DHEA can help sexual function and menopausal symptoms, suggesting it may one day become an alternative to hormone replacement therapy (HRT). But they stressed that the trial was small, so far larger studies are needed to confirm the results. “We must bear in mind that this is a pilot study with a small sample,” Anna Fenton, co-editor of Climacteric, said in commentary on the work. For this trial, a team of researchers led by Andrea Genazzani of the University of Pisa followed a group of 48 post-menopausal women with troubling symptoms. Genazzani said the results showed DHEA has potential, especially for those women who may have problems in taking more conventional HRT.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story does a nice job specifically explaining the benefits or lack thereof. It says, “After 12 months, all the women on hormone replacements had improvements in menopausal symptoms, but those taking vitamin D and calcium did not show any significant improvement. At the start of the trial, all groups had similar sexual activity, but after the year, those taking calcium and vitamin D scored an average of 34.9 on the questionnaire scale, while those taking DHEA had a score of 48.6, showing that those on DHEA had more sexual interest and activity.” By presenting the actual scores, readers are able to see how close the scores were and decide for themselves whether the increased benefit was worth the risk of possible side effects.

But nearly 40% have headaches that are so frequent (at least once a week), severe or hard-to-treat that they qualify, Silberstein says. Studies find that just 3% to 13% use the treatments. Still others try the treatments and decide they don't work or have unacceptable side effects. Finding the right medication for the right patient can take a lot of trial and error and careful dosing, Silberstein says. But about 80% will get relief, he says — defined as a headache reduction of at least 50% — after trying three or four drugs, alternative remedies and lifestyle changes.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story quotes one of the guideline authors who says that “about 80% will get relief …— defined as a headache reduction of at least 50% — after trying three or four drugs, alternative remedies and lifestyle changes.”
This may well be true, but we think the 80% figure puts the benefits in the best possible light and misplaces the emphasis. If it takes 3 or 4 drugs, alternative remedies and lifestyle changes to achieve a benefit for 80% of people, clearly a much smaller number of people are likely to experience a clinically significant benefit from any individual treatment.
A close call here, but the story does mention that treatment can “take a lot of trial and error and careful dosing” — enough context to merit a satisfactory rating.

The findings from the study sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Maternal Fetal Medicine Units Network also underscore the importance of a woman seeking medical care as early into her pregnancy as possible, so that doctors can accurately gauge the gestational age with an ultrasound, Mercer said. Of those, more than 13,000 had elective C-sections. All of the women had previously had C-sections. "I think there is something inherent in labor -- probably a signal from baby to mother that the baby is ready to make the transition -- that we choose to circumvent when we schedule an elective, repeat C-section," Thorp said. "I think it points to a role for the baby in the initiation of labor and the baby's readiness to make the transition."

In fact, the physician has wagered a few good bottles of champagne that none of three large randomized trials now underway will find proof of positive effects. To Autier, a researcher at the Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences in Glasgow, Scotland, the widespread faith in vitamin D’s benefits is like a religion. The one thing the research leaders are certain of is that the public’s faith in vitamin D as a modern panacea has far outpaced what the scientific evidence proves. Unfortunately, the lessons of history have shown repeatedly that many of these supplements that appeared to be very promising did not pan out in more rigorous testing.”

Manson should know. That’s why there are no official recommendations yet from any medical organizations.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story begins from a baseline context of controversy and uncertainty, rather than one of assumed benefit — an approach that frames the issue appropriately in our view. There is detailed discussion of research showing benefits, and research NOT showing benefits. In the absence of definitive large trials, the benefits accepted by the Institute of Medicine are limited to bone health.
The story quotes the Institute of Medicine, which concludes that vitamin D and calcium are “necessary for bone health” but that as for preventing cancer, heart disease, diabetes and autoiummune disorders, the evidence was insufficient.

America's favorite dietary supplements, multivitamins, modestly lowered the risk for cancer in healthy male doctors who took them for more than a decade, the first large study to test these pills has found. The result is a surprise because many studies of individual vitamins have found they don't help prevent chronic diseases and some have even caused problems. That is less effective than a good diet, exercise and not smoking, each of which can lower cancer risk by 20% to 30%, cancer experts say. Most studies have been observational — they look at groups of people who do and do not use vitamins, a method that can't give firm conclusions. There also was a trend toward fewer cancer deaths among multivitamin users, but the difference was so small it could have occurred by chance alone.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story was very cautious in its framing of the results, quoting a researcher who called the effect “very mild” and who said he wasn’t sure it’s significant enough to recommend to anyone. The story also took the time to explain exactly what the benefit looked like in absolute terms: “After about 11 years, there were 2,669 new cancers, and some people had cancer more than once. For every 1,000 men per year in the study, there were 17 cancers among multivitamin users and more than 18 among those taking the placebo pills. That worked out to an 8% lower risk of developing cancer in the vitamin group.” The competing Reuters coverage didn’t provide these details.

In a study in the Nature Medicine journal researchers from Cyprus said a trial on 40 pregnancies using the test, which involves analyzing the woman’s blood to detect DNA differences between the mother and the fetus, showed it accurately predicted which fetuses were at risk of developing the syndrome. The risk for a 40-year-old mother is 16 times that for one who is 25. Since amniocentesis carries a small risk of spontaneous miscarriage — Patsalis put it at around one or two percent — scientists have been looking for new less invasive ways to test for Down’s and other potential genetic problems. Patsalis’ method takes advantage of differences in the DNA methylation patterns — which are important to control levels of genes — between mother and fetus. “Such a non-invasive approach will avoid the risk of miscarriages of normal pregnancies caused by current, more invasive procedures,” the scientists wrote in their paper.

The findings, which support earlier research demonstrating positive results of the assessment and treatment method in a university setting, have the potential to transform dental care for high-risk patients at a lower cost to both patients and dental clinics and practices. Those in the control group also reduced their risk to a lesser degree, simply by using over-the-counter products that also protect teeth and affect the bacteria." From this assessment, the dentist utilizes behavioral approaches and chemical treatments to optimize protective factors. The authors said now that this has been shown to be effective in a non-academic clinical setting, there also is potential for insurance companies to reimburse CAMBRA and other preventive therapies for adults, thereby lowering patient costs while increasing profits for dental practices. Proctor & Gamble, 3M Espe and Epic provided products for study participants at reduced or no cost.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release described benefits this way:
Among 242 patients (137 intervention, 105 control) initially identified as high risk for caries, only a quarter of the patients remained at high risk in the CAMBRA group at 24 months, while just over half (54 percent) of the control group did. Of the 192 low-risk participants (93 intervention, 99 control), most participants remained low risk.
As noted under Evidence criteria below, the release listed as a limitation the fact that only about one-third of the patients who started the study completed the 24 month checkup.

But researchers said it’s still unclear what types of patients might benefit from the treatment and by how much. “They’re less likely to become completely independent.”

Most of those patients can improve with therapy and exercises, she said, but the process is often slow, and keeping people in the hospital during it is costly. The researchers said that it’s not clear what the amount of improvement they observed would mean for patients in their daily lives. He said that larger studies at multiple treatment sites are needed to determine how helpful magnetic stimulation can be in stroke recovery. The ideal option might end up being a combination treatment that involves stimulation in certain patients and other therapies that address a range of skills important for regaining function, Barrett added.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This story provides a more nuanced look at potential benefits of TMS than the competing WebMD coverage. In addition to providing statistics on the amount of improvement seen in the stimulation group, the story notes that “it’s not clear what the amount of improvement they observed would mean for patients in their daily lives.”  It also explains that the benefits were more pronounced among those with more serious symptoms. This is important context for patients or caregivers who want to know how the research findings might apply to them.

“Dietary magnesium intake is inversely associated with risk of stroke, specifically ischemic stroke,” wrote lead author Susanna Larsson, a professor at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. The results suggest that people eat a healthy diet with “magnesium-rich foods such as green leafy vegetables, nuts, beans and whole grains,” she added. About 6,500 of them, or three percent, had a stroke in the time they were followed. Most of the studies allowed the researchers to rule out other factors, such as family history. More in-depth studies are needed before researchers can say that the magnesium was what actually reduced the stroke risk, she added.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story provided the absolute number of strokes observed in the analysis, and the relative risk reduction observed. With a meta-analysis it is not statistically appropriate to pool absolute risk reductions, so the way the story treated the evidence is as good as can be done (showing the relative risk reduction and an “anchor” in terms of absolute risk.)

The study is the first large, multi-institutional study of SBRT in prostate cancer with long-term follow-up. Biochemical failure was assessed using the ASTRO-consensus and the nadir+2 definitions. Fewer than two percent of all patients experienced serious side effects in the five years following SBRT. “After following patients for more than five years, we found that serious side effects from a brief course of SBRT were uncommon and that cancer control rates were very favorable compared to historical data. This news release contains updated data from the study author(s).
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release gives a lot of data. It states that 97 percent of patients were free from prostate cancer progression after five years, exceeding a historical control of 93 percent. It also says that fewer than 2 percent of patients experienced severe toxicities in their gastrointestinal, reproductive, and urinary systems, and no patients reported life-threatening or fatal toxicity. However, the news release does not attempt to say how these rates compare with other treatment options, which would help readers put the data in perspective. There are important caveats left out in the description of findings that are discussed under the evidence criterion.

An even bigger surprise: Angioplasty gave only slight and temporary relief from chest pain, the main reason it is done. He led the study and gave results Monday at a meeting of the American College of Cardiology. Also, the clogs treated with angioplasty are not the really dangerous kind. The new study shifts the argument from which type of stent to use to whether to do the procedure at all. Neither treatment proved better for any subgroups like smokers, diabetics, or older or sicker people.

The findings also underscore the importance of flu vaccination for this risk group. Past studies have suggested that flu antiviral therapy is safe and beneficial for pregnant women. The current study, based on data from a nationwide flu surveillance network including 14 states, focused on pregnant women hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed flu over four recent flu seasons, from 2010 to 2014. "All pregnant women should receive annual influenza vaccination to prevent influenza and associated complications for themselves and their infants," the study authors wrote. A related editorial commentary by Alan T. N. Tita, MD, PhD, and William W. Andrews, PhD, MD, of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, accompanies the new study in The Journal of Infectious Diseases.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release is a mixed bag here. The release adequately describes some aspects of the benefits. For example, pregnant women hospitalized with severe flu that were given oseltamivir within two days of exhibiting flu symptoms spent a median of 2.2 days in the hospital; as compared to 7.8 days for pregnant women hospitalized with severe flu that were given oseltamivir more than two days after exhibiting flu symptoms. In addition, the release addresses the benefit of vaccination by saying: “pregnant women hospitalized with severe flu illness were half as likely to have been vaccinated as women hospitalized with milder illness (14 percent vs. 26 percent).” But the release would have been stronger if it had done a couple additional things.
First, the release notes that “Pregnant women hospitalized with less severe illness who were treated early also had a shorter hospital stay than those treated later, but the difference was not as great.” If you’re going to mention this benefit at all, even using modest language, it would be better to put a number to it. (Was it a difference of a day? 0.2 days?) Also, the release specifically mentions “serious illness and complications, including death” in its opening paragraph — but never tells readers whether the study found any potential connection between early antiviral treatment and reduced risk of complications for mother or child. Even if the study didn’t find any such relationship, the release could have said that.

But that was only the case among people who stuck with the diet study over a few months. Neither the researchers nor the participants knew who was receiving the seaweed supplement. Just looking at the effect of the supplement on people who finished the treatment can bias the findings, she said. For Mette Kristensen, one of the study’s authors, the message seems clear: “If you actually comply with the treatment, you do have the improvement in weight loss.”

However, effects on blood pressure were less promising. According to the researchers, the higher sodium content of the alginate drink — a little over one gram per dose, or about half a teaspoon of salt — could have offset any potential blood-pressure reducing effect of the supplement.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

After three months, the participants switched diets. Most participants were able to stay on both diets. In an editorial accompanying the study, Cheryl A. M. Anderson, Ph.D., M.P.H., M.S., an associate professor of preventive medicine at the University of California, San Diego, in California, wrote that there were similarities between the two diets that may explain the results. This research received no specific grant from any funding agency, commercial or not-for-profit sectors. The association has strict policies to prevent these relationships from influencing the science content.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Both the lacto-ovo vegetarian diet (Vd) and the Mediterranean diet (Md) were effective in reducing body weight, body fat, and body mass index with no significant differences between them. The release presents these benefits in absolute numbers. However, the Md led to greater reductions in triglyceride levels, while the Vd led to greater reductions in low-density lipoproteins (so called “bad” cholesterol). These were well covered in the news release.
But the latter benefits are changes in surrogate markers measured over just 3 months in people at a low risk for cardiovascular disease. Whether these results translate into meaningful, sustained, and clinically relevant outcomes that actually affect people’s risk for developing heart or vascular disease can not be answered by this small randomized, controlled study.

This success in large animals holds considerable potential for a safe, effective and long-lasting new treatment in humans with the same bleeding disorder. "We developed a unique animal model of this disease after identifying dogs with naturally occurring factor VII deficiency," said Margaritis. The CHOP team collaborated with scientists at UNC who have a long-established colony of dogs for hematology research. Based on kidney function, liver function, and blood measurements in the dogs, the treatment was safe, and did not elicit unwanted immune responses. The current study sets the stage for clinical trials in humans.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release squeaks by on this. There are no numbers used to quantify, but this excerpt at least touches on the method of measurement and the three-year follow up. “The treated dogs had expressed levels of clotting factor VII that would be therapeutic in humans, with long-term stability. In one dog, the effects persisted nearly three years.”  The release could have explained what a “therapeutic” expression level of clotting factor actually means. A closer look at the paper reveals that a clinically therapeutic level is greater than or equal to 15% of normal.

Knowing the genotype helps inform treatment recommendations and the duration of treatment. The safety and efficacy of Epclusa for 12 weeks was evaluated in three Phase III clinical trials of 1,558 subjects without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis (mild cirrhosis). Results demonstrated that 95–99 percent of patients who received Epclusa had no virus detected in the blood 12 weeks after finishing treatment, suggesting the patients’ infections had been cured. The safety and efficacy of Epclusa was also evaluated in a clinical trial of 267 subjects with decompensated cirrhosis (moderate to severe cirrhosis), of whom 87 subjects received Epclusa in combination with ribavirin for 12 weeks, and 94 percent of these patients had no virus detected in the blood 12 weeks after finishing treatment. Epclusa also carries a warning not to use with certain drugs that may reduce the amount of Epclusa in the blood which could lead to reduced efficacy of Epclusa.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release includes results from Phase III clinical trials in about 1,600 patients showing a benefit.
“Results demonstrated that 95–99 percent of patients who received Epclusa had no virus detected in the blood 12 weeks after finishing treatment, suggesting the patients’ infections had been cured.”
The release also notes that after 12 weeks, 94 percent of patients with more advanced disease who received Epclusa in combination with ribavirin showed no virus in their blood.

The balloons made patients feel full, the researchers explained. "The long-term results are dependent on patients keeping their motivation to stay with their diet and exercise programs." After six months, patients with the Obalon balloons had them removed. One health and nutrition expert noted that a balloon does not equal a lifestyle change. The role for such technology-based approaches to weight control should be a small one, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story quantified benefits by stating:
Obese patients who swallowed balloon capsules that helped them eat less lost an average of 15 pounds, roughly two times more weight than patients who just dieted and exercised, researchers report.
and:
People treated with the balloons lost an average of 7 percent of their weight, compared to less than 4 percent for those who received the sham device, the researchers found. Six months after the balloons were removed, nearly 90 percent maintained the weight loss they achieved during treatment, Pryor said.
In addition to reporting the weight loss results announced by researchers and that, unlike other balloons, this device doesn’t require patients to be sedated during placement, the story adds important context by including comments from independent sources who are skeptical that many patients will maintain their lower weight long after the device is removed.

"The DTI approach is a powerful tool for breast reconstruction in elderly patients," comments ASPS Member Surgeon Andrea Moreira, MD, of the Cleveland Clinic. The authors note some important limitations of their study--particularly the fact that it was a review study of one hospital's experience with a relatively new procedure. Dr. Moreira and colleagues write, "These reported cases include our learning curve patients as we familiarized ourselves with appropriate patient selection and surgical technique." Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery® is published by Wolters Kluwer. Representing more than 7,000 physician members, the society is recognized as a leading authority and information source on cosmetic and reconstructive plastic surgery.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Multiple follow-up benefits (measured at 30 days and 1 year) are cited, with the DTI group having fewer readmissions, fewer days with a drain in place (13 vs 23), fewer days in hospital after the procedure, and fewer follow-up office visits (6.5 office visits vs 12 visits for the non-DTI group.)
The news release highlights the following benefit: “avoiding some of the inconvenience and risks of staged approaches to breast construction.” So, It would have been helpful to clarify for readers what the staged approach with tissue expanders involves; mainly inserting an inflatable expander in the space left by the removed breast, gradually filling the expander with saline over weeks or months, and eventually placing an implant once the area can safely and comfortably accommodate it.

The goal of mindfulness meditation was different, to foster an awareness of every sensation as it unfolds in the moment. “It’s a shift from having our mental health defined by the content of our thoughts,” Dr. Hayes said, “to having it defined by our relationship to that content — and changing that relationship by sitting with, noticing and becoming disentangled from our definition of ourselves.”

For all these hopeful signs, the science behind mindfulness is in its infancy. Others, like Dr. Linehan, insist that patients in severe mental distress are the best candidates for mindfulness. Since mindfulness meditation may have different effects on different mental struggles, the challenge for its proponents will be to specify where it is most effective — and soon, given how popular the practice is becoming. The question, said Linda Barnes, an associate professor of family medicine and pediatrics at the Boston University School of Medicine, is not whether mindfulness meditation will become a sophisticated therapeutic technique or lapse into self-help cliché.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story notes the evidence of potential benefit for some patients, and a lack of evidence for use  of mindfulness mediation with certain populations.  However, benefit from psychotherapy is difficult to quantify as endpoints are not always standardized.

Of the 32 patients who received the drug that way, 29 were still alive, BioCryst said in late October. He said the drug should be distributed so that hospitals could have it in stock. Anecdotes like Ms. Gurno’s aside, the efficacy of peramivir is still in question, according to the government. Dr. Lurie, the federal official, said there had been 237 requests to use the drug since the emergency use authorization was granted nearly two weeks ago. Right now, Dr. Lurie said, peramivir is the only drug that can be used intravenously so the government had to pay a high price.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: 


 
The story points out that the benefits of peramivir have yet to be proven and that it is being offered only because some patients are not helped by approved drugs or are they are so sick they need a drug that can be given intravenously. The approved antiviral drugs are currently available only in pill or inhaled form.

The study found a correlation between people’s olive oil use and their stroke risk, he told Reuters Health — but that doesn’t necessarily translate into cause-and-effect. And after they did, olive oil was still linked to a lower stroke risk. What’s needed, he said, are clinical trials where people are randomly assigned to use olive oil or not, then followed over time to see who suffers a stroke. The current study included 7,625 French adults age 65 and older who reported on their diets and other lifestyle factors. The findings, according to Scarmeas, argue for more research into olive oil’s potential benefits against not only heart disease, but stroke and other neurological diseases as well.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This story did the best job of the three stories we reviewed in quantifying the potential benefits observed in the study.
“Over the next five to six years, those intensive users suffered strokes at a rate of 0.3 percent per year. That compared with just over 0.5 percent among non-users, and 0.4 percent among moderate users.
When the researchers factored in other diet habits, exercise levels and major risk factors for stroke — like high blood pressure and diabetes — heavy olive oil use was tied to 41 percent reduction in the odds of stroke.”
There are better ways to try to communicate numbers of less than one percent.  But we applaud the detail provided.

Two years ago, she gained access to an experimental immune-enhancing treatment in clinical trials at Providence Cancer Center in Portland. After one year, the once palpable tumors were no longer detectable in diagnostic scans. The antibodies bind to a specific protein studding the surface of T cells, immune system cells that seek and destroy virus-infected and cancerous cells. Researchers linked 14 deaths to the study drugs, half caused by immune-system reactions. Still, the study stands as "a major landmark in cancer immunotherapy," says Dr. Bernard Fox, president of the International Society for Biological Therapy of Cancer.

Additionally, results showed that tree nut consumption may be particularly important for lowering the risk of heart disease in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Of 1,301 articles surveyed, 61 trials met eligibility criteria for this systematic review and meta-analysis, totaling 2,582 unique participants. Trials directly provided nuts to the intervention group rather than relying solely on dietary advice to consume nuts. Co-authors with Dr. Falk are Liana C. Del Gobbo, PhD, Robin Feldman, MBA, Kara Lewis, PhD, and Dariush Mozaffarian, MD, PhD. This study was supported in part by funds from The International Tree Nut Council Nutrition Research and Education Foundation.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: While in most cases the release carefully states that the study analysis included “tree nuts, such as walnuts” without claiming the focus of the research was walnuts alone, in one paragraph the release says that decades of research have shown that walnuts can help reduce cardiovascular disease risk by decreasing LDL (bad) cholesterol by 9 to 16% and diastolic blood pressure by 2 to 3 mmHg.
But according to the study:
“Conclusions: Tree nut intake lowers total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, ApoB, and triglycerides. The major determinant of cholesterol lowering appears to be nut dose rather than nut type. Our findings also highlight the need for investigation of possible stronger effects at high nut doses and among diabetic populations.”
The release could have done a better job giving and explaining absolute risk reduction for the cholesterol findings. From the study: Of 2,582 volunteers involved in one of 61 studies, lowered total cholesterol was −4.7 mg/dL; 95% CI: −5.3, −4.0 mg/dL.

The study, presented at The International Liver Congress™ 2017 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, also showed that the fixed-dose combination of LDV/SOF was well-tolerated, and no patients experienced a serious adverse event considered related to the study drug. "These data establish the use of the oral direct-acting antivirals as an important treatment option in HCV-infected children aged six to 11 years old." This ongoing, open-label study enrolled 90 children aged between six and 11 years with chronic HCV, mostly genotype 1 (n=86). "This study is a breakthrough for the management of children aged six to 11 years old with Hepatitis C, demonstrating that the new DAA regimen is highly efficacious and, more importantly, safe in this group of HCV-infected children", said Prof Frank Tacke, University Hospital Aachen, Germany, and EASL Governing Board Member.

QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release states that 99 percent, or 89 out of 90, children treated with the ledipasvir/sofosbuvir combination had undetectable levels of hepatitis C virus 12 weeks after treatment.
We do caution that sustained virological response (SVR) and the reduction in viral load, which is what this study measured, may or may not reflect outcomes that people care about. As discussed in another review on a different hepatitis C drug announcement, “Patients care most about conditions that affect them and not how many virus particles are in their blood.”

The drug costs at least $350 a month, plus the price of doctor's visits. It's unclear whether the findings will make a dent in an addiction that affects millions of Americans. The study, published in today's Journal of the American Medical Association, was funded by the maker of the drug, Johnson & Johnson Inc.'s Ortho-McNeil Neurologics. The Topamax group cut back to six drinks a day, on average, assuming everyone who dropped out of the study relapsed into heavy drinking. It's unclear how many relapsed after quitting the pill.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story provided some idea of the magnitude of benefit from the use of this drug – significantly more people using this medication were able to abstain from drinking entirely for at least 28 days out of the 98 days of the study.  Similarly, there was also a reduction of the average 11  drinks per day to 6 1/2 drinks per day for those using this medication as compared with 7 1/2 for those in the placebo group.
The inclusion of the anecdotal report of someone who remained sober years after taking the drug implies a duration of effect well beyond the duration of this study: 3 1/2 months.  While there is no formal exaggeration of the effect, a cheery anecdote may falsely raise expectations in the reader.

The study said there were still many unanswered questions about Pfizer's pill, torcetrapib, the first in a new class of heart medicines known as a CETP inhibitors, which raise HDL, or good cholesterol, and lower LDL, or bad cholesterol. Pfizer suspended development of the tablet, its most important experimental drug, after it caused an increase in deaths and heart problems in clinical trial volunteers. Cardiologists had hoped it would reduce the buildup of plaque in blood vessels that can cause heart attacks. It was unclear what the mixed bag of data presented at the American Heart Association's Scientific Session in Orlando would mean for CETP drugs under development by Merck and Roche, and another candidate in early-stage development by Pfizer. However, the study found the tablet triggered an increase in the hormone Aldosterone, which helps regulate both blood pressure and bodily fluids.

A new migraine drug that can halve the length of attacks has been hailed as “the start of real change” in how the condition is treated. Phase three trial data on nearly 1,000 patients showed that it typically cut between three and four “migraine days” per month. In half the patients treated, migraine duration was reduced at least by half. Lead investigator Prof Peter Goadsby, from King’s College hospital, London, said: “Strive … represents an incredibly important step forward for migraine understanding and migraine treatment.”

The findings, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, clearly showed that blocking the CGRP pathway could reduce the impact of migraine, he said. “This is probably the first example of a migraine preventing drug that was rationally designed, rather than serendipitously found,” he added.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This story does a decent job summing up the study design and presenting key results from the study, down to the differences between dosage and even placebo groups.
While we give the story a satisfactory score on this criterion, we also suggest that the numbers could have been explained far more clearly. Our heads are still spinning a bit from this paragraph in the story:
The research revealed that by months four to six, at least a 50% reduction in mean migraine days per month was achieved for just over 43% of patients injected under the skin with 70-mg of erenumab each month, while half of patients injected with the higher dose of 140-mg had such results. However, those given a placebo also saw benefits, with 26.6% of participants in this group experiencing such a reduction.
A sidebar infographic would have helped, breaking down precisely how many days, how many people, and on what dose. Yes, the results were quantified, but in a less than optimal way.

Such patients need anticlotting drugs because blood clots can be a deadly complication of getting a stent. But there's a problem with Plavix, and with a newer, stronger drug in the same class called Effient. Both drugs increase the risk of dangerous bleeding. And since the drugs irreversibly bind to blood-clotting platelets, a patient has to stop taking these drugs for five to seven days before the body can make enough new platelets. And in the new study, patients had less bleeding after stent installation.

As part of their employer-provided health benefits, each participant in the study underwent screening colonoscopy at Konkuk University, which also sponsored the research. Colonoscopy, used in millions of Americans every year, is just one of many methods to detect abnormalities. LeFevre, a member of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federally appointed expert panel, said the chances that a polyp turns into cancer is currently a matter of debate. As a result, he said, it is hard to know whether removing polyps in younger people would in turn lower their risk of getting cancer. “If we back screening down to age 45, does that affect mortality?” he said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story quantifies the number of people who would need to be screened in order to find one late-stage polyp (and is clear to point out that they may or may not develop into cancer).

"Drug-coated stents have reduced re-stenosis rates compared to bare metal stents, but require prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy to prevent clotting of the drug-coated stent," said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, an American Heart Association spokesman. In preventing major cardiac events, the researchers found that zotarolimus-coated stents, the new entry in the field, were less effective than the sirolimus-eluting stents, but better than stents coated with paclitaxel. For the study, a team led by Dr. Duk-Woo Park from the University of Ulsan College of Medicine and Asan Medical Center in Seoul randomly assigned 2,645 patients undergoing angioplasty, a procedure to restore blood flow through the artery, to one of the three stents. After a year, Park's team tallied the number of adverse cardiac events the patients experienced, including death, heart attack and the need for a new angioplasty on the same artery in which the stent was placed. The number of heart attacks and deaths was about the same in each group, but the rate of blood clots in the stents was significantly lower with sirolimus-eluting stents, Park's team also found.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The article gives the absolute rates of major adverse cardiac events for each treatment group. 
Also, while this is likely not a major issue for most readers and not an official strike against the article, as an FYI we point out that there are some interwoven concepts that can be confusing. The article’s headline is that SES won this contest. If you want to get technical, there are two buts. First, while SES did have the fewest cardiac events of the 3 stents, the difference with ZES wasn’t statistically significant. In other words, the apparent superiority of SES may have been do to chance. Or not. We don’t know. Researchers call this a trend but not significant evidence.  Second, this contest, the study, wasn’t designed to answer whether SES was the best. The researchers concluded, as quoted in the story, that this study answered two main questions: ZES and SES were similar, and ZES fared better than PES did. Notice it didn’t say SES was the best.

Because the study wasn’t a clinical trial, it’s hard to know if the findings can be chalked up to aspirin or if something else is at play. Dr. Kausik Ray of St. George’s University of London, who has studied aspirin, said the new study did not look at overall death rates or side effects such as serious stomach bleeds. Earlier this year, Ray’s team published an analysis of previous aspirin trials showing the medication did not prevent deaths from heart disease or cancer, and was likely to cause more harm than good. One of the problems with the new study as well as with previous aspirin trials, he said, is something called detection bias. Ray called for trials that specifically check people for new cancers at given intervals to weed out the selection bias marring the previous research.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Much better than the competing WebMD story, this story appropriately stated:
“People who said they took daily aspirin – whether ‘baby’ or adult strength – had a 16-percent lower risk of dying from cancer than non-users overall, Thun and his colleagues found.
For men, the difference came out to 103 fewer cancer deaths a year per 100,000 people; for women, the number was 42.”

Now the biggest collection of cases so far comes out in favor of surgery on the all-important question of mortality. But Dr. Laura Mauri says in an accompanying editorial that the new study can't settle any debates. And while such a study is being done, the technology (especially stenting technology) changes. That can call into question the ultimate relevance of the findings. So the new data may be the best that doctors and patients in this situation can expect for the foreseeable future.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story quantified the benefits two different ways. It says, “Four years after the procedure, patients over 65 who had coronary artery bypass surgeries (called CABG or “cabbages”) were almost 20 percent less likely to die. Put another way, 21 percent of stented patients had died after four years compared with 16 percent of surgery patients.”
This would have been a good time to use the Number Needed to Treat statistic.  Overall, the story made a good effort to give readers numbers in a way they could easily understand.

The clinical trial included 22 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had been treated previously with irinotecan and whose disease was progressing. The study also showed signs that guadecitabine reduced methylation among the cancer cells. There was one death during the study, possibly resulting from febrile neutropenia caused by the treatment. The current study was based on previous studies in the laboratory of Nita Ahuja, M.D., director of the Sarcoma and Peritoneal Surface Malignancy Program and professor of surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, which showed that guadecitabine limited the growth of colorectal cancer cell lines when combined with irinotecan, says Azad. The drug combination is being tested in an ongoing phase II clinical trial (NCT01896856) in a larger group of metastatic colorectal cancer patients at multiple institutions to determine the effectiveness of the dual therapy compared with chemotherapy regimens that do not include guadecitabine, says Azad.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release does a good job here in two ways. First, the release makes clear that the goal of this study was not to assess benefits, but to assess potential harms. That places the findings — and the study design — in context. Second, the release notes that 15 of the 22 patients had at least one imaging scan to track the extent and location of their cancers. Twelve of those 15 patients had “stable” disease, while one saw a 30 percent decrease in the size of the tumors.

"We saw very encouraging reductions in clinical events," said Dr. Christopher Cannon, lead author of the study, which also appears in the Nov. 18 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. A big study to confirm the results would take four to five years to complete so the drug is still years away from market, said Cannon, who is a cardiologist with Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. "Torcetrapib raised HDL astoundingly but that was entirely neutralized by the increase in cardiovascular events." It also didn't result in the blood pressure increases that helped doom torcetrapib. "The fact that LDL was also reduced also makes it promising."
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story emphasizes the safety questions that were at the heart of this trial. It also tells readers plainly that it is unknown whether the changes in cholesterol levels seen in this trial have beneficial health effects. It does an impressive job in describing the uncertainties associated with drug manipulation of HDL blood levels. After reporting that the HDL cholesterol numbers rose from 41 mg/dl to 101 mg/dl, the story quotes an independent source saying, “Currently, we’re not convinced that manipulation of HDL matters, though certainly it’s promising.” Unlike some other stories about these trial results, this report repeatedly tells readers that any discussion of real health benefits will have to wait at least until after a trial designed specifically to measure such outcome is conducted.

The effect was so marked that the trial was stopped early for ethical reasons, so that patients in the control group could be offered the new drug. To be sure, more than half of patients with metastatic melanoma would not be helped all that much by either drug. A series of articles in The New York Times last year followed the development of vemurafenib, then known as PLX4032, and recounted how some patients close to death seemed to make miraculous recoveries. In the trial, sponsored by Roche and led by Dr. Paul B. Chapman of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, 38 percent of participants had to stop taking the drug or lower the dose because of side effects, including rash and joint pain. The new trial of this drug, by contrast, involved patients who were getting treated for the first time.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

They found that such patients who gulped a few cups of the tart liquid every week lowered their chances of infections, the second-leading killer of the more than 350,000 Americans on dialysis. The findings were presented at the American Society of Nephrology’s meeting in Denver — aka Renal Week — and have not yet been vetted by independent experts. By comparison, that number would be nearly 11 in patients not drinking the juice. Brosius was skeptical of the benefits, although he said the juice was unlikely to cause harm. “Who the heck knows what the active ingredients are?”

Marion Nestle, a nutrition expert at New York University, said the effects might not be unique to pomegranate juice.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Good use of absolute risk reduction:
“According to the findings, among 50 patients drinking pomegranate juice for a year, about two would have to go to the hospital at least twice. By comparison, that number would be nearly 11 in patients not drinking the juice.”

"I went in there and I could barely take two steps," said Bush, 42, who researchers believe is the world's first MS patient to "test-drive" an implanted FES system. Both men gained strength and endurance through repeated use of the systems and fine-tuning by the researchers. McGlynn's gait became noticeably more symmetrical and energetic, the researchers said. Training with the system improved McGlynn's speed when it was turned off to 23 yards per minute, indicating therapeutic benefit. Due to his improvements, the research team is developing a system that McGlynn can use at home and outside.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release describes both men’s improvement in terms of distance walked with the aid of electronic nerve stimulation. For example, the stroke patient’s ability to move “without the system was about 19 yards per minute; with the system, 47 yards per minute,” the news release states, while training improved his speed with the system turned off to “23 yards per minute, indicating therapeutic benefit.” His distance improved from 83 yards to 1,550 yards, almost a mile.
It states that the multiple sclerosis patient “went from the two steps to consistently walking more than 30 yards during the (90-day) trial. In that time, he used a walker to help maintain his balance.”
The news release also provides quotes from the men and links to videos that show the men’s abilities to walk with and without electronic stimulation.

After sleep deprivation in the lab, five people exposed to dim light therapy got in car accidents during the driving simulations. None of the people who slept at home crashed, and neither did any of the sleep-deprived people who got bright light therapy before getting behind the wheel, the study found. “Sleep deprivation makes this worse of course, and together with the clock, this conspires to impair our ability to sustain attention to task (e.g., driving), and avoid distraction, and react quickly to external stimuli like traffic lights, brake lights in front of you, road signs, etc,” Mistlberger added by email. Exposure to bright light didn’t appear to improve reaction times or sleepiness. More research is needed on the potential of bright light therapy to make exhausted drivers safer, said Dr. Donald Redelmeier, a researcher at the University of Toronto who wasn’t involved in the study.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story is specific about the number of sleep-deprived participants who crashed their simulated cars after exposure to dim light (5) compared to those whose simulated drive home was preceded by 45 minutes of bright light (0).

The research team reports that the potential improvement in diagnostic accuracy will spare thousands of patients each year in the United States alone from having to undergo unnecessary surgery. At Johns Hopkins, use of this test has already spared a number of our patients from unnecessary surgery and unnecessary removal of a kidney that would require them to be on dialysis. Following surgery, similarly ‘blinded’ pathologists analyzed the tumors without knowing the radiologists’ imaging results. The addition of sestamibi SPECT/CT increased the reviewers’ diagnostic certainty in 14 of the 48 patients, or in nearly 30 percent of all cases. “In the absence of diagnostic certainty, surgeons tend to remove kidney tumors in an abundance of caution, leading to an estimated 5,600 surgically removed benign kidney tumors each year in the United States.”

Other authors on this paper include, Sara Sheikhbahaei, Christopher S. Jones, Kristin K. Porter, Alex S. Baras, Phillip M. Pierorazio, Mark W. Ball, Lilja B. Solnes, Jonathan I. Epstein, and Mehrbod S. Javadi, all of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and Takahiro Higuchi of Wurzburg University in Germany.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release states that “The addition of sestamibi SPECT/CT increased the reviewers’ diagnostic certainty in 14 of the 48 patients, or in nearly 30 percent of all cases,” and that “Conventional imaging combined with sestamibi SPECT/CT had a value of 0.85, while conventional imaging alone had a value of 0.60.” The release offers that “a value of 0.50 indicates that a diagnostic test is no better than chance,” to give readers a benchmark for comparison.

It is hard to know who will be able to improve reading skills over time, and how much extra help is necessary. A study led by Fumiko Hoeft, psychiatry researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine, used brain imaging to answer this question. If made widely available, this kind of brain scan could be an important complement to the assessments -- based on reading and behavior -- already available for diagnosing dyslexia, Hoeft said. Because of this, Weiner said, three-dimensional letters and numbers, perhaps made out of plastic or clay, help a dyslexic child grasp the shapes better. The most important intervention is a direct, explicit teaching of phonics, or how symbols correspond with sounds, Branstetter said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: 



We will give this story a satisfactory rating because it portrays this research as providing information for researchers seeking to understand dyslexia, rather than offering important direct benefits to individuals. However, most of the story is about what it is like to live with dyslexia. These anecdotes have little or nothing to do with the research. The list of celebrities who may have or had dyslexia also seems irrelevant and distracting. Then the story tosses in discussion of a study that looked at correlations between dyslexia and spatial skills; again, unrelated to the topic of the primary study reported here. The jumble of extraneous personal tales and other research muddles the point of the story.

The research offers hope to patients who haven’t been helped by traditional antidepressant treatment. That’s probably the best hypothesis.”

Other studies have suggested that SAMe can relieve symptoms of depression. Dr. Nelson, who was not involved in the Harvard study, said the results need to be replicated in a larger study, and that more information is needed on dosing, side effects and long-term treatment with SAMe, among other things. “In the last 60 years of depression research, all the treatments have focused on similar mechanisms of action. This is one of the first few studies that suggests a different mechanism.

It eventually attracted attention in cardiology circles, where the scans' costs and benefits are the subject of much debate. They say the test's value is limited because it doesn't identify which plaque are stable and which could rupture and cause a heart attack. The American Heart Association did not endorse the legislation, which Khera estimates could result in millions of Texans being screened. Dr. William Zoghbi, director of Methodist Hospital's Cardiovascular Imaging Institute, said the cancer risk numbers reported in the study are actually fairly low compared to other tests that take X-rays of the chest area, such as a regular CAT scan or coronary angiography. The Texas law will require insurance companies pay $200 of the bill for patients to get the test every five years.

As mentioned above, the story notes that while some experts recommend CT screening for coronary artery calcium deposits in order to increase the number of people receiving treatment to reduce the likelihood of a heart, others are skeptical about the real value of this type of screening for apparently health people. The reporter points out that many heart attacks strike people who do not have very high cholesterol levels or other indicators of elevated risk, but also that “no study has linked the use of CT scans with better patient outcomes.”

People with psoriasis who haven’t seen improvement with standard treatments now have a new option. This small difference is significant, says Dr. Richard Fried, a member of the National Psoriasis Foundation medical board, since responses to drug treatments can vary dramatically from person to person. Because of these events, the labeling for Siliq will include a Boxed Warning, and the drug will only be available through a restricted REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program. In order to prescribe it, doctors must be certified with the program and must counsel patients about this risk. He adds that the data on Siliq suggests that it is not only effective in treating psoriasis, but that many patients experience improvement in anxiety and depression, as well.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This also is a barely passing satisfactory. The story states that, “In the three clinical trials considered for drug approval, more than 50 percent of patients who used Siliq achieved total skin clearance—the ultimate goal of psoriasis treatments—within a year.”  It would have been more helpful to provide more data, but this statement at least gives us a sense of the scale of the benefit.

He hopes his new technique will "lower the bar to adoption" of effective surgical treatment for patients with this debilitating headache condition. The technique is a new use of an approach that many surgeons are already familiar with: the Gillies incision, used for surgical repair of cheekbone fractures. The experience supports a growing body of research showing good outcomes with surgery for chronic temporal headaches. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery® is published by Wolters Kluwer. The ADRs are traded on the over-the-counter market in the U.S. (WTKWY).
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release mentions that headache symptoms were assessed using the Migraine Headache Index (MHI), which is calculated by multiplying together the frequency, intensity, and duration of migraine headache, according to another paper published by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.
Out of the 19 patients mentioned in this news release, 16 had at least a 50 percent reduction in headache symptoms.  It also reveals the absolute numbers, pointing out that the average MHI score decreased from approximately 132 points before surgery to 52 points afterward.
Since the release communicates a quantitative estimate by giving both absolute and relative benefit data, we give it a Satisfactory rating here.

In retrospective research, it's impossible to filter out the countless reasons that a woman and her doctor might have made the decision to treat the cancer with or without surgery, leaving the conclusions unreliable for clinical decision-making, he said. Two small prospective studies have suggested no survival difference among women with Stage 4 breast cancer who have surgery and those who don't, he said. Still there may be reasons to remove the cancer in the breast. But with better therapies to control the cancer systemically and improved imaging that finds ever-smaller deposits of cancer in other parts of the body, it may be time to see whether surgery also can help increase the length of survival times, they said. "Theoretically...patients with metastatic breast cancer might benefit from surgery to remove the cancerous breast tumor in combination with medical therapies as a more complete reduction of their total body cancer burden," she added.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The Washington Post story quantifies the potential benefits of surgery, detailing that women who underwent breast surgery had better survival rates than those that didn’t (median of 28 months versus 19 months). Despite the better outcomes, the article adds the number of surgeries dropped from 67.8 percent in 1998 to 25.1 percent in 2011, which it describes as an “intriguing question” about that approach.
Furthermore, the story is quick to point out early in the story that surgery may not be the right option for all women and “may be better for some women than it was in 1995.”
We applaud the fact that the benefits are reported in absolute terms and in a more cautionary manner, which is why we give it a Satisfactory rating here.

The results were presented Monday at the Society of Interventional Radiology's annual meeting, in Los Angeles. Much of the pain that comes from knee arthritis actually stems from inflammation in the lining of the knee joint, also called the synovium, Bagla said. Overall, the two scales represented an 80 percent improvement in function, the researchers concluded. Researchers are already kicking off a second, larger trial to better understand how the procedure works and which patients it might benefit, Bagla said. Dr. Suresh Vedantham, president of the Society of Interventional Radiology, called the new procedure "very promising," given that it focuses on the inflamed knee lining that causes the pain.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story passed muster by saying patients studied so far “averaged a 58-point decrease in pain, as measured on a 100-point visual scale used to estimate pain,” starting from an average baseline of 72. It said that meant pain was “brought down to manageable levels.”

But doctors have continued to think that even microscopic disease in the lymph nodes should be cut out to improve the odds of survival. If any are positive, the disease could become deadly. But Dr. Carlson said that some of his colleagues, even after hearing the new study results, still thought the nodes should be removed. “It’s a little frustrating.”

Eventually, he said, genetic testing of breast tumors might be enough to determine the need for treatment, and eliminate the need for many node biopsies. The new research grew out of efforts in the 1990s to minimize lymph node surgery in the armpit, called axillary dissection.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story did a good job providing some numbers on benefits, but we wish it had provided more and explained some things a bit more. It says, for example, “In 27 percent of the women who had additional nodes removed, those nodes were cancerous.” How many women had additional nodes removed and, of those, how many had cancerous nodes? A figure like 27% means 1 out of every 4 women had nodes that were, indeed, cancerous, which seems to conflict with other statements in the story about chemotherapy and radiation wiping out the cancer.

The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human trial, which is considered the gold standard test for any new medicine. GW Pharmaceuticals, a company that is developing cannabidiol medicines, helped subsidize the study. Based on the overall results, Devinsky believes CBD should be evaluated for epilepsy types beyond Dravet syndrome, which is caused by a genetic mutation and affects about one in 20,000 to 40,000 children in the United States. Some scientists have said these federal requirements have slowed research supporting medicinal benefits of the plant. He noted that generating more evidence of effective use is "a good thing."
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story says in the first paragraph: “Among children taking cannabidiol, the decrease in the frequency of convulsive seizures — which involve a loss of consciousness, stiffened muscles and jerking movements — was 23 percentage points greater than the decrease in seizures among children taking a placebo.”
What exactly does this mean? That, for example, the children taking a placebo experienced seizures on 73 out of every 100 days during the trial and that those taking the drug experienced seizures on 50 out of every 100 days? We would need to know the actual number of children who did and did not experience seizures and then know more about the frequency of those seizures to understand this reduction.
Later in the story, there is a better explanation of the comparison of frequency of seizures, and the story does something that most stories don’t ever do. It explains the range of experiences during the trial, not just the average. It says, “Within the study, individual participants experienced convulsive seizures at a rate ranging from four per month, on average, to 1,717 per month. During the 14-week study, frequency of convulsive seizures decreased from an average of 12.4 to 5.9 per month in the cannabidiol group, compared with 14.9 to 14.1 in the placebo group. On average, the change in seizure frequency amounted to a 39% decrease for the cannabidiol group patients, compared with a roughly 13% decrease among the placebo group.”
That’s quite a range, and it would have been good for the story to include a sentence explaining that the sheer variety in the patient population would make it difficult to adequately assess the efficacy of the drug in a trial this small in size. We’re unclear on the math here, though. It looks to us that there was a 26 percentage point difference between the reduction in the drug group and the placebo group.
Still, this is a lot of data-driven detail we don’t normally see in news stories, so we appreciated this.

It’s good news for women with severe urge incontinence, who can choose between treatments based on preference, said Dr. Cindy Amundsen of Duke University, who led the study. The team studied women with severe incontinence who could not be helped with drugs or other treatments. The women in the study had to suffer at least six episodes of incontinence over three days. Incontinence may sound funny, but it’s no joke, the researchers said. They’re also studying the cost difference.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The benefits are stated as such:
The Botox injections freed 20 percent of the women in the study of incontinence, compared to 4 percent who had a nerve stimulator implant, Amundesen and colleagues reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
“Forty-six percent in the onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) group and 26 percent in the sacral neuromodulation group had at least a 75 percent reduction in the number of episodes of urgency incontinence,” they added.
and
On average, both treatments cut the number of “accidents” – Botox by almost four times a day and the nerve stimulator by about three times a day.
This is sufficient for a Satisfactory rating on this criterion. We would have liked to have seen more discussion about actual improvements (perceived and otherwise) to patient quality of life. The closing line of the study brings this into question, i.e. how the work is of “uncertain clinical importance,” and good interview questions with both a study author and independent expert source could have greatly clarified the issue.

The test has the potential to help curb overtreatment in cancer care. Conversely, the test also suggested some tumors were more aggressive than doctors had believed. Only 10 percent who are candidates for monitoring choose it now. The newest test was developed by Genomic Health Inc., which has sold a similar one for breast cancer since 2004. The gene test shifted about half of the men into either a lower or a higher risk category.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story carefully framed the potential benefits – “could triple the number of men thought to e at such low risk for aggressive disease that monitoring is a clearly safe option.  Conversely, the test also suggested some tumors were more aggressive than doctors had believed.”
It explained that one manufacturer had published 9 studies while the other had not published any results yet – “another thing that makes doctors wary.”
It explained that in one study:
“Using one current method, 37 of the 395 men would have been called very low risk and good candidates for monitoring. Adding the gene test put 100 men into that category, said another study leader, Dr. Matthew Cooperberg of UCSF. The gene test shifted about half of the men into either a lower or a higher risk category.”

But help could soon be at hand in the form of a nasal spray, new research suggests. A spritz of a synthetic hormone, already used by bed-wetting kids, might benefit older people struggling with the problem called nocturia. In the United States there's no approved drug to treat the problem, the study authors said. Desmopressin spray prompted "a significant decrease" in the frequency of nightly bathroom trips compared with the untreated group, Kaminetsky said. This suggests that the anti-inflammatory impact of routine exercise may minimize nocturia, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: We’re giving the benefit of the doubt on the rating, though we wish the story were more precise. The story says the results showed “a significant decrease,” and the average was “two fewer episodes” per night, but a reduction from how many episodes total is unclear.   The same lack of details complicate the discussion of the measured increase in uninterrupted sleep and quality of life. The numbers in the story, though a little vague, at least give some sense of the magnitude of the benefit in terms that are meaningful to people with this condition.

In some cases however, patients maintained a clinical response after stopping the TNFi altogether. "The optimal management of RA involves achieving the lowest possible disease activity - ideally remission, and then maintaining this level of control," said lead author, Dr. James Galloway, Department of Rheumatology, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UK. "Findings from our study have shown that adopting a TNFi dose reduction strategy can still meet this objective, with no compromise on symptom control for the patient and offering a more cost-effective option by substantially reducing the high drug costs associated with TNFi maintenance therapy." Post-dose reduction flares resolved when the original dose of TNFi was restarted. To be eligible, patients had to demonstrate stable low disease activity (DAS28 less than 3.2) for over three months.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release notes that there was no significant difference in outcome between those who got the standard dose and those who got the dose that was reduced by a third. It gives the absolute percentage of patients experiencing flares in both groups.

The benefit seemed to stem from better decisions on C-sections and inductions of labor, according to the researchers, led by Dr. Zarko Alfirevic of the University of Liverpool in the UK. In general, he and his colleagues found, the trials included in the review, which were mainly done in the 1990s, had their shortcomings. Research, according to Alfirevic, has moved on to other questions, including how to best manage abnormal findings from a Doppler scan. Another question, Alfirevic said, is whether ultrasounds of blood vessels other than the umbilical artery might improve pregnancy outcomes. “There is no evidence to suggest that it should be done in low-risk women,” Alfirevic said.

The story clearly states the reduction in fetal death rates the review authors calculated by combining the results of the studies ithey looked at. It reports the absolute risk calculation of fetal or newborn deaths (1.7 percent among women who did not receive ultrasound monitoring vs. 1.2 percent among those who did). This reporting of absolute (as opposed to relative) risk reduction is a strong point of the story since it conveys to readers that while the intervention did improve outcomes, the underlying risk is small. We only wish, however, that the story had cited the Number Needed to Test that was included in the study – 203 would need to be tested in order to find one case of fetal distress that would otherwise not have been seen using other routine exams.

Dr. Ransohoff and other screening experts say patients should continue to have the test, because it is still highly effective. When she saw them, she said, “I asked my analyst to rerun the data.”

Now, researchers say, the challenge is to find out why the test missed so many cancers, in particular, those on the right side of the colon, and whether the problem can be fixed. One solution, supported by six studies, is to be sure there is just a short time between when patients finish taking the strong laxative that cleanses their bowel and the colonoscopy, Dr. Rex said. Still, he said, that does not mean that patients should have more frequent colonoscopies. CT colonoscopies, so-called virtual colonoscopies, are not a solution, some screening experts said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story adequately quantifies the mortality benefit from colonoscopy screening. But we wish the story had quantified the benefit in absolute rather than relative terms.

Survival was shown to be greatest among those prescribed first-generation nonselective beta-blockers. According to Sood, the usefulness of beta-blockers was unclear until now. "The ability to show improved survival using nonselective agents - which inhibit a specific stress pathway - is the culmination of years of research into ovarian cancer biology and pathogenesis." Further examination revealed that NSBB users had improved overall survival regardless of the presence of such prognostic factors or comorbidities. "The stratification of patients by beta-blocker use and selectivity in this study makes it unique among all other studies examining the impact of these drugs on cancer.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release provides an understandable summary of the benefits seen in this retrospective review.  “The release reports that EOC patients nonselective beta antagonists (NSBBs — a type of beta blocker) had a median overall survival of of 94.9 months. That’s compared to 42 months for EOC patients who did not take beta blockers, and 38 months for those receiving beta-1-adrenergic receptor selective agents (SBBs — another type of beta blocker).”  But we think a few words about a couple of important provisos which we comment on under Quality of evidence should have been included.

There’s a good explanation for that: While the research shows that 12-step treatment can be as effective as professional treatment modalities like cognitive behavioral therapy, the research also shows that the 12 steps don’t work for everyone. The good news is that the research suggests the spiritual aspect doesn’t fully explain why the 12 steps are effective for some people. That’s long led researchers to suspect that alternative mutual help groups could work. Providing these alternatives would essentially move addiction treatment closer to other kinds of medical problems. While alternatives like SMART or LifeRing do exist, they’re not nearly as available as AA — and they certainly aren’t built into professional treatment programs in the same way as the 12 steps.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story reports the researchers’ conclusion that “[Women for Sobriety], LifeRing, and SMART are as effective as 12-step groups for those with AUDs.”
The story also quantifies that level of effectiveness when it says that studies broadly find that “about a third of people maintain recovery from alcohol addiction due to 12-step treatment, another third get something out of the treatment but not enough for full recovery, and another third get nothing at all.”
The story acknowledges that there were some differences in the data — for example that those who reported SMART as their primary group “seemed to have worse substance use outcomes,” and that “there were lower odds of total abstinence among LifeRing members.” It explains that those differences might be explained by the differing goals of the programs, as LifeRing doesn’t emphasize complete abstinence as intensely as the 12-step programs. While it would be interesting to know just how much worse the outcomes were with these alternate groups, we don’t think the omission is enough to merit a not satisfactory grade.

Still, she says, the finding points to a gene-environment interaction that may possibly help explain some cases of autism. Taking prenatal vitamins was found even more protective for mothers and children who had a high-risk genetic makeup . The risk rose if the mothers or the children had a high-risk gene form. Children who had the high-risk COMT gene form were seven times as likely to have autism as children without it whose mothers did take the vitamins. Exactly why the prenatal vitamins may protect against autism is not clear, she says.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story communicates the results using relative terms, noting that women who didn’t take vitamins had “about a 60% higher risk of having a child with autism.” In women with a high-risk genetic profile who didn’t take vitamins, the risks were 4.5 to 7 times higher compared with women who didn’t have the high risk genes and took prenatal supplements, according to the story. While these relative numbers probably give readers an overinflated sense of the benefits of taking supplements (or the harm of not taking them), using absolute numbers, which we normally prefer, would be inappropriate and probably even more misleading in coverage of a case-control study such as this one — for the reasons discussed here. The use of relative numbers is acceptable in a case-control study if there is some indication of the underlying population-wide risk, which this story provides when it says that autism affects “up to one in 110 children” — or about 1%.  While admittedly complicated and imperfect, this mix of numbers should help readers draw appropriate conclusions about the significance of the findings.

Mandato stressed that no one in the study required sedation to undergo the procedure. And, he said, the hope was that lidocaine would essentially short-circuit that bundle's headache-causing pathway. Seven of the patients (about 6 percent) failed to get any benefit from the treatment, the investigators found. The researchers acknowledged that this procedure is a temporary solution that would need to be repeated. The study received no funding from private industry.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story was on point with the reduction of pain levels. It mentioned that a single outpatient treatment seemed to reduce migraine pain levels by “about 35 percent for up to a month after the procedure,” which was close to the 36 percent reduction rate researchers saw on day 30. The article also explained very well the range of “pain scores” that patients experienced during the study, such as pain levels recorded from a day to a week to a month after the procedure. We’d note that in headache research, investigators usually also record the frequency of headaches as well, since this is an important quality of life measure for patients. It’s not clear why that outcome wasn’t measured in this study.

But it's important to know that the weight loss that's typical for users of the drug -- 5 to 10 percent of total weight -- will be less than many dieters expect. And many consumers may be put off by the drug's significant gastrointestinal side effects, including flatulence, diarrhea and anal leakage. While Americans spend an estimated $1 billion on nonprescription weight loss products, few if any of those products have undergone the rigorous testing that is required by the FDA for prescription medications. At the current recommended prescription dose -- 120 milligrams taken up to three times per day, for example up to 360 milligrams daily -- about 70 percent of users experience gastrointestinal complications, Klein says. That's because Orlistat works by blocking fat absorption in the intestine.

Casts were applied in the operating room under general or spinal anesthesia by a trained surgeon. At 6 months, casting resulted in measures of ankle function equivalent to that with surgery. Casting required less operating room time compared with surgery. The researchers add that close contact casting may be an appropriate treatment for older adults with unstable ankle fracture. Further studies are needed to help identify which patients will not benefit from casting.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release includes a list of benefits of the modified casting method, with some quantification, mostly in terms of reduced complications. It says, “At 6 months, casting resulted in measures of ankle function equivalent to that with surgery. Infection and wound breakdown were more common with surgery (10 percent vs 1 percent), as were additional operating room procedures (6 percent vs 1 percent).”

It shows that palliative care and cancer care aren’t mutually exclusive.”

Dr. Atul Gawande, a Harvard Medical School surgeon and writer who just published a long article in The New Yorker about hospitalized patients’ suffering before death, called the study “amazing.”

“The field was crying out for a randomized trial,” he added. In practice, Medicare and private insurers do pay for some palliative care, said Dr. Gail Austin Cooney, a former president of the palliative medicine academy. She needed powerful painkillers, and also chose alternative-medicine options like acupuncture and “energy work” for nausea and fatigue. “But I couldn’t have completed the program without the psychosocial support.”

Palliative care experts now want to study patients with other cancers, heart disease, stroke, dementia and emphysema. This trial was paid for by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and private philanthropy.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Like the competing coverage, this story featured prominent discussion of the survival benefit associated with palliative care. We were pleased to see that it also spent some time on the improvement in quality of life and depression scores as well as the reduction in aggressive chemotherapy usage toward the end of life in the palliative care group. We wish the story had been more precise in its quantification of some the benefits — it notes that the palliative care group reported "less depression" and "happier lives" but offers no way to judge the magnitude of the benefit. However, we don’t think these shortcomings were enough to throw the story out of balance.

But patients treated with fake or “sham” acupuncture - using retracting needles that don’t stick in the skin, for example - estimated their pain at somewhere in between the other two groups, suggesting that they also got some benefit from the procedure. It’s usually “not their first approach to address the condition,” he said - rather people seek acupuncture when traditional care fails to stop their pain. Park, who was not involved in the new study, said acupuncture focuses on healing the underlying tissue injury that is causing pain, rather than treating the pain itself as medications would. But, he added, “I would sincerely say more than 75 percent of my patients will see improvement.”

Vickers said people who are considering acupuncture should first make sure their acupuncturist is appropriately qualified and licensed. In those cases, he said, acupuncture is very safe - and the main downsides are costs and the inconvenience of getting to a clinic.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story puts the benefits in terms readers can understand and that accurately reflects the magnitude of the benefit: “…about 50 percent of patients had their symptoms cut in half with acupuncture, compared to almost 43 percent of those treated with sham acupuncture and 30 percent with no acupuncture-like therapy.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - German researchers who used a bone marrow transplant to treat a cancer patient with the AIDS virus, have declared him cured of the virus — a stunning claim in a field where the word “cure” is barely whispered. “Our results strongly suggest that cure of HIV has been achieved in this patient,” they wrote in the journal Blood. It requires destruction of a patient’s own bone marrow — itself a harrowing process — and then a transplant from a donor who has a near-exact blood and immune system type. Schneider’s team has been following the patient, taking samples from his colon, liver, spinal fluid and brain as he developed various conditions that justified the tests. All these places are suspected “reservoirs” where HIV can hide out for years, to rebound in patients who stop taking drugs that suppress the infection.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: We’re giving this one a pass here. The story makes quite clear that it is a report on the experience of only one patient and that while the researchers say there are now no signs of HIV infection in this individual, the tests don’t completely rule out the possibility that the virus is lurking somewhere. In particular, the comments of Dr. Gallo to place the apparent benefit in this single patient into context.

Newswise — CHAPEL HILL, NC – UNC researchers say the results from the multi-site phase 2 and 3 trials of brexanolone injection are not only promising, but could change the way postpartum depression (PPD) is treated. A unique dose group of brexanolone 60 µg/kg/hr in one of the studies was not included in the integrated efficacy analysis, but was included in integrated analyses of safety. Another 107 women were administered a placebo and evaluated during the same timeframe. The reduction of symptoms in the patients receiving brexanolone injection was maintained throughout the last study visit at Day 30. Sage Therapeutics is the developer of brexanolone injection and sponsor of the trials.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that  there was a reduction in depressive symptoms of 17 points for those on the drug, and 12.8 for those in the placebo group based on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The absolute reduction in the rating scale is given for each group. This information would have been much more helpful if the release also clarified the magnitude of the scale and whether a 4.2-point difference is clinically meaningful.

Just an avocado a day can significantly lower your cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease, a new study shows. And it’s one more piece of evidence in favor of adding good fats to the diet. “All the foods were exactly the same, except the avocado versus oils that were high in monounsaturated fat on the moderate-fat diet. “

Americans may not be used to eating avocado but Kris-Etherton says it’s easy to add. Avocados are definitely not low-calorie food.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story accurately compares the reduction of LDL cholesterol in study participants who ate avocado to reductions in LDL among study participants who did not — the avocado group’s LDL levels dropped by just over 13 milligrams per deciliter of blood (13.5 according to the news release), compared to reductions of 8.3 and 7.4 for two other groups. The story also provides readers with a frame of reference for those numbers, noting that overall LDL levels should be below 100 (which makes a difference of 5 or 6 mg/dl fairly significant). The story also explicitly makes the connection between LDL cholesterol and human health, noting that it is a significant risk factor for heart disease.
We wish the story had explained how the changes observed in the study would affect someone’s risk of a heart attack or stroke. In addition, there’s a reference to the “plaque-busting” properties of monounsaturated fatty acids that is a bit of unnecessary hype. There is no medication or nutrient that “busts” plaque, but rather a healthy lifestyle, diet, and medications for some will help prevent its accumulation. Given the other strengths discussed above, we don’t think these problems are sufficient enough to warrant an unsatisfactory rating.

In the current study, researchers evaluated whether the HbA1c test (also called the A1C test), commonly used to diagnose type 2 diabetes, could identify signs of gestational diabetes in the first trimester of pregnancy. According to the authors, comparatively few studies have examined whether the HbA1c test could help identify the risk for gestational diabetes, and these studies have been limited to women already at high risk for the condition. The test is not currently recommended to diagnose gestational diabetes at any point in pregnancy. The authors noted that further studies are needed to confirm whether measuring HbA1c levels in early pregnancy could determine a woman’s later risk for gestational diabetes. Similarly, research is needed to determine whether lowering HbA1c with lifestyle changes, either in early pregnancy or before pregnancy, could reduce the risk for the condition.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release quantifies the results and potential benefits by noting that each 0.1 percent increase in HbA1c levels above 5.1 percent  in early pregnancy was associated with a 22 percent higher risk for gestational diabetes.

There also isn't a great deal of information on how effective medications or home exercise programs are for treating neck pain, the researchers noted. The goal of the home-exercise program was to improve movement in the neck area. There are different pathways to healing, and whether you feel you're better off with chiropractic, home exercises or medications, this study shows that all three are basically just as effective. He also noted that it's important for anyone receiving spinal manipulation to know that there are rare, but serious risks that can occur with neck manipulations. All three experts said anyone experiencing neck pain needs to have it evaluated to make sure there isn't a serious or correctable cause of the pain.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story includes both some of the specific results reported by researchers as well as more conversational descriptions of the overall experiences of people in this trial. Readers get the message that people with neck pain tend to feel better as time passes no matter which treatment option they used and that none of the treatments is clearly superior or can deliver sure-fire pain relief.

The treatment combination also shaved two days off a typical 14-day stay in the hospital. About 27 million surgeries are done just in the United States each year, and in as many as half a million cases, infections occur at the site of surgery. The new study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, used a rapid test to identify which patients, most of whom were scheduled to undergo surgery, had the bacteria in at least one nostril. The research team, led by Dr. Lonneke Bode of Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, estimated that 250 patients would need to be screened to prevent one infection. Although his team did not evaluate enough patients to study the problem directly, “We feel this technology is capable of preventing those types of infections as well,” Verbrugh said.

“If parents are using it to determine gender and then terminate the pregnancy based on that, that could be a problem,” she told Reuters Health. In a fresh look at the medical evidence for the blood test, she and her colleagues analyzed 57 earlier studies that included more than 6,500 pregnancies. That leaves some room for error, which could be important if parents are making medical decisions based on the results — such as whether or not to get an invasive procedure to look for genetic disorders. Bianchi said one study had estimated the blood test costs about 255 pounds in the UK (about $413), all included. While it’s available over the Internet, she said her team had only looked at hospital-based test performance.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Reuters examines how parents may benefit from earlier results in pregnancy if their unborn child is at risk of a serious genetic defect that is sex-linked. However, the story also points out that there is some chance of mistakes with the early testing.
We’re just surprised that neither Reuters nor the NY Times pointed out in absolute terms that 5 out of every 100 tests of girls and 1 of every 100 boys will be wrong – 6 out of a hundred multiplied by millions of pregnancies a year is a lot of errors even if uptake is small.
It’s also worth noting that most research achieves better performance results than when the tests are used in the real world.

This finding could lead to the first advance in the treatment of calcium oxalate stones in 30 years. The findings are the result of a combination of experimental studies, computational studies and human studies, Rimer said. "HCA shows promise as a potential therapy to prevent kidney stones," the researchers wrote. "HCA may be preferred as a therapy over CA (potassium citrate)." The most effective inhibitors reported in the literature simply stop the crystal from growing.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release merely states that, in lab tests, hydroxycitrate appears to be capable of dissolving a common component of kidney stones and could be more effective than citrate, which is often recommended in addition to diet and lifestyle changes as a way to help prevent kidney stones. There is also a cautionary note at the end of the release (which could have been placed near the top) stating that long-term safety, dosage and additional human trials are needed.

But she didn't hurt very much. She'd consider a second operation, but Metson says usually that's advised only for patients with nasal polyps that regrow -- not a problem she has. But surgery rarely cures them. That's because surgery doesn't touch the root cause of chronic sinusitis. That, he says, will be the next big advance in sinus treatment.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This story focuses almost exclusively on the experience of one patient, a practice we generally think should be avoided. In this case, however, the patient in question was a health columnist with the Boston Globe who brings a well-informed and appropriately skeptical perspective to the story. Whereas many stories seek out patients who embody the best possible outcome for a new technology or procedure, this patient describes an incremental benefit that was "disappointing" in size but in the end, still worth the trouble. Instead of getting 5 or more sinus infections per year, she now gets 3 or 4 infections that are not as bad as before. In addition, the story emphasizes that surgery is "rarely a cure" and should be viewed as a "last resort" for most patients with sinus problems.  We wish more stories were this measured in their assessment of medical benefits.

Previously, the appropriate blood pressure treatment for these patients used risk calculations and some guesswork, potentially leaving many vulnerable to heart disease or taking drugs they don't need. In the study, published on Jan. 10 in Circulation, the researchers say these calcium scores allow physicians to go beyond the traditionally calculated risk factors to determine which blood pressure treatment strategy may be most appropriate for a particular patient. To determine if coronary artery calcium scores could inform blood pressure recommendations too, the researchers used data from 3,733 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) who had systolic blood pressures between 120 and 179 millimeters of mercury. Thus, even though their calculated heart disease risk is relatively low and their blood pressure is below traditional cutoffs for treatment, the researchers say people in this category with calcium over 100 are high risk and may benefit from more aggressive blood pressure treatment. Participants with high systolic blood pressure between 160 and 179 millimeters of mercury had high event rates ranging from 20 to 40 heart disease events per 1,000 person-years regardless of their calcium scores.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release does a good job of explaining the findings with numbers. It says the study shows “heart CT scans can help personalize treatment in patients whose blood pressure falls in the gray zone of just above normal or mild high blood pressure.” It says the study suggests “people with the highest calcium levels would benefit most from aggressive blood pressure treatment, whereas those with little or no calcium may not need to be treated as intensively, depending on their other heart disease risk factors.”
It gives some detailed numbers to show the risk differential between people with no calcium buildup and those with a lot of calcium. To paraphrase the release, among participants with borderline blood pressure readings, those with calcium scores of zero and high predicted risk of heart disease had a low actual event rate, of 12.7 events per 1,000 person-years. Those with calcium scores over 100 but a low predicted risk of heart disease ended up with a higher rate of actual cardiac events, 19.7.
“Thus,” the release says, “even though their calculated heart disease risk is relatively low and their blood pressure is below traditional cutoffs for treatment, the researchers say people in this category with calcium over 100 are high risk and may benefit from more aggressive blood pressure treatment.
Given that the difference in cardiac event rates between people with low calcium scores and those with high calcium scores isn’t extreme, this might amount to a marginal benefit; we would have liked some discussion of how many patients might fall into this “gray zone” and thus benefit from this approach.
Basically, the benefits, including the number needed to treat (NNT), cost-effectiveness, as well as harms and costs of obtaining these calcium scores are unknown. All we know is the magnitude of the increased potential risk associated with higher calcium scores, not whether this risk can be reduced.

For the first time, however, patients such as Herry have options. But after decades of failure, the spate of new drugs is helping more patients than ever before, giving people like Herry more time and better quality of life, Schuchter says. Doctors now dare to hope that giving these new drugs in sequence, or in combination, will help people with melanoma live for years while feeling relatively good. Older melanoma therapies — including interferon, interleukin-2 and five chemo drugs — caused much more serious side effects, leaving her too sick to work, Herry says. Patients with a limited time to live may not be so positive, Turnham says.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: With so many different drugs discussed in one overview story, it’s difficult to give complete data on all. And, while we had some reservations, we give the story the benefit of the doubt on this criterion.
In general terms the story states, “No one can claim to have cured melanoma.” Also in general terms, it stated, “When the new immune therapies work, they often keep cancer at bay for a long time.”
It gave specific details on two studies released in advance of the upcoming ASCO meeting – what percentage of patients had what percentage of tumor shrinkage. But we would have liked to have seen additional comments on why this level of tumor shrinkage is important to the patient. Tumor shrinkage may be a surrogate outcome that doesn’t translate into a meaningful improvement in a person’s life. Was there an improvement in survival or quality of life?  How long were the subjects followed in the studies?
It also included this quote from the executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation: “Drugs such as ipilumumab can seem like breakthroughs to doctors because they help 15% of patients. Patients with a limited time to live may not be so positive.”

Researchers claim that although the drug does carry some health risks, its overall effectiveness, especially its ability to reduce self-harm and suicide, mean it should be much more widely used. The lead author behind the research told the Guardian that widespread “lithium stigma” among patients is leading to them receiving the wrong treatment and ending up admitted to hospital unnecessarily because their condition is not as well controlled as it could be. The researchers’ analysis bore out one of the two main criticisms of lithium, but found the other to be baseless. That means that people end up in hospital more often than they need to and end up achieving less in their lives than they could do if they were on lithium. “Different people will find that different treatments help with managing their mental health problems.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The research examined the side effect profiles of  lithium, valproate, olanzapine, and quetiapine and provided hazard ratios for the most commonly recognized side effects.
The Guardian story reflects those findings in a qualitative way with some quantitative details, such as: “Meanwhile, lithium patients were less likely to put on weight than patients on the other drugs. While 15%-20% of those on the three other drugs were more likely to gain more than 15% of their body weight, just 10% of those on lithium put on the same amount of extra pounds.”

Researchers compared this new drug, which comes in pill form, to the only FDA-approved chemotherapy drug for melanoma, dacarbazine: It has been used to treat melanoma patients since 1975, but is only effective in about 10% of patients. Nearly 90% benefited from this new targeted drug, Schuchter said. Among 502 patients enrolled in this clinical trial, half were given Yervoy plus dacarbazine and the other half were given a placebo and chemotherapy. Yervoy takes a while to work, and some patients may not have that time, study author Chapman said. He also points out that both drugs do have side effects so patients have to be monitored.

Led by Dr Linda Solbrig from the School of Psychology, the research involved 141 participants, who were allocated either to FIT or Motivational Interviewing (MI) - a technique that sees a counsellor support someone to develop, highlight and verbalise their need or motivation for change, and their reasons for wanting to change. Everyday behaviours and optional app support are used to cue imagery practice until it becomes a cognitive habit. We asked them to imagine seeing it, touching it, juicing it, drinking the juice and juice accidently squirting in their eye, to emphasise how emotional and tight to our physical sensations imagery is. From there we are able to encourage them to fully imagine and embrace their own goals. "As well as being delighted by the success of the study in the short term, there are very few studies that document weight loss past the end of treatment, so to see that people continued to lose weight despite not having any support shows the sustainability and effectiveness of this intervention."
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release describes benefits in terms of kilograms lost at six months and twelve months after the FIT/MI intervention. Benefits are also described in terms of centimeters lost from their waist circumference. This information would have been more meaningful if it had provided information about the starting weight and waist circumference for the groups, since that would have shed light on whether one group would find it more difficult to shed kilograms or centimeters.

Researchers say they have taken a big step towards developing a test that can tell people if they have cancer long before the first symptoms show up. The test is a long way from being used to screen for cancer, but the study shows a way to get there, the team reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine. It was even more accurate in finding late-stage cancers, but the goal would be to catch cancer in its earliest, easiest-to-treat stage. But there’s nothing yet that can detect cancer in someone who has not yet been diagnosed. And then it will have to be shown that using the test allows doctors to intervene sooner and help people.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story says, “They identified 62 percent of the patients with stage I cancer – four out of eight colon cancer patients, and 90 percent of colon cancer patients with stage II, III or IV disease. They got a positive in 45 percent of the lung cancer patients with stage I disease, 67 percent of ovarian cancer patients with stage I disease and 67 percent of breast cancer patients with stage I disease.”
This is a good start and we’ll rate it Satisfactory, but one very important thing to make clear with this type of research: It used samples where cancer was already confirmed to exist–which is different from testing only on samples where it’s not known if there is any cancer present. That could affect the accuracy.

A new Canadian study provides the first estimate of the risk of major complications from replacement surgery, important information for patients facing the choice. "That risk is much higher than we initially thought," said study co-author Dr. Andrew Krahn of the London Health Sciences Center in Ontario. And not every failure is deadly. Krahn said the rate of complications from surgical removal will surprise doctors, because replacing a defibrillator is considered a minor procedure. All the patients had devices that were recalled by manufacturers, Canada's national health system or the FDA.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The article includes the numbers of patients who had serious complications after replacement surgery, as well as how many had minor problems. Data are also included that would help readers assess how the risks of replacing a device compare with the device manufacturers’ estimates of how often something could go wrong if it was left in place.

But a new study suggests an existing medication may help. However, he cautioned that its long-term effects aren't known. Drugs in this class -- called anticholinergics -- have been linked with mental decline, he said. And oxybutynin doesn't interfere with the metabolism of tamoxifen, Leon-Ferre said, calling that an important consideration for breast cancer survivors. The research was scheduled to be presented Friday at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in Texas.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The article reports that the study found the women on oxybutynin had an average of five fewer hot flashes per week, while those on the placebo had three fewer. It’s not clear if the benefit was the same for both doses. The story explains that this was from a group 150 women who experienced at least 28 hot flashes a week. This is enough information to glean the magnitude of benefit.
But, the story could have used more context: The drug resulted in five fewer hot flashes a week. That’s not even one less hot flash per day. And those on the placebo, which costs nothing and has no side effects, has three fewer hot flashes a week. That’s a difference of two hot flashes a week–which seems like a really low bar.

The average survival time for someone diagnosed with melanoma is nine to 11 months, added Chapman, who is an attending physician in the Melanoma Sarcoma Service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. "I think the most important part of this breakthrough is the bigger percentage of people who responded." That finding opened the door to potential targeted, molecular therapies for melanoma, which has been sorely lacking in effective treatments. PLX4032 is the first potent inhibitor of BRAF that has made it to the clinical trial stage, Chapman said. It turns out that the melanoma really cares if we block the gene BRAF.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job of quantifying the benefits. It explained that 81% of patients had a partial response, meaning some shrinkage of the tumor, and gives the absolute number of people this represents. It also explains that the drug is effective in only the 50% of advanced melanoma patients with a specific genetic mutation. Although it cautions that a "sizable proportion" of patients developed resistance to the drug, we wish it had been a bit more precise in its characterization of this problem.

Dr. Douglas P. Zipes, a professor at the Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis, said the new device could someday displace existing models used in many patients Every month, about 10,000 patients in this country get a defibrillator, either for the first time or as replacements for devices whose batteries have worn out. Hundreds of patients who received the model have had to undergo new operations to replace it. But Dr. Bardy estimated that the device could work in about 25 percent of patients who now get a defibrillator. Dr. Bardy said the cost of the new device is about the same as a standard defibrillator. However, he said it could help reduce health care costs, because implanting it is much simpler.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: 
This story outlines the problems with the electrical lead wires of existing devices that have harmed patients and required re-operations and recalls. It explains that by using wires placed under the skin, instead of through blood vessels into the heart, the new device might reduce the risks associated with implantable defibrillators for certain patients. The story cautions that only about a quarter of patients who currently are given implantable defibrillators might be candidates for the new type of device.

The balloons take up space in the stomach, which presumably makes people feel fuller faster, the FDA said in its announcement Tuesday. But the device can only be used for six months at a time, and it is not likely to be an alternative for people who require lap-band surgery, stomach stapling or other forms of bariatric surgery, said Dr. Mitchell Roslin, chief of obesity surgery for Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. The device doesn't change the stomach's natural anatomy, according to the FDA. Roslin also believes that, for now, patients will have to pay cash for the ReShape. Patients who did not receive the device lost about half that amount of weight -- just over 3 percent of their total body weight, the FDA said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story states “the ReShape system helped people more than double their weight loss compared to those trying to lose weight through diet and exercise.” We also also note that because previous studies on weight loss suggest that the average individual is hoping for a loss of 20% or more of presenting weight, “double” as a descriptor, when discussing very small losses, may be a bit loaded.
In the final paragraph, the story includes absolute values of weight loss:
“In the clinical trial, the 187 participants who used the device lost an average of more than 14 pounds, or about 7 percent of their total body weight. Patients who did not receive the device lost about half that amount of weight — just over 3 percent of their total body weight, the FDA said.”
Kudos to the writer for including the comments from the researcher who said the results may be temporary.

Dr. Neil M. Bressler of Johns Hopkins University, the chairman of the group that conducted the trial, said a two-line improvement in vision would allow some people to read normal-size print or to drive again. So doctors can — and some already do — use the drug off-label for the diabetic condition. With this successful Phase 3 trial, insurers will now be more likely to pay for such off-label use. He said treatment with Lucentis in the clinical trial virtually eliminated those incidents. The trial involved 691 patients, some of whom had both eyes treated, resulting in 854 total eyes.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION:  The story provided quantitative information about the possible impact on vision. But we wish there information about any measurement of  the patients’ perspective on whether they are functioning better after receiving this treatment versus standard treatment

But the blood-thinning drug doesn’t appear to cut the chances of dying from the disease, at least not enough that researchers can say for certain. The task force advises that men age 45 to 79 take aspirin to stave off heart attacks, as long as the benefit outweighs the risk of bleeding. “It refines our knowledge of how beneficial aspirin is,” Dr. Graham Nichol, an expert in emergency care at the University of Washington in Seattle, said about the study. “I don’t think this paper is inconsistent with previous work.”

Nichols, who was not involved in the study, said aspirin is clearly beneficial for people who’ve already had heart disease, and that it also seems to help those at high risk. LeFevre added that while the new study did add extra evidence compared with earlier work, it failed to analyze the effects on men and women separately.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Appropriate context.  With a meta-analysis it is not statistically appropriate to pool absolute risk reductions, so the way the story treated the evidence is as good as can be done (showing the relative risk reduction and an “anchor” in terms of absolute risk. Excerpt:
“The researchers found a 19-percent reduction in non-fatal heart attacks among participants who took aspirin compared to those who did not.
They don’t mention how many people actually suffered such a heart attack, but an earlier analysis of six of the trials showed that out of every 1,000 people, 18 individuals taking aspirin had heart attacks every year, compared to 23 individuals taking placebo pills.
On the other hand, that analysis also found aspirin increased the rate of bleeding from 0.7 to 1 per 1,000 people per year, making the authors conclude the drug was of “uncertain net value.”

Overall, the conclusions have been pro-coffee. A co-author of the 2013 study linking heavy coffee drinking to higher mortality called the new one “very good,” especially since it controlled for the deadly effects of smoking, which the earlier one did not. It might mean instead that a third factor — another behavior, socioeconomic status, even personality or genetics — might go hand in hand with Behavior A and be the true cause of Outcome B. This same Nurses Health Study, for instance, infamously found a correlation between post-menopausal hormone therapy and lower risk of cardiovascular disease and death, here and here. If you do want to infer causation from this latest study, know that drinking coffee reduced the absolute mortality risk from 6.8 deaths a year per 1,000 people to, at best, 5.8.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: STAT’s story, like the coverage in CNN, gets the details, strengths and weaknesses of the data right, but STAT’s piece more precisely quantifies the findings and goes to exceptional lengths to clearly describe what an observational study can and cannot do, and did and did not do in this current piece of analysis.

"And for pain patients in particular, our work adds to the argument that cannabis can be effective." "I don't think that's the only reason, but certainly, it was too easy at many points to get prescriptions for opioids." All of these states include chronic pain -- either directly or indirectly -- in the list of approved medical conditions for marijuana use, according to Bradford. "So dispensaries are much more powerful in terms of shifting people away from the use of opiates." "There is a great deal of movement in the Northeast, with New Hampshire and New Jersey being well-positioned to legalize adult use," Moore said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The article quantified the findings this way:
The researchers found that states that allow the use of cannabis for medical purposes had 2.21 million fewer daily doses of opioids prescribed per year under Medicare Part D, compared with those states without medical cannabis laws. Opioid prescriptions under Medicaid also dropped by 5.88% in states with medical cannabis laws compared with states without such laws, according to the studies.
It could have also mentioned that the study that looked at Medicaid data did not see reductions in opioid prescriptions in all states with medical marijuana laws.
Below, in evidence quality, we address a related concern: Does the story do enough to clarify that these findings aren’t proof that marijuana legalization reduces opioid use?

Taking Prozac (fluoxetine) doubled the chances that a patient would show overall improvement, measured by their clinicians. When taking Prozac, Hollander says, “Patients acknowledge experiencing less discomfort. “The clinicians could tell that people were doing better not only in terms of OCD symptoms but overall distress and ability to function.”

MORE: Why Are So Many Foster Care Children Taking Antipsychotics? Responding to the research, Yale Child Study Center director Fred Volkmar told WebMD: “The question remains, ‘Is fluoxetine better than risperidone for this symptom?’ It would be interesting to see studies comparing these two drugs head to head.”

Hollander has previously received funding from pharmaceutical companies, but the current study was paid for by a grant from the Food and Drug Administration’s “orphan” drug program. The study was published in the American Journal of Psychiatry.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: After explaining that the story was quite small and covered only a few months time, the story provides a quick summation of the benefits found in the study saying, “half of the participants taking Prozac had significant reductions in obsessive-compulsive symptoms, compared with 8% taking placebo.”  But given the very small sample size, natural frequencies would have been more informative and less likely to be misinterpreted. Also, a bit more detail on what a “significant reduction” means in an autistic disorder would have been welcome.

"The Decipher test's tendency to make the two specialties more concordant in their treatment recommendations provides significant value toward standardizing care for patients." The study was designed to evaluate how the Decipher Prostate Cancer Classifier, which predicts the risk of metastasis after prostatectomy, would impact adjuvant treatment recommendations made by urologists and radiation oncologists. The test provided a more accurate and precise estimate of a patient's risk of recurrence. Use of this test therefore has the potential to assist clinicians to better direct utilization of secondary therapy after surgery. Adding truly unique information to the treatment decision-making process, Decipher generates a risk result that is completely independent and distinct from PSA, Gleason score and other clinical risk factors.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release states that, according to the latest study, Decipher has the ability to change the minds of both urologists (45%) and radiation oncologists (35%), and get more of them to agree what or what not to do with a patient after removal of his cancerous prostate gland.
We’ll give the release credit here for quantifying the main findings of the study. But we’d note that there was potential to go deeper. We’re never told how many patients have issues with recurrent cancer or metastasis. (The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services suggests about 40,000 men each year face a high risk.) We also aren’t told how effective radiation or other therapies are after a prostatectomy, nor how effective Decipher might be in saving lives. Most of the clinical trials cited in the article mention only reductions in biochemical progression–a surrogate endpoint.
Most of what’s found in the release are rather general statements from doctors who have financial relationships with GenomeDx Biosciences, e.g. “it helped ensure that the ones selected for adjuvant therapy are the ones most likely to benefit from it.”

One thing that has been less clear is what role fish oil plays in people who have already had a heart attack. The effects remained strong even after the researchers accounted for the fact that all of the people were taking standard heart disease treatment drugs, including cholesterol-lowering statins and blood pressure medications. Based on analysis of their blood samples, the people taking omega-3 supplements also showed lower levels of inflammatory markers, which suggests that the fish oil may be working by reducing inflammation following a heart attack. It’s the first encouraging strategy for protecting the heart a heart attack; the more remaining healthy tissue that can be saved, the stronger the heart will be. How much omega-3 is needed to start remodeling the heart in a beneficial way?
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story includes the most salient quantitative evidence of the study:
This is sufficient for a Satisfactory rating. However, more context would have made the story stronger: That researchers don’t know what “6% less scarring” means in terms of actually reducing a repeat heart attack, death or another cardiac event.
And from the original study, we learn that compared to standard post-heart attack medical therapies, the benefits of fish oil were not significant:
“after adjusting for standard post-MI (heart attack) medical therapies, there was only a nonstatistically significant trend for the treatment effect of O-3FA (omega-3 fatty acids) on noninfarct myocardial fibrosis (abnormal scarring of the heart muscle).”

But in a paper published in the , researchers in the UK describe a landmark study in which people with diabetes went into remission—just by losing weight. All of the people had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in the six years preceding the study. “It isn’t an irreversible, inexorable condition that you can never escape from — at the moment, people are told that.”

Previous studies have suggested that lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise, can be powerful ways to lose weight and combat diabetes. The current study takes that work a step further and shows that it’s possible to actually reverse the disease in people who have been diagnosed. Those are the cells that weight loss can re-activate.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story quantifies how much weight people lost and how many people went into remission, both in the group on the liquid diet and the control group (in which subject received the usual care for diabetes). That’s good, and worthy of a satisfactory.
However, the story does not explain what remission is or how it was measured. The study used hemoglobin A1c levels, which indicate blood sugar levels over the previous three months, and is often used to diagnose type 2 diabetes. Remission was defined as having a hemoglobin A1c level below the threshold for diagnosis without taking any diabetes medications. (This good outcome might still be characterized as pre-diabetes.)
In addition, readers aren’t told how high blood sugars readings were before the diet, so it’s impossible to tell how big the change was with weight loss.

Additional therapies are needed for prevention of osteoporotic fractures. Overall, there were no differences in serious adverse events between the treatment groups. “Further research is needed to understand the clinical importance of risk difference, the risks and benefits of abaloparatide treatment, and the efficacy of abaloparatide vs other osteoporosis treatments,” the authors write. : This study was funded by Radius Health. Editorial: Osteoporosis Therapy in Postmenopausal Women With High Risk of Fracture

“Ultimately, which therapy is selected for osteoporosis treatment may be less important than identifying and initiating an approved treatment,” write Anne R. Cappola, M.D., Sc.M., of the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and Associate Editor, JAMA, and Dolores M. Shoback, M.D., of the University of California, San Francisco, in an accompanying editorial.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: High in the release, the benefits of the drugs being studied and the placebo being compared are quantified clearly in both relative and absolute terms. Readers can see clearly that we are talking about quite a small group of people who saw benefits from either drug compared to the rather large group of women who were studied.
Most of the data presented was absolute risk which was excellent. This shows the benefit as well as the fact that most patients didn’t have a fracture regardless of which treatment was given.

The results of one new study may be less than hoped for, but the science is sound: The study concluded that injecting stem cells into the spinal cords of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is safe in most, though not all, cases. Unfortunately, the procedure provided no benefit to patients, though it caused substantial pain to two of the study participants. What he discovered during that experiment was that none of the patients suffered long-term effects (from either the surgical procedure or the implantation of stem cells), and no unusual acceleration of disease occurred. "He did not want to go on the ventilator," she said, adding that many people prefer a "natural death." In Pharr's opinion, this and other stem cell studies are certainly fair from a participant's perspective, since beforehand, "patients are presented with all the risk factors involved so they can make an informed decision."
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Since this was primarily a safety study, there are no measurable benefits to quantify, and the story lets us know with this statement: “Unfortunately, the procedure provided no benefit to patients.”
We’ll count this as sufficient for a Satisfactory rating.
However, we encourage journalists to think twice about giving air time to early-phase trials, especially for stem cells. In many cases, there isn’t a lot to report yet, since benefits haven’t been established in any meaningful way. Better to wait until bigger trials are conducted, which was even implied with this ending quote in the story:
“We are just now getting started with testing our hypotheses about using stem cells as therapeutics,” Glass said. “We do not know if these treatments will work, and it will take time to test these therapies in a systematic and safe way.”

This data highlighted compelling early results using the company's MRIdian system for the treatment of inoperable, locally advanced pancreatic cancer. The early results highlighted above, along with other data obtained using MRIdian will be tested in a multi-center, prospective, single-arm clinical trial for inoperable, locally advanced or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. The trial will be conducted by ViewRay's Clinical Cooperative Think Tank (C2T2), a group of MRIdian medical institutions focused on evidence gathering to support MR-guided radiation therapy. Forward looking statements with respect to predicted improved survival described in the poster presentation and video, are based on current expectations from the presented retroactive study and involve inherent risks and uncertainties about the potential health and medical benefits of MR-guided Radiation Therapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Further studies, including the planned prospective multi-institutional study referenced in this press release, as well as patient data covering longer periods of time post-treatment, could lead to different or contrary results from those expressed during ASTRO or in the poster presentation.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release provides exact information about increased survival rates in the cohorts of individuals treated with the adaptive versus the convention radiotherapy techniques.
“The cohort receiving a higher dose demonstrated a near doubling of median overall survival (Kaplan-Meier estimated median overall survival of 27.8 months compared to 14.8 months).”

Now, in the first study of its kind, researchers on Monday confirmed that a mother’s beneficial microbes can be transferred, at least partially, from her vagina to her baby after a C-section. As the operations began, the gauze was pulled out and placed in a sterile collector. But in terms of their bacterial colonies, the infants swabbed with the microbes closely resembled vaginally delivered babies, she found, especially in the first week of life. Anal samples from the swabbed group, oddly, contained the highest abundance of bacteria usually found in the mouth. And all infants delivered by C-section were exposed to antibiotics, which also may have reduced the number and variety of bacteria colonizing them.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The article does a nice job of detailing the potential benefits of the microbial transfer and the results seen in the study, while giving the caveat that longer follow up studies are needed to understand the implications of various microbiome make-ups. But to be fair, the results are from a total of 4 newborns, hardly a number on which to base any strong conclusions.

You don't actually need an app to practise natural family planning – although it does cut down on paperwork. Even so, the FPA advises that natural family planning is most effective if you’re taught how to do it by a specialist teacher, and you monitor all three fertility indicators – temperature, menstrual cycle length, and cervical secretions. But natural family planning is not for everyone. For starters, it can only protect against pregnancy, not STIs. And if the app gives you a "red day" – meaning you could be fertile – you have to abstain from sex, or use another method of protection such as condoms.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story cites a study that the app, when used precisely as directed–or so-called perfect use–has a failure rate such that 0.5 in 100 women will get pregnant over a year of use. People aren’t perfect, so with so-called typical use, 7 people will get pregnant out of 100 users over a year. The pill by comparison, results in 0.3 out of 100 people with perfect use, and 9 out of 100 with typical use.
In addition, the writer makes clear that the method requires abstaining from sex or using other protection for as many as 10 day per cycle, although that interval may decrease with longer use.

The CGI-I is a standardized assessment tool that allows clinicians to rate the severity of ADHD illness, change over time and efficacy of medication. "These results represent an important step toward a new treatment option for patients with ADHD. Including study 305 and previous studies, Shire now has a robust database of 15 clinical studies evaluating SHP465 in more than 1,100 subjects. Once the pharmacokinetic study and an additional safety and efficacy Phase 3 trial in adults currently under way are complete later this year, Shire plans to add these study results to its existing SHP465 data set to submit a Class 2 resubmission for FDA approval of the medicine for treatment of ADHD. In the event such risks or uncertainties materialize, Shire's results could be materially adversely affected.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release does a good job of explaining the benefits of the drug to children and adolescents with ADHD in relationship to a placebo and to a standardized measurement of improvement, but does not compare this new drug with existing treatments. It’s difficult to estimate how many people would want a stimulant that lasts 16 hours. Even if they do, it would be much cheaper to take a dose of an existing, shorter acting drug in the early afternoon.

Now, the field includes a slew of new drinks promising a better night's sleep using such ingredients as melatonin, valerian root and - think turkey - tryptophan. Oral doses of melatonin haven't worked much better at inducing sleep than a placebo in most studies, Scharf says, and a single, concentrated shot of the stuff doesn't exactly mimic the body's time-release system. When it launches nationally in March, Snooz'n will be available in grocery and convenience stores and pharmacies, like most of these drinks. The relaxation drink market is tiny compared with the energy drink market, says Garima Goel Lal, a senior analyst at the consumer research firm Mintel. Katherine Zeratsky, a registered dietitian at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., has blogged about relaxation drinks.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story does not report in detail on any one study, but comments from a sleep expert  tell readers what they need to know here. He remarks that melatonin (a constituent of many of the drinks) doesn’t seem to work much better than a placebo, and that we have no idea how well valerian root  (another supplement found in some drinks) works compared with prescription sleep medicines because they haven’t been compared.

"The goal of precision medicine is to give the right treatment to the right patient," said lead author Frank Sciurba, M.D., director of the Center for COPD and Emphysema and UPMC Pulmonary Function Exercise Physiology Laboratory, and visiting professor in the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. "These findings are the first example of a precision therapy that is uniquely effective in a subgroup of patients with treatment-resistant COPD." The first trial, termed METREX, was conducted at 117 sites in 15 countries from 2014 to 2017. The 300-milligram dose did not provide an advantage over the lower dose. "In addition to providing a new treatment option for patients with treatment-resistant, moderate to severe COPD, the new results also are important because they identify a potential biomarker for the disease and demonstrate that eosinophilic inflammation plays a role in flare-ups in COPD," Sciurba said.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The primary endpoint of the studies was to reduce the number of flare-ups that sent COPD patients either to the hospital or to the emergency room.
The release reports on the findings of two studies looking at the usefulness of the drug in a subset of COPD patients. For the METREX trial, which enrolled 837 volunteers for one year, it says, “The patients with high eosinophil counts who received mepolizumab had a statistically significant 18 percent lower rate of moderate/severe exacerbations (1.4 per year compared to 1.7 per year) than those in the placebo group.”
It’s not clear what a difference in exacerbation rate of 0.3 per year really means. Does this mean that each person will get one less exacerbation about every 3 years? That doesn’t sound like much of a difference.
For the METREO trial, the release said, “the exacerbation rate was reduced by 20 percent in the high eosinophil group after 100 milligrams of mepolizumab. The METREO results narrowly missed statistical significance.”

The ring is designed to be replaced by an ophthalmologist every six months. Ophthalmologists at 10 sites nationwide tested the ring in a phase 2 clinical trial on patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The ring became dislodged in 15 patients but was replaced each time, allowing therapy to continue. A phase 3 study of a larger group of patients is expected to begin later in 2016. The results are also being presented today at the Ophthalmology Innovation Summit in New Orleans.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release states that the ring containing the drug bimatoprose reduced eye pressure in glaucoma patients by about 20 percent over six months, and eye pressure fell 3.2 to 6.4 mmHg, compared with 4.2 to 6.4 mmHG for the group taking standard eye drops. The news release could have given more context to these numbers to help readers understand what they mean in terms of patient outcomes.
It’s worth mentioning that reducing intraocular pressure is an intermediate outcome. The real goal is to slow vision loss. While this trial is too short for that, it could have been mentioned when discussing future trials that the real goal is yet to be studied. We won’t dock points for that omission here since we address it below under the “Evidence” criterion.

An LDL of less than 100 mg/dL of blood is considered optimal. Participants received one of five doses of the new drug delivered via shot or intravenously or a placebo. The new drug did hit its target, PCSK9, and decreased levels of LDL cholesterol by up to 64 percent. Cardiologists were cautiously optimistic about the novel therapy. Former AHA President Dr. Ralph Sacco said that it is too early to make any predictions about what role, if any, this therapy will have in lowering cholesterol levels, but it could one day fill an important void.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The says that AMG 145 decreased LDL cholesterol by up to 64%. Although this description isn’t quite as useful as simply telling us what the cholesterol numbers were before and after treatment, the number does convey the point that this was an impressive amount of cholesterol lowering — which is accurate. The story also explains other features of the drug that might be attractive — e.g. the potential for less frequent dosing and fewer muscle-related adverse effects compared with statins. As already noted, the potential limitation of impacting a surrogate marker was worth mentioning. There was room for improvement here, but we’ll call it satisfactory.

approval was a belated triumph for the drug’s original developer, BioSpecifics Technologies of Lynbrook, N.Y., on Long Island. It tested that drug for numerous uses, including herniated disks. With Dr. Korn’s help, BioSpecifics licensed the drug to Auxilium in a matter of weeks, receiving $5 million initially. Auxilium and BioSpecifics hope that the half-century-old collagenase might eventually become as versatile as Botox, another bacterial product. With its belated success, BioSpecifics has sold off its ointment business.

EXPLANATION: The sidebar describes the outcomes of the main clinical trial of Xiaflex in absolute terms. It reports that 64% of treated joints straightened out, compared with 7% of control group joints. The story relied a bit heavily on a positive patient anecdote in the sidebar lead-in, but it also managed to find a second patient who offered a unique perspective on the treatment. This second patient had successful Xiaflex injections on three fingers and open surgery on a fourth finger which didn’t respond to the drug. In this patient’s view, the drug was preferable to surgery.

But vitamin pills seemed to have less of an effect in women with heart disease, Dr. Susanne Rautiainen of the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden, and her colleagues found. The results don’t settle the question of whether it’s actually the vitamin pills that are protective, Rautiainen told Reuters Health via e-mail. “It is very important to keep in mind that multivitamin users tend be ‘healthier’ in general. The women ranged in age from 49 to 83 at the study’s outset, and about 60 percent in each group used some type of dietary supplement. Similar studies have been done in men, with some confirming the current findings and others contradicting them, Rautiainen said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story provided the numbers so that readers could calculate the absolute reduction in heart attacks in the group of women taking multivitamins who did not have heart disease (with multivit = 2.6%; without multivit = 3.4%).  However, it is unfortunate that instead of choosing to report that there was  a1% reduction in heart attacks, a decision was made to report it as a 27% reduction in heart attacks.  While a 27% difference sounds pretty exciting, it is a bit misleading.

The results of the clinical trials, presented this week at a meeting in Hawaii, shocked and surprised stroke physicians. The three studies reported this week (which will eventually be published in the New England Journal of Medicine) tested the hypothesis in a rigorous way. Removing the clot wasn’t better than standard care in either group — those with a lot or a little brain tissue to lose. Why endovascular treatment wasn’t better is a mystery that the researchers are struggling to explain. The answer could be in the patients, the device or the timing of the procedure.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Strong lead:
“mechanically removing a blood clot from a stroke patient’s brain is no more useful than the older treatment of giving an IV dose of a clot-dissolving drug to the whole body.”
Absolute numbers provided later.  Another strong point in the story.

The group taking orlistat received a 120-milligram dose of the drug three times daily and got less than 30 percent of their calories from fat. Yancy said the blood pressure and cholesterol drops might have been even more impressive if people had stayed on their medications, but as they lost weight and normalized these readings, the doctors took them off blood-pressure and cholesterol drugs. The more intensive intervention was more successful with 31 percent losing more than 5 percent of their body weight, compared to just 9 percent of the Internet group. What often makes the difference in whether or not a diet is successful, she said, is whether or not there's a counseling and support component to the plan. And, she said, these studies show that you don't necessarily need to get to your "ideal body weight" to make substantial improvements to your health.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story gives a reasonable overview of the effects of the two interventions on a variety of different markers associated with health. Although it earns points for noting the absolute reduction in blood pressures and not just providing them as a percentage, it should have provided the weight loss in similar terms of actual pounds or kilograms lost instead of as a percentage of bodyweight.

Abbott Laboratories' newly approved Absorb stent comes with one important caveat: it hasn't yet been shown to be safer than older metal implants. The new stent is designed to gradually dissolve over three years. Other complications with the new device include allergic reactions, infections and internal bleeding. Doctors who studied Absorb said it may take several years before its advantages become clear. Some Wall Street analysts are betting that products like Absorb will allow companies to raise prices and boost revenue.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: A major message of this story, to its credit, is that the benefit of these dissolving stents has not yet been established–there is no data yet. This is important, because the whole point of designing a dissolvable stent is to minimize longer-ranging complications resulting from metal stents.
The story does briefly describe a company-conducted study. It says “patients who got Absorb fared about as well as those receiving Abbott’s older metal stent after one year.” However, we’re not told really what that means in terms of survival and reduced cardiac events.

Having one of these antibodies isn't a guarantee that you'll develop type 1 diabetes, but it does indicate an increased risk for the disease. People who have two or more type 1 antibodies have between a 50 and 100 percent risk of developing type 1 diabetes, according to background information in the study. The current study was randomized and double-blind (meaning neither the parents nor the researchers knew who was getting what), and compared regular baby formula to one that was made easier for babies to digest because the proteins were broken down (extensively hydrolyzed). How the highly hydrolyzed formula might reduce the risk of developing diabetes-predictive antibodies is unknown, but the researchers speculated that it might contribute to reduced gut permeability or changes in gut microflora, among other things. According to Knip, the take-home message from the study is that "it is possible to reduce considerably the initiation of the diabetes disease process in at-risk children in a simple and safe way: weaning to an extensively hydrolyzed formula."
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: We’ve already penalized the story in “evidence” above for not giving the absolute risk reduction, so we won’t do it again here. The story reports on a study which showed about 50% fewer diabetes antibodies in at-risk children who were fed special hydrogized infant formula. But 50% of what?  This may or may not translate into fewer cases of childhood diabetes. If there are other side effects or harms associated with using hydrolyzed versus standard formula, they are not described.

The scientists, whose work was published Wednesday in the Science Translational Medicine journal, said their findings offered hope for the millions of people who go blind each year because of a worldwide shortage of corneas for donation. “This study ... is the first to show that an artificially fabricated cornea can integrate with the human eye and stimulate regeneration,” said May Griffith of the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, who led the study. Made from parallel strands of the protein collagen, it refracts light to focus images on the retina. The patients were monitored for two years after surgery. Fagerholm said the patients in this trial had no problems with rejection and did not need long-term immune suppression drugs to help their bodies accept the corneas.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Like the other two stories reviewed, this reporter made the smart choice of avoiding the use of percentages in explaining the benefits. It would have been easy to say that 60% of the patients had improved vision, which sounds more impressive than six of the 10. More numbers and more context would have been ideal, but, given the size of the study, the amount of explanation of the potential benefits is adequate.

But it's not clear that women concerned strictly about breast cancer will line up for this drug, either. Based on those findings, it is easy to see why raloxifene was declared the winner. More important, the difference between the numbers of side effects was not statistically significant, meaning that it could have occurred by chance and that the drugs could be similar or even the same. In the meantime, Dr. Ford said, at least tamoxifen and raloxifene give women at risk the chance to do something. To Dr. Norton, the most important conclusion to be drawn from the study is that more research on breast cancer prevention is needed.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story does a very good job of quantifying the benefits of raloxifene compared to tamoxifen. Not only did the story provide absolute numbers in quantifying the benefit, but it also explained why presenting only relative risk reductions can be deceiving.

This type of "adoptive immunotherapy" could be effective against a wide range of cancers, Yee said. Several independent researchers said the study results were promising. The researchers hoped that by choosing T cells more selectively and cloning only those judged most likely to vanquish their foe, the treatment would be more effective. But Yee bet that the extra effort would pay off with better results and fewer side effects. The last step was to infuse the resulting army of cancer-fighting clones back into the patient.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

“In six of the 11 patients in the trial, the melanoma stopped progressing for 12 to 19 weeks.

Three years later, researchers continue to detect the presence of the cloned cells they infused into the patient”

But whether vitamin D is the reason for the excess risks — and whether taking supplements can curb those risks — has yet to be shown. On average, men who took vitamin D missed about two days from duty because of a respiratory infection, compared with three days in the placebo group. However, men in the vitamin D group were more likely to have no days missed from work due to a respiratory illness. Laaksi said that larger clinical trials looking at different doses of vitamin D are still needed before the vitamin can be recommended for curbing the risk of respiratory infections. However, exactly what the optimal vitamin D intake might be remains under debate.

As noted above, the body of the story makes clear that the results of this trial did not show a clear benefit from taking 400 IU daily.

Once on either of the medications, people fared equally well. What was important, Lee said, was for opioid addicts as well as treatment providers to understand that addiction isn't one-size-fits-all. Public health experts consider medicated-assisted treatment the gold standard of opioid addiction treatment. Without the opioids, people can go into withdrawal, all contributing to a cycle of dependency. Addiction "is an incredibly deadly disease," said Komaromy, an addiction specialist at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story describes duration of staying on the treatments and rates of relapse, reporting that the rates are roughly equal. The story is also clear that that those randomized to Vivitrol did not do nearly as well as those randomized to Suboxone–because over a quarter did not tolerate or receive the first dose of Vivitrol. If a person is hardy enough to tolerate detoxing in preparation for Vivitrol, then their likelihood of abstaining from opioids may be similar to those getting Suboxone (a little less than half of all people in the trial were still taking the drugs after six months).

Bakkum-Gomez has also used the method in her practice and is conducting a study of the IUD, which was originally designed as a contraceptive device, for this purpose. "Well selected," in this case, means those with early-stage disease who want to maintain their fertility, much like the group in this trial. The IUD was removed at the end of the year if there was no evidence of cancer. However, all the women were alive and seemingly cancer-free by the end of the study after further treatment (either the IUD and GnRH treatment or a hysterectomy), the study reported. Nine of the women in the study successfully delivered babies.

“I think the take home message is that robotic (surgery), looking at our study, had certain beneficial outcomes compared to open and laparoscopic procedures,” said study leader Jim Hu at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. Hu and his team analyzed surgery data from a national government database to see if the costlier robotic surgeries were cost effective with extra benefits over older techniques. The open-surgery group also stayed in the hospital about one day longer than the robotic group. The trade-off was the cost, with robotic prostate removal costing about $10,000 on average, roughly $700 more than laparoscopic surgery and $1,100 more than open surgery. David Penson, a surgeon at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who was not part of the study, said more consideration should have been given to the state of patients afterwards.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

Using this threshold in routine practice could potentially double the number of patients suitable for immediate discharge directly from the emergency department, say the authors. "We have identified a cardiac troponin concentration (less than 5 nanograms per deciliter; <5 ng/L) below which patients are at very low risk of heart attack either during the admission or in the ensuing 30 days. These patients are therefore potentially suitable for immediate and safe discharge from the emergency department. The overwhelming majority of these patients do not have a heart attack. Use of this approach is likely to have major benefits for both patients and healthcare providers.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This is a mixed bag. On the one hand, the news release refers to the high negative predictive value of the test (99.6%), which suggests that the test is very good at finding those who aren’t at risk of a heart attack or death over the next 30 days. But it also relies on relative risk comparisons, and does not offer data in absolute terms about risks of heart attack or cardiac death in those with various ranges of troponin levels. It refers to patients “at very low risk” of a heart attack in the next 30 days, but never tells readers what that means (1%? 5%? 15% chance of a heart attack?).  Despite these shortcomings, we think the reader will come away with a decent understanding of the potential benefits of the more sensitive test, and so we’ll award a Satisfactory rating here.

IRVINE, Calif., Aug. 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- MDxHealth SA (OTC: MDXHF.BR) today announces that a new study validates the cost-effectiveness of the SelectMDx® for Prostate Cancer test, a non-invasive, urine-based (liquid biopsy) test that helps identify patients at increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer. The researchers found that incorporating SelectMDx resulted in an average gain of 0.045 life years, or approximately 16 days, in full health gained at a cost-savings of $1,694 for each patient undergoing biopsy. "We believe that this strategy improves the value of conventional risk assessment strategies through improvements in both quality and cost, the numerator and denominator of the health care value equation." Since the introduction of the SelectMDx test in mid-2016, over 23,000 patients have been tested and 15 commercial contracts have been signed with US based insurance companies. This press release contains forward-looking statements and estimates with respect to the anticipated future performance of MDxHealth and the market in which it operates.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release does a good job of explaining the benefits of the SelectMDx test at both individual and societal levels.  Those benefits are pretty modest for a patient: a gain of 16 days of health at a cost savings of nearly $1700, on average.  But they are impressive when one ramps up to a societal level, given that more than 300,000 patients a year consider undergoing biopsies.
But it needs to be recognize that benefits and cost savings are estimated. The authors acknowledged that literature estimates for clinical benefits may not be applicable for the general population and the actual cost savings are uncertain because commercial payment rates are unknown.

These at-risk individuals may have weak or transient psychotic symptoms, and already show schizophrenia-like brain changes, Dr. G. Paul Amminger of The University of Melbourne in Australia, a researcher on the study, told Reuters Health. “At the moment there’s no state-of-the-art guideline (on) how to treat those people.”

Prescribing antipsychotic medications may be helpful, Amminger added, but these medications have serious side effects, and can also be stigmatizing. There’s considerable evidence that abnormal fatty acid metabolism may contribute to the development of schizophrenia, Amminger and his team note in the Archives of General Psychiatry. Seventy-six of the 81 study participants, or 94 percent, completed the trial, Amminger noted, which underscores the safety and tolerability of fish oil. The effect of fish oil capsules, Amminger noted, was similar to that seen in two trials of antipsychotic drugs in at-risk individuals.

The Italian researchers wanted to compare the electronic nose to the other commonly used tests -- spirometry and FENO -- to see which test was best at confirming a diagnosis of asthma. To do this, all of the study volunteers were given all three tests. Each test is non-invasive, requiring only the use of exhaled air. The electronic nose was able to correctly differentiate healthy people from those with physician-diagnosed asthma in 87.5 percent of the cases. This test seems relatively easy for patients and it does have potential, but they've only looked at a very narrow collection of people who have allergic asthma."
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story tells us the percentage of asthma patients who were correctly diagnosed by the electronic nose, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and spirometry. It provided this data in absolute terms and didn’t muddy the waters with relative comparisons of the three techniques. Although the study data by itself might suggest that the new device is superior to the other methods, the comments from the expert sources put the results in the appropriate context. They make it clear that we can’t tell yet whether this technology represents a better option than existing techniques.

The results add to a growing body of evidence linking cocoa consumption to heart health, but they aren’t a free pass to gorge on chocolate. “Given the observational design of the study, findings from this study cannot prove that it’s chocolate that lowers the risk of stroke,” Susanna Larsson from Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm told Reuters Health in an email. Over the next decade, there were 1,549 strokes, and the more chocolate women ate, the lower their risk. Among those with the highest weekly chocolate intake — more than 45 grams — there were 2.5 strokes per 1,000 women per year. For those at high risk, doctors recommend blood pressure medicine, quitting smoking, exercising more and eating a healthier diet — but so far chocolate isn’t on the list.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story went the extra mile here, providing the absolute rates of stroke seen in the groups consuming the lowest and highest quantities of chocolate.  “Among those with the highest weekly chocolate intake — more than 45 grams — there were 2.5 strokes per 1,000 women per year. That figure was 7.8 per 1,000 among women who ate the least (less than 8.9 grams per week).” These statistics weren’t provided in the study text, suggesting that the writer made the calculations based on data contained in one of the study tables. We applaud the extra effort made to provide meaningful statistics to readers!

"Increasing screening rates among under-screened women is of paramount importance." Earlier this year, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force gave an "A" rating to HPV primary screening alone for women aged 30 to 65. Offering HPV testing using self-collection by mail has a lot of potential to reach women who are the highest risk of being screened: those who don't access regular medical care." Researchers provided study participants with self-collection brushes along with instructions for how to take a sample from inside the vagina. The brush samples were then tested in a lab for HPV and other sexually transmitted infections.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This is a tricky question, as it is not clear how one should define the relevant benefit. The paper itself defines the goal of the study as evaluating the “validity and acceptability” of at-home self-collection of samples for HPV screening. If part of assessing “acceptability” was determining whether mailing self-collection kits improved screening rates, should the benefit be defined as successfully submitting a sample for screening? If so, the release failed, since it doesn’t even tell readers how many women received screening tests through the mail (284 women, according to the related paper). However, validity is easier to address. How well did the at-home, self-collected samples compare to other screening tests? The release does address this head on. It states that the at-home, self-collected test indicated 12.4% of women had high-risk HPV infections. In-clinic, self-collected tests indicated 15.5% had high-risk HPV infections. And clinician-collected tests indicated 11.4% of women had high-risk HPV infections. Those are hard numbers, and we’ll give the release the benefit of the doubt on this one. However, those three different numbers raise some questions, which the release doesn’t do a good job of addressing. More on that below.

At the start of the trial, 660 adults with DME were enrolled: their average age was 61 years and 90 percent had type 2 diabetes. One year after starting treatment, all participants had improved vision. “The results clearly remove any doubts about anti-VEGF drugs’ efficacy in treating DME. Physicians now have robust data to help them counsel patients and make informed decisions regarding treatment options,” says study co-author Lloyd P. Aiello, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School, Director of Joslin’s Beetham Eye Institute, co-head of Joslin's Section of Vascular Cell Biology, and founding chair of the DRCR Network. Joslin Clinic patients, and others with diabetes, have the option of participating in clinical trials at Joslin to help translate basic research into treatment innovations.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: These drugs are already used for treatment of macular edema and the purpose of the study was to compare the three. In general, all three show good results, with aflibercept producing slightly better results for those initially exhibiting poorer vision. The release quantifies this clearly in terms of improved ability to read an eye chart.

The researchers previously developed a vaccine that helps the immune system recognize the HER2 protein on breast cancer cells. The researchers report that the dendritic cell vaccines were well-tolerated and patients only experienced low-grade toxicities. They also show that the vaccine was able to stimulate an immune response in the majority of the patients. Importantly, the immune responses among the patients were similar, regardless of the route of vaccine administration. The study was published in the December 13th online issue of Clinical Cancer Research and was supported by funds received from R01-CA096997, P30-CA016520, Pennies-in-Action®, and the Henle Foundation.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release states that “approximately 80% of evaluable patients had a detectable immune response in their peripheral blood and/or in their sentinel lymph node wherein their cancer is most likely to spread to first.” It also states that 13 patients achieved an absence of disease after treatment, though it doesn’t give a percentage, and that patients who had early non-invasive disease called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) achieved a higher rate of disease absence than patients who had early-stage invasive disease.
Further, it says those patients who saw absence of disease had a higher immune response in their lymph nodes, which, says a researcher, “may serve as a more meaningful immunological endpoint.”
The news release states that immune responses were similar regardless of whether the vaccine was administered into a lymph node, a breast tumor, or both, though it doesn’t explain why this is an important finding.

The patients who are at high risk are candidates for surgery, he said. Those who would benefit from the ultrasound test are people with known carotid stenosis who are fit for surgery, Topakian said. Of course, anyone with symptomatic carotid stenosis is a candidate for immediate surgery, Topakian said. Nonetheless, some experts said that research suggests that patients with no symptoms are better off without the surgery. Marquardt noted that the risks associated with the surgery are a lot higher than leaving the stenosis as it is and starting aggressive medical treatment.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story got the “gist” correct that surgery’s benefit increases with increasing risk. One of the saving graces of the piece was this independent perspective:
“It is also unclear how optimal medical management [lifestyle changes in addition to anti-platelet medication and statins] would affect overall stroke and cardiovascular risk, and stroke-free survival,” he said.

Now, technology is dangling the possibility that women can stop that clock, at least for a while. Dr. Alan Copperman of Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York wastes no time laying out this harsh reality: By the time a woman hits her 40s, 90 percent of her eggs are abnormal. All told, costs can easily exceed $40,000, money Montoro doesn't have. And yet, even Widra agrees that egg freezing has appeal if it can help avoid the anguish of infertility. The bigger challenge, Sher and others say, is reaching out to younger women — getting them to take action before it's too late.

When validating a new biomarker for disease, "one should always analyze at least two different (groups of patients and controls) to make sure that the results are reproducible," said Hansson, who added that participants should also include both early- and late-stage patients established at different clinics. However, the test cannot distinguish between the different atypical disorders, which doctors must rely on symptoms to diagnose. According to Dr. Paul Wright, chairman of neurology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, New York, and Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York, the importance of this study is that it brings to light that there are new biomarker tests that can delineate between these neurological diseases. Instead, the cause is multiple system atrophy, a neurodegenerative disease. Though other symptoms will show up eventually and help in diagnosing the patient, in the meantime, the patient will be receiving the wrong medicines.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Atypical for many news stories like this, this one provided the actual specificity and sensitivity numbers for the blood test, and how that compares (in general) to the typical spinal fluid test.
That said, the story could have been a little more thorough in its discussion of what sensitivity and specificity mean. It says sensitivity is “the percentage of positives that are correctly identified, and specificity, the percentage of negatives that are correctly identified.” That’s accurate, but the story could have gone further to explain, for example, that a low specificity test means it will have a high false-positive rate (more people who don’t have the disease are erroneously told that they have it). A low-sensitivity test, by contrast, will have a high false-negative rate (more people who actually have the disease are falsely reassured by a negative test result).

The patients had been recruited and treated with the virus in England by a team led by Dr. Amit C. Nathwani of University College London; researchers at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia monitored their immune reactions. Dr. Nathwani and his team reported that they treated the patients by infusing the delivery virus into their veins. The patient cannot be injected again with the same virus because his immune system is now primed to attack it. Twenty more patients will be treated to assess the best dose of the virus, the goal being the highest dose that does not set off an immune system attack, Dr. Tuddenham said. The virus used by Dr. Nathwani’s team, known as adeno-associated virus-8, generally stays outside the chromosomes, so it should not present this problem.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story states that six patients were “successfully treated” and explained that treated patients “continued to produce their own Factor IX for up to 22 months,” and notes that one patient had an initial good response but his Factor IX levels declined.  It also points out that because his immune system recognized the viral vector, it is now sensitized to respond in the future and he now can’t be treated again.  That would mean that five of six – not six of six – were successfully treated.
There was also no comment about what difference these blood test changes made in patients’ lives – how they felt.
Nonetheless, we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt.

The findings appear in an upcoming issue of the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (CJASN). To investigate, a tem led by Giovanni Strippoli, MD, PhD (University of Bari, in Italy and Diaverum, in Sweden), and Jaimon Kelly (Bond University, in Australia) analyzed the medical literature, finding 7 relevant studies that included a total of 15,285 participants. The article, entitled “Healthy Dietary Patterns, Mortality and End-Stage Kidney Disease in CKD: A Meta-Analysis of Cohort Studies,” will appear online at http://cjasn.asnjournals.org/ on December 8, 2016, doi: 10.2215/CJN.

QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release does provide some numbers around the benefits, but they are mostly in relative terms, not allowing reporters or other readers to assess how many people really ended up benefiting from the healthy diets. It says, for example, “In 6 studies, healthy dietary patterns were consistently associated with a 20% to 30% lower rate of mortality, with 46 fewer deaths per 1000 people over 5 years.” It’s hard to understand from this sentence what this means. If it is a range from 20% to 30% lower mortality rates, does this mean that “46 fewer deaths per 1,000 people” is the average reduction in mortality? And this is 46 fewer deaths than what? Than 100? Than 900? Precision would have helped here.

Another trial in 2013, however, suggested that removing clots was not beneficial, he added. In this latest trial, researchers found that routinely removing clots was not beneficial, Jolly said. However, preliminary results from small trials of mechanical clot removal have not been promising, Jolly noted. Jolly said the lesson from his team's trial is that clot removal should be used only as a rescue treatment when an angioplasty fails to clear an artery. A number of studies have suggested a benefit from manually removing clots during an angioplasty, but this trial found no clinical benefits for doing so, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story reports the absolute difference in the primary composite outcome in the two groups in this study (in fact there was no difference between those groups, indicating no added benefit for clot removal), which earns the story a satisfactory rating here.
With that being said, the general benefits of angioplasty are not really discussed in the story. The assumption made is that after a heart attack, where clogged arteries occur, angioplasty is an accepted and effective treatment.  A bit of background on angioplasty as a treatment and stent placement might have filled out this story and made it clearer why these two approaches were being evaluated in the first place.

But there’s also an emerging body of research that suggests marijuana might be effective as a treatment for cancer on its own, or in conjunction with standard therapies. She knew the leukemia treatment protocols are backed by decades of research. First, there would be several months of aggressive inpatient chemo and other therapies for what’s known as “remission reduction.” After that, even when blood work showed the disease had entered remission, Landon would need years of chemo and monitoring—called “consolidation”—to make sure his body wasn’t harboring leukemia cells. For most of the kids who go through the entire course of treatment, the illness turns out to be a mere blip on the screen of childhood. But Landon appeared to be among a small percentage of children with leukemia for whom the treatment was unbearable, excruciating.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story gives the impression that the mother made the right choice for her son: stopping conventional chemotherapy and other treatment, and instead giving him cannabis oil. But more than once, the story warns that there is no evidence that cannabis oil fights cancer in people. It reports the mother’s beliefs that the cannabis oil benefited her son, but it does not tell readers that her beliefs are supported by any independent scientific evidence; in other words, there are no specific claims that the cannabis oil provided proven benefits. So we will give the story a passing grade on this criterion.
However, the story could have more clearly noted that the improvements in the boy’s quality of life could be explained by the end of toxic chemotherapy and other treatments, and that it’s just a coincidence that the cannabis oil treatment started at the same time.

The author, Dr. Alan Gaby, has long promoted the use of intravenous vitamins for a wide range of clinical conditions. One didn’t turn up any significant improvement in patients who received the infusions. Schwartz, though, said the supplements are completely safe. But as for whether they’ll help a client prepare for an important presentation? A longitudinal study would be needed to back those claims with evidence, she added.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story hinges on the lack of benefits, and we think it chose credible sources for questions about that. Besides quoting nutrition researchers Goodstein and Miller, we liked how the story explained the history behind the “Myers” cocktail and links to a review published in an alternative medicine journal. Readers are given their own way to check the credibility of claims of “evidence.”

The findings suggest that many of our expectations about the inevitability of physical decline with advancing years may be incorrect and that how we age is, to a large degree, up to us. As it turned out, the cyclists did not show their age. On almost all measures, their physical functioning remained fairly stable across the decades and was much closer to that of young adults than of people their age. Some aspects of aging did, however, prove to be ineluctable. All in all, the numbers suggest that aging is simply different in the active.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

What is less clear is whether there is another group of individuals whose digestive systems have some “gluten sensitivity” and who would, therefore, benefit from avoiding gluten. Of course, it’s difficult to distinguish between someone who is sensitive to gluten and someone who is sensitive to the placebo effect. If you think avoiding gluten will make you feel better, there is a reasonable chance that it will — even if gluten is irrelevant. For those of you keeping track at home, that means that while 30 percent of Americans are trying to cut gluten from their diet, probably at most only 1 percent of Americans may have NCGS. It’s hard to test for gluten sensitivities.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job of addressing the symptoms associated with NCGS, which would presumably be eliminated by adopting a gluten-free diet. It also provides useful numbers on the size and duration of the studies mentioned and how big the effects observed were. Example: “The authors found that 40 percent of patients on the entirely gluten-free diet reported a continuation of symptoms, compared with 68 percent of those who had consumed gluten.”

A small-scale pilot study of psilocybin’s use in cases of treatment-resistant depression showed it was safe and effective, the British researchers said. Robin Carhart-Harris, who led the study at Imperial College London’s department of medicine, said the results, published in the Lancet Psychiatry journal, were striking. Many patients described a profound experience, he said, and appeared to undergo a shift in the way they perceived the world. The trial involved six men and six women, aged between 30 and 64, all diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression. The patients were given psilocybin capsules during two dosing sessions, seven days apart.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story does offer some specific information about the outcomes of treatment for the 12 individuals in the study. Ideally it would have explained how those outcomes were actually measured–how did researchers measure what “some decrease” in symptoms meant? The same with “positive response.”

Her report is the latest warning from researchers who suspect that stents are being overused and may even be causing heart attacks and deaths. After a few days have passed, though, there is little or no chance of preventing heart damage. But many doctors open the artery anyway, thinking it may still have long-term benefits and prolong the patients’ lives. The findings may come as a rude surprise to many cardiologists, who have come to believe that opening a blocked artery, even days or weeks after a heart attack, is bound to be good for patients. The ones who might benefit, they say, are a small minority — perhaps 10 to 15 percent — who cannot take the class of heart medicines known as beta blockers, which have been proved to increase survival after a heart attack.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The benefits of the two treatments in terms of reducing the risk of heart attack, heart failure, or death in this particular patient group (individuals who had had a heart attack more than 12 hours before and were no longer experiencing angina) were found not to differ as reported in the story.

While the results, from only nine patients, must be replicated in a larger study, said Dr. Joseph Bellanti of Georgetown University Medical Center, “if what they found is true, they really have something here.” Bellanti, who was not involved in the research, said the study’s eight-year follow-up and use of a placebo control arm made him “cautiously optimistic” that two doses of the BCG vaccine “can decrease levels of A1c,” a measure of blood glucose that predicts the likelihood of serious complications such as stroke and kidney failure. All of the patients remain on insulin, she said, but less of it. The A1c reductions could also bring significant health benefits. The new paper describes how the BCG vaccine, which has been used for nearly 100 years against tuberculosis and is considered extremely safe, might affect diabetes. A Phase 2 clinical trial of BCG is currently underway at Mass.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Wisely, the story quantifies reduction in absolute terms: “In the vaccinated patients, A1c levels fell from an average of 7.36 before the first dose to 6.18 after five years, holding almost steady at 6.65 in the eighth year. In patients receiving a sham injection, levels showed almost no change from their initial levels of 7.10: 7.07 in the fifth year and 7.22 in the eighth.”
The story also explains exactly how much the drop in hemoglobin A1c was (9-16%) and how that compared to the levels in patients receiving the placebo injections and to normal A1c levels. The story also noted that a 10% drop in A1c levels reduces the likelihood of complications such as stroke and heart attack by a third. In addition, the story explained that the patients treated with the BCG vaccine now need one-third less insulin than they did before the treatment, “reducing their risk of hypoglycemia, in which insulin lowers blood sugar to dangerously low levels.” One relatively minor shortcoming is that the story did not explain that the reduction in hemoglobin A1c levels didn’t occur until the third year after the vaccinations had been given.

Among more than 200 stroke victims, TNKase (tenecteplase) was about twice as effective as alteplase in restoring blood flow to the brain, and it also resulted in less disability, the scientists found. For either drug to be most effective, it needs to be given as soon as possible after a stroke occurs. In this study, patients were given the drugs within 4.5 hours after the onset of a stroke, Campbell said. The researchers specifically looked to see which drug was better at restoring blood flow to clot-blocked blood vessels in the brain, and which drug resulted in patients having better outcomes. Bleeding into the brain, the most serious side effect of either drug, occurred in 1 percent of patients, regardless of which drug they received, Campbell said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story reported that 22% of patients treated with tenecteplase had more than 50% of blood flow return to the brain, compared with 10% of those treated with alteplase. That was the primary outcome.
It also said that patients treated with tenecteplase also had better functional outcomes after 90 days than those given alteplase, but doesn’t give data on the size of the difference.
The story didn’t mention that there were no significant differences between the two groups in two secondary outcomes: The proportion of patients who had minimal or no deficit after 90 days or the proportion of patients whose condition improved within three days.

But those who stuck with therapy had improved as much six months and one year later as those who had arthroscopic surgery right away, researchers found. The therapy was nine sessions on average plus exercises to do at home, which experts say is key to success. Thirty percent of patients assigned to physical therapy wound up having surgery before the six months was up, often because they felt therapy wasn't helping them. Surgery costs about $5,000, compared with $1,000 to $2,000 for a typical course of physical therapy, Katz said. One study participant — Bob O'Keefe, 68, of suburban Boston — was glad to avoid surgery for his meniscus injury three years ago.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This description of benefits observed in the study seems sufficient to us:
“After six months, both groups had similar rates of functional improvement. Pain scores also were similar.
Thirty percent of patients assigned to physical therapy wound up having surgery before the six months was up, often because they felt therapy wasn’t helping them. Yet they ended up the same as those who got surgery right away, as well as the rest of the physical therapy group who stuck with it and averted an operation.”
It would have been interesting to learn how much the patients improved from these injuries, and whether they regained total function or had lingering impairment.

But that cautionary experiment and others didn’t slow the ascent of cortisone (also known as corticosteroids). Why cortisone shots should slow the healing of tennis elbow is a good question. Why then does a cortisone shot, an anti-inflammatory, work in the short term in noninflammatory injuries, providing undeniable if ephemeral pain relief? “It’s not insignificant, but it’s not kidney stones.”

So the question of whether cortisone shots still make sense as a treatment for tendinopathies, especially tennis elbow, depends, Dr. Khan said, on how you choose “to balance short-term pain relief versus the likelihood” of longer-term negative outcomes. In other words, is reducing soreness now worth an increased risk of delayed healing and possible relapse within the year?
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: 
The article might have provided better quantitative estimates of the impact of steroid injections on tennis elbow—in terms of the degree of pain relief. However, the systematic review didn’t report its results in quantitative terms that would be easily understood by the general public. And the journalist did solicit some quantitative estimates of treatment impact from one of the researchers she quoted.

The researchers cautioned that the drug was given in tightly controlled conditions in the presence of two clinically trained monitors and said they do not recommend use of the compound outside of such a research or patient care setting. Most participants had breast, upper digestive, GI, genitourinary or blood cancer, and each had been given a formal psychiatric diagnosis, including an anxiety or depressive disorder. Two monitors aided participants during each session, encouraging them to lie down, wear an eye mask, listen to music through headphones and direct their attention on their inner experience. A few participants reported headaches following the session. The study was funded by grants from the Heffter Research Institute, the RiverStyx Foundation, William Linton, the Betsy Gordon Foundation, the McCormick family, the Fetzer Institute, George Goldsmith, Ekaterina Malievskaia and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (R01DA03889).
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This is a tricky one. The release does tell us what percentage of patients benefited from psilocybin treatment, but does not explicitly quantify the extent of those benefits — which is what this category is designed to address.
However, the release does address benefits in a meaningful way. Here’s how: First, the release makes clear that all of the study participants had received a formal psychiatric diagnosis. That tells us that they were suffering from symptoms of clinical anxiety or depression. Second, the release states that six months after the treatment “about 80 percent of participants continued to show clinically significant decreases in depressed mood and anxiety, with about 60 percent showing symptom remission into the normal range.” That language telling us that about 60 percent were in the normal range is important, because it means they were no longer exhibiting clinical anxiety or depression — and that is sufficiently meaningful to earn the release a satisfactory rating here.
The release would have been better if it had been more clear that this was a cross-over study so all participants received both the low-dose (placebo) and the full therapeutic dose in either the first or second treatment session. In addition, no comparison is given between the low-dose and high-dose therapeutic effects. Instead, the release describes benefits five weeks and six months after the second session, after all participants had received the strong dose.

Because although colonoscopy certainly has its advantages, direct evidence that it’s the best way to prevent deaths from colorectal cancer is not one of them. But there is a menu of options beyond colonoscopies — and they’re not necessarily any better or worse, according to the USPSTF’s recently finalized updated recommendations for screening among average-risk adults. (Wender doesn’t recommend the OTC tests that are available.) There’s variation in the quality of the test, depending on who’s doing it. So why do so many people prefer it to the poop test?
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This story focuses on the available methods of colorectal screening, comparing them based on available data, and points out that the two at-home screening kits are comparably effective to the two invasive procedures: sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy.  One of the at-home tests — the FIT, or fecal immunochemical test — when used, is estimated to prevent 20-23 deaths per thousand people screened, while estimates among those using colonoscopy suggest 22-24 deaths are prevented per thousand people screened.  The story is clear in saying that there has been no head-to-head comparative study pitting the techniques against each other.

— have no problem fitting regular aerobic exercise into their lives. The rest of us want to know how much we have to exercise to see health benefits. In effect, those guidelines say there's no particular benefit from working out harder, other than saving time. That exercise prescription was about the same as in the government guidelines. That intensity was equivalent to brisk walking for the previously sedentary participants, Ross told Shots.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story (complete with table) did a fair job of balancing a digestible message with the caveats of research. It tells us that all the exercise groups lost about 2 inches off their waistline and about 5% to 6% of their bodyweight. Since average people don’t really think about weight loss in terms of “percentage bodyweight,” however, it would have been better for the story to tell us how much participants weighed at the start of the study and how much weight each group lost in pounds.
And while the story suggests that brisker walking gives more benefit by improving glucose tolerance, it expressly cautions that this change may not be meaningful to patients: “It’s unclear whether the 9 percent improvement seen will be enough to cut their risk of heart disease, though.” That’s a useful distinction.

The data, to be presented next month at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, follow last week’s announcement that rival drug Tecentriq, from Roche Holding AG, did not improve survival when used as a second-line treatment for bladder cancer in a trial. The Merck drug is awaiting U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, but Tecentriq was approved by the agency last year, contingent on verification of its clinical benefit. According to the FDA approval letter, the company has until December to submit the full trial data to the agency. Merck announced in October that the second-line bladder cancer study met its main goal and was stopped early. The company is currently enrolling patients in a phase three trial of Keytruda, combined with chemotherapy, as an initial treatment for bladder cancer.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story does quantify the benefits of the intervention, and it does so in absolute terms.
“Merck said data from an open-label Phase 3 trial of 542 advanced bladder cancer patients showed median survival of 10.3 months for Keytruda patients and 7.4 months for patients given second-line chemotherapy. The study’s median follow-up was 18.5 months. After 18 months, 36 percent of Keytruda patients were alive, compared with 20.5 percent of chemotherapy patients, according to research published by ASCO. The study did not detect a difference in the length of time patients lived without their disease getting worse.”
This is sufficient to be satisfactory, but we do think more could be said about if this minimal time difference truly make an impact on patients’ lives, or not. Are the patients healthy enough to make meaningful use of the additional time they receive with treatment?

Using patients' own stem cells to reboot the immune system is a way to halt the advance of the disease. Those deaths are a major concern, one neurologist said, because MS is not in itself life-threatening. A trial that compares stem cell transplants with other therapies to see whether stem cell transplants can become a treatment for patients who have progressive MS is about to start, added Racke, who co-authored an editorial that accompanied the study. Medications can slow the progression of MS and help patients manage symptoms, but there's no cure. Those deaths were related to the transplants, Saccardi said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: One benefit here is progression-free survival. This is basically a yes/no question: did the patient’s MS progress? For 46% of the 239 patients who could be analyzed, the answer was yes. The story tells readers that. It also tells readers that a certain subset of patients was more likely to experience these benefits than others: “younger patients with a relapsing form of MS who were not severely disabled and who hadn’t found relief with other treatments fared better than others over five years.”
However, the story didn’t convey important context for this progression-free survival figure. The reason that the 46% figure is interesting is because of this: Conventional wisdom says patients with aggressive disease would still continue to accumulate disability even if their inflammation is stopped, yet among the group studied among which 75% had progressive disease, 46% had not progressed at the 5-year mark. This means that some patients with progressive disease benefited from stem cell treatment–against conventional wisdom.
As we explain below in our evidence quality criterion, the story should have made it clearer that these findings were not obtained via a randomized controlled trial.

"CMA should be added to first-tier genetic testing for autism spectrum disorders." While both Children's Hospital Boston and Montefiore have offered CMA testing for several years, not all hospitals do, nor does all insurance pay for it, the researchers noted. Between 10 percent and 15 percent of autism cases can be traced to a known genetic cause, the researchers noted. There are a few other genetic tests that can explain another few percentage points of autism cases. But that leaves 85 percent or more families with little explanation for the disorder, Marion said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story adequately presents the efficacy of three different genetic tests in identifying abnormalities that may be associated with autism—karyotype: 2%; fragile X: 0.5%; CMA: 7%.  It would have been helpful to let readers know that not all 933 people included in the study were tested with each of the three tests. According to the results, the CMA tests performed best in females with autistic disorder, but this was not reported.

This trial is the first to use NAC as a pharmacotherapy for PTSD and a broad range of SUDs. Of the veterans enrolled in the trial, 83% completed it, a very high rate for this difficult-to-treat population. The threshold CAPS score for diagnosis of PTSD is 50. "For PTSD, these are some of the best outcomes we have seen in the literature for a medication." The Ralph H. Johnson VA achieved a 5-Star rating according to VA's Strategic Analytics for Improvement and Learning Value (SAIL) model.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The intent of the pilot study was to determine the effect of N-acetylcysteine on PTSD symptoms, cravings and substance use. All three endpoints are described in the news release albeit in relative terms.
We are told that the 8-week trial randomized 35 veterans with PTSD and substance use disorder. Some received N-acetylcysteine and others a placebo, but all of the participants received cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).
The release reported that “Veterans in the NAC-treated group showed a 46% reduction in PTSD symptoms, compared with a 25% reduction in the placebo group on the Clinical-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), which assesses trauma history and symptom severity. The threshold CAPS score for diagnosis of PTSD is 50.”
The release quotes the lead author: “As a group, the NAC-treated veterans were below diagnostic level for PTSD at the end of treatment.” This establishes that the benefit was clinically meaningful. But we prefer to see absolute rather than relative numbers as used here. For example, the actual before and after scores on the PTSD scale would have better illustrated how large the benefit was.

About $60,000 of the cost would be incurred in the first eight weeks, when the drug is given more frequently. That median expenditure now, he said, is $87,000 for a little over a year of treatments. Even to try the drug for the first seven-week cycle to see if it works would cost over $50,000. Mr. Schimmer’s note was entitled “Folotyn Prices High, Reiterate Outperform.” He estimated annual sales of the drug in the United States reaching about $300 million by 2014. “A peripheral T-cell lymphoma patient,” he said, “at first blush will see this therapy as a very good thing.”

Allos, which is still unprofitable, has lost $350 million since its founding in 1992 and failed to win approval of a previous drug.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story adequately quantitifes the benefits of Folotyn, which are not that impressive. The story provides the percentage of patients with reductions in tumor size and the median time that the benefits lasted.

It also doesn't change the very limited treatment choices. The distinction is nothing to worry about for patients and their families. Rather, the goal in creating this category is to see if scientists can define when the disease starts, and track it through biomarker tests, brain imaging, or other yet-to-be-invented tests. The problem is that there aren't yet any reliable tools for earlier diagnosis and treatment. And it does leave one wondering if a lot more worry will be generated by the notion of "preclinical Alzheimer's," when science and medicine can't offer anything to ease those fears.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: 


As mentioned in the section on harms, this story tells readers that it is too soon to use lab tests or brain scans to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease in routine clinical practice, so it is reasonable to defer consideration of potential benefits. This story is appropriately cautious about what benefits early diagnosis might offer, pointing out that receiving a diagnosis when there is no known treatment can cause worry and concern without offering an effective response..

The chemo failure was the latest in a string of personal setbacks. The pills have kept her cancer from growing. And Zelboraf is expensive, though it's free to Anselmo because she's taking it as part of a study. More doctors are taking advantage of the information to treat patients with a targeted approach. There's no way to predict when.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The benefits are described as extending a person’s survival while increasing her quality of life, and a number–1 year, so far–is attached to the treatment. The story also includes this quote from a researcher, which clarifies that the treatment is not expected to work indefinitely: “We all have patients that have been on these drugs for years. But I don’t know, I mean, I think if I was being honest eventually our expectation would be that it would stop working.”
We’ll call this good enough for a Satisfactory rating, but it would help to have more context here. For example, the article could have stated the median survival for the typical adult diagnosed today with glioblastoma, which is about 15 months. It would also be useful to know if there are studies of patients similar to the one profiled here, and what their experience has been. That’s a deficiency we’ll address below in the Evidence section.

The authors acknowledged certain weaknesses in their study. “If you’re testing the same intervention on the same population using the same outcome measures, then meta-analysis is a very good technique,” Dr. Barrett said. “But here every one of those things fails.” One of Dr. Barrett’s papers on echinacea was included in the analysis. Some might not have a large enough sample to find a small but statistically significant effect. “But if adults believe in echinacea, they’re going to get benefits — maybe from placebo — but they’ll get benefits.”

Dr. Coleman, who described himself as “not much of a pill taker,” hedged a bit when asked if he planned to use echinacea himself.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The reporter says the study showed a 58 percent reduction in cold risk, and some unspecified ability to shorten duration. It would be useful to know how likely an average adult or child is to get a cold each year, and how long it lasts. This would also help people understand the possible payoff of taking echinacea–and compare it to the costs.

The surgery she's upset about may be archaic - but it's very common. What's happening now is that the vast majority, about 70 percent, are done the old-fashioned way, with a large surgical incision, lots of pain, and a six-to-eight-week recovery. It's all over in about an hour, and patients are usually home within a day and back to normal within a week or two. LaPook said: "So about five hours ago, you had your uterus out, and how do feel now?" "You would want them to have the least invasive procedure possible."

All study participants followed their treatment plan for one year. The authors said such side effects were typically "mild." "The important thing to keep in mind is that although we diagnose obesity on the basis of a mathematical formula -- a BMI of 30 and up -- the basis for obesity may differ from one individual to another." Psychological factors or lifestyle factors may play a role, he said. Caution is vital when using any drug that has been approved for one condition for another, Sandon said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: We weren’t very happy with the headline and lead of this story, because they make the benefits sound more spectacular than they really were. The story goes on to explain, though, that a larger percentage of the study participants who took the highest does of the drug managed to lose 5 percent of their weight. The story says, “Although nearly 55 percent of those on the higher-dose medication shed 5 percent or more of their pre-study weight, that figure was 34 percent among the lower-dose group and 31 percent among the non-medication participants.”

The team used this opportunity to see how stimulating the brain affects memory. Fried said the findings suggest stimulating the brain just as memories are forming is key. They also saw signs the treatment might have an effect on memory. Dr. Sandra Black, a brain researcher at the University of Toronto who wrote an editorial on the current study, said the findings could have implications for early stage Alzheimer’s disease if tests were developed to identify this process early through imaging or genomics. “Although the current evidence is preliminary, is based on small samples and requires replication, the potential application of deep-brain stimulation in amnestic disorders is enticing,” Black wrote.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story is clear that this test was just a preliminary experiment to see if brain stimulation can have any memory effects in people. It notes that while researchers say it is worth exploring as a potential treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, there is no evidence yet that it provides such benefits.

But working out the unique mutations of each person’s cancer, a time-consuming and complicated process, must first be identified before a vaccine can be developed for them. While they are very small scale—one was on six participants, the other 13—the findings mean researchers can move ahead with the vaccines, which could potentially lead to new, more effective cancer treatments. These vaccines are not necessarily the future of personalized cancer treatment. “The data shows that it is a safe and well tolerated strategy that stimulates relevant anti-tumor immune responses.”

However, the treatment has its downsides: “As the vaccine therapies are designed and generated specifically for each individual there is a lag time from enrollment to commencement of treatment—approximately four months—which may be too long from some patients with advanced cancer. The next step will be to test these personalized vaccines in larger clinical trials to see if they are better than existing treatments, if they improve survival, and what their long-term side effects could be.”
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story says that four of the six patients had no cancer recurrence after 25 months in the first study, and in the second study, eight of the 13 patients remained tumor free after 23 months.
But the studies cited are both phase I clinical trials designed to address safety, not efficacy. Any claims regarding the latter, especially given the limited number of subjects, would be highly speculative. Therefore, the headline is misleading. As noted in the final sentence of the article:
“… The next step will be to test these personalized vaccines in larger clinical trials to see if they are better than existing treatments, if they improve survival, and what their long-term side effects could be.”

It’s designed to stimulate nerves under the skin in the arm and block pain signals from reaching the brain. “All stimulation treatments given so far have been in the head,” said lead study author Dr. David Yarnitsky, an advisory board member for Theranica, the company developing the device. Researchers asked participants to put the device on their upper arm as soon as possible after the start of a migraine and use it for 20 minutes. One shortcoming of the current study is that researchers didn’t examine how long the pain relief lasts beyond two hours, Schoenen said by email. “The percentage of attacks for which TENS is sufficient as sole treatment and allows sustained pain relief remains to be determined,” Schoenen cautioned.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

But a milestone study with results published today in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that clot removal up to 24 hours after stroke led to significantly reduced disability for properly selected patients. There was no difference in mortality or other safety end-points between the two groups. "However, this does not diminish urgency with which patients must be rushed to the ER in the event of a stroke. To select patients for the trial, the researchers used a new approach which used brain imaging and clinical criteria as opposed to just time alone. The trial was sponsored by Stryker Corporation, a medical technology company that manufactures the clot removal devices used in the study.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release does an adequate job of comparing the randomized groups (late clot retrieval versus medication), although it could have offered much more information about how the study defined patients whose damaged brain area was considered “small” enough to qualify for late clot removal.

But new tests for breast cancer risk mutations beyond the well-known BRCA genes would offer actionable information for many women and their doctors, a new study finds. “Does it actually change what you would tell them to do in terms of screening, prevention, or risk management?”

According to the new results, at least for some women, it would change their clinical management, he said. And for many, family testing would be recommended for first-degree relatives, according to the report in JAMA Oncology. Even among all appropriate candidates who are sent for genetic testing, only nine percent will test positive for the BRCA mutations, so an additional four percent who have non-BRCA mutations is a significant number, Ellisen said. “The interpretation of these tests is not a simple color-by-numbers thing.” The vast majority of uncertain genes will be benign, but a misinterpretation could lead a patient to a drastic, unnecessary surgical procedure, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story relays the benefits described in the study for the study population. It notes that 63 (about 4%) out of more than 1,000 women who test negative for BRCA mutations tested positive for non-BRCA mutations. “Of those, the researchers decided that 33 would have been considered for additional screening or prevention measures based on their results.” That description earns to the story a Satisfactory rating. Additional details on what screening and prevention measures might be recommended for which women — and some statement about whether those results are likely to apply to people outside of the study — would have been welcome.

But the risks of nutrient deficiencies are greater with duodenal switch, and include some not seen with gastric bypass, Livingston pointed out. That, he added, makes the risks of duodenal switch seem even less worthwhile. And studies suggest that a sizable percentage of those people will still have a BMI higher than 40 after gastric bypass. In this study, one-quarter of gastric bypass patients still had a BMI that high two years after surgery — versus none of the duodenal switch patients. More extensive monitoring after duodenal switch, Sovik noted, can help detect and manage side effects.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story makes clear that the duodenal switch surgery, in comparison with the bariatric surgery, may give patients greater weight loss in pounds but the value of that reduction is not clear. The additional information from the paper published by Livingston demonstrating no advantage to surgery over medical management was very useful.

The phase II study, for which findings are being presented at this week's American Association for Cancer Research's annual meeting in New Orleans, was designed and led by researchers at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center's Human Papillomavirus-Related (HPV) Cancers Moon Shot Program. The study revealed encouraging correlations between immunologic biomarkers and responses to treatment. "This study demonstrated responses in five of 18 patients treated at MD Anderson, and many of the patients had significant reductions in their tumor size." The study employed the monoclonal antibody nivolumab, one of the drugs represented among the growing arsenal of immunotherapy therapies. "This the first formal clinical trial completed with patients with previously treated metastatic SCCA," said Morris.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The patients’ response was modest and the news release reflects that.

However, the treatment failed to improve secondary goals of the trial, such as heart-pumping efficiency and six-minute walking distance, and Vericel shares fell more than 31 percent by afternoon trading on Monday. “It’s a little baffling that you’re keeping patients alive, but not having any effect on those secondary endpoints,” said Needham & Co analyst Chad Messer. “People were looking for downside and they had one.”

The data compared Vericel’s bone marrow-derived ixmyelocel-T stem cells with placebo in 109 well-treated patients with advanced heart failure who had exhausted medical and device therapies. Vericel last month reported that the study succeeded. “For patients, this is a really hopeful thing.”

Henry, who presented the data at the ACC meeting, stressed the need for larger trials to prove the benefit of ixmyelocel-T

For the treatment, bone marrow is taken from the patient and enhanced over two weeks to increase two types of cells associated with healing.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This article outlined the 37 percent reduction in adverse events due to the stem cell therapy, and explained that the outcome was mainly due to difference in deaths and hospitalizations between the therapy and placebo groups. And, we were very pleased to see the inclusion of absolute numbers related to this–i.e., 7 deaths versus 2 deaths. The story also let us know that the study didn’t show a benefit in secondary endpoints, like heart pumping efficiency and a walk test.
However, we’d have liked to have seen more discussion–ideally from an independent medical experts–on what investors already seem to know, but the reader is left to deduce: Were these results as meaningful as the lead investigator is making them out to be?

Newswise — Johns Hopkins Medicine specialists report they have developed a urine test for the likely emergence of cervical cancer that is highly accurate compared to other tests based on genetic markers derived directly from cervical tissue. The researchers tested the value of these genes as markers using 214 cervical cell samples collected from women undergoing Pap smears at Hospital Dr. Hernan Henriquez Aravena in Chile. The test had an 88.9 percent specificity, meaning the percent of time the test correctly identified someone without the disease. The next step, the researchers report, was to verify that the four-gene test worked using freely circulating DNA from blood and urine, rather than DNA taken directly from cervical tissue. They plan to continue modifying the test to improve the urine sensitivity to that of the cervical tissue samples.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: We rate this a borderline satisfactory.  On the one hand, the release offers numerical summaries of the test’s abilities to both correctly detect cancer (sensitivity) and correctly identify someone who does not have the disease (specificity).  But the text does a relatively dense job of explaining how the investigators reached the urine-test stage, creating a narrative that will require a determined reader and could thwart someone giving the text a more cursory view.

June 2, 2010 (San Francisco) -- A quick spray of a new drug may help men who suffer from premature ejaculation last nearly six times longer, new research suggests. Nonetheless, doctors like Irwin Goldstein, MD, director of San Diego Sexual Medicine at Alvarado Hospital in San Diego, tell WebMD they're excited because this is the first time a drug is being rigorously tested for men with really serious premature ejaculation problems. Premature ejaculation can be devastating for both a man and his partner, triggering anxiety, depression, and relationship problems, says Goldstein, who heard the results presented at the annual meeting of the American Urological Association. A total of 358 of the men gave themselves three quick sprays of PSD502 to the head of the penis five minutes before sex and then wiped it off right before penetration. All used the product for three months, for a total of 23,000 doses.

These patients received EDAS surgery, along with intensive medical management, which included diet and lifestyle changes, blood thinners and other medications to control blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels. Two of the EDAS patients had small wound openings that required additional surgical interventions, but there were no intracranial hemorrhages or other serious adverse events, the researchers reported. "Developing new therapeutic strategies is crucial for ICAD patients." Gonzalez said his team is working with the stroke prevention working group of the National Institutes of Health to develop a proposal for a Phase III randomized clinical trial across multiple institutions to further test the effectiveness of EDAS as compared with intensive medical management. "This clinical trial moves us significantly closer to preventing strokes and death in high-risk populations," said Keith Black, MD, professor and chair of the Department of Neurosurgery.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release provides readers with a numerical comparison of the study’s results, in this case, the prevention of subsequent strokes or death among these patients.  According to the release, in those receiving the EDAS procedure, after one year, 9.6% of patients had a later stroke or died, compared to more than twice that number (21.2%) from a matched control group who didn’t receive this surgery.

That means that if women do take hormones, Bachmann told Reuters Health, it should be the lowest dose and for the shortest possible period of time. And not every woman needs treatment, notes Bachmann, who was not involved in the study. Women with severe or frequent hot flashes or whose hot flashes keep them up at night, should consider treatment, she said. Women typically suffer between 30 and 150 hot flashes a month, said Dr. Rafael Bolanos-Diaz, professor of health economics at San Marcos University in Lima, Peru, who co-authored the study. The study did not look at whether eating soy in food has the same effect on hot flashes as supplements, Bolanos-Diaz said.

But tailoring those guidelines to better fit individuals could prevent many more heart attacks and strokes, say developers of a computer model that makes those calculations. But the new study looked at a more sophisticated way of estimating individual patients’ needs. The problem with the old-fashioned way, he told Reuters Health in an email, is that there are many pieces of information about a patient to consider. According to Eddy, risk calculators like the one in the study could, eventually, help doctors give patients real numbers. This gives them a tool.”

Now the looming questions are how to implement risk calculators in doctors’ practices — and, Owens said, whether that benefits patients’ health in the real world.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Mixed bag here, but we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt.
The benefits from the use of models to better fit treatment recommendations were described as relative improvements rather than absolute benefits.  That’s how the data were described in the abstract of the paper reported on; the predicted numbers were contained within the body of the article. Given the size of the population in question, we can look the other way on the use of relative risk reduction figures.
And, as already noted, the story injected some caution about real world benefits by quoting an independent expert:

When it comes to preventing blood clots after a knee replacement, good old aspirin may be just as effective as newer, more expensive drugs. Based on the experience of 41,537 Michigan patients undergoing knee replacement, the study may further the debate about the routine use of aspirin for clot prevention. The new U-M study suggests patients may be adequately protected if they take aspirin alone from day one. "Patients can get it over the counter for pennies, while the other anticoagulants require monitoring, injections, frequent dose adjustments and are extremely expensive." Although warfarin costs a few dollars for a 30-day supply, its cost approaches that of the other anticoagulants when doctor visits for monitoring are factored in, Hallstrom says.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release lists the percentages of patients who had a blood clot within three months of their knee replacement and emphasized that there was no statistical difference between those who took only aspirin and those who took anticoagulants.  However, the release is remiss in not pointing out that the majority of patients were also treated with pneumatic compression boots.

The uncertain benefit of PSA based screening, combined with the complications associated with treatment, led the USPSTF to conclude in October 2011 that the harms of PSA based screening outweighed the benefits, leading it to recommend against regular screening. This study helped quantify the potential benefits (reduced harms of over diagnosis and overtreatment of low risk disease and disease found in elderly men) and potential harms (missed opportunities to diagnose important cancers in men who may benefit from treatment). By contrast, the number of monthly colon cancer diagnoses remained stable. The study showed that 12 months after the draft guidelines were published diagnoses of new low risk cancers had fallen by 37.9%, and continued to fall more rapidly than other disease risk strata, suggesting that, in this regard, the USPSTF recommendation had its intended effect,. "While some of the effects of this guideline may be beneficial in terms of reducing harms of over diagnosis and overtreatment, the reduction in intermediate and high risk cancer diagnoses raises concern for delayed diagnoses of important cancers associated with inferior cancer outcomes," noted Dr. Barocas.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The apparent benefit of the USPSTF guidelines is the 37.9% reduction in the incidence of low-risk cancers–the over-diagnosed cancers that lead to over-treatment. While this benefit takes second billing to the potential risks of finding fewer higher-risk cancers in the release, there is at lease some discussion of this benefit. The fact that the rate of non-localized cancer did not increase in the study is reassuring–though the follow-up time is actually way too short to know whether trend will be durable.

Once inserted, these long-acting methods remove the risk of patient error when a sexually active woman wishes to avoid pregnancy. Their effectiveness rivals that of sterilization. The risk of an unwanted pregnancy with these other methods was especially high among women under 21, whose rate of unintended pregnancy was nearly double that among older women. In real-world use, these methods are associated with a one-year pregnancy rate of less than one per 100 women. With both implants and IUDs, fertility returns quickly as soon as the devices are removed.

EXPLANATION: The story gives figures on the effectiveness of a variety of contraception methods.
Here is an excerpt:
In a 2012 study of 7,486 women aged 14 to 45, long-acting reversible contraceptives, or LARCs, were shown to be 20 times as effective in preventing pregnancy than the pill, contraceptive patch or vaginal ring. The risk of an unwanted pregnancy with these other methods was especially high among women under 21, whose rate of unintended pregnancy was nearly double that among older women.
Absolute risks are also cited in the report on one-year pregnancy rate with real-world use, which is another strength of the story.

Some believe its only powers are a psychological, placebo effect. That kind of analysis is not the strongest type of research, but the authors took extra steps including examining raw data from the original studies. Their study isn't proof, but it adds to evidence that acupuncture may benefit a range of conditions. The new analysis was published online Monday in Archives of Internal Medicine. The analysis was more rigorous than most research based on pooling previous studies' results, because the authors obtained original data from each study.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The benefits are clearly explained by the story: “The patients’ average baseline pain measured 60; it dropped to 30 on average in those who got acupuncture, 35 in those who got fake acupuncture, and 43 in the usual treatment group.” It would have been helpful to include some comparison here.  For example, how well do NSAID’s work for these conditions?

Others on the study team were from Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Nearly 90 percent have continued to participate in followup. Diet was assessed five times over the 20-year study, allowing the researchers to capture within-person variation in changes in food and nutrient intake over times, Boutot explains. Participants in the study contributed more than 1 million person-years of follow-up, during which 2,041 women experienced early menopause. Boutot and Bertone-Johnson suggest that more prospective studies of their findings are warranted, including studies that compare soy-based and non-soy vegetable proteins.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release does the minimum in conveying the size of the link between diet and early menopause risk, saying women who consumed about 6.5 percent of their daily calories as vegetable protein had a 16 percent lower risk compared with women whose vegetable protein intake was approximately 4 percent of calories.
It further states: “For a woman with a 2,000 calorie per day diet, the authors explain, this is equal to three to four servings of such foods as enriched pasta, breakfast cereal, tofu and nuts, or about 32.5 grams a day.”
The release could have provided better perspective by giving some absolute numbers. With a 10 percent overall risk, a 16 percent reduction would amount to one or two women in every hundred.
It also could have helped readers interpret this quote from researchers: “Though relatively few women in our study consumed very high levels of vegetable protein and our power for analyses of more extreme intake levels was limited, women consuming 9 or more percent of their calories from vegetable protein had a hazard ratio of 0.41 (95 percent confidence interval = 0.19-0.88)” compared to those eating less than 4 percent.
In more understandable terms, women consuming 9 percent or more of the calories from vegetable protein developed early menopause at slightly less than half the rate of those getting less than 4 percent of their calories from vegetable protein.

This is a solution supported by both the America Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics. When it made its recommendation, the Academy of Pediatrics admitted “it is clear that additional research is needed to further document the effects of changes in school start times over time.”

Well, there’s some new (but still incomplete) evidence that later start times do help teens get more sleep. But even if later school start times only improve sleep time, that’s a positive step for public health. There’s some evidence that when students sleep better, they perform better in school as well. And many of the studies were short in duration, comparing sleep duration in snapshots before and after a school made a switch.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story is specific about the average sleep advantages of a later start time among teenage participants in the 18 studies evaluated. For this reason, it rates satisfactory.
However, its discussion of other benefits—including fewer accidents involving teens behind the wheels of cars, mental health indices and actual school performance—is general and, with respect to school performance, more optimistic than the meta-analysis that is the centerpiece of the story.

The new review of the scientific literature found no evidence to alter that assessment for younger men. It did find enough new data to recommend for the first time against screening for older men. The recommendations come at a time when doctors are increasingly questioning whether many tests, drugs and procedures are being overused, unnecessarily driving up health-care costs and exposing patients to the risks of unneeded treatment. But they drew strong criticism from others who are convinced that routine screening is necessary. "If therapy isn't providing meaningful benefit, then how could screening provide benefit?"

Moreover, they warn that while regular screening might help doctors catch cancer earlier, it also comes with a high price tag and added risks to patients. Everybody agrees that CT “does find the early stage lung cancer,” said Dr. Heidi Roberts, a lung cancer researcher from Women’s College Hospital, Toronto who wasn’t involved in the new study. That’s consistent with the findings of the National Lung Screening Trial in the U.S., which in November released data — published online in the New England Journal of Medicine last week — showing that 20 percent fewer middle-aged heavy smokers died of lung cancer when they were screened annually with a CT scan compared to a standard, less detailed chest X-ray. And screening comes with an inherent risk of false-positives — scans which suggest a lung cancer that turns out not to be there. While doctors ruled out cancer, those patients would have undergone further tests, sometimes including biopsies, which can cause complications including infection and bleeding.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story explained: “Five years after their diagnosis, 95 percent of people whose cancers were found through a CT scan were still alive, compared to 73 percent diagnosed with an X-ray and 40 percent of patients who had not been screened and whose symptoms led to discovery their disease.”

The procedures are designed to reduce the bulge of the hernia and make a patch so it doesn't protrude again. The other approach is older and is performed through a 2- to 2.5-inch incision in the groin, Brunt said. The study authors didn't examine a third approach, known as "patch and plug," he said. Almost all the patients were men, and their average age was around 55. The researchers followed up with 75 percent of the patients after an average period of five years.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story quantified how often the hernias recurred in each group and how many patients had chronic pain at follow-up. It noted that “the vast majority of patients do well, regardless of the approach.” This is enough for a satisfactory, though the story could have provided data about how quickly patients were able to return to work with each procedure, and how satisfied they were overall with their results.

CAD is becoming more widespread, said Dr. Joshua Fenton, an associate professor of family and community medicine at the University of California, Davis, and lead study author. Now, with about 75 percent of mammograms adding it, it is even more common, Fenton said. Dr. Daniel Kopans, a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School and senior radiologist in the breast imaging division at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the study provides additional information to doctors and women, but has some limitations. One limitation of the study, he said, is that the researchers cannot say for sure it was the computer-aided detection that made the difference. Other factors could have played a role, such as the radiologists becoming more experienced, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story pointed out that CAD use did increase the likelihood that a woman’s cancer would be diagnosed at an earlier stage.  Readers should also have been told that the study found the increased association between using CAD & an earlier stage of cancer diagnosis may be stronger among women older than 75.
The endorsement of the use of CAD & minimization of its problems by Dr. Daniel Kopans, should have been balanced by comments from another expert not connected with the study.

That could mean that study participants’ hot flashes are just getting better over time, which they sometimes do. So far, Freedman noted, the only hot-flash treatment that has consistently worked in studies is hormone replacement therapy (HRT). And right now, HRT is the only treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for cooling hot flashes. That’s important because it gets at quality of life, according to the researchers, led by Janet S. Carpenter of Indiana University in Indianapolis. And for now, he noted, it’s also not clear why antidepressants would have effects on hot flashes.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Adequate quantitative description of the extent and timing of hot flash reduction for the treatment group.  Describing the response in placebo group as “occurring more slowly and to a lesser degree” provides an adequate sense of the difference.  And story provided quantitative comparison for the outcome of insomnia between placebo and treatment groups.

Canadian researchers note that their finding should be a heads-up to clinicians performing the exam, as well as to patients preparing for it. Given the wide variation in colonoscopy training, the researchers call for standardizing it, including credentialing and re-credentialing. “This is very different from a population undergoing screening.”

Colonoscopy would probably miss a smaller percentage of cancers in such a large population, Lieberman said, because the rate would be lower. Dr. Charles Kahi of the Indiana University School of Medicine, in Indianapolis, noted that the rate found in the new study was a bit higher than previously reported. But he added that the risk factors identified match those in the earlier studies.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story includes a lot of numbers and, for this reason, we’ll give it the benefit of the doubt on this criterion although we would have liked to have seen more numbers in absolute terms. Saying that women had a 30 percent higher chance of having their cancers missed, for example, sounds like cause for a significant health policy overhaul. But what does that mean in hard numbers? How many women were included in this study, for one. And what was the ratio of missed cancers for them? We’re told 1 in 13 overall, but what was the breakdown for men and for women? It also would have been helpful to see the absolute numbers by gastroenterologist versus primary care physician, as the skill set of the person operating the colonscopy also appears to be a factor.

Results from the randomized, single-blind study will be presented today at the American College of Gastroenterology 2016 Annual Scientific Meeting, being held in Las Vegas, NV, by principal investigator, Douglas K. Rex, M.D., Distinguished Professor of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine. "Results from this study show that this innovative investigational product performed as well as or better at colon cleansing than two currently available colonoscopy prep formulations. Moreover, the higher levels of patient satisfaction reported by those who used the lead ECP formulation in the trial suggest this new approach to colonoscopy prep may have a positive impact on patient willingness to undergo this potentially life-saving colorectal cancer screening procedure." "We are very pleased with the efficacy and safety results of this study, which clearly support advancing this product to a Phase 3 trial," said Corey A. Siegel, M.D., M.S., a co-founder of ColonaryConcepts, and Director of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and Associate Professor of Medicine at The Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth. "The ECP approach allows patients to eat solid food bars and drink palatable low-volume beverages, a patient-friendly design that participants in the study clearly favored over conventional preps," comments Dr. Siegel.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release provides a modest amount of information on the results of the study providing both percentages and actual numbers on the success and acceptability of the comparisons. We would have liked to have seen an acknowledgement that the sample size is rather small and while the percentages seem impressive, they may not be clinically or statistically significant.

But a scan found a brain tumor nearly the size of a golf ball. Then Dr. Boockvar ticked off the risks from a second brain operation. Dr. Boockvar said microcatheters should increase the odds of success by delivering a high dose of the drug directly to where it was needed most. “Nobody knows.”

Indeed, the death of the first patient was a reminder that glioblastoma can invade other parts of the brain and the spinal fluid and that the highly localized spray of Avastin might miss deadly seeds of cancer. That means a lot to me.”

Dr. Boockvar said: “Avastin may not be the best drug for this delivery technique.

THURSDAY, July 20, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- A laser treatment can reduce spots in people's vision known as "floaters," a new study finds. The new research was led by Dr. Chirag Shah and Dr. Jeffrey Heier of Ophthalmic Consultants of Boston. The patients in the YAG group also had improvements in several other measures, including general vision and independence, compared with those in the placebo group, the findings showed. A limitation of the study was its small size and short follow-up period, the researchers said. For her part, Goldberg said that although "there was significant improvement in patients' symptoms following treatment, and no significant complication was seen," these findings are early and "it is difficult to predict the long-term safety of this laser procedure."
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story does quantify the benefits of the procedure in question, saying, “Six months after treatment, 54 percent of patients in the YAG group reported significantly greater improvement in floater-related visual disturbances, compared with only 9 percent of those in the placebo group.”  It goes on saying, “Nineteen patients (53 percent) in the YAG group reported significantly or completely improved symptoms, compared with none of the patients in the placebo group.”

In contrast to acupuncture, this technique can be used as a form of self-care and is suitable for use at home. A total of 221 participants were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups, both of which received a study app and short introduction. Acupressure-based features - with instructions on how to administer self-acupressure shortly before and during menstruation - were only made available to the intervention group. The app helped participants to apply simple self-acupressure techniques to three different acupressure points. "We were surprised to see that, after six months, two thirds of participants continued to use self-acupressure.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release put the benefits experienced by the treatment and control groups in numerical context:
“After three months, 37 percent of participants in the acupressure group reported a 50 percent reduction in pain intensity. After six months, this proportion had increased to more than half of the women in this group (58 percent). Only 25 percent of women in the control group reported a similar reduction in pain intensity at both the 3-month and 6-month marks. Women in the acupressure group also used less pain medication than women in the control group and reported lower levels of pain overall.”

Pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children worldwide, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Investigators conducted a randomized controlled trial in the pediatric Emergency Department at The Mount Sinai Hospital comparing lung ultrasound to chest X-ray in 191 children from birth to 21 years of age. The research team was led by James Tsung, MD, MPH, Associate Professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine and Department of Pediatrics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and former clinical fellow Brittany Pardue Jones, MD, who's currently Assistant Professor in the Department of Pediatrics at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Further research is needed to investigate the impact of lung ultrasound on antibiotic use and stewardship.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release clearly stated that chest ultrasounds effectively diagnosed study patients who had pneumonia as well as chest X-rays.  There were 38.8 percent fewer chest X-rays required for a pneumonia diagnosis in the investigational arm of the study compared to the control group of the study. The study also showed that stays in the emergency department by ultrasound-only patients were almost a half-hour shorter than those of the control group.
We offer a word of caution, however. The release didn’t explain how the pneumonia cases were actually diagnosed so we cannot determine if the ultrasound really was accurate and effectively diagnosed study patients who had pneumonia.

DRCR.net investigators enrolled 660 people with DME at 89 clinical trial sites across the United States. At enrollment, about half the participants had 20/32 to 20/40 vision. Results of the study were published online today in Ophthalmology, the journal of the American Academy of Ophthalmology. The DRCR.net is dedicated to facilitating multicenter clinical research of diabetic eye disease. Of these, about 750,000 have DME.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release states the general benefits over time for each group assigned to one of three drugs and gives some specifics about the improvements seen.
Among participants with 20/50 or worse vision at the trial’s start, visual acuity on average improved substantially in all three groups. At two years, Eylea participants were able to read about 3.5 additional lines on an eye chart; Lucentis participants were able to read about three additional lines, and Avastin participants improved about 2.5 lines.
The release also does a pretty good job of quantifying how many people in each group needed laser surgery.
By two years, 41 percent of participants in the Eylea group received laser treatment to treat their macular edema, compared with 64 percent of participants in the Avastin group and 52 percent in the Lucentis group.

The study speaks both to the benefits of bariatric surgery and to the tremendous toll obesity takes on health. "So I could never say that effect is definitive, but it is suggestive, given that we know already the incredibly strong link between endometrial cancer and obesity." Modesitt, of the UVA's Division of Gynecologic Oncology in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, was most surprised by the dramatic changes seen in the patients' metabolic profiles derived from the gut microbiome, the population of microorganisms living inside us. Who knows what role the gut bacteria play in promoting obesity, but metabolic parameter/markers of the bacteria definitely changed after [study participants] lost weight." Almost everybody agrees adding exercise would be wonderful and improve health on many levels.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This release does something wonderful. It sums up the main findings from the study – including a quantification of some benefits – at the very top of the release. What would have made the quantification even better would have been breaking down the raw numbers. How many women lost how much weight? Not just the averages. And when the release talks about improvements in other outcomes such as physical quality of life and insulin levels, what sort of changes are we talking about? Were they just statistically significant or would they really be meaningful to these patients in their daily lives?
Another area of concern is the headline, which suggests that bariatric surgery offers “dramatic benefits” for “preventing cancer.” This seems to be referring to a reduction in precancerous changes in a small number of women and some changes in these women’s gut bacteria. We would be hard-pressed to characterize those changes as a “dramatic” cancer-prevention benefit. In fact, the study offered no proof that the surgery prevented any cancers at all. We’ll address this issue down below under “Unjustifiable Language.”

Cognitive behavioural therapy could help many people with a dental phobia overcome their fear of visiting the dentist and enable them to receive dental treatment without the need to be sedated, according to a new study by King's College London. Nearly all patients (94%) reported a knock-on effect from problems with their teeth, mouth or gums on their daily living and quality of life. Individuals were referred to support services via the care of their GP and for suicide risk, immediate action was taken based on local service guidelines. The average number of CBT appointments required before a patient received dental treatment without sedation was five. Some of the patients referred to us were found to be experiencing additional psychological difficulties, and needed further referral and management.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The benefit here is the ability of a patient to receive dental care without sedation — which carries its own costs and health risks. The release states that 79% of patients who participated in the study “went on to have dental treatment without the need for sedation.” Only 6% of patients had treatment under sedation. The remaining 15% either dropped out of CBT or were removed from the study because they were identified as having other psychological problems that required treatment. Of the patients who completed the CBT (i.e., didn’t drop out and weren’t removed from the study), 93% went on to have dental treatment without sedation.

Also missing, Nelson said, are randomized studies that would indicate how often patients should be screened. A preliminary report in July packed a surprise: No direct evidence was found that testing patients for low bone density helped avoid broken bones. Her task force recommended that an international registry be created for tracking such cases to help researchers better pinpoint which patients might be at risk. If they pull them off the medications because of the possible risk of serious side effects with longer-term use, there is little else to prescribe. For Dr. Douglas C. Bauer, a professor at the University of California-San Francisco and a researcher who also treats many osteoporosis patients, the hardest decision is when to stop the drugs in patients who still have low bone density after five years of treatment but are not especially frail.

An outside expert, however, said the study is too limited in size and scope to allow conclusions as to whether meditation really reduces risk of death or disease. The new study focused on Transcendental Meditation. He added, however, that meditation would work as well among whites and other populations. But a cardiology expert said that although the study adds to evidence supporting meditation, it doesn't prove a cause-and-effect relationship between the practice and better health outcomes. Even though the findings in this study were statistically significant, the new study was too small to be conclusive, Fonarow said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story tells us that 20 people in the medication group had a heart attack or stroke or died, compared with 32 in the health education group. It also provides the number of subjects who participated in the study (201).  We would have liked to have seen both the numerator and denominator provided for completeness (20/99 in the TM  group vs. 32/102 in the HE group for example). This is still preferable to simply telling readers that there was a “48% reduction” in risk.

In fact, they're experiencing profound exhaustion that isn't relieved with sleep, flu-like symptoms, muscle pain, "brain fog" and various other physical symptoms, all of which characteristically worsen with even minor exertion. The link to gradation in severity, rather than simply seeking a positive versus negative result, represents a new approach to the search for biological markers for the illness. This is significant because symptoms in these patients and findings from other studies also suggest that chronic inflammation plays a major role in the illness. So why do routine lab tests that doctors order often come back negative or not informative in ME/CFS patients? What's more, the findings also point to possible treatment with immune-modifying or anti-inflammatory therapy.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The most relevant text here is: “Out of 51 cytokines investigated via sophisticated fluorescence-based testing, only two of the cytokines differed, in their total concentrations, between the ME/CFS and control groups. But, levels of 17 of the cytokines varied dramatically between the patients with mild versus severe ME/CFS symptoms. Of those 17 cytokines, 13 were types that promote inflammation.”
The issue is, though, what does this actually mean in terms of diagnosing a patient as having ME-CFS and treating them with a potentially risky drug such as rituximab that is mentioned in this piece. While the story could have done a better job on that point, we think the discussion here is sufficient for a satisfactory grade. We’ll address the broader implications and the story’s shortcomings below under the evidence quality criterion.

The new study, in the Annals of Surgery, doesn’t settle that question. “Overall, this study shows benefit from laparoscopy on every aspect, including cost,” he told Reuters Health. Yet again, the patients who had laparoscopy fared much better than those who had conventional surgery. “In healthy individuals, the death rate is very (small) for all groups of patients. “Substantial savings could be seen if open surgery is done in a laparoscopic fashion.”

But he acknowledged that the study has major limitations.

Physicians will "be able to use a simple blood test and then know that this woman is at increased risk or reduced risk of a preterm birth," said Graves, whose laboratory performed the research in the study. The test wasn't as effective at 24 weeks of gestation. The test may cost $150 to $250, Graves said. Even if the test is found to indicate that a birth will be premature, physicians would have limited options. Wu said the study results are promising, but more research is needed to confirm that the test is reliable.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Mixed bag here.  We’ll give it a somewhat satisfactory grade. Here’s why.
The story stated that the test “predicted 80 percent to 90 percent of the premature births at 28 weeks of gestation. The false positive rate — referring to tests that wrongly indicated premature birth — was 20 percent. The test wasn’t as effective at 24 weeks of gestation.”  It didn’t give any numbers to back up the experience at 24 weeks.
But we would have appreciated somewhere a note that it is the very early preterm births that are the most crucial to predict. The story fixates on 28 week testing. What’s really needed are means to identify and study the 23 to 28 weekers. The story also doesn’t acknowledge that we have no effective interventions to stop preterm birth and somewhat incorrectly explains how betamethasone for lung maturity works.
It also had an independent expert’s quote: “If you are going to be alarming a patient by saying that she may have premature delivery, you want to make sure that’s truly the case.”  That’s a very important contribution to the story.

Biomarkers of inflammation were measured at the beginning and end of the study. While IL-6 has normal functions in the body, elevated levels are associated with an increased risk of developing certain cancers and diabetes and may be implicated as a cause of depression, Duggan said. "We were quite surprised to see that vitamin D had an effect on an inflammation biomarker only among women who lost at least 5 percent of their baseline weight," Duggan said. Vitamin D receptors are found in more than 30 cell types and the research focus around this nutrient recently has shifted from bone health to vitamin D's effect on cancer, cardiovascular health and weight loss, among other health issues. Duggan encourages women to speak to their health care providers about measuring their levels of vitamin D to determine the most appropriate dosage.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release does a good job of comparing data and providing explanations for the measurements used. We’ll award a Satisfactory for that precision, but as noted below under “Evidence,” there was no explicit caution regarding the fact that measurements of interleukin-6 (IL-6) are only surrogates for the effects of weight loss and vitamin D on clinical outcomes related to inflammation (e.g. cancer diagnoses). IL-6 levels dropped in both the placebo and vitamin D arms, and it’s not clear whether the statistically significant additional decline in IL-6 observed in the vitamin D group is clinically important.

A vaccine against the Zika virus could one day be used to fight the deadly brain cancer that claimed the life of Senator John McCain, according to a study in mice. Researchers used a vaccine against the mosquito-borne virus to kill human glioblastoma brain cells which had been implanted into rodents. Currently, most people diagnosed with the condition die within two years. That’s because glioblastoma stem cells have similar properties to neural stem cells. The animals dosed only with the stem cells developed tumors.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: We learn from this story that mice with the attenuated Zika virus lived 50 days, in comparison to mice in the control group that lived 30 days. We aren’t given specific numbers on how much tumor development was delayed. We’ll award a satisfactory grade since the story did at least quantify the overall survival difference between the two groups (something rarely reported on in coverage of rodent studies). However, given that this was a study in mice, we were looking for strong cautions that we simply have no evidence if this will work in humans, which is true of all animal studies on potential human treatments. That’s a deficit we’ll address below under the Evidence criterion.

The test represents a first in the rapidly developing field of “liquid biopsies,” which use gene sequencing technology to screen blood samples for trace amounts of DNA associated with different cancers. But the move by Pathway, a privately owned maker of genetic tests ranging from cancer risk and heart health to drug response, underscores a growing debate over how much genetic information should be made available to healthy people if it is not yet clear how it can improve their health. Several oncology experts said liquid biopsy tests like Pathway’s, while exciting, still require large clinical studies proving they help people beat cancer through early detection. The tests must be ordered by a doctor, based on a patient’s risk profile. A positive test will require additional checks to find where the cancer is growing.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story cites a company figure stating that the test “is more than 99 percent accurate in detecting mutations in blood samples that contain at least nine copies of a tested mutation.”
It then knocks down that figure with a quote from a researcher who says the statistic represents the test’s “technical ability to detect DNA in the blood.” It goes on to state that a large clinical trial would be needed to determine the test’s true accuracy, including false positive and false negative results. But such a study hasn’t yet been done.

Newswise — Chicago – Chronic back and leg pain sufferers in search of better pain relief options may have a new choice. Given the prevalence of chronic pain, high frequency SCS is an exciting advance for our patients.”



SCS is an increasingly common therapy that delivers electric pulses to the spinal cord, through a small device implanted under the skin, for difficult to treat chronic pain in the trunk and limbs. Identifying a new intervention that does not rely on paresthesia to mask pain is novel to SCS and has the potential to improve pain relief and quality of life for these complex patients. None of the patients in the HF10 therapy group experienced paresthesia. HF10 therapy remained more effective than traditional SCS over the 12 month study period.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release does a good job of putting some numbers on the potential benefits. For example, the release gives us the absolute number of pain patients in each group who experienced a 50% or greater reduction in symptoms.
“At three months, 85 percent of back pain and 83 percent of leg pain patients in the HF10 therapy group experienced a 50 percent reduction in pain or greater. Conversely, only 44 percent of back pain and 56 percent of leg pain patients in the traditional SCS group experienced a 50 percent reduction in pain.”
Of course, it’s worth noting that these are the findings after 3 months, and the study lasted for 12 months. However, it doesn’t look like the benefits were diminished too greatly with longer-term use of the device, so we’ll award a Satisfactory grade — even though it would have been preferable to also see the findings after a full year of use.

The report, scheduled for presentation this week at the Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium in San Francisco, adds more weight to suspicions that vitamin D might be a valuable cancer-fighting supplement. However, colon cancer patients shouldn't try to boost vitamin D levels beyond the normal range, one expert said. "These findings are interesting, and show that vitamin D may have a role in improving outcomes in cancer care." But vitamin D also influences cellular function in ways that could be beneficial in treating cancer, Ng said. The patients were divided into five groups based on vitamin D levels, ranging from low to high.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story offers a good explanation of the survival benefit observed in the study and puts it in appropriate context. It notes that patients in the highest vitamin D category lived an average of average of 32.6 months, compared with 24.5 months for those in the lowest category. That being said, it would be hard for any reader to clearly understand from this story that the vitamin D levels among the better-surviving patients were still well within the normal range. Even those patients in the “higher” level category averaged just  27.5 nonograms/mililliter on a clinical spectrum that considers 25 to 80 optimal and safe.

“These results pave the way for Amphora’s disruption of the contraception market as a novel, highly effective, non-hormonal and woman-controlled method that finally answers women’s long-awaited desire to avoid hormones,” Roth Capital Partners analyst Yasmeen Rahimi said. Amphora was found to have an 86 percent efficacy rate in avoiding pregnancies and no serious side-effects were observed in the study, which evaluated about 1,400 healthy women belonging to the age group 18-35 years, Evofem said. The rate stands at about 91 percent for oral pills and intrauterine devices, according to brokerage Roth Capital Partners. “Our research and current understanding of women suggests the time is now for there to be a new non-hormonal category in contraception,” Chief Executive Saundra Pelletier said on a conference call with analysts. The company plans to resubmit the marketing application for Amphora in the second quarter next year and if approved, plans to launch the product in January 2020.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story briefly describes a study in 1,400 young women, from which researchers calculated that the gel had an 86% efficacy rate — a common measure of birth control efficacy. However, it could have explained that better: In the contraceptive research world, this generally means that the failure rate is 14 pregnancies per 100 women in a year. But researchers only studied the gel for seven menstrual cycles.
The story compares this pregnancy rate to a couple of of other forms of birth control, which is good, but it’s worth pointing out that those failure rates have far more evidence behind them. The efficacy rate for this new product is based on just one industry study.
Also, the story makes a vague reference that the gel may kill “certain viral and bacterial pathogens that can cause sexually transmitted diseases.” Only at the end of the story do we find out that researchers have no data yet for this claim.

A viable vaccine to prevent and/or treat leprosy is the next step in the effort to bring this disease to an end. Based on data generated in preclinical studies, the vaccine candidate, called LepVax, has progressed to Phase I clinical testing in the United States, the first stage of safety testing in human volunteers. This vaccine represents a unique accomplishment, requiring the most advanced technologies in molecular biology and immunology, and American Leprosy Missions has been there from the beginning." The vaccine candidate will serve as part of an overall strategy to end leprosy, which will require detection, prevention and treatment. Reed, along with scientists from a variety of scientific organizations recently published "Innovative tools and approaches to end the transmission of Mycobacterium leprae" in , outlining what is needed to achieve this goal.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release does note that the study will be focused on safety and immune system response which earns a minimal Satisfactory rating for clearly establishing the purpose of a phase 1 study. 
There is currently no information on how effective this vaccine is in human subjects. There is also no mention of how this vaccine weakens the mycobacterial load in those already exposed.

IRVINE, Calif., May 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Proove® Biosciences, Inc. announces a new study validating the accuracy of precision medicine technology to predict prescription opioid abuse. This study shows that analyzing genetics with lifestyle and behavioral variables in a predictive algorithm can accurately stratify patient risk." Study author, Gregory A. Smith, M.D, former Director of Pain Management at Harbor UCLA, explains, "Having used this technology for 6 years, this data provides further evidence that clinicians can use Proove Opioid Risk® for ruling out patients unlikely to exhibit aberrant behaviors, and identifying high-risk patients for alternative therapies." Peer-reviewed clinical studies show that the Proove Opioid Risk® profile accurately identifies patient risk for opioid abuse. Proove®'s medical advisory board is led by those NIH-funded researchers and the company has licensed some of its technology from leading academic centers, such as the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the University of Utah, and other institutions.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release states that the algorithm correctly identified patients with a history of opioid misuse nearly 97 percent of the time, rarely mis-classifying the healthy controls as being at high or even moderate risk of opioid misuse. One question that remains unanswered in the release is whether the POR test would successfully distinguish people with opioid use disorder from individuals who have used opioids without becoming addicted.

The study also revealed parents who had the condition but didn’t know it, and had passed it on to their children. Ninety percent of them started taking preventive medicines after finding out. Statins aren’t recommended until around age 10, but certain dietary supplements such as plant sterols and stanols could help younger kids, Urbina said. The study was led by Dr. David Wald at Queen Mary University of London. But many parents balk at the idea of testing children for a disorder associated with middle age, experts say.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story quantified the findings this way: “For every 1,000 people screened in the study, four children and four parents were identified as being at risk for early heart disease. That’s nearly twice as many as most studies in the past have suggested.” That lets us know how many more people might get identified if screening was widened, but readers should also be informed that it isn’t clear if this ultimately reduces cardiac deaths.

The surgical group was also much less likely to give birth to larger-than-normal babies. Additionally, the surgical group experienced a slight bump in the rate of stillbirths, the study found. The investigators didn't examine what might have caused smaller babies among bariatric surgery recipients, or higher stillbirths. But Caughey, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new research, said women considering weight-loss surgery should make the decision based on the long-term health benefits of the procedure -- not on potential pregnancy-related benefits. Caughey agreed with the researchers that any pregnancy occurring after weight-loss surgery merits a higher level of monitoring and should be considered high-risk.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The article generally does a good job of describing the benefits. In one instance, it mentions the absolute difference in outcomes between the intervention and control group for gestational diabetes. (“Only 2 percent of women who had weight-loss surgery developed gestational diabetes, compared to 7 percent of the other group, the researchers said.”). That’s very useful. But we’re concerned that the story never explains why readers should be worried about a “larger than normal” baby. It sounds, at most, mildly worrisome, and some readers might even hope for a baby that’s “larger than normal.” But a baby that’s significantly larger than normal can increase risks for a variety of delivery complications such as difficult labor and need for cesarean delivery, vaginal tearing, and bleeding after delivery. Although we wish the story had explained this, we think its overall treatment of benefits merits a satisfactory rating.

He found that not only did the practice activate different parts of the brain, it also seemed to impact the body in ways that matter for health. The results of one of those studies are out Tuesday in JAMA. The second group participated in cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) to change pain-related thoughts and behaviors during eight weekly two-hour group sessions. The results for both techniques were very positive. In an editorial, Madhav Goyal and Jennifer A. Haythornthwaite of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine said that the mechanisms for why meditation might work on back pain is still a mystery but that this question is merely "academic" for many clinicians and their patients who need immediate relief.

There is thus an important, but currently unmet, need for additional therapies to effectively control hypertension." The procedure is safe as well as effective, the study authors said. If it is applicable, it could mean patients need not take blood-pressure drugs, Esler suggested. Even with this technique, people will most likely still have to take blood-pressure medications, Singh said. Singh also noted that although this procedure is used in other countries it is not yet approved in the United States.

QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release makes several statements about benefits to an entire population, not necessarily the benefits to an individual patient. The release provides a useful number-needed-to-treat explanation.
“For every 1,000 patients treated with Entresto vs. enalapril, potentially 59.7 HF hospital admissions could be averted per each year alive in the model.3 In addition, Entresto increased life expectancy at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio consistent with other high-value widely accepted cardiovascular interventions such as implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and cholesterol-lowering statins before they became generic.3″
One weakness in describing the benefits was the omission in the release (but not in the published study) of actual figures or percentages to back up the cost-effectiveness claim.

Ketamine has a very different mechanism of action than standard treatments." However, they note that the study was limited by its small sample size, so future research will be needed to confirm these results. The study serves to point out the need for further, rigorous, study designed to answer the many questions that remain about ketamine for TRD, such as optimal dosing and route of administration, dosing interval and treatment length, and long-term effects—just to name a few." James Stone, a clinical senior lecturer from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King's College London, who was not involved in the study, told Newsweek that there is "a lot of potential for the use of ketamine as a second or third line antidepressant where other treatments have failed." "Although ketamine is potentially a huge breakthrough in the treatment of depression, we still don’t know about the long-term safety, or about how to keep people well from depression without requiring regular ketamine dosing," Stone added.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story did the bare minimum, pointing to “an average decrease of 42 percent” in criteria contained in a depression assessment tool. It also stated that five of the 13 participants “met the criteria for response and remission” and three of those were still in remission after six weeks, with the remaining two relapsed within two weeks.
The story would have served readers better by emphasizing those figures higher up and spelling out what “response and remission” mean in terms of a patient’s symptoms.

In contrast, the historical OS rate with standard of care concurrent chemotherapy and traditional radiation was 16 months at the time when the study was designed. Toxic effects of treatment in both the acute and late settings also were analyzed. Of note, said Chang, no patients developed the most severe, or grade five, toxicities, as seen in patients who receive standard of care. While the study's survival, recurrence rates and toxic effects are still favorable when compared to rates associated with the most advanced traditional photon radiation therapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), technology to diagnose and stage the disease, as well all treatment modalities have significantly improved. Also, delivery of both the conventional intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and proton therapy (IMPT), have improved, thereby reducing side effects for both treatment modalities."
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release spells out the different measurements in both relative and absolute terms about the benefits of the therapy, but it is full of so much medical jargon that journalists and others would have a hard time following. The clearest statement is that they found “an overall survival (OS) of 26.5 months. In contrast, the historical OS rate with standard of care concurrent chemotherapy and traditional radiation was 16 months at the time when the study was designed.” Contrast that with, “In sum, 39 patients experienced a relapse, with distant sites representing 62 percent of all recurrences.” What is a distant site? Were these people living on islands? What they mean is that in 62 percent of the cases where cancer came back, it was where the cancer had spread to other parts of the body. But it’s unclear what this means in relation to the overall purpose of the study.  The primary outcome reported is overall survival: 29 percent were alive at 5 years, meaning  71 percent had died. As discussed elsewhere, the key issue is, compared to what?

Researchers report these findings in the journal Archives of General Psychiatry. Knowing which patient with mild cognitive impairment patients may go on to develop Alzheimer's is vital information for researchers, who are looking for treatments for the fatal brain disease. The current thinking is that interventions will be most effective when given to a patient as early as possible, Brickman said. That suggests that a five-year follow-up period is not long enough to determine how well biomarkers can predict which patients will develop Alzheimer's disease, researchers say. But it's too early to use this as a diagnostic tool in clinical settings, says Brickman.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: We’ll give the story a satisfactory grade for providing context for the projected benefits of the test:
“A new study suggests that biomarkers found in cerebrospinal fluid (fluid that surrounds the spinal cord and brain and acts as a protective cushion) could predict who would develop Alzheimer’s disease 90% of the time among patients with mild cognitive impairment, a condition characterized by measurable memory problems.

The FDA reviewed and authorized for marketing the Banyan Brain Trauma Indicator in fewer than 6 months as part of its Breakthrough Devices Program. Availability of a blood test for concussion will help health care professionals determine the need for a CT scan in patients suspected of having mTBI and help prevent unnecessary neuroimaging and associated radiation exposure to patients. “Helping to deliver innovative testing technologies that minimize health impacts to patients while still providing accurate and reliable results to inform appropriate evaluation and treatment is an FDA priority. “A blood-testing option for the evaluation of mTBI/concussion not only provides health care professionals with a new tool, but also sets the stage for a more modernized standard of care for testing of suspected cases. These findings indicate that the test can reliably predict the absence of intracranial lesions and that health care professionals can incorporate this tool into the standard of care for patients to rule out the need for a CT scan in at least one-third of patients who are suspected of having mTBI.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release refers to a multi-center prospective study of 1,947 blood samples, but does not tell us the citation for publication of that study. The blood sample tests were able to “predict the presence of intracranial lesions on a CT scan 97.5 percent of the time and those who did not have intracranial lesions on a CT scan 99.6 percent of the time. These findings indicate that the test can reliably predict the absence of intracranial lesions.”
The release claims that the blood testing will rule out the need for a CT scan in “at least one-third of patients who are suspected of having mTBI.” This is the main purported benefit, along with reducing costs.

That’s a major achievement in a group whose cancer is emboldened by every treatment failure. Now she was in a much more dangerous category: children whose leukemia no longer responds to chemo. But the leukemia was still producing another common protein, called CD22, and that offered an opportunity. As it happened, Fry, head of the blood-cancer section in NCI’s pediatric oncology branch, had already launched the world’s first trial using CAR T-cell therapy to focus on CD22. It seemed an equally promising target that could broaden the therapy’s impact, researchers thought.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story provides a broad overview of multiple trials, rather than spending a lot of time on any specific study. That can be dicey, given variability between trial results. However, the story still manages to offer some real numbers — and grounds the benefits with qualifiers. For example, in referring to multiple trials in both adults and children, the story says that some trials have reported “remission rates of up to 90 percent.” The story then notes that “rates in other trials are considerably lower, and many patients relapse.”
Elsewhere, the story quotes one researcher as saying “The treatment is great about getting people into remission but not at keeping everyone in remission.” The story then offers some information on one study by the same researcher, stating “39 of 42 patients went into complete remission. By a year, about half had relapsed.” That combination of real numbers, with a sobering qualifier, is important.
What we would have liked to have seen: Along with remission discussion, some extra assessment of what the research shows on overall survival rates, and how long people on the drug can be expected to live.

Smokers who took the pill, sold as Chantix in the U.S. and Champix elsewhere, were much more likely to quit after cutting back on cigarettes than smokers who didn’t use the drug, the study found. “This is very strong support for changing clinical practice to include gradual reduction aided by medication.”

Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To see if Chantix, which is manufactured by Pfizer, could help smokers quit without going cold turkey, Ebbert and colleagues randomly assigned 1,510 people at 61 centers in 10 countries to receive either the drug or a placebo for 24 weeks. They asked study participants to reduce cigarette use by 50 percent by the fourth week, and by 75 percent by the eight week, with the goal of quitting by week 12. Other treatments, such as nicotine patches and gum, can also help some smokers cut back gradually, she said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: There are two ways to think about benefits in a story like this one: the benefit of quitting smoking and the benefit of using the smoking cessation drug. The story thoroughly addresses both. First, the story tells readers exactly how much more likely people were to quit smoking when using the drug (compared to those using a placebo) — and that they were able to stay smoke-free for up to a year. Second, the story offers some specifics on how quitting smoking reduces health risks. For example, the story states: “Ten years after quitting [smoking], the risk of lung cancer drops by half, according to the CDC.”
Another area where the story excelled is in characterizing the motivation level of the study participants. It noted that they wanted to quit and were willing to start reducing their cigarette consumption — they just couldn’t “go cold turkey.” The competing Times piece wasn’t as clear on that point.

Ideally, this assessment should be administered and evaluated by a medical professional. Eye tests can tell evaluators a great deal about how well someone’s brain is working. But it had not been evaluated for use in young athletes. The pace-along-the-tape test was also relatively accurate. The upshot, Dr. Galetta believes, is that parents and coaches “should absolutely consider” familiarizing themselves with the King-Devick test and administering it to young athletes before the season starts, then having those baseline numbers and the test itself handy on the sidelines.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story provides a good discussion of how the vision test compared in reliability with the standard testing protocol including a cognitive test and a balance test. The tests were applied to 243 young (age 5-18) and 89 college athletes playing a season of hockey or lacrosse.
Among the 12 students that sustained head injuries, the researchers found the King-Devick test correctly assessed concussion in 75 percent of the injured players and misidentified one. In comparison, the standard testing protocol accurately assessed only two of the concussed athletes and missed 10. The standard tests also misidentified three athletes as having sustained a concussion, according to the study. The study authors concluded that the vision test was the more sensitive, accurate test.

The experimental therapy eliminated the need for insulin injections for months or even years in 14 of 15 patients who were recently diagnosed with the disease. The study suggests a new avenue for treating the intractable disease, in which the immune system destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. The strategy is similar to an approach showing some success in treating other immune-system disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and multiple sclerosis. But other doctors said that even if the benefits of the therapy are temporary, the research provides valuable insight into the mechanism behind the disease. Even if patients continue to require insulin shots, the treatment should be considered a success if it halts the destruction of beta cells, said Dr. Jay Skyler, with the Diabetes Research Institute at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.

Published online by the New England Journal of Medicine and being presented this week at a Presidential session of the European Cancer Congress (ECC), the findings of CheckMate-025 provide definitive evidence that an immune checkpoint inhibitor is a valid treatment strategy for patients with advanced RCC, and supports a paradigm change in the standard of care treatment, according to the authors. CheckMate-025 is an example of how investigators are examining approved immunotherapy drugs to determine potential impact on other tumor types. In the randomized phase III clinical trial, patients whose disease progressed on antiangiogenic therapies were treated with either nivolumab or everolimus. The Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of medicines with early signals of clinical benefit in serious diseases to help ensure patients have access to new therapies as soon as possible. "The overall survival benefit shown in this study sets a new benchmark for therapeutic strategies for advanced RCC patients in need of a second-line therapy."
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The primary outcome measure for the study was median survival.  The news release notes, “In the randomized phase III clinical trial, patients whose disease progressed on antiangiogenic therapies were treated with either nivolumab or everolimus. Median overall survival was 5.4 months longer with nivolumab (25 months) compared with everolimus (19.6 months).” We are also told, “More than 12 months later, 31% and 27% of patients treated with nivolumab and everolimus, respectively, continued to show a response.”
If one is discerning, it becomes clear that this new treatment buys a patient about 5 months of survival time. That’s certainly valuable time, but it’s debatable whether that amounts to the kind of benefit patients associate with the term “breakthrough.”

The work, described as a tour de force and a breakthrough by one leading expert, suggests that ageing across the body is controlled by stem cells that are found in the hypothalamus region of the brain in youth, but which steadily die off until they are almost completely absent in middle age. The animals died months earlier than healthy control animals. Next, the scientists looked at what happened when aged mice received injections of fresh neural stem cells. Having proved that it was neural stem cells that were important for ageing, the scientists ran further tests to work out what the cells were doing. The next step is to create human neural stem cells in the lab for testing.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

The meta-analysis appears as an online advance in Nutrition Reviews. We hope to empower patients with new research about the long-term cardiovascular health benefits of a vegetarian diet, which include a reduced risk of a heart attack, stroke, and premature death." More than 700 people have enrolled to learn how to lose weight, eliminate the need for medications to treat type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and elevated cholesterol, and to simply feel better. What I've found is that if you want your patients to make significant health changes, you have to make them yourself. For clinicians concerned about spending extra time in and outside of the exam room, the study authors encourage time-strapped health care providers to refer patients to registered dietitians who can help with the transition to a plant-based vegetarian diet.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: This release clearly states the benefits of a plant-based vegetarian diet for cholesterol. In clinical trials, a plant-based diet was reported to lower total, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by 12.5 mg/dL, 3.4 mg/dL, and 12.2 mg/dL respectively. In observational studies, a plant-based diet was associated with reductions in total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol levels of 29.2 mg/dL, 3.6 mg/dL, and 22.9 mg/dL respectively. The release also included information on the lack of association between dietary patterns and blood triglyceride (a type of fat) levels — an important mention of results that were not statistically significant.
However, the case description based on the physician’s subjective personal experience was over the top and detracted from the more balanced aspects of the release.

They conducted a placebo-controlled trial with dozens of participants. The nitrate-free beetroot juice was the basis of the placebo group. The trial was double-blind, which means neither the administering clinicians nor the patients knew whether the beetroot juice they were given was the placebo or the active supplement. "The possibility of using a natural product, rather than another pill, to help lower blood pressure, is very appealing," adds Dr. Amoils. As for the next step in confirming the relationship between beetroot juice and blood pressure, she says this was a small trial.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story explains that people in the experimental group who consumed the nitrate-containing beetroot juice showed a reduction of 8/4 mmHg in their blood pressure after drinking the juice.  In addition, the experimental group showed as much as a 20 percent increase in blood vessel dilation, which may be helpful in reducing the risk of heart disease.  No such changes appeared in those people taking the placebo. Finally, the story notes how the changes in blood pressure might be expected to influence overall cardiovascular risk: “The authors note that large-scale observational studies show that for every 2 mmHg increase in blood pressure, the risk of death from heart disease goes up 7% and from stroke by 10%.”

The last study is a warning to people who get screening tests that aren't recommended, or who question whether screening can ever hurt. The new study was the first big one to examine a newer screening tool, HPV tests, with or without Pap smears in routine practice. The new study gives "very, very solid support" for screening less often, Lichter said. HPV tests were twice as good as Paps for predicting risk. Adding a Pap after a negative HPV test did little to improve risk prediction.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story quantifies the benefits, or lack of benefits, in terms that everyone can understand. For example, it says, “Only about three out of 100,000 women each year developed cervical cancer after negative HPV and Pap tests. HPV tests were twice as good as Paps for predicting risk. Adding a Pap after a negative HPV test did little to improve risk prediction.”

An immunotherapy drug has been hailed as a potential 'game changer' after being found to greatly improve survival for patients with relapsed head and neck cancer - a disease which is notoriously difficult to treat. The trial was led in the UK by Professor Kevin Harrington of The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, and involved 20 research organisations from around the world. This trial found that it can greatly extend life among a group of patients who have no existing treatment options, without worsening quality of life. Some of the data was presented at 16:25 CEST today (Sunday) at the European Society for Medical Oncology 2016 Congress in Copenhagen. Today it is a world leader at identifying cancer-related genes and discovering new targeted drugs for personalised cancer treatment.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: There are two way of considering benefits in relation to this study: survival time and quality of life. The release addresses both of these. For example, the release notes that median survival time for patients receiving nivolumab was 7.5 months, as compared to 5.1 months for patients receiving conventional chemotherapy. The release also notes that fewer patients in the nivolumab group (13 percent) experienced “serious side-effects” than in the chemotherapy group (35 percent).
The release states: “More than double the number of patients taking nivolumab were alive after one year as those treated with chemotherapy.”  However, according to a table published as part of the study, the actual numbers of patients at that point had dwindled to 24 on the drug and five on conventional treatment, from the original group of 361 patients. Three months later this was down to five on the drug and one on conventional treatment, and 3 months after that (18 months into the trial), all patients had died. (as per Fig 1)
It’s worth noting that the group receiving nivolumab was significantly younger than the control group; the majority were under age 65. Drug companies do many things to bias their studies in subtle ways–might having relatively younger, healthier people in their drug group be one?

But a U.S. expert wasn’t convinced by the results, which run counter to other published studies. “The majority of them are showing no benefit,” said William W. Wong, a nutrition researcher at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston who wasn’t involved in the new work. The new study, published in the journal Menopause, is based on 90 Chinese women. The work was supported by Frutarom Netherlands, which also donated the supplements. He said it was “hard to believe” that soy would have an effect on these women.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: There was a discussion about the reductions of symptoms among patients in the study in both relative and absolute terms.  Would have liked a better idea if the levels in the study among Chinese women are what American women also experience.
In most prior studies of hot flashes, the frequency has been much higher in study subjects – more like 5 – 10 per day, not per week.  So, as commenter in story notes, these Chinese women were not very symptomatic compared to their American counterparts.

But because the study was stopped early, a full analysis of the harms caused by screening scans is still months away. In the study, even experienced radiologists at major cancer centers had a high rate of false positives, suggesting that the rate would be even higher in the real world. And it’s possible that many of those scanned unnecessarily could be seriously harmed. “Even in these highly controlled settings, about 1 percent of the people had surgery or a part of their lung removed for something they thought was cancer and it wasn’t.”

Low-dose CT scans expose patients to about the same radiation levels as mammograms. The government has estimated the cost at about $300 a scan, but some centers may charge $1,000 or more.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Excellent.  The story put the important number needed to screen in the third sentence of the story:  “A major government study found the screening scans saved the life of one person for every 300 current or former smokers who were scanned.”  It went on to explain “The study was stopped when it was found that the scanning group had a 20 percent lower risk of dying from lung cancer than those being screened with X-rays.”
It could have done so in absolute terms, not relative risk reduction, but overall it warrants a satisfactory score.

What's more, the drug carries a risk of bone damage, stunted growth and heart trouble, and can render children impotent. Lupron therapy grew from the mercury camp. Geier's promotional materials said he has treated hundreds of children with Lupron and has launched nine ASD Centers in eight states. Lupron critics said autism parents may not understand the dangers. Other doctors said Geier's studies were small, were not scientifically sound and were published in journals that do not follow the standard practice of having experts review the methods.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story, as noted, cites the Maryland researcher’s claims from small published studies, but also states: "      
numerous physicians, researchers and therapists insist there’s no proof mercury causes autism, that Lupron removes mercury or that autistic kids have excessive testosterone."

The new study is notable because of the decade-long follow-up, said Maciejewski, who is also a research career scientist at Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center. At the study's one-year mark, those who had the bypass had lost 31 percent of their starting weight, but the non-surgical patients had lost just 1 percent. The new finding, he added, validates his belief that the gastric bypass could be a "durable procedure." For example, the study included mostly men, so the findings may not apply to women. Another possible limitation was the loss of patients during the follow-up, which could have affected the results, the researchers noted.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story does a nice job of making the weight loss comparisons—both over time for gastric bypass surgery and across surgical options—clear.

"This is due to an extra chromosome 21, and that leads to physical and mental impairment." "With our method we identify all normal and all Down syndrome [pregnancies]," Patsalis said. It also can identify Down syndrome in the 11th week of pregnancy, early enough for a woman to end her pregnancy if she chooses, Patsalis said. If larger clinical trials confirm the results, the test could become standard practice, Patsalis said. Dr. Brian Skotko, clinical fellow in genetics at Children's Hospital Boston and a spokesman for the National Down Syndrome Society, said this study has widespread implications for the incidence of Down syndrome.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story explained that “the test quickly pinpointed the chromosomal variation, identifying 14 Down syndrome cases and 26 normal fetuses.”

One of the recommendations was that statins should be prescribed to anyone with a 7.5 percent risk or higher of developing heart disease over the next 10 years. There’s an online tool that people or their doctors can use to calculate their risk of heart disease, which is based on age, sex, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Experts estimate that another 8 million to 13 million Americans would get statins if everyone used the new criteria -– with just under half of all adults aged 40 to 75 eligible. Statins, which include Lipitor, Mevacor, Crestor and Zocor, are extremely popular. Limiting factors should be a patient's own preference about taking a daily pill, price and the risk of diabetes, they said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story did quantify benefits using absolute numbers when describing the potential impact on heart attacks from wider statin use. The story said that “if even more people were given statins — if they were given to people with a 3 percent risk of developing heart disease over 10 years — another 160,000 heart attacks and strokes would be prevented, they estimated.” We thought the Times, though, did a better job overall providing context for those numbers.

The story of the health system's success is a story of persistence, confidence, hope and a strict adherence to a very specific approach. Fifteen years ago, suicide prevention care at Henry Ford, like in many places, was mostly reactive. When patients came in talking about suicide, health providers took notice. The Henry Ford therapists are trained to break that barrier. The behavioral health provider in Nashville implemented the Henry Ford approach for nearly 200 patients who'd already made a suicide attempt.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that the Henry Ford Health System currently has a suicide rate of 20 per 100,000 among patients with mental health and/or substance abuse problems, which is 80 percent lower than than it had been when the “perfect depression care” was launched in 2001. It also notes that the overall suicide rate for system patients is five per 100,000 — which is significantly lower than the national average of 12.6 per 100,000. It would have been good if the story had simply given the starting suicide rate among patients with mental health and/or substance abuse problems in 2001 (according to Henry Ford it was apparently 89 per 100,000), rather than asking readers to do the math.

Results from the study, which included researchers at The Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, were recently published online in The Lancet. The trial, funded by Bayer, included 152 sites in 21 countries. This trial provides evidence that regorafenib is the first systemic treatment for patients whose HCC progressed during treatment with sorafenib, the only other drug with proven clinical benefit. The success of this trial opens the field for testing drugs in third-line treatment of HCC and provides a rationale to test regorafenib as a first-line treatment or in combination with therapies administered directly into the tumor or diseased liver in patients in an earlier stage of HCC, according to Dr. Llovet. This research was also presented during the European Society of Medical Oncology's World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer in June.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release is pretty clear on this point, noting that patients who received regorafenib had an overall survival of 10.6 months, compared to 7.8 months for patients who received a placebo.

The death rate in the trial was very low, but risks varied depending on the procedure. Among the possible explanations offered for the disparities are that the European study included only symptomatic patients, who may have had more advanced disease, and that the North American trial carefully screened the doctors doing the stenting procedure, including only highly skilled physicians with a lot of experience. Dr. Walter J. Koroshetz, deputy director of the institute that sponsored the North American trial, said the Crest trial was the first in which the results of stenting and surgery had been found to be equivalent — suggesting that the stent procedure had improved with time. The most important message is that the overall death rate was extremely low, 0.6 percent, said one of the study’s principal investigators, Dr. Gary S. Roubin, the chairman of cardiovascular medicine at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. “What this trial has done overwhelmingly,” he said, “is shown that in , with the very skilled surgeons and physicians performing stenting, the outcomes were extremely safe.”
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story does a satisfactory job of presenting the major findings using the appropriate statistics. Like the LA Times, however, this story suggests that the disparate findings of the two studies might be explained by the better training and experience of the American CREST surgeons compared with their European counterparts in the ICSS trial. We wish it had spent some time exploring whether the typical patient in the U.S. can expect to receive the kind of expert care offered by the top CREST surgeons. In many cases, the "real-world" outcomes of patients will be less favorable than what the CREST team reported.

Now, a University of Missouri School of Medicine researcher has found that a complex procedure to remove the prostate achieves excellent long-term survival for men after radiation therapy has failed. "Prostate cancer, unfortunately, is a common cancer, and more than 27,000 men are estimated to have died from the disease in 2015," said Naveen Pokala, M.D., an assistant professor in the Division of Urology at the MU School of Medicine and lead author of the study. "By studying a national database of prostate cancer cases, we found that a procedure known as salvage radical prostatectomy can greatly increase a man's chance of survival when traditional radiation therapy has failed to eradicate the cancer." Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program database, Pokala and his research team studied 364 patients who underwent a salvage radical prostatectomy surgery after unsuccessful radiation treatments. "Because radical prostatectomy is a complex surgery, there can be a reluctance to undergo the procedure," Pokala said.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release adequately quantifies the benefits with this statement:
“Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program database, Pokala and his research team studied 364 patients who underwent a salvage radical prostatectomy surgery after unsuccessful radiation treatments. Looking at survival rates, the researchers found that 88.6 percent of men were still alive 10 years later and 72.7 percent of men were still alive 20 years later.”
It would have been beneficial to readers if the release had also included cancer-specific survival. Without a comparison group, it’s hard to draw any conclusions about the benefit of this approach. Even if there was a comparison, it’s also hard to draw conclusions from observational data. While they could report how many patients were alive at the end of the study period only a relatively small proportion of the patients would have been followed for the 20 years so it would be hard to interpret.

The same is true for 88 percent of CRT-D patients, they noted. The study team also found that patients whose implants were monitored remotely, on a continual basis, by a health facility network were about half as likely to die as patients who only had intermittent in-person assessments. Remote monitoring via telephone lines and online physician access is available for all ICD and CRT-D devices, the authors noted, and enrollment in such programs is typically free with a cardiologist's recommendation. But at our facility we think it makes caring for a patient much easier. Physicians knowing things sooner will theoretically give a patient a better chance for quicker access to appropriate care.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: We give the story a barely passing grade here for at least providing readers with some numbers, although we feel that ultimately the numbers provide very little clarity. What was needed were some absolute numbers to show how many patients were in each group, how many died, how many lived and how many suffered side effects, etc. Instead, we are given sentences like this, “Among those outfitted with CRT devices alone, one-year survival was pegged at 82 percent, while five-year survival came in at 48 percent, the investigators found.”
In addition, the study was observational and as such, the benefits of remote monitoring seen may not be applicable to all patients. For example a selection bias (motivated patients and physicians signed on to the manufacturers registry) could explain a good deal of the results. The cautionary comments of Dr. Prystowsky provided sufficient balance to the comments of the investigator.

The finding is another in a series suggesting that early detection of cancer might not always lead to better outcomes for patients. Doctors are convinced that if the initial diagnosis can be made early, which is very difficult, the cancer can be treated by surgery. But she stopped short of saying it should be eliminated, saying that in any event, patients would not accept that. The group getting the test began chemotherapy a median of about five months earlier. Moreover, the extra chemotherapy seemed to worsen the quality of life.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story adequately quantifies the survival benefit with CA-125 compared to no testing.

It defies common sense, she says, for scientists to conclude that breast self-exams do women more harm than good. What is clear is that studies don't supply an answer that fits all women. Some evidence does suggest that self-exams done properly could make a difference. The preferred method, known as the vertical strip, three-pressure test, has proved the most sensitive and least likely to produce false alarms, Steiner said. But finding a lump also is no reason to panic, given the limited accuracy of the self-test.

Similar programs have been used to treat depression, but this may be the first one tested to prevent it, the researchers say. At the next session, participants reflect on their experiences. Lead author Claudia Buntrock, a PhD candidate in clinical psychology at Leuphana, says that because the study only tracked participants' mental health over the course of 12 months, the long-term effectiveness of the intervention is unknown. It's also not clear if this kind of program could be scaled up. Other experiments with online therapy have found that people didn't continue it if it wasn't guided by an actual human.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story made clear that patients who participated in one of two online self-help interventions had a 27 percent rate of experiencing major depression disorder (MDD) in the 12 months following the study, compared to a 41 percent rate for those who did not participate in the online interventions. That’s enough to earn a satisfactory rating.
It would have been even better if the story had addressed whether there was any difference in performance for patients who received the “cognitive behavioral therapy” intervention versus the “problem-solving therapy” intervention. And if the study didn’t differentiate between results for the two interventions, the story could have said that. This is significant because it’s not clear to readers whether one approach might have been significantly more effective at preventing the onsite of MDD, or if they had comparable results.

The latest findings add to a growing body of evidence that the high-protein Atkins diet does not cause the harmful heart and artery effects long feared by many researchers. All the participants reported eating about 2,000 calories a day when the study began. But as researchers noted, if participants ate as little as they said, all the groups would have lost much more weight. Both the authors and other weight-loss experts were quick to note that the new findings did not answer the question of what is the best way for most people to shed weight. A careful read of the study shows "no significant difference in weight loss between the Atkins and Ornish or LEARN diets after one year!"
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The primary outcome of the study was weight loss; after a year, individuals on the Atkins diet were reported to have lost about 10 pounds as compared to about a six pound loss on the other four diets.
The quantitative information on the other clincial parameters measures were not reported.

And what if the company selling the product did the tests? But the researchers never compared the response directly between the two groups, the whole point of a randomized controlled trial. Schalock told Reuters Health he has a “hard time seeing that statistically or scientifically they have proven it.”

The fact that the company did the testing itself could also raise a red flag. While some people will want to see and feel an impact, he said, for many the clinical claim alone suffices. He pointed out it was hard to draw any conclusions from this part of the study because it didn’t include any data.

But independent monitors recommended the results on the low-risk group be released, because it was clear that adding chemo would not improve their fate. ‘‘These patients who had low risk scores by Oncotype did extraordinarily well at five years,’’ said Dr. Hope Rugo, a breast cancer specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, with no role in the study. Mary Lou Smith, a breast cancer survivor and advocate who helped design the trial for ECOG, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, which ran it, said she thought women ‘‘would be thrilled’’ to skip chemo. ‘‘Patients love the idea of a test’’ to help reduce uncertainty about treatment, she said. It’s not pretty.’’

The test costs $4,175, which Medicare and many insurers cover.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: In the low risk population, women who had foregone chemotherapy had less than a 1 percent chance of cancer occurrence at another faraway spot, the story says. It also mentions that 16 percent of the 10,253 study participants were classified as low risk.
Later down in the article, it lists more study findings: “After five years, about 99 percent had not relapsed, and 98 percent were alive. About 94 percent were free of any invasive cancer, including new cancers at other sites or in the opposite breast.”
The only feedback we have is that the story could have been a bit clearer in pointing out that all of these figures pertained to the low-risk group.
But the quantifying of benefits was good enough to merit a Satisfactory rating here.

However, myomectomy is not always possible or effective and can result in major complications including hysterectomy, according to study co-author João Martins Pisco, M.D., Ph.D., from the Department of Interventional Radiology at Saint Louis Hospital in Lisbon, Portugal. Despite its less invasive nature, UFE has yet to be fully embraced in the medical community as a fertility-preserving treatment for women with symptomatic fibroids due to concerns that the procedure may cause inadequate blood flow to the endometrium, or lining of the uterus, and the ovaries. For the new study, Dr. Pisco and colleagues assessed pregnancy rates in 359 women with uterine fibroids who were unable to conceive and who underwent either conventional or partial UFE. The procedures had a clinical success rate of approximately 79 percent for fibroid-related symptoms. Dr. Pisco suggested that UFE may become the first-line treatment for women with fibroids who wish to conceive, particularly for those with numerous or very large fibroids.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The news release does a good job providing absolute numbers in describing the trial results:
After an average follow-up of almost six years, 149 of the 359 women, or 41.5 percent, had become pregnant one or more times, and 131 gave birth to a total of 150 babies. It was the first pregnancy for more than 85 percent of the women who gave birth.
The procedures had a clinical success rate of approximately 79 percent for fibroid-related symptoms.
However, to understand the actual benefits, we’d need to know more about the women who were treated with UAE.  This study enrolled women who had fibroids and/or adenomyosis (a different condition) that apparently caused symptoms, and had not become pregnant after a year of unprotected sex; it offered them the option of UAE, even though its fertility effects were not well understood at the time of the study. There is no information on whether these women had fibroids as the cause of their failure to conceive after a year.  Thus, the pregnancy rates achieved after UAE are difficult to interpret.
The release would also have been more informative had it broken down pregnancy rates by full or partial UAE.

But most insurers won't pay for it, because they consider it experimental. Duggal says foot specialists don't really know what causes the pain of plantar fasciitis.

But it will be some years before that approach is proven -- or not.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Even when it’s quoting a doctor who is clearly a proponent of shockwave therapy (as discussed above in the Evidence Quality criterion), the story treats benefits with appropriate caution and doesn’t succumb to hype. This story also seems to have avoided the compulsory anecdote about the patient who is feeling dramatically better after a new high-tech treatment. In fact, the story seems to go out of its way to provide the perspective of someone got better with low-tech standbys such as stretching, taping, and ice — valuable  context that is often lacking in coverage of medical treatments.
On the downside, the story focuses exclusively on pain and doesn’t tell us whether patients who receive shockwave treatment had improved functioning or could participate in more activities afterward. These are important measures of a treatment’s overall effect on patients.

The eight-week clinical trial involved 30 otherwise healthy adults with moderate to severe restless leg syndrome. Patients using the RLS device also reported an 82 percent decrease in sleep loss. As an osteopathic physician, it's a challenge to balance the need to restore sleep while preventing additional harm from medication. Adverse effects were reported by seven patients in the study. Disclosures: Dr Kuhn worked without compensation through Lake Erie Research Institute (LERI) during the 5 years of the study of the device and is now receiving compensation for that work.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release reports summaries of two types of measures of restless leg syndrome. However, the release would have been better if, in addition to the numerical results for the two scales, it had offered some definition of what the numbers mean in more common terms, such as how many nights per week people lost a lot of sleep because of leg movements. Or, since this treatment is focused on improving sleep, one could have focused on the number of nights with uninterrupted sleep.
And as noted below, the release offers a comparison only to one type of drug, without any reference to numerous alternatives.

The study is the first to show that a point-of-care EVD test (ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test; Corgenix) is faster than and as sensitive as a conventional laboratory-based molecular method used for clinical testing during the recent outbreak in Sierra Leone. This new rapid diagnostic test (RDT) could cut back on the lengthy process usually required to confirm if a patient has EVD, help identify case contacts, and ultimately curb the spread of Ebola. This method poses substantial risks to the healthcare workers responsible for blood collection, transport, and testing, and efforts to contain the Ebola epidemic in west Africa have been hampered by this slow and complex diagnostic test. [1]

In this study, the researchers compared the diagnostic accuracy of the new RDT against the benchmark RT-PCR test (altona Diagnostics) being used for clinical diagnosis in the field reference laboratory run by Public Health England at Port Loko in Sierra Leone. Surprisingly, the findings also revealed that the standard altona RT-PCR test, under the conditions deployed in the field, was itself an imperfect reference standard.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release dedicates two paragraphs to describing the results, including comparing them to standard tests made by two different companies. We were particularly pleased to see reporting on the sensitivity and specificity of the test, as well as descriptions of what those numbers mean. We think those figures are important to include in any discussion of screening or diagnostic testing, but they’re often not provided or reported incompletely.

For every additional cup of coffee a person consumed each day, the study’s authors found, a person’s risk of diabetes was reduced by 7 percent. The current analysis could have overestimated the effect of these beverages on diabetes risk due to statistical issues with the smaller studies, Huxley and her colleagues note. It’s also not possible to say from the current evidence that heavy coffee drinkers (and tea and decaf drinkers) don’t have other characteristics that might protect them against developing diabetes, they add, such as eating a healthier diet. Clinical trials are needed to investigate whether these beverages do indeed help prevent diabetes, the researchers say. If the benefits turn out to be real, they add, health care providers might begin advising patients at risk for diabetes not only to exercise and lose weight, but to drink more tea and coffee, too.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

Their findings don’t prove fiber itself lowers cancer risk, however, because women who consume a lot of it might be healthier overall than those who don’t. So to get more clarity, the researchers combined 10 earlier studies that looked at women’s diets and followed them over seven to 18 years to see who developed cancer. That was after accounting for differences in risk factors like alcohol drinking, weight, hormone replacement therapy and family members with the disease. Although the connection between breast cancer risk and fiber is a small one, fiber is “something that we know is healthy for you anyway,” said Christina Clarke, a research scientist at the Cancer Prevention Institute of California in Fremont. “Increasing dietary fiber intake in the general public is of great public health significance,” the Chinese team concludes.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: We’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt, although suggest a minor change in the future.
The story only used relative risk reduction figures. It could have included just a line to explain why it may not be statistically appropriate to pool absolute risk reductions in such a meta-analysis.

"Treatment with oral tofacitinib is potentially a new treatment option for patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, pending review by the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration]," Sandborn said. Whether Xeljanz should be used as a first treatment is still not clear, said Dr. Arun Swaminath, director of the inflammatory bowel disease program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. Forty percent of those taking a 10-mg dose of the drug had remission at a year. "Tofacitinib may be used in the future as rescue therapy from failure of biologics," she said. "Only future studies will determine whether it can be used as initial therapy for ulcerative colitis and what patients it would help the most."
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story does a nice job here. The NEJM article reported on three trials. Two of the trials involved treating patients for whom conventional drug therapy didn’t work. The story not only tells us how many patients went into remission for each trial (19 percent and 17 percent), but how that compared to people in the trials who went into remission and were taking placebo (8 percent and 4 percent, respectively). The third trial was of people who had gone into remission using Xeljanz. In this trial, patients were given lower, “maintenance” doses of the drug — either 5 or 10 milligrams. In this trial, 11 percent of patients on placebo were in remission after a year, compared to 35 percent for those on the 5 mg dose, and 40 percent for those on the 10 mg dose. Overall, the story provided detail and context in reporting benefits, which is good to see.
We did wish these benefits were included higher up in the article, which instead initially focused mostly on the implications and promise of the drug before delving into the findings.

This is 12 times higher than other less effective shingles vaccines. "The efficacy is approximately 90% for all age groups--even for those over 70 years of age. We are seeing results comparable to those of childhood vaccinations. "What's particularly exciting, though, is that 90% of recipients had an increased immune response sustained across the 3-year duration of the study. The vaccine also contains an adjuvant--a substance that helps your body fight off the virus.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The primary benefit being reported here is that “90% of recipients had an increased immune response sustained across the 3-year duration of the study.”  It would have been more helpful if the release had noted the actual incidence of shingles in those vaccinated with the new vaccine versus the old (or no vaccine).
The news release says the study “shows that the vaccine stimulates your immune system to produce more antibodies and it generates a 24-fold increase in T cells. This is 12 times higher than other less effective shingles vaccines.” T cells are white blood cells that kill infected cells.
We did have some concerns with a statement in the release projecting how long the vaccine protects against shingles. The release quotes a researcher saying, “We anticipate that this protection will actually last much, much longer. We are now measuring the efficacy of the vaccine over the next 10 years and are very optimistic about the results.” However, it doesn’t say when and if that will translate into a benefit for patients.

Based on the results, George and his team say, it would be necessary to treat 12 depressed patients with TMS in order to have one patient recover. In a second phase of the study, all patients were given the real TMS treatment. “It looks as if from this trial you at least need to try three weeks and maybe even six weeks before you would give up.”

Patients who got better were prescribed venlafaxine - marketed as Effexor — and a small dose of lithium, noted George, a combination that’s been shown to help people stay well after their depression has remitted. George said he and his colleagues would like to study whether giving people TMS intermittently instead of putting them on antidepressants would produce equally durable effects. George said he believes the approach works by “resetting” electrical activity and restoring normal mood regulation.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The article describes the percentage of patients who benefited from TMS in absolute terms and tells us that 12 patients would need to be treated with TMS to achieve 1 treatment success. These descriptions give readers a realistic idea of how likely a patient will be to benefit from TMS.  
An even clearer approach would have been to say that 13 of 92 (14%) benefited from TMS and that 5 of 98 (5%) benefited from sham treatment. The other critical missed opportunity is to remind readers that these are remission rates in those who failed at least 1 prior treatment. For patients who have never been treated for depression, remission rates are much higher with any first-line treatment.

And even the company’s founder and CEO acknowledges the test can’t provide clear and definitive answers on which treatments women should try next if they’re struggling with infertility. And just because women have an elevated genetic risk for a condition doesn’t mean they actually have it. But the report doesn’t note that just 1 percent of women have that condition in the first place, making the odds still overwhelmingly in her favor. Beim, the Celmatix CEO, said the test is already bringing “tremendous” value, in part by providing guidance that can act as a “tiebreaker” to help patients and their doctor decide which treatment to prioritize. The patient asked a good question: What would we do differently if we had this genetic analysis?
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: A primary goal of the story is to drive home the point that benefits are highly uncertain. The text is clear about the intended benefit, to provide genetic information that could inform a woman’s reproductive decisions.  But it also tells the reader, in no uncertain terms, that there is as yet “no evidence” that the test actually accomplishes that. It even busts the company for using fictitious patient anecdotes to sell women on the benefits of the test.
A strong point for the story is its characterization of one woman’s increased risk of a condition known as primary ovarian insufficiency, which the test notes is 4-fold higher than in women without a specific genetic variant.
That sounds alarming, and might prompt a younger woman who’s planning to delay pregnancy to freeze her eggs to be sure she has them available down the road. But the report does not explain that the condition is fairly rare — affecting just 1 in 1,000 women by age 30 and 1 in 250 women by age 35 — so the absolute risk is still very small.
We have a primer on the difference between relative and absolute risk that readers can turn to for more information.

All the nonhormonal drugs have side effects. There were only two studies for Effexor, just one of which suggested it might help. She took a cautious view because she and her colleagues found that there was relatively little reliable data on using the drugs for hot flashes. The poor rating often meant a study, even though well conducted, was too small or too short to be conclusive. But Dr. Tice warned that the drugs should not be used long term.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: Absolute reduction in number of hot flashes per day is presented for non-hormonal treatments and these are compared to the number of hot flashes with hormone treatment.

Though scientists spent years looking for genes, they found none that were reproducibly associated with a marked effect. The next step was to ask whether those variants really could predict who had prostate cancer. But some said that if the test leads to more screening, it is not necessarily a good thing. “We are just feeding off of this cancer phobia.”

What is needed, and what the new test does not provide, is a way to decide which cancers are dangerous and which are not, Dr. Isaacs said. Still, he said the new test could help patients if it was used with caution.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story did provide some discussion on the conundrum presented by prostate cancer detection – namely that it is really an incomplete piece of information. The real goal is to develop a means of distinguishing between indolent and deadly prostate cancer.  The risk of the former would not warrant treatment likely to render the individual impotent and/or incontinent.  The risk of the latter might be worth the risk, or at least participation in active surveillance to allow for detection of a cancer while it is still localized.  The story did mention this conundrum though it might have spent more time on it.
The benefit of this treatment is an early warning of a pathology that might develop; it is less clear what a man in his 30s would do with this information.

Overall, hormone therapy reduced the risk of dying from prostate cancer over 10 years from 8 percent to 4 percent, Jones said. He noted that the radiation treatments in use today differ from those given in 1994 when the trial began. So, that brings into question how much, if any, hormone therapy is needed, he added. An ongoing trial among patients with intermediate risk prostate cancer aims to answer that question, Jones said. These findings are good news for some men, since the effects of short term of hormone therapy are reversible, D'Amico said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story provided a clear description of the potential benefit seen in the group of men with intermediate risk prostate cancer who were treatment with male hormone therapy in addition to radiation therapy alone.

The possibility of a 50 per cent cure rate would be a significant improvement over the current 20 per cent survival rate resulting from more conventional treatment options offered to patients, which consist of a combination of different methods including: chemotherapy before surgery; post-operative chemotherapy delivered intravenously to the whole body (as opposed to localized into the abdomen); and surgery that leaves minimal residual disease in the abdomen, rather than removing all visible cancer cells. The goal is to have no cancer visible to the naked eye of the surgeon after the surgery. • Surgery should be followed by intraperitoneal, or localized, chemotherapy delivered to the abdomen. It is the combined effect of surgery and chemotherapy that works best. "Women need support to endure surgery and the rigours of intraperitoneal chemotherapy, but should be encouraged to do so whenever possible, considering the potential survival benefits," said Narod.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The key benefit here is the survival rate and, on this point, the release is fairly clear. It notes that the current survival rate for advanced stage ovarian cancer is 20%, and that adopting a new standard of treatment could increase that survival rate up to 50%. The release would have added clarity by including an explanation of what is meant by “up to 50 percent” survival. It’s a bold claim about a devastating disease so precision is desirable. The reviewer uses 12-year survival as a proxy for cure in the original article but the release equates this to being “cured” of ovarian cancer. Some might debate that long-term survival equates to a cure — we’ll give the benefit of the doubt here and dock points below under the “Unjustifiable Language” criterion.

Not every patient feels that way. “It quickly becomes clear that ‘weird’ is going to be just fine if it replaces the pain.”

Chronic pain is a particularly difficult problem to understand and solve. But spinal cord stimulators offer significant relief to only about half the patients who try them. Another concern is that patients who require high doses of stimulation drain the battery quickly, requiring surgery to replace the device. Doctors say simple adjustments to the device may solve that problem.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story accurately characterizes the results of a 2007 multinational randomized trial showing that the device helped reduce pain by about half in about half of people who received the treatment, compared to only 9% of people receiving conventional medical treatments. The study is the largest of its kind and a fair representation of the literature. A 2004 review, for example, found that spinal cord stimulators provide mild to moderate pain relief in selected individuals for anywhere from 6 months to several years. (Pain 2004;108:137-47)  Still, the story could have probed the absolute reduction in pain.  For instance, halving moderate pain may be less beneficial than halving severe pain.

The study results published in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association. The study analyzed 375 patients ages 50 or older who were randomly assigned to three groups, either receiving OMT, a light touch or conventional care only. OMT also reduced the in-hospital mortality rates of those with the highest severity of illness. "This study should encourage physicians to use their osteopathic techniques when treating older patients with pneumonia." Disclosures: The basis for this analysis, The Multicenter Osteopathic Pneumonia Study in the Elderly (MOPSE) clinical trial, was funded by a consortium of foundations including the Foundation for Osteopathic Health Services.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release briefly but adequately covers the major quantitative findings. For example, the 1.1 reduction in hospital stay mentioned in the release is an absolute reduction. The release would have been greatly strengthened by including more of the results in the narrative that are confined to the graphic. Describing the actual length of stay in each group, which is provided in the graphic, as opposed to just the amount of the reduction would provide some context for how meaningful the benefit it is. (i.e. a 1-day reduction on a 30-day stay being less impressive than a 1-day reduction on a 4-day stay). It also could have given more attention to a comparison of the full manipulative therapy and “light touch” therapy groups. For the mortality data, it wasn’t clear from the text if they are referring to an absolute or relative risk reduction.

"The benefit in 40- to 49-year-old women is pretty small," said Dr. Virginia Moyer, chair of the task force, about annual mammograms. These cancers were more treatable because they were caught in earlier stages, Plecha said. "I would still recommend screening mammograms starting at age of 40," because cancers caught earlier would be more curable. She found that fewer clinicians were recommending annual mammograms after the task force's guidelines were issued. Meanwhile, younger women may feel as though they don't have to get this screening.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story states:
“The data that we have suggests that 1 in a thousand will benefit from mammograms in the 40-49 age,” (the USPSTF chair) said. “There are whole lots of assumptions that are not supported by the data they presented.”

The analysis, published Monday in Annals of Internal Medicine, drew wildly different reactions, as is often the case with research on PSA screenings. If the new analysis is correct, one of the influential PSA studies, called PLCO, reduced deaths from prostate cancer by 27 percent to 32 percent, not the zero percent that PLCO researchers themselves found. This is a screening test that saves lives.”

Those gains come at some cost to health, though: For every life saved, she estimated, five men will be told they have cancer when in fact their abnormal cells would never grow, spread, or harm them. In other estimates, such “overdiagnoses” outnumber lives saved by 50-to-1. If so, then those traits, not screening, might be responsible for their lower risk of dying from prostate cancer.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: There is good depth here discussing the benefits. Early in the story it indicates that “for a man in the U.S., the risk of dying of prostate cancer is about 2.5 percent. A mortality reduction of 30 percent would lower the death rate to 1.75 percent.”  Later this is described in relative terms, saying that more frequent PSA screening “moved some prostate cancers from too-advanced-to-treat to treatable, reducing prostate cancer mortality by 27 percent to 32 percent over 11 years.”

Current guidelines have vastly increased the number of people who are eligible to take statins. So, the investigators asked, could a scan identify those whose actual risk is lower than what was calculated? According to today’s guidelines, half had risk scores high enough that a statin would be recommended or should be considered. But guidelines then were more conservative, and in accordance with them, the subjects did not take the drugs. It turned out that the actual incidence of heart attacks or disabling chest pain in those with zero calcium was half or less than what the risk calculator predicted.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story reports that among study participants, those with a zero calcium score on a heart CT scan had only half the expected number of heart attacks or disabling chest pain over a 10-year period. That’s a relative comparison, which as we frequently note does not provide the full picture regarding benefit. But the story goes on to give readers a better sense of what these numbers mean in absolute terms. It explains the example of a person with a 12 percent risk of a heart attack over a decade based on the risk calculator recommended by the American college of Cardiology and others. That person actually turned out to have only a 4 percent 10-year risk, below the widely-used 7.5 percent risk threshold for recommending a statin.
The story makes clear that the scan does not provide a direct health benefit, but it provides information to people who are trying to decide about whether to start taking cholesterol-reducing statins. To help with that decision, it would have been nice for the story to include some discussion of the benefits associated with statin use, especially the numbers needed to treat (NNT) with a statin in order to save a life.
The story includes only one patient anecdote, a woman who was feeling depressed and had trouble getting out of bed when she took statins, and then decided to stop taking the drugs after having a CT scan that showed zero calcium. We often find fault with stories that introduce readers to only one patient, who claims to have greatly benefited; however, the placement of the anecdote low in the story and the preceding context that included limitations and expert cautions mean this single patient story doesn’t overwhelm the other information.

But the researchers and other brain-cancer doctors caution the research is at a very early stage. Much more follow-up research is needed to better assess and hopefully improve the treatment's effectiveness, the researchers say. Dr. David Reardon, clinical director of the Center for Neuro-Oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, says the Duke group's results may represent "a good, solid, important step forward" for patients with no alternatives. The treatment can cause a dangerous swelling in the brain that can lead to seizures and other complications, the researchers found. Two patients have survived more than six years, Bigner says.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story did a good job of reporting the scope of the observed benefit, stating that 21% of patients “experienced a prolonged survival” and then breaking down that number with more specifics. For example, it reported that after three years, 21% the treated patients survived versus 4% of a historical control group. But in a small study, why not cite the actual numbers – how many out of how many? – rather than make readers do the math in their heads.

Therefore, quitting leads to a quick drop in endorphin levels, he said. Using acupuncture methods to treat addictions such as smoking is not new, White said, but there is still no clear evidence that treatment with needles has any therapeutic effects either. But the government organization had only dealt with drugs - not new technology - for smoking cessation, which has slowed down the process, Camera said. Usually three convincing studies involving large groups of human patients are needed before the FDA decides to approve a treatment. Still, Laser Therapeutics’ Camera said, the treatment won’t work on everybody.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

"The study's findings suggest a potential new quitting strategy, especially for those later in their pregnancies and older pregnant women." The researchers recruited pregnant women who were already enrolled in an established text messaging program called Text4baby. Abroms and her team wanted to find out if a more intensive mobile phone program called Quit4baby would be more effective. The more intensive intervention did seem to help two subgroups quit smoking at least in the short run, Abroms says. Very little help is provided to pregnant smokers who want to quit so the study's findings are important, especially if the strategy can be adjusted to be more effective, Abroms says.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release appropriately describes the outcomes in absolute terms. For example, “16 percent of the women who were enrolled in both Text4baby and Quit4baby had quit compared with just 11 percent of women getting just Text4baby.”
But while the body of the release clarifies that this difference between groups was not statistically significant, the headline and lead sentence gloss over this fact. We’ll address that issue below under the Evidence criterion.

There was no difference in how much blood patients lost, and there were no complications in either group. The robot-surgeon team might not have outperformed the surgeon alone because the procedure was a relatively simple one. “We were surprised that (surgery with the robot) did not have better outcomes than (the surgeon alone), as we have always believed if you can see more and see better you can do more and do better,” the authors write. In this case, the robot could turn what would have to be an open surgery into a simpler one. Using a robot for basic surgery, like the kind studied here, would be like using a computer to do addition, he told Reuters Health.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: There are two possible benefits here. 1. People spend less time in surgery to achieve roughly the same outcome and potentially a better outcome, which, by all accounts, is better. 2. Hospitals and medical groups spend less money on robots and are allowed to devote those health resources elsewhere. Both are not so much quantified as addressed. In order to truly establish the second point, one would need to perform a longer term and larger study to find out whether humans outperform robots on a wider range of surgeries. These $1.5 million machines are not just specific to endometriosis. They are used for hundreds of procedures, and so to decide whether they are worth the money would require more research. Still, the story is measured in its claims.

Thirty-five subjects from the nonsurgical group opted to undergo the implant procedure, with similarly good results. There were only a few complications related to the SIJ implant procedure. The minimally invasive SIJ implant approach evaluated in this trial has been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration. The study is the first randomized controlled trial to directly compare the results of surgical and nonsurgical treatment for SIJ dysfunction. The results show "clinically and statistically important" improvements in clinical outcomes for patients undergoing the SIJ implant procedure, according to Dr. Cher and colleagues, with "profound differences" between the surgical and nonsurgical groups.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release cited the primary outcome of the implant procedure in terms of an absolute percentage.
Using reduction in pain and absence of complications at 6 months as the primary outcome, “treatment was rated successful in 81 percent of subjects assigned to the SIJ implant procedure, compared to 26 percent with nonsurgical treatment,” according to the release. In addition, the average pain score decreased to 30 in the surgical group versus 72 in the nonsurgical group. “Seventy-three percent of subjects undergoing the implant procedure had “clinically significant” reduction in disability scores, compared to just 14 percent in the nonsurgical group.”
We thought that the release’s implication that it is easy to figure out who has chronic pain due to SI joint inflammation was inadequate. In practice, it is very difficult to diagnose patients with sacroiliitis and it’s often mistaken for other types of back pain, as the study itself indicates.

And the population who might benefit from the new device is somewhat limited. This is why the telescope is implanted in only one eye. Colby says that's also why patients need to learn to use the implanted telescope eye for near activities. Practically all the patients in the telescope study with Orr had their vision improve. For one, the treatment doesn't work for those who have had cataract surgery.

“Women will know pretty quickly if acupuncture will work for them. Women who had a reduction in their hot flashes saw a benefit beginning after about three to four weeks of weekly treatments.”

The National Institutes of Health-funded study was designed to examine different patterns of responses to acupuncture. Of the 170 women who received acupuncture, a small group of women (11.9 percent) had an 85 percent reduction in hot flashes by the eighth week of the study, Avis said. Forty-seven percent of the study group reported a 47 percent reduction over this same time frame. Funding for the study was provided by grant R01AT005854 from the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, at NIH.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The release does a nice job here, breaking down the results in a detailed, quantified way: “Of the 170 women who received acupuncture, a small group of women (11.9 percent) had an 85 percent reduction in hot flashes by the eighth week of the study, Avis said. Forty-seven percent of the study group reported a 47 percent reduction over this same time frame. However, 37 percent showed only a minimal reduction of 9.6 percent in frequency of hot flashes, while 4 percent reported a 100 percent increase in hot flashes.”
What would have made the release stronger would have been to note that 79.5 percent of the control group — who received no acupuncture — saw a 10 percent decline in hot flash frequency. That casts the 37 percent of the acupuncture group who had a reduction of 9.6 percent in a different light. i.e., it indicates that any reduction they saw may not have been tied to the acupuncture at all.

The earlier study also found that undergoing a radical prostatectomy lowered the risk of the cancer spreading, as well as the death rate from prostate cancer or any other cause. The benefit was primarily seen among men younger than 65 and the authors estimated that seven men under the age of 65 and 8 over the age of 65 would need to be treated to save one life. There was also a benefit in men whose tumors had low-risk characteristics. Also, he said, erectile dysfunction can also be a factor of aging and can be treated in most cases. "Currently, the potential benefit and side effects of treatment needs to be addressed on an individual basis in relation to the risk stratification of disease, patient desires, health status and risk tolerance," Danziger added.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: While describing some of the differences observed in general terms without quantification, the story provided absolute percentage of men dying from prostate cancer in the two study groups.
The story then went on to explain that the difference was in the men who were less 65 years of age at the time of diagnosis.  The story would have been better if it had more clearly explained this important caveat about the benefit seen.

"The thing to bear in mind is that it's a first, important step," said Suzanne Haber, a brain researcher and professor of pharmacology and physiology at University of Rochester Medical Center in New York, who wasn't involved in the study. Stimulation of the entorhinal cortex -- a region considered crucial to transforming daily experience into lasting memories -- produced the improvement, the researchers said. The study is published Feb. 9 in the New England Journal of Medicine. Stimulating the hippocampus -- a brain region next to the entorhinal cortex which helps form and store memories -- produced no effect during this experiment, however. "Our preliminary results provide evidence supporting a possible mechanism for enhancing memory, particularly as people age or suffer from early dementia.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story reports that the test looked only at a simulation of learning how to navigate a virtual city.

An independent source quoted in the story points out the experiment did not show if the effects last.

A small pilot study funded by St. Jude Medical Inc STJ.N compared the two therapies in a sicker population of patients and also found that the procedure worked better than drugs. Patients in the Medtronic-sponsored trial who underwent the cryoablation procedure — which involves using a catheter to freeze away the heart tissue where the problem originates — was just as safe as drugs used to treat the condition and far more effective, meeting the study’s primary goal of eliminating atrial fibrillation one year after the procedure. Dubbed Stop-af, the Medtronic trial showed that almost 70 percent of patients who had cryoablation remained free of the condition after one year, compared with just 7 percent of patients who received drug therapy, according to data presented at the American College of Cardiology meeting in Atlanta. Over the past decade, more patients have been referred for ablation procedures when drugs proved ineffective. Only Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) has an ablation device approved by U.S. health regulators specifically to treat atrial fibrillation.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION:  The story did provide insight about the difference in heart attack, stroke and death in the groups taking medication alone or those who had received treatment with this device.  However, since the story did note that there is currently a device on the market, it would have been helpful to readers to provide information about treatment with the other device affects the rate at which these things occur.  A comparison of effectiveness would provide insight as to the relative merit for this new device.

It's almost impossible to find a compatible donor for those patients. Now the new research suggests a simple approach -- an infusion of a particular enzyme hours before the transplant -- could offer a better alternative. They come back, Montgomery said -- and the results of that comeback vary from patient to patient. If larger, longer studies bolster the current findings, she said, "this could potentially be practice-changing." But the findings mark another step forward for patients like these, according to Jordan, who is medical director of the kidney transplant program at Cedars-Sinai, in Los Angeles.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?

Now, researchers say a special scoring system might point to those people at highest risk for colon cancer, who may need the test the most. One expert said more efforts are needed to get people to undergo colonoscopy, which is currently recommended once every 10 years beginning at age 50. For now, he said, the data from this study is not strong enough to spur any changes in current screening recommendations. "A risk stratification tool is critical in helping physicians make appropriate screening recommendations for patients," Garbus said. The study is published Aug. 10 in the Annals of Internal Medicine.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?
EXPLANATION: The story cites a study that credits colonoscopy with reducing the risk of death from colon cancer by about 50 percent, by removing polyps. It would have been helpful for the story to explain what that relative reduction in risk means in absolute terms (e.g. did the rate of cancer death go from 50% to 25% or from 2% to around 1%?)
The story also notes that the study found that patients with a low to intermediate risk score “still have a risk between of between 1.9 percent to 9.9 percent of harboring a polyp that can develop into cancer.”
We’ll give credit here for the story’s provision of these key statistics, which do give a sense as how well the test accurately identifies truly low-risk individuals. However, we’d note that the benefit here should ideally refer to the ability of the algorithm to classify people at all risk levels (including high-risk), and therefore target the highest-risk patients for colonoscopy. The story doesn’t really get into discussion of the predictive power of the test, referred to as a likelihood ratio, which is in the study manuscript. However, this is a difficult concept for most health care providers and patients, and we think it’s understandable that the story did not include a full discussion of this topic.
