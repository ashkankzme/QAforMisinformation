A recent study showed that more than 25 men were being unnecessarily treated with surgery or radiotherapy, for every single life saved. It is now understood that to find the different levels of cancer, scientists have to identify genes that have been altered in different cancer types. This is part of the normal functioning of the human body and can tell individuals apart, but the process can sometimes go wrong, resulting in various diseases. The team needed to eliminate the 'noise' of the genetic patterns that make individuals unique, to leave them with the patterns that indicate cancer. "Out of almost a million markers studied, we were able to use our new tools to single out differences in cancer potency."
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The term “life-threatening cancer” was used very loosely.  A cancer that has spread beyond the prostate — but not throughout the body–is not necessarily fatal.

She also recommended he try naltrexone, a prescription drug. "Naltrexone is an effective medication for the treatment of alcohol use disorders," says Koob. Many physicians are "unaware that there are medications to treat alcohol use disorders," says Koob. Naltrexone is certainly not a cure-all, researchers say. And it won't help everyone who has a drinking problem — especially if the disorder is severe.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The story may inadvertently overstate the portion of the population that is a candidate for treatment with this drug. The story says that 28% of the adult population are heavy drinkers or drink more than is recommended. It also says that heavy drinkers are not getting the help they need, implying that naltrexone might be an appropriate treatment for this group. However, naltrexone is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe alcohol use disorder, formerly “alcohol dependence,” and not for drinking more than is recommended or heavy drinking. So undoubtedly, the pool of drinkers who might benefit from this drug is smaller than the 28% figure cited in the story.
This is a close call. A careful reader will be able to tell that the drug isn’t an option for more than a quarter of the adult population (as the 28% figure might suggest). Then again, we think some extra caution and qualification was needed to ensure that readers don’t get the wrong idea.

It’s hard to talk about carbs without talking about wheat, and it’s hard to talk about wheat without talking about gluten. Even some people who don’t have celiac disease feel better when they don’t eat wheat. Gibson estimates that, overall, about 10 percent of the population may be FODMAP-sensitive. But there’s a problem with a low-FODMAP diet. “Following strictly the low-FODMAP diet is associated with changes in the microbiota that many would not equate with good health,” says Gibson, who stresses that a low-FODMAP diet should be used to reduce specific symptoms, not as a way to improve health.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: We’d like to rate the article satisfactory here, since it does counter widely held views about the prevalence of gluten sensitivity that are inaccurate. However, it’s possible that disease-mongering of gluten sensitivity is being replaced by disease-mongering of FODMAPS. We are told that 10% of the population has a problem with foods high in FODMAPs, but we aren’t provided with any validation of that statistic.

FDA said it asked the company to dig deeper into its data on Singulair for evidence of possible links to suicide. The agency said it has not established a "causal relationship" between Merck's drug and suicidal behavior. The company said none of the 11,000 patients enrolled in 40 Singulair trials has committed suicide. She's now writing letters to every patient who takes Singulair, urging them not to over-react. Their labeling does not contain language about suicide.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: By emphasizing one tragic story about a teenager who took the drug and committed suicide, the segment exaggerates the likelihood that the two are linked.

It is the first time an epigenetic signature in blood has been discovered which is diagnostic of the severity of fibrosis for people with Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). We currently have to rely on liver biopsy to measure fibrosis at its early stages - by examining a piece of the liver under the microscope. Dr Timothy Hardy is a hepatology registrar within Newcastle Hospitals and a Medical Research Council-funded clinical research training fellow at the University. This research was supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre. It's important to make lifestyle changes to prevent the disease from getting worse.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: As noted above, NAFLD is both fairly common and — for most patients — is not cause for undue alarm. In a small number of patients, it can progress to more serious conditions. That is not clear from the release. Readers who know little about NAFLD could be forgiven for thinking that NAFLD is likely to progress to cirrhosis and liver failure. A little bit of extra context would have been good here; for example, noting that approximately 5 percent of patients with NAFLD are likely to deal with long-term liver failure. Is NAFLD something that should be taken seriously? Absolutely. But it needs to be discussed responsibly.

Craig Horswill, clinical associate professor of kinesiology and nutrition at the University of Illinois at Chicago, says the study adds to the growing body of evidence that suggests strategies for increasing non-exercise active thermogenesis — defined as spontaneous activity unrelated to a fitness routine — are needed to help overcome the detrimental effects of prolonged sitting. Participants in the study familiarized themselves with the workstations during one visit. “These results suggest that non-exercise active thermogenesis, which we call NEAT, can increase movement and calorie burning, and may have the potential to impact health,” said Horswill, the senior author on the study. “This is more evidence that NEAT, something everyone can do throughout the day, may be an important strategy for improving health, and even reducing early death,” said Horswill. Haley Scott and Danel Voorhees are co-authors on the paper.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The release fear mongers by citing a statistic based on one association study that looked at the relationship between sitting and risk of death. The study suggests that 7% of deaths from any cause were attributed to long periods of sitting down. What does it even mean that “Up to 7 percent of deaths have been attributed to sitting alone.” Does it mean those people died earlier than they would have otherwise? If so, how much earlier? And what sort of evidence would allow us to say with any certainty that sitting down was the cause of these deaths as opposed to the myriad other possibilities? If a statistic like this is to be used, it’s meaning must be explained — otherwise it constitutes unacceptable fear-mongering.
The authors of that study also cautioned that “sedentary behavior research is still in its infancy and that more high-quality prospective studies are needed.”

"This information is available on every mammogram, with no additional cost or radiation exposure, and our research suggests breast arterial calcification is as good as the standard risk factor-based estimate for predicting risk," Hecht said. Mammograms were reviewed by a second radiologist who was blinded to the CAC results. To date, there is no consensus on using CAC as a screening test, though a very large outcome study of 39,000 subjects is underway in the Netherlands. Future prospective trials are needed to see what the prognostic significance of breast arterial calcification might be. This study is being published simultaneously online in JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The use of fear-mongering language was a weakness of this release. The release calls BAC a “red flag” and says, “Many women, especially young women, don’t know the health of their coronary arteries.”
That statement presumes that young women should know this information because it can lead to health benefits — something not established here. It’s not at all clear that BAC is a useful “red flag,” but it does seem pretty certain that this kind of language will cause women to worry about BAC, perhaps unnecessarily.

By following this recommendation, 53 percent of patients who had prediabetes or type 2 diabetes would not be screened. The expanded criteria include a family history of diabetes, history of gestational diabetes or polycystic ovarian syndrome or non-white race or ethnicity. This is the first study to report how these expanded screening criteria would perform in practice among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. But there has been little attention focused on this group's most recent diabetes screening guideline. The study was conducted collaboratively with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), using data collected every year from a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?

Called Zecuity, the patch contains sumatriptan, one of the most widely prescribed medications for migraines. According to Dr. Fawad Khan, a neurologist with Ochsner Neuroscience Institute in New Orleans, few drugs are approved for the treatment of acute, symptomatic migraine. Research involving 800 patients ultimately led to the approval of Zecuity. It's not clear how much the patches will cost, but the class of medications known as triptans can be expensive, as much as $300 a month (although sumatriptan now has a generic version), Waltman said. "Migraine patients tend to be underdiagnosed and undertreated and inappropriately treated."
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: Two thoughts give us pause as we think about this criterion.
The story didn’t explore or reference the claim, made by an expert source, that “Migraine patients tend to be underdiagnosed and undertreated and inappropriately treated.” While this pinged on our disease-mongering radar, the available epidemiologic evidence does appear to support this contention. But the story didn’t reference that evidence.
The other, broader question is how often migraine suffers need alternatives to pills. How often is the nausea so bad that the intranasal, injection or patch methods would even be needed? We also can’t be sure – even if migraines are undertreated or inappropriately treated –  whether the patch would do anything to change this. The story mentions that some people have nausea and vomiting so bad that they can’t take a pill, but knowing how many migraine sufferers there are and how many fit that description is the question.
To fail to explore these questions is on the borderline of cheerleading for a new delivery method (the patch) for an old drug (sumatriptan) without reporting on sufficient evidence (data) for true need in comparison with what’s already available.

It defies common sense, she says, for scientists to conclude that breast self-exams do women more harm than good. What is clear is that studies don't supply an answer that fits all women. She stopped routinely teaching self-exams to patients after the large trials in China and Russia showed no benefit. Some evidence does suggest that self-exams done properly could make a difference. But finding a lump also is no reason to panic, given the limited accuracy of the self-test.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: This otherwise balanced story leads with a frightening anecdote about a woman whose breast cancer was only diagnosed by breast self-exam. We do not know if her doctor also felt this lump.  Her statement that she would not have survived if she had not been vigilant about monthly exam may or may not be true.  A physician’s quote buried in the piece notes that  tumor biology (not size) is the most important predictor of mortality.  Introducing this otherwise balanced story with such an unfortunate missed diagnosis detracts from the overall message that, in population studies there is no benefit to regular SBEs for low to moderate-risk women.

She no longer showed evidence of cognitive decline. Without effective prevention and treatment, the prospects for the future are bleak. THE BREDESEN PROTOCOL, Dr. Bredesen’s book describing for a lay audience the interventions described in this paper, will be released by Penguin Random House in May 2017. Dr. Bredesen hopes to eventually transform the perception and reality of Alzheimer’s disease from a death sentence to a preventable reversible condition. Other collaborators on the study include Edwin C. Amos, Jonathan Canick, Mary Ackerley, Cyrus Raji, Milan Fiala, and Jamila Ahdidan.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The news release points out the vast and growing number of Alzheimer’s cases. But it edges toward disease-mongering when it quotes a researcher suggesting the protocol can “transform the perception and reality of Alzheimer’s disease from a death sentence to a preventable reversible condition.”
It also recommends genetic testing for everyone, which clearly is not appropriate or warranted. The release states, “Now we’re recommending that people find out their genetic status as early as possible so they can go on prevention.”

“Dry eye is a common complaint to eye care professionals, with millions of U.S. adults experiencing the symptoms of this often chronic disease,” Nichols said. She focused on the cause and potential therapies for dry eye that are being funded through the National Eye Institute and in private industry. There are more than 30-plus new dry eye basic, translational and clinical studies being funded by the NEI/National Institutes of Health to further explore these lipids and proteins, with more than 50 papers being published monthly. “Funding from NIH is helping the optometry world make significant strides in understanding the cause and treatment of dry eye,” Nichols said. UAB’s Center for Clinical and Translational Science is advancing innovative discoveries for better health as a two-time recipient of the prestigious Center for Translational Science Award.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: Optometrist Kelly Nichols is quoted as saying, “There is hope for dry eye patients worldwide.” Given that dry eye is not fatal and rarely results in permanent vision loss, that statement might be considered hyperbolic.
The news release also states, without attribution, that dry eye affects more than 16 million adults in the United States.
A search of the National Eye Institute’s website finds no total figure for U.S. adults, but the figures it does offer raise questions about whether the 16 million figure is accurate: “Elderly people frequently experience dryness of the eyes, but dry eye can occur at any age. Nearly five million Americans 50 years of age and older are estimated to have dry eye. Of these, more than three million are women and more than one and a half million are men. Tens of millions more have less severe symptoms. Dry eye is more common after menopause. Women who experience menopause prematurely are more likely to have eye surface damage from dry eye.”
There is a small risk that the release, when encouraging patients to visit the specific eye clinic at UAB, could lead to “indication creep” as more and more people with very mild symptoms go to that clinic for diagnosis and treatment.

The vaccine won approval from the Food and Drug Administration on Feb. 3, and some doctors have received supplies of it. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the manufacturer, Merck & Co. Inc. of Whitehouse Station, N.J., have promised elaborate studies to catch any safety problems. Merck has tested the vaccine in about 70,000 babies in 11 countries, one of the biggest vaccine trials ever conducted. But doctors said it is impossible to design a test big enough to catch all possible side effects that might show up once the product is used in millions of children. That means many doctors are likely to charge more than $300 retail, putting the Merck product in league with Prevnar, an expensive Wyeth vaccine that has been widely used in the United States for five years.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: Although the author provides some information on the prevalence and seriousness of rotavirus in the US and abroad, he does not mention that there are multiple strands of rotavirus and the vaccine is not equally effective against all of them. The vaccine is about 75% effective in preventing disease (especially severe diarrhea) and the incidence of emergency room visits and hospitalizations is also reduced. The author does exaggerate the seriousness of rotavirus in the U.S, because although all kids get infected with the virus, few have disease from it and it only accounts for about 40-50 deaths.

Calcium deposits develop as a response to plaque formation along the artery walls, Shaw said. Doctors learned in the 1990s that these calcified plaques show up on CT scans, and can be used to determine whether a person is suffering from hardening of the arteries, Shaw said. "The best use is in patients who have no symptoms, but the value of the test is not well known." People with many calcium deposits can improve their long-term prospects by eating right, exercising, and taking medication to treat heart risk factors such as high blood pressure, elevated blood cholesterol and type 2 diabetes, Shaw said. The findings appear in the July 7 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The story blurs the line between a risk factor and a disease. This study merely documented that people with very high CAC test scores have a higher risk of death over the next 15 years. It does not prove either that coronary artery calcium deposits caused those early deaths or that testing and treatment could extend lives, yet the story portrays high CAC scores as a health problem that demands action.
Of course, we’ve already mentioned this concern, and we might have given the benefit of the doubt here if the story had better connected the calcium deposits to the study outcomes. Instead, there are several errors in the description of what happens in heart disease that may serve to mislead or confuse readers about the impact of coronary calcium: 1) Coronary arteries carry blood to the heart muscle (they feed the muscle), not away from the heart as the story states; and 2) The problem with coronary plaque buildup isn’t that it causes the heart to “work harder to pump blood through the body” as the story states; it is that narrowing in the coronary arteries deprives the heart muscle of blood, causing angina (chest pain), and  3) Clots in coronary arteries don’t break off and cause strokes in the brain; the rupturing of plaque leads to blockage in the coronary arteries, again depriving the heart muscle of blood (causing a “heart attack” or myocardial infarction).

These findings appear online in the Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology and Therapeutics. In addition, T is essential for overall health and well-being and for the prevention of osteoporosis. In the non-treated control group, there were 21 deaths, 19 of which were related to CV events. According to the researchers, long-term TTh in men with hypogonadism appears to be an effective approach to achieve sustained improvements in cardiometabolic function and reduces the risk of CV events. "The low CV events observed in the T-group compared to the untreated (control) group strongly suggest that TTh is protective.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: We credit the release for not referring to the manufactured disease label “low T” that others have ascribed to the natural decline in testosterone levels as men age.
Given the controversies over the necessity for testosterone replacement, the study results beg the question of why these men were on testosterone replacement in the first place — and whether it was successfully addressing the symptoms for which it was prescribed. If not disease mongering, then this is product mongering.

That allowed Neal and his team to determine how many children who actually had high cholesterol would have been missed if they had been screened based on federal guidelines. Indeed, of all the children in the study whose LDL levels were above 160, one-third were in the group who would not have been screened. "It's something we would become more aware of if more children were screened." "Maybe the way we are doing family screening, with a very simplistic questionnaire about any parent having early heart disease or having high blood cholesterol, is not effective," he says. "I think we need more effective screening tools.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: 1clip_filelist.xml" rel="File-List"/>



 
The lead of the story focuses on the number of children with elevated cholesterol who might be missed based on current national guidelines and does not jump to the conclusion that these children would necessarily benefit from treatment. The story also reports that less than two percent of the children tested had cholesterol levels high enough that doctors might consider drug treatment. Oddly, the lead sentence says current guidelines “may miss nearly 10% of those who have high levels of LDL, or bad cholesterol,” but the researchers put the figure at closer to a third. It may be that the reporter confused the proportion of children overall who had elevated cholesterol (about 10%) with the proportion of children with elevated cholesterol who would not have been tested under current guidelines (about a third.)

Researchers have discovered a new class of drug that has the potential to help cancer patients who no longer respond to existing therapies. The drug may not become available to patients for a number of years yet, but researchers believe that if clinical trials are successful, it could be used to tackle a variety of treatment-resistant cancers. In a bid to come up with new forms of treatment that work in a distinct way from established ones, chemists, biologists and clinicians at Imperial College London collaborated on creating a new drug, the properties of which are reported in the journal Molecular Cancer Therapeutics. The drug targets an enzyme called CDK7, involved in directing cells through their lifecycle, which consists of growth, DNA replication and cell division. Ultimately, a candidate molecule called ICEC0942 suppressed tumour growth in a wide range of cancer types in lab tests.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The news release offers this quote:
Professor Charles Coombes, from the Department of Surgery & Cancer, said: “Treatment-resistant tumours represent a significant threat for patients, as once a cancer stops responding to treatments there is increasingly little clinicians can do.
But there’s no data on how frequent treatment-resistant cancers occur.

But a new study published Monday in Cancer suggests that at least one decision our parents make FOR us may have an impact on our predisposition to certain types of cancer. It's important to note, right off the bat, that this study is not purporting to establish a cause and effect relationship. Circumcision, of course, removes this protective environment. A few potential caveats to note include the reliance on self-reporting when it comes to a man's history of STIs, as well as his sexual partners. The bottom line from the American Cancer Society: While this is an interesting finding, it's not likely to spur any change in recommendations or medical practice.

A team from the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology at Oxford University found that a blood test that looks for antibodies that recognize the protein tenascin-C could reliably show those who will contract the condition. We decided to see if it could be citrullinated and, if so, whether it was a target for the autoantibodies that attack the body in RA. That might also indicate whether it could be used in tests to indicate the disease. 'This discovery therefore gives us an additional test that can be used to increase the accuracy of the CCP assay and that can predict RA, enabling us to monitor people and spot the disease early. This latest research provides the basis of tests that could improve diagnosis and, importantly, detect disease at a very early stage, with the promise even that people at risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis can be followed before the disease begins.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: One could argue that this study and news release are pushing for the creation of a new disease – called “pre-rheumatoid arthritis.” But the value of classifying people with such a condition is not established, and the release doesn’t explore any of the downsides of such an approach. Expanding the boundaries of disease without sufficient evidence that this is justified constitutes disease-mongering. So we’ll flag the release here.

The HSRx product demonstrated superior treatment performance throughout the entire clinical study. Acne treatment represents a vast global market estimated at $3-4 billion annually, with significant expansion expected among surging middle class populations in China and India. "Acne is among the 10 most prevalent human infectious diseases and recent studies show it has a significant long-term psychological impact on many of the 80+% of teenagers and young adults who suffer from it," he added. HSRx Group has developed a portfolio of next generation OTC drug products for many categories of common health conditions. Each product is subjected to independently conducted clinical trials against a current market-leading product to demonstrate its ability to deliver superior treatment outcomes with reduced side effects.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: There is a fair amount of fear mongering here. The release calls acne “a universal plague”, “unsightly” and even cites a NASA “warning” about acne bacteria living on the International Space Station! (The release links, by the way, to a story in the UK Daily Mirror — not exactly a credible news source.) For the record, NASA itself never produced a “warning” as stated in the release. Its scientists merely described all kinds of organisms found on the ISS which, not surprisingly, include bacteria that live on human bodies (http://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-015-0116-3).
The release also refers to acne as “among the 10 most prevalent human infectious diseases” as if it were some deadly virus or bacteria. Though bacteria does play a role in acne, it is, in fact, better known as an inflammatory condition and bacteria is but one pathophysiological mechanism responsible for it.

Mr. Brown, with a history of two heart attacks, had been aggressively treated with multiple drugs to reduce his cholesterol levels, but they remained stubbornly high. Even with this trio of medicines, Mr. Brown’s LDL cholesterol level hovered around 200. This woman had stunningly low levels of LDL cholesterol. Crucially, this woman was in good health, suggesting that therapies aimed at blocking PCSK9 would not only be effective, but also safe. Dr. Cohen, Professor of Internal Medicine and with the McDermott Center, holds the C. Vincent Prothro Distinguished Chair in Human Nutrition Research.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: This is a close call but we think it crosses the line to Not Satisfactory. We stated this above, but it bears repeating: High levels of cholesterol, especially high levels of LDL cholesterol relative to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, are widely considered a significant risk factor for heart disease. However, it is only a risk factor — it is not a disease in itself. The release refers to “dangerously high levels of cholesterol” in its opening paragraph, and it focuses on the story of a patient with familial hypercholesterolemia — a condition that is known to cause premature heart disease. But it never tells readers that cholesterol is only a risk factor and doesn’t give any insight into how common this condition is or how worried the average reader should be about it. “There are many more Frank Browns out there – patients who can’t control their cholesterol with the standard drugs,” the release says. How many?

But some envision a $1 billion market for the devices within a decade -- not counting doctors' fees. Everyone agrees that clinical evidence about the relative risks in different types of patients is only beginning to emerge. By contrast, they say, carotid surgery -- called endarterectomy -- has no significant room for improvement. Even stenting proponents worry about overuse of the technology in challenging cases. Not only does she believe her risk of stroke has been reduced, Ms. Packer is also convinced the procedure has other benefits that device companies have not yet even asked regulators to consider.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: Provides natural history. While harboring an element of disease mongering in terms of stroke concern it also 
contains a flavor of over-enthusiasm by physicians to intervene; mentions the element of competition among specialties for 
this piece of the medical care pie. The framing of the story implies that the falls and “unwell” feeling were caused by the 
patient’s carotid blockage, which may not really be the case.

The surgical surge has created an expanding brigade of bionic baby boomers whose artificial parts are accompanied by sky-high expectations — something doctors struggle to manage. But he has already resumed golfing — on a March trip to visit his son and his family in Atlanta. And, he promised, “I will get on the skates again.”

Like Smith, many boomers endured months or years of pain before surgery, pain caused by “bone-on-bone” friction when cartilage deterioration eroded their bone cushioning. But having had the procedures, many say they wish they’d done it sooner. While physical activity obviously plays a role in joint deterioration, genetics may be the biggest factor in determining who needs a replacement and when, he said.

The findings will fuel an already intense debate about the merits of taking aspirin, which increases the risk of bleeding in the stomach to around one patient in every thousand per year. Peter Rothwell of Britain’s Oxford University said that while taking aspirin carries a small risk of stomach bleeding, that risk was beginning to be “drowned out” by its benefits in reducing the risk of cancer and the risk of heart attacks. His suggestion was that healthy people could start taking a small 75 mg dose of aspirin every day from the age of about 40 or 45 and continue doing so until they reached around 70 to 75, when the risk of the aspirin causing stomach bleeding rises. Alastair Watson, professor of translational medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the study was an important step in scientists’ understanding of how to prevent cancer. Peter Elwood, an expert on aspirin from Cardiff University’s medical school who was not involved in this study, described aspirin as “a remarkable drug.”

“This risk of a bleed is so small compared to the benefits,” he told reporters.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: 


The story highlights suggestions that everyone over 40 begin taking aspirin in order to reduce the risk of many types of cancer, while minimizing concerns about the limitations of this study and the risks associated with aspirin. The voices included in this story form a cheering section for the universal use of aspirin.

In previous studies, folic acid levels have been linked to mental ability; however, until now this had not been linked with improved school performance, the study authors said. In fact, folate deficiencies may be involved in the development of autism, he added. None of the other factors they examined accounted for their finding, Nilsson's team noted. "These results provide new information that points to the importance of keeping a closer watch on folate status in childhood and adolescence. However, there is no scientific evidence that taking folate supplements will be beneficial, Armstrong noted.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: Although the study reported on examined the association between folic acid intake and composite school group score, this story strayed awkwardly into a litany of all sorts of problems associated with low folic acid intake:  heart disease, brain development and function, poorer neurocognitive function and neurocognitive development, autism, spina bifida, dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease. But such a laundry list, with no discussion of the strength of the evidence, seems alarmist.

The uncertain benefit of PSA based screening, combined with the complications associated with treatment, led the USPSTF to conclude in October 2011 that the harms of PSA based screening outweighed the benefits, leading it to recommend against regular screening. By contrast, the number of monthly colon cancer diagnoses remained stable. The study showed that 12 months after the draft guidelines were published diagnoses of new low risk cancers had fallen by 37.9%, and continued to fall more rapidly than other disease risk strata, suggesting that, in this regard, the USPSTF recommendation had its intended effect,. "While some of the effects of this guideline may be beneficial in terms of reducing harms of over diagnosis and overtreatment, the reduction in intermediate and high risk cancer diagnoses raises concern for delayed diagnoses of important cancers associated with inferior cancer outcomes," noted Dr. Barocas. "Future research should focus on prostate cancer screening paradigms that both minimize harms and maximize the potential benefits of screening, as well as accounting for individual patient risk factors and preferences."
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: We think there’s some fear-mongering going on related to the downside of following USPSTF guidance. Specifically the headline, which states that “more men are at risk of prostate cancer” due to following these guidelines. While it’s true that fewer men are being diagnosed with cancer, the idea that more men are “at risk” of aggressive cancer isn’t addressed by the study at all and may not be true. The study actually found that the rate of non-localized cancer did not increase during the study. The headline seems very one-sided considering that the study also shows a steep drop in the diagnosis of low-risk cancers, something which has clear and tangible benefits.

That slowed his metabolism and reduced his need for oxygen in his brain and internal organs. That's most likely what happened to Mr. Beck, whose heart arteries were clear. But putting the therapy into practice in many hospitals has been slow. But that number is one or two higher than would occur without hypothermic therapy. Without the procedure, Dr. Granato said, the discussion about Mr. Beck would require a more serious tone.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The numbers in this story don't square up as describe.  The story estimates that the number of people who are killed by acute cardiac arrest in this country is 250,000 per year. But the most recent estimate from the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/) is that this is the cause of death for 171,00 people per year.
The story engages in treatment mongering by claiming that this treatment could save "tens of thousands" of lives each year.  However, using the data in the story, (250,000 cases of cardiac arrest; out of 100 cardiac arrests, 7-8 that undergo hypothermia walk out of the hospital as compared to one or two fewer in those who don't undergo hypothermia) hypothermia has the potential for an additional 500 people to walk out of the hospital.  This is 500 more happy outcomes but not "tens of thousands".

Results of the study are published online today in the journal Psychopharmacology. "Reports of cognitive decline, particularly in executive functions, are widespread among menopausal women," said lead author, C. Neill Epperson, MD, professor of Psychiatry and Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and director of the Penn Center for Women's Behavioral Wellness. The Penn-led team administered a once-daily dose of LDX for four weeks to 32 healthy, non-ADHD-diagnosed women between the ages of 45 and 60 experiencing difficulties with executive functions as a result of mid-life onset menopause, and as measured using the Brown Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (BADDS). In addition to Epperson, other Penn co-authors are Sheila Shanmugan, Deborah R. Kim, Sarah Mathews, Kathryn A. Czarkowski, Jeanette Bradley, Dina H. Appleby, Claudia Iannelli, and Mary D. Sammel. This project was funded in part by Shire Pharmaceuticals, the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Institute on Aging, and the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: As noted in above in this review, we’re concerned that this release engages in disease mongering. Fresh off of an approval of this drug for binge-eating disorder, study co-funder Shire appears to be looking to menopausal women as a new market and possibly pathologizing such women inappropriately. Are these women truly impaired enough to require drug treatment? The release says that reports of cognitive impairment are “widespread” in menopausal women. But to truly establish such a need, the release should have provided more context as to the degree of impairment and the number of women with severe impairment, and how long this lasts. The idea that this research is addressing “a major public health goal” needs more high-quality evidence to be accepted. In the study itself, the authors acknowledge that “the true prevalence and severity of mid-life onset of executive function difficulties among women experiencing a natural menopause are not known.”

"The fact that the treatment was performed so successfully by non-specialist centres in various health systems is really remarkable," says Professor Emberton, who is supported by the National Institute for Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre. "New procedures are generally associated with a learning curve, but the lack of complications in the trial suggests that the treatment protocol is safe, efficient and relatively easy to scale up. We would also expect the treatment to be far more precise if we repeated it today, as technology has come a long way since the study began in 2011. One of the first people to be treated with VTP was UCLH patient Gerald, a man in his sixties who took part in the latest trial under the care of Professor Emberton. The VTP treatment is currently being reviewed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), so it is likely to be a number of years before it can be offered to patients more widely.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The news release contains an inflammatory quote from a patient who signed up for the trial because, he said, “Some men prefer to delay treatment, but I couldn’t live with the fear of the cancer spreading until it either couldn’t be treated or needed a treatment that would stop me living a normal life.”  That’s one man’s take, certainly not representative of all men — and it exaggerates the risk of small prostate cancers.
Quotes from the investigator are also questionable. Active surveillance is described as monitoring and treating only “when” the cancer becomes more severe. The correct phrasing would be “if and when” the cancer progresses, because many of these cancers will not progress.  Moreover, we are not still “commonly” removing or irradiating the whole prostate–studies have shown a marked increase in the uptake of active surveillance.

If they're right, we all may soon be taking a pill that could give us an extra decade or two of healthy old age. And he had shown that you could extend life span in yeast. It's normally inactive, but when it is active, Sinclair believes it triggers a survival mechanism that extends life. They, along with a handful of other cutting-edge biotech companies, are developing resveratrol-based drugs that they believe zero-in on the longevity gene. Everyone from plastic surgeons to your friendly snake oil salesman have been promising a ticket to eternal youth for some time, so the prospect of a prescription pill based on red wine that could trigger a longevity gene sounds too good to be true.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The intro to the story suggests that "we all may soon be taking a pill that could give us an extra decade or two of healthy old age."  We understand that they want to keep us tuned in with flashy intros.  But there are many people who do not embrace the "pill for every ill" mentality and, indeed, will predictably NOT be among the predicted universe of people who would pop such a pill even if it did pan out – which is a long way away to say the very least – not "soon" as promised. 
The story also stated that "The pill … could prevent the diseases of aging, like Alzheimer’s, diabetes, heart disease, even cancer."  Perhaps.  It may also be shown to be unable to do so.  This is wild hyperbole that just isn’t necessary or warranted.  Stick to what’s known now and let the future unfold as it does.

Men who took acetaminophen for less than five years saw no protective benefit. Researchers from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and Harvard School of Public Health followed the men from 2004 to 2009 and found that those who engaged in regular brisk walking after diagnosis were significantly less likely to see their disease progress. The patients’ average age at diagnosis was 65. The findings are in line with previous research suggesting that physical activity may help reduce the risk of disease-related death in certain cases of prostate cancer. Another potential source of the associated reduction was reduced inflammation due to a lower circulation of interleukin-6, high levels of which “predicted a 73% increased risk of dying from prostate cancer among normal-weight men,” the researchers wrote.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: We do think there was a subtle element of disease mongering in this story.
The facts at the end are all correct – “Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men. According to the National Cancer Institute, about 32,050 men died from prostate cancer in 2010 and 217,000 new cases were diagnosed. More than 2.2 million men in the U.S. are living with prostate cancer.”
But there is no context given about prostate cancers not being the same as other cancers – that many are not killers – that many men die WITH prostate cancer, not FROM it.
And crediting acetaminophen for a “51% reduced risk of developing an aggressive form of the disease” without every quantifying how relatively few men develop an aggressive form of the disease among the 217,000 new cases diagnosed each year is not helpful.  51% of what?

You've probably heard that colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in the United States. And you've probably heard about how early screening means early detection and removal of polyps before they turn into cancer. "Clearly by itself, it is not reaching other people," said Markowitz, who sits on the medical advisory board of the National Colorectal Cancer Research Alliance. Up until June 1, LabCorp of America had a product on the market. But it's a huge step forward, especially for those who are skittish about a trip to the doctor.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The story’s first several paragraphs are designed to alarm readers (some 150,000 people will be newly diagnosed with colon or rectal cancer this year) and prod them to action (if you are over age 50, get screening to detect and, presumably, cure early cancer). Although any life lost prematurely to colorectal cancer is a terrible misfortune, the chances that it will happen to the average reader are quite small. About 2% of those over age 50 will die of colorectal cancer during the next 30 years if they don’t receive screening, and less than 1% if they do. To our eye, the story is teaching fear when it should reassure. It is problematic that the only reasons given for NOT having a colonoscopy are: "fear of doctors, the prospect of being poked and prodded in strange places, lack of insurance to cover the costly test"; another perfectly sane reason is that a person made a well-informed decision against colorectal cancer screening. The story does not even consider that many patients are making a choice here.

Rather, it was exploring whether the device could reliably track an already-known occurrence: how a woman’s resting heart rate changes when she’s experiencing rising hormonal levels linked to ovulation. The happy discovery was similar to one earlier this year, when a man posted on Reddit about how his wife’s Fitbit showed an uptick in her resting heart rate. And that's provided that a couple doesn't have any other fertility-related problems. If you’re curious exactly what kind of increase in resting heart rate you should look out for, Clue hasn’t revealed that information yet, but says it will publish that and other data in a paper later. But as Clue’s and Ava’s fertility research indicates, increasingly sophisticated sensors and algorithms could significantly open up wearables’ capabilities — and make them that much more able to tackle bigger, complicated health issues.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The story says that getting pregnant can be “tricky,” and it can be. But it doesn’t make it clear that the vast majority of women are able to conceive without this device. In fact, the story doesn’t really give any sense as to how common or uncommon it is to have difficulty conceiving. Without that context, the story may perhaps contribute to women unnecessarily seeking out and purchasing the device for a problem they don’t have. We suppose that there is not much harm in that, but it could cost.

Now another aging joint is fast becoming a candidate for replacement. Ankle replacement has been around for three decades, but it has been slow to catch on. The operation is complex, and many foot and ankle surgeons lack experience. Each year about two million Americans visit the doctor for ankle pain from arthritis or fracture. Still, Dr. Deland said, “we’re getting fewer and fewer failures.”

The new models require that less bone be removed, so the bone to which the device is affixed is stronger.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: Borderline.  The numbers fly fast and furious – "Each year about two million Americans visit the doctor for ankle pain from arthritis or fracture. An estimated 50,000 people a year experience end-stage ankle arthritis."  In framing the ankle as "fast becoming a candidate" for joint replacement, there is a whiff of disease-mongering in the air.  Given the sourcing on the story – all experts with potential conflicts of interest – we’re going to give this one a thumbs down.

“Our finding was unexpected, but extremely important because this is the only heart treatment that is clearly better in women than men,” Dr. Arthur Moss of the University of Rochester Medical Center, whose study appears in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, said in a statement. The device also included a defibrillator used to shock dangerous heart beats back into normal rhythm. In the latest study, Moss and colleagues explore how much better women did, and why. “We found there was a dramatic reduction not only in heart failure events, but a very dramatic reduction in death from any cause,” Moss said in a telephone interview. “We think this is the first (study) to show this.”

Moss said women have often been overlooked in studies of heart disease, which until recently were dominated by men.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The story ended with disease mongering about the 42 million American women ‘living with heart disease’ in a story about heart failure, which, while it may fall under the rubric of heart disease, is only a subset of the vast 42 million.  The story then went on to share that ‘It’ is the ‘leading killer of women’. Why not simply provide heart failure stats, and heart failure stats by gender?

But Dr. George Merriam, a professor of medicine at the University of Washington, cautioned that much more study is needed to determine whether the medication should become widely available to help counteract the effects of aging. The government has approved use of growth hormone for a limited array of conditions in adults and children, Dr. Merriam said. Other researchers involved in the study were affiliated with Duke University, Stanford University, the University of Arkansas, Johns Hopkins University, the Veterans Affairs health care system, and Pfizer, which supported the project. Dr. Merriam said Merck and other companies also are investigating similar treatments. Dr. Julia Zehr, a Michigan State University researcher who led the study, said the findings suggest that biological factors may influence those behaviors, not just the psychological effect of changes in body composition during puberty.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: While the story notes that diet and exercise are preferred methods of prevention for staying healthy and functional as we age, the story focuses on the notion that normal physical decline involved with aging needs to be counteracted with a pill, such as growth hormone. The natural decline in growth hormones may actually be protective. Also, the term ‘anti-aging’ is a misnomer, as there is no proven medical intervention to stop or reverse the process of aging. The comparison of prescription eye-glasses to improve eyesight in older adults with taking growth hormone to increase muscle mass and improve physical functioning is unfounded. Eyeglasses are an intervention to improve a manifestion of aging, i.e. reduced eyesight, and glasses pose few (if any) risks to physical health. Growth hormone may pose serious risks to the endocrine system, and possibly the cardiovascular system, and long-term use may increase the risk of some cancers in older adults.

This is particularly true during the first three years of life when the brain is developing rapidly, the study authors explained. A more health-conscious diet was associated with small increases in IQ, she said. The key seemed to be the diet at age 3, since diet at 4 and 7 seemed to have no effect on IQ, the research team noted. However, to truly understand the effect of diet on children's intelligence, further studies are needed, they said. Commenting on the study, Samantha Heller, a dietitian, nutritionist and exercise physiologist in Fairfield, Conn., said that "most of us do not realize that the foods we eat have direct consequences on brain growth, function and performance."

"This might discourage people, and legitimately so, from using this drug for prevention because of the weight gain, but hopefully it won't discourage study" of other drugs. The new study was intended in part to clarify the trade-off between the risks and the potential benefits of preemptive treatment. They eventually enrolled 60 people, most of them adolescents, who scored highly on a scale that assesses risk for psychosis. The scale rates severity of more than a dozen symptoms, including suspiciousness, grandiosity and bizarre thoughts. But by then, more than two-thirds of the young people in both groups had dropped out, making it difficult to interpret differences between them.

People who can’t control cholesterol with diet, exercise and statin drugs could soon have a new option. The study was sponsored by Merck, the drug’s manufacturer. There were no significant side effects. “It appears to be safe and to not raise blood pressure,” Shah told CNN, “but it’s not a slam-dunk.” For one thing, despite improved cholesterol levels, patients did not see less inflammation in their blood vessels. Lee Davies, a Merck spokesman, said the company is not likely to seek FDA approval until those results are in, most likely in 2015.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: 



The fundamental problem with this story is that it promotes the common misconception that equates elevated cholesterol numbers with heart disease and death. The relationship between cholesterol and health problems is far more complex and murky than most people realize, but this story takes the same short cuts used by advertisements promoting statins to millions of people who don’t actually fit the definition of those shown to benefit from drug treatment.
The story points out that the current trial involved people with existing heart disease or at very high risk and that they were all already taking a statin, and the lead sentence also refers to new options for people who are already taking a statin, so it meets this criterion. 
Nevertheless, readers are likely to miss the point that the drug has yet to be tested in people who are generally healthy except for having somewhat high cholesterol numbers. This is an important point, because statins are already being prescribed for many people who are at relatively low risk of heart disease and may derive little if any actual health benefit from the drug. The story would have been better if it included stronger caution against a similar premature leap from people with existing disease or very high risk to the far larger number of people with milder cholesterol concerns.

It is expected to be available as an inexpensive, over-the-counter product. But research is also uncovering new impacts on health, including degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer’s, mental illness and, this week, diabetes. The impact of air pollution costs $5tn a year, according to a World Bank report published last week. Bilstein said the inhaler could be useful around the world, as particulate air pollution is not just a European problem: “Especially in Asia – China in particular – the demand for such a product is even higher. Russell, who also lectures at Imperial College and Oxford University, said it might also be useful for the treatment of asthma, COPD and other lung diseases, not only prevention.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: There is a suggestion that all of us who live in cosmopolitan areas where particulate pollution is a problem will need to start and end our day with an ectoine inhaler or risk type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, COPD and a host of other maladies.
Also, the article should be mindful of statements such as the ones below, which may unintentionally incite fear in the public.
“Outdoor air pollution is a global health crisis that kills over 3 million people a year…”
“In the UK, at least 40,000 people a year die prematurely from air pollution, with a cross-party committee of MPs calling it a “public health emergency.”
These types of statistics are, first of all, hard to wrap one’s mind around. Overuse of them has numbed people to their impact and effect.

They say it will enable the body to produce more of a natural compound that supports a healthy metabolism. “We are filling a space by combining natural compounds with scientific validation.”

The active ingredients in Basis are nicotinamide riboside, a substance that makes NAD and is found in traces in many foods such as milk, and pterostilbene, an antioxidant found in blueberries. If Elysium Health were developing Basis as a drug, it would have to conduct clinical trials with humans to prove that it works, and the Food and Drug Administration would have to sign off on its scientific evidence before it could be sold as medicine. “What does it mean, to improve metabolic health?

QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The premise of the new supplement — one that is never challenged by the story — is that aging is somehow a “condition” that needs to be treated with a new medicine. Loss of muscle and other aspects of aging are normal changes that people experience as they age — not conditions in need of a cure. The framing of aging as a “condition” opens the door to expensive and untested approaches that waste money and encourage the use of more pills that can interact unpredictably. The story should have done more to resist this framing.

That's according to a study just published in the journal CANCER. The new study discrediting the test, coupled with persistent questions about how useful prostate screening is for most men anyway, add up to a whole lot of discussion points patients should take to their doctors. Even so, Andriole says, the findings may not make too much difference in the real world. They say what's really needed is a set of tests that classify prostate tumors by what genes are turned on or off in the cells. Once this is sorted out, doctors treating prostate cancer will be less like the blind men who try to guess what kind of creature they're dealing with when they grasp the elephant's trunk or tail.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: There was an imbalance in the story in that it only discussed the perils of failing to treat prostate cancer aggressively enough because of a treatment course based on clinical staging.  But the flip side is equally important and the story did not mention the pitfalls of treating a prostate cancer that was not destined to be problematic.
So, in effect, the story only focused on the aggressive prostate cancers but didn’t remind readers that most prostate cancers are not.

He found that their muscle fibers had been remodeled by the drug into the type more prevalent in trained human athletes. That is the process that he says is reversed by resveratrol and, he hopes, by the more powerful sirtuin-activator drugs that his company is developing, though many years of clinical trials will still be needed to demonstrate whether they work and are safe to use. One manufacturer of such capsules is Longevinex, whose president, Bill Sardi, said today that demand for the product had increased by a factor of 2400 since Nov. 1. Whether much lower doses would benefit athletic performance is not clear, Dr. Evans said. In the latter case, Dr. Sinclair’s and Dr. Auwerx’s mouse experiments would offer less support to the sirtuin theory.

The procedure has the potential to restore the hairlines of millions of men with male pattern baldness, the most common cause of hair loss and often an enormous source of stress. It stems from a sensitivity — largely genetic — to the effects of hormones on hair follicles. “If you transplant leg hair on the head, it’s not going to start acting like head hair. The hairs were removed in a diffuse pattern, so there were no bald spots on the legs after the procedure. “They’ve been told to forget about it by many other clinics.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The story engages in the worst kind of disease-mongering by overstating the potential benefits of the unproven procedure and by attempting to turn one of the most naturally occurring phenomena of aging into a medical condition that requires treatment. The story says, “The procedure has the potential to restore the hairlines of millions of men with male pattern baldness, the most common cause of hair loss and often an enormous source of stress.” Then it goes on to use the term that hair transplant surgeons love to use to market their techniques, “The condition, also called androgenic alopecia, typically begins at the hairline and eventually creates a horseshoe-shaped pattern of hair around the ears. It stems from a sensitivity — largely genetic — to the effects of hormones on hair follicles.” Yes. It’s genetic. It’s called being born with an X and Y chromosome. Given this description, roughly 50% of the world’s population may be potential victims of this genetic problem.

The study to be presented by Abid Irshad of the Medical University of South Carolina examined the effectiveness of screening mammography between ages 40-49 in comparison to age groups 50-59 and 60-69. More than 41,000 screening mammography exams were examined for callbacks and recall rate, biopsies performed, cancers detected, and sensitivity and specificity of screening mammography. Overall, 41,028 mammograms were performed with 5,196 callbacks (12.7% recall rate), 1,164 biopsies, and 326 cancers detected. By adding the women ages 40-49 to the screening population of 50 and over, the overall callback rate increased 1.5%, the biopsy rate increased 0.1% and 19.3% more cancers were detected. The Society's mission is to improve health through a community committed to advancing knowledge and skills in radiology.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The release veers into disease mongering with this sentence:
“When compared to the screening population ages 50 and over, screening mammography in women ages 40-49 detects 19.3% additional cancers at the expense of an overall 1.5% increase in callbacks and 0.1% in increased biopsies….”
This sentence makes it sound like the incidence of the disease is high in this age group. In fact, at age 40 the average woman has a 1.45 percent (or 1 in 68) chance of developing breast cancer over the next 10 years.

Although many guidelines rely on self-reports, Hennekens and his collaborators from Baylor College of Medicine and Meharry Medical College, used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program file linked to the Medicare administrative claims file, which allowed them to identify screening mammography use from 1995 to 2009 from 64,384 non-Hispanic women (4,886 black and 59,498 white). These linked files also permitted them to explore breast cancer mortality differences between elderly black or white women who self-selected for regular annual or biennial mammography screening. The researchers selected 69 as the lower age limit because Medicare coverage of the general population begins at age 65, and the exposure of interest was regular mammography screening in the four years immediately preceding breast cancer diagnosis. Hennekens notes that further research is needed, but that in the future, the use of regular claims-based surveillance for mammography as a source of data may offer some unique advantages over self-reports. In 2013, he received the "Fries Prize for Improving Health" and in 2014, he received the Alton Ochsner Award for his pioneering work on smoking and health.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The liberal use of statistics such as “1 in 8 women” will be affected and “1 in 25” without qualification earns this release a Not Satisfactory. The release opens with a long list of stats but doesn’t explain for an already worried public that some breast cancers are not deadly. There’s a long-running debate among medical experts that one of the most frequently diagnosed breast cancers — carcinoma in situ (CIS) — shouldn’t necessarily be termed “cancer” because it’s more of precancerous abnormality rather than a definite cancer precursor.
In addition, the first paragraph of the release ends by pointing out that 41% of breast cancer deaths in 2010 occurred in women between ages 65 to 84 but fails to add the important information that many, if not most of those women who died were diagnosed years, if not decades, before ages 65-84.  The release leaves the reader with the impression that 41% of breast cancer deaths in 2010 occurred in women diagnosed between ages 65-84.

Dr. Anne Moscona of Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York and colleagues tested varying doses of the drug, also known as DAS181, in lab dishes and on cotton rats, a species accepted by scientists for testing parainfluenza. There is no treatment or vaccine for parainfluenza. The rats were pre-treated with the drug an hour before they were infected with parainfluenza. Moscona said tests were needed that would show the drug actually helped reduce disease symptoms in animals. A spokesman for NexBio, David Wurtman, said the company would seek Food and Drug Administration approval to test Fludase in people with parainfluenza.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION:        
 
The story fails to note that parainfluenza virus infections do not cause serious disease in the majority of people. In doing so, it provides an overly disconcerting  picture of the virus and its potential to cause serious illness. The failure to provide background information in combination  with the initial quote of the lead author, “Therapies for parainfluenza  are urgently needed," qualifies as disease-mongering.

The women were randomly assigned to a diet, exercise, a combination of the two or standard care. The women who took part in diet, exercise and combination programs were also less likely to develop high blood pressure during pregnancy, compared to those in the standard care group. There was no clear benefit among the women in the diet and exercise groups when the researchers looked at other complications, such as cesarean delivery, but it did look like there may be some benefit, they write. While the new study generally did not show fewer complications in the diet and exercise group, Dr. Loralei Thornburg told Reuters Health that it’s good that there was no increase in complications. She cautioned, however, that women should check with their doctors before starting a diet and exercise program during pregnancy.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: Generally speaking, the story treats excessive weight gain during pregnancy as a disease in itself, rather than as a risk factor for other health problems. Where it does explicitly state that gaining too much weight is linked to “an increased risk of complications,” it doesn’t tell readers what those complications might be.

What causes the disc to herniate in the first place? Whether you have surgery often depends on where you live and what doctor you see.

EXPLANATION: The story crosses the line into disease mongering in the beginning of the story by stating that back pain is "almost as common as the common cold." Although back pain is common, this story is really about herniated disc, a specific back condition that is relatively uncommon. The story does not clearly differentiate between the average patient with low back pain and the patients enrolled in this study who had sciatica due to a herniated disc. The study goes on to describe what a herniated disc is, but the first paragraph implies that 4 out of 5 of us will have the condition described in the story.

Rather, they will suggest that doctors focus on changes in levels over time. They will also suggest that testing start at 40 to obtain a baseline measurement, with the test repeated at 45 and 50, after which it should be given annually until 70. But, he added, “If we biopsied every man with a PSA below 4, we’d be looking at a sea of cancers that would never grow to be life threatening.”

These facts and the results of a recent study by Dr. Carter, among others, indicated that rather than acting on the basis of a single PSA test, the rate of change in levels over time is a better indicator of who might have a serious cancer. For them, if other factors like prostate infection are not the cause of the high level, a biopsy is in order. But in men with a PSA from 0 to 4, knowing the velocity of changes can add useful information, he said.

EXPLANATION: There are several inaccuracies in the description of prostate cancer and prostate cancer screening.  One, the story quotes a source who attributes the drop in prostate cancer deaths to PSA screening, which is not known for sure (and there were advances in medical treatment at the same time even though this source states there weren't).  There could be other reasons for the drop in prostate cancer deaths.  Another inaccuracy is that the story states "guidelines" (without explaining which guidelines) recommend all men have an annual PSA test beginning at age 50.  This is not true; in fact, major guideline-issuing organizations like the American Urological Association, the American Cancer Society, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommend a shared decision making approach which individualizes this choice based on personal preferences and values.  Third, the idea of using PSA velocity in prostate cancer screening has not been well-studied and there is not a lot of evidence to prove the value of this approach.  The article states using PSA velocity is a better approach than using a single test for prostate cancer screening, which has not yet been proven (although this approach is often used in monitoring advanced disease after diagnosis).  Although a minor inaccuracy, the article also quotes a source who states that PSA does not fluctuate based on sexual activity.  However, the evidence for this is mixed and not conclusive.

The researchers found that women eating dried apples lowered their total cholesterol by 14 percent. What effects, if any, the prunes had on cholesterol levels were not mentioned in the study abstract. The researchers theorized that the nutrients in apples may reduce inflammation in the body. Despite the addition of several hundred calories a day to their diet, the apple-eating women didn't gain weight over the course of the study. The addition of apples to the diet probably kept the women feeling fuller because of the fiber content in the apples, she explained.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: We’re going to take a hard line on this – and we admit we hold the bar high, but we think it’s for important reasons.
The story only discusses changes in cholesterol scores – and actually doesn’t do a very good job of that because it only provides relative risk changes, not the absolute score changes.  (14% of what?  23% of what?  4% of what?)  But the bigger point is that there was no discussion of what difference these changes actually makes on peoples’ cardiovascular heatlh.  Yet the story was headlined, “An apple a day may help keep heart disease away.”  Where was that shown?  The first sentence said “eating apples…may be good for your cardiovascular health.”  Where was the evidence that these lower scores actually equate to improved outcomes?
Changes in cholesterol scores are changes in risk factors – not necessarily changes in the disease itself or in individual outcomes.  The story could have said that in just an additional line.

Losing weight is one of the best ways to find relief without having to rely on medication. Quitting smoking, limiting alcohol and avoiding carbonated drinks are also important protective measures. But while certain common foods — like raw onions, garlic, citrus juices, coffee and chocolate — are likely to cause reflux in most people with the condition, Dr. Aviv and other experts emphasize that everyone is different, and trial and error is the most effective way to determine an individual’s trigger foods and drinks. If adopting the above measures fails to fully control acid reflux, taking a proton pump inhibitor may also be needed. He said they should be taken 30 to 60 minutes before eating breakfast or dinner (or both), but not used as an “antidote” to consuming acidic foods.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: As we mentioned in the summary, the story conflates occasional heartburn (known as acid reflux and other names) with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is a persistent and long-lasting form of acid reflux. These are two different things.
For example, the story says “Acid reflux is a serious disorder that can and must be treated to prevent symptoms and stave off potentially life-threatening consequences.”
That is scary language — and doesn’t apply to someone who only gets heartburn once a year after having too many beers and chili dogs.
Second, the story states that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) — a class of drugs used to treat acid reflux and GERD — “are now linked to a growing number of complications, ranging in seriousness from nutrient deficiencies, joint pain and infections to bone fractures, heart attacks and dementia.”
Fortunately, the story does note that “evidence from most of the risks identified thus far is lacking” — but that caveat may not resonate with readers scared to see a common drug linked to, for example, dementia. More detail on the risks–using absolute numbers–would have helped readers better understand the drawbacks.

That, said Dr. Leon of Columbia, who was the trial’s principal investigator, was remarkable. and Medicare to devise a plan to restrict the device’s spread to places where doctors had sufficient skill to implant them safely. The result was a requirement that a hospital should be doing at least 50 surgical aortic valve replacements a year to have access to the technology. Former skeptics like Dr. Cohn now recommend the procedure for high-risk patients. More recent 2015 data from Medtronic indicates that its valve is better than surgery for high-risk patients, resulting in fewer deaths, at least in the first two years.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: Aortic stenosis is a serious, sometimes life-threatening condition, but the article hypes the situation:  “aortic valve disease has risen 35 percent, in large part because more people are living long enough to develop it.” then notes that “more than 8,000 Americans die from the disease annually.” Eight thousand deaths seems like a lot in isolation, but readers would have benefitted from being told it is still only about 1 percent of all heart disease deaths in the U.S.
What’s more, while these catheter-inserted valves are approved only for the sickest patients, the articles leads readers to the conclusion that all patients with aortic stenosis would be better off being treated with these relatively new devices, without waiting to see what happens in trials involving healthier patients.

This is the first time a randomised, double-blind, clinical trial has shown that a nutritional intervention can help to conserve the ability of patients with very early AD (pre-dementia) to carry out everyday tasks, such as paying bills, or finding your way around, as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) - a combined measure for the ability to think and perform everyday tasks. This is important because those with very early AD (pre-dementia) currently have no approved, available pharmacological options. The LipiDiDiet study illustrates that this nutritional intervention can help to conserve brain tissue and also memory and patients' ability to perform everyday tasks - possibly the most troubling aspects of the disease. The clinical trial, headed by Professor Hilkka Soininen is part of a large EC project (LipiDiDiet) to explore the therapeutic and preventative impact of nutrition on neuronal and cognitive performance in ageing, AD and vascular dementia. As part of the LipiDiDiet project, the first randomised clinical trial to investigate the effects of a medical food Fortasyn Connect (Souvenaid), in patients with very early AD (pre-dementia), has just been completed.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The news release liberally applies hype on a narrowly focused area called “early dementia” and focuses on the purported benefits of this drink for this phase of mental disorder. It is important to note that not all people with mild cognitive impairment (what the release calls early dementia) go on to develop full blown symptoms of Alzheimer’s.

This study was funded, in part, by The Ben & Catherine Ivy Foundation. "New therapeutic strategies that target the molecular drivers of invasion are required for improved clinical outcome," said Dr. Harshil Dhruv, a TGen Research Assistant Professor and lead author of the study. However, this security system is so effective at protecting the brain that it prevents many life-saving drugs -- all but some small molecules -- from being able to treat cancer and other diseases of the brain. "Clinical trials revealed that PPF can cross the blood-brain barrier, and has minimal side effects," Dr. Tran said. "PPF could be easily translated to the clinic as an adjuvant therapy in combination with standard of care treatment for GBM patients."
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The release calls glioblastoma multiforme “the most common primary tumor of the brain and central nervous system,” without noting how rare brain tumors are. The release should have noted that glioblastoma multiforme is diagnosed in about 22,000 people in the United States each year, accounting for barely more than 1 percent of all cancer cases. Glioblastoma multiforme kills about 15,000 people in the U.S. annually, representing about 2-1/2% percent of the total deaths attributed to cancers of all types.
This type of tumor is indeed usually life threatening, but this news release misleads readers when it uses the term “common” without providing the full picture.

Newswise — ARLINGTON, Va., March 1, 2017 – Results from a new prospective clinical trial indicate that high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy administered in a single, 19 Gray (Gy) treatment may be a safe and effective alternative to longer courses of HDR treatment for men with localized prostate cancer. All patients received a single, 19 Gy fraction of HDR brachytherapy. At an average of nearly three years following treatment, cancer control rates were favorable and the toxicity profile was highly favorable. Three patients experienced recurrence or progression, yielding an estimated three-year cumulative biochemical control rate of 93 percent. “This study illustrates that a potentially curative dose of radiation may be delivered safely to the prostate entirely in a single administration,” said Dr. Krauss.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: Promoting brachytherapy radiation for treatment of low-risk men is a form of disease-mongering, particularly since there is no mention of the surveillance option. The American Urological Association (AUA) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend that men with low-risk cancers be offered active surveillance.

Newswise — CHICAGO – Epidural anesthesia may do more than relieve pain during labor; in some women it may decrease the likelihood of postpartum depression, suggests a preliminary study presented at the ANESTHESIOLOGY® 2016 annual meeting. And, therefore, alleviating this pain might help reduce the risk for postpartum depression. In the study, researchers reviewed the medical records of 201 women who used epidural analgesia and had their pain assessed using a 0-10 scale during labor. They calculated the percent improvement in pain (PIP) throughout labor after the implementation of epidural analgesia. Researchers found the higher the PIP scores, the lower the EPDS scores.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: We found the statement that labor pain “may be psychologically harmful for some women and play a significant role in the development of postpartum depression” a gratuitous assessment, especially given that humans have been bearing children for hundreds of thousands of years without modern analgesics. This statement might scare women away from a perfectly viable alternative, i.e. birth without medicated pain relief.

The drug costs at least $350 a month, plus the price of doctor's visits. It's unclear whether the findings will make a dent in an addiction that affects millions of Americans. About half were randomly assigned to take Topamax, also called topiramate, in gradually increasing doses. The Topamax group cut back to six drinks a day, on average, assuming everyone who dropped out of the study relapsed into heavy drinking. It's unclear how many relapsed after quitting the pill.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: While there is no "disease mongering" in the sense of exaggerating the scope of the problem, there is implication in this report that the drug under study is more widely applicable than the study demonstrates.  The study author was quoted as saying you "can come in drinking a bottle of scotch a day and get treatment without detox."  In this study, patients who experienced significant withdrawal symptoms with cessation were excluded, as were those who had multiple unsuccessful attempts in the past to stop drinking in inpatient programs.

MONDAY, Nov. 29, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Women who have had breast cancer should consider annual screening with breast MRI in addition to an annual mammogram, new research indicates. DeMartini was scheduled to present the findings Sunday at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America in Chicago. Overall, the MRI detected 25 of 27 cancers, DeMartini said. However, still more research is needed to clarify the role of MRI in this population, she said. While the society recommends neither for nor against MRI imaging for those with a personal history of breast cancer, he said it regularly reviews study findings to determine if the guidelines need updating.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: 


The story does say that the American Cancer Society does not currently recommend MRI scans for most women with a history of breast cancer. However, it does not give readers the information they need to understand who this study is relevant to. It does not provide key details about the women who participated in the study. Was there something unusal about their cases that prompted them to get an MRI scan of their breasts? The researchers reported that 3 percent of the women with a personal history of breast cancer were found to have another tumor. That number seems quite high. The story should have told readers more about the women in the study and how they compare to the average woman who has had treatment for breast cancer. And again, it should not allow researchers to claim that MRI adds anything to conventional mammography when this study did not involve any such comparison.

Right now, medications available for treating either major depression or bipolar illness can take weeks, or even months, to work, notes Dr. Carlos A. Zarate Jr. of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, one of the researchers on the study. And as a person waits for their medications to kick in, he added, they will continue to have difficulty working and coping with social and family life; they may even be having thoughts of suicide. By developing more specifically targeted drugs, Zarate noted, it may be possible to treat patients effectively while avoiding these symptoms. Ketamine could improve treatment of bipolar illness and depression in a variety of ways, Zarate said; for example, as a means to jump-start standard drug treatment, or as an anesthetic before ECT. But, according to Zarate, more research is needed on how to use the drug in the safest and most effective way.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The press release did more disease mongering than the story. But the story does paint a scary picture, even raising the specter of suicide. "Right now, medications available for treating either major depression or bipolar illness can take weeks, or even months, to work, notes Dr. Carlos A. Zarate Jr. of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, one of the researchers on the study. And as a person waits for their medications to kick in, he added, they will continue to have difficulty working and coping with social and family life; they may even be having thoughts of suicide." This is a borderline case. 
Without additional context or some actual numbers explaining how many people have severe depression that is unresponsive to existing drugs or other therapies, the effect is disease mongering.

The 10-minute, non­invasive examination can detect subtle lapses in the brain’s perceptual ability that may signal the early stages of mental decline caused by dementia. With the United States shifting toward an older society, the hope is that earlier detection can lead to earlier intervention to slow or arrest the disease, perhaps through medications working their way to the market or changes in lifestyle. The device would be available only for use by medical professionals as part of a more comprehensive assessment of cognitive function. It is not intended to be a standalone diagnostic tool, and its effectiveness for people with less than 12 years of education is not proven. The test, which has been around since 1975, offers only a broad indication of cognitive abilities and fails to pick up borderline problems, she said.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: Dementia is a serious public health problem and as the population ages it will become a larger issue.  The story does a good job in providing some useful context.  However we think that the construct of a, “…late-life tsunami of late life cognitive decline coming at us…” and “…Dementia is the gorilla in the corner of the room in every primary care visit with every older adult..” don’t add much in the way of information and suggest that the problem is nearly universal after a given age. Such descriptions are particularly problematic when applied to a cognitive disease that is the source of worry for many and is often conflated with normal behaviors. The company source says doctors haven’t been provided with tools to assess dementia, yet several other tools are mentioned in the piece, including the one that is used as the gold standard comparison for his new test.

It’s a challenge even for the nation’s 1,000 heart failure specialists. But it can be even harder for primary care doctors, who have less expertise in heart failure yet care for most of the six million patients in the country with the condition. Those with the nontransmitting device were seen in their doctor’s offices every few months, the standard of care. One solution, being tested by St. Jude Medical, a medical device company in St. Paul, is to let patients deal with important data. Ninety percent of the time it is because fluid has accumulated in their lungs.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION:  The story opened with an anecdote that implied that something terrible was avoided.  That, of course, is always hard to know. The punch line is that without the device reporting in to a clinician, the situation was one in which it  "could have gone for months before the problem was discovered."   The story never considered the question of whether there is always value in immediate recognition of a situation.

The phase II trial, conducted by researchers at the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, demonstrated a host of benefits from the regimen. People in the second group were placed on a three-month test of the fasting-mimicking diet. The researchers had invited participants in the study for one last set of tests three months later, at the end of the diet. The research team found that the beneficial effects -- from weight loss, smaller waistlines and lower glucose, blood pressure and IGF-1 levels -- were sustained. The researchers said further investigation will determine whether the benefits of the diet can continue for several months.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: There is no disease mongering, but there is also no context provided on how fasting fits into current diet and nutrition recommendations, or which segment of the population might benefit from such a diet.

"This is a new concept that could increase therapeutic efficacy without adding new medications." There is considerable data showing connections between the brain, nervous system and heart, said Torre, but until now, no one has attempted to take advantage of the relationship therapeutically. It is usually ultimately fatal. Because new drugs can only be tested on top of existing therapy, introducing potentially better drugs is difficult. The therapy passed a first test Monday evening as doctors adjusted the electrical impulse level to Bardwell's satisfaction.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The patient profiled in the story is clearly in the most advanced stage of heart failure and may have a dire outlook, but there are many effective and life prolonging therapies for earlier stages and not all patients reach his stage. In addition, it is misleading to suggest that most patients end up on 7 drugs that are ineffective; there are many lifestyle, dietary, and drug treatments that are known to be effective for heart failure. This patient anecdote – coupled with phrases such as "prognosis is grave" and "usually ultimately fatal" – may mislead readers.

That gentle stimulation dupes the brain into thinking that the stomach is full after only a few nibbles of food. That ongoing maintenance can be a big barrier to use, says Luke Funk, a surgery professor in UW-Madison's Division of Minimally Invasive, Foregut and Bariatric Surgery. That means the device only stimulates the vagus nerve when the stomach moves. If successful, they hope to move toward human trials. UW-Madison radiology professor Weibo Cai is also a senior author on the study.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The lead sentence of the release proclaims that more than 700 million adults and children worldwide have obesity. However, many people who are obese are not considered candidates for treatment with this type of weight loss device. Obesity is defined as a Body Mass Index greater than 30. The existing similar device is approved only for certain patients with a BMI greater than 35 or 40, depending on other health factors and previous treatment. In other words, the release overstates the number of people who might be candidates for receiving this experimental device, if it ever comes to market.

A team of researchers from the National Cancer Institute reported yesterday that they have successfully treated two cancer patients using gene therapy, the introduction of genes into the human body for medical purposes. The report, published online by the journal Science, is the latest result of a three-decade effort by surgeon Steven A. Rosenberg to find ways to manipulate the human immune system to fight cancer. The new report, however, is believed to be the first time that genetically engineered immune system cells -- specifically, T lymphocytes -- have produced the same effect. And cancer sometimes returns even after that much time has elapsed. Response by others in the field was positive but not effusive.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: Cancer has a scary connotation for most people. This story failed to inform the viewer about how common death from melanoma was. While they presented an estimate for the number of Americans that will be diagnosed with melanoma in 2006 (~ 60,000) there was no mention that it is estimated that there would be <8,000 deaths attributable to melanoma. This information is helpful for recognizing that melanoma is much less common and deadly than a number of other diseases.

The solution: plastic surgery to remove the extra skin, a set of procedures known as body contouring. Intense discomfort that interferes with activity is a common problem after bariatric surgery, says plastic surgeon Sarah Holland, an instructor at Columbia University Medical Center in New York -- and it can be almost constant. That should be the norm, says Holland. Ultimately, she won her case. Seven weeks after surgery, Baez concluded the pain and effort had been worth the result: an end to the recurrent skin infections in her thighs and abdominal folds.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: This article presents body contouring after weight loss surgery as something inevitable. It turns excess skin into a disease that must be treated. While there are individuals for whom excess skin can develop into a situation that is of health concern, this is not always the case. Further, excess skin does not just occur after bariatric surgery but can be a consequence of loss of large amounts of weight even without a bariatric procedure.

Of course, the idea that high-fiber diets can help keep us healthy is not new. Maryam Farvid, a fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health who is lead author of the study, says the influence of fiber on cancer risk may be time-sensitive. So, how might the message of this new study linking high-fiber diets to a lower risk of breast cancer be communicated to teenagers? This is a question Kristi King, a dietitian at Texas Children's Hospital, has thought about a lot. She says it can be hard to get the attention of teenagers about healthy eating.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: In its second paragraph, the story says “…if you’re skimping on fiber, the health stakes are high, especially if you’re a teenage girl.” That’s scary language. This study is an interesting one, and possibly an important one, but it is also just one study addressing one risk factor for one disease. Granted, breast cancer is a scary disease. But the language here appears to be unduly alarming about the consequences of not eating a fiber-rich diet as a teenager. Also, since the absolute risk reduction is 0.2 percentage point there is no cause for alarm here.

The publication has published a comprehensive review article exploring Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). An international scientific and medical review team reported that there are a range of agents available to treat IBS and physicians should be knowledgeable about the efficacy and risk profile of any option they are about to prescribe. Only doctors can diagnose IBS. It is a privately held company based in Boca Raton, Florida, that is also the innovator of FDgard® for the dietary management of functional dyspepsia. The company is dedicated to developing products to address gastrointestinal issues where there is a high unmet need.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The news release states that “one in six Americans experience Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).” That estimate is about twice as high as the range cited in the Nature article (between 5-10 percent or 1-in-20 to 1-in-10). The release does say that only doctors can diagnose IBS and that IBgard should be used only under medical supervision, even though this product and other brands of peppermint oil capsules are available without a prescription.
The estimate of prevalence is inflated, but it is true that IBS should be diagnosed by a medical professional.  Other more serious conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s) can mimic IBS symptoms.

Experts commenting on the findings said they had “enormous potential to change clinical practice” and raised the question of whether most stroke patients with motor skill problems should be treated with this relatively cheap type of antidepressant. A few previous small trials had already suggested that giving drugs like Prozac, which belongs to a drug class known as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), might improve motor skill recovery after stroke. Commenting on the study, Robert Robinson and Harold Adams from the University of Iowa in the United States, said it could change the way doctors treat stroke victims in future, but more research is needed to see if the effects continue over time. Roger Bonomo, director of stroke care at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, said another way to look at the implications of this trial would be as justification for treatment of post-stroke depression before it progresses. “If motor function is also more likely to improve, then treating before symptoms of depression emerge is likely to be even more beneficial.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: This is one of the areas where this story could have been a lot clearer by explaining the study population with more detail than just “people who just had a stroke.” It was people who had the more common type of stroke, ischemic stroke, leading to a specific type of motor deficit.
Patients enrolled in this study had profound weakness due to a stroke, and these results may be generalizable to that population. But many patients have milder and even more severe stroke symptoms. It is uncertain whether these results would apply to lesser or more severely affected patients. By not saying these results only apply to a certain subset of stroke patients, the story implies that this is a good treatment for any patient with motor weakness after a stroke. That implication would widely overstep the findings reported in this study.
In addition, the study itself doesn’t say how many patients were screened to enroll the 118 patients. In other words, it doesn’t describe how much the general population was filtered. That information would give a clue to how small this subpopulation really is out there in the real world.

The drug, MK-4305, helped patients sleep for a larger percentage of eight hours spent in bed at one night and at the end of four weeks of treatment, Merck said. The drug also demonstrated superiority to placebo in the time it took to fall asleep and time spent awake after initially falling asleep, Merck said. The company said it is testing only the 40 mg and 20 mg doses in the Phase III study among younger patients and 30 mg and 15 mg doses in the late stage trial of elderly patients. He said the 80 mg dose was likely more than most people need. On average, it took patients 21.6 fewer minutes to fall asleep with the 40 mg dose of MK-4305 than a placebo on night one, Merck said.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: What is the definition of insomnia?  The definition given in the story fails to mention that the difficulties with sleep need to be chronic to meet the definition.  How many Americans have experienced difficulty initiating or maintaining a good night of sleep?  A small percentage of these will meet the  disease definition.

The algorithms can detect subtle patterns in the lines created by EEGs that the human eye might miss, Bosl explained. When broken out by gender, researchers found other differences. Dr. Joshua Ewen, a neurologist and director of the clinical neurophysiology laboratory at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, said the study is well done and looks promising, but needs to be replicated. Also, the study predicted who was at high risk of autism, but it's unknown if those babies actually went on to develop autism, he noted. "If it can eventually be shown that this technique can reliably identify which children will indeed develop autism, then we will have a valuable tool for early detection," Ewen said.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The story takes a fairly straightforward approach at first, but it gradual builds up a head of steam before blowing its top when lead author Dr. William Bosl says, “My hope is we would have a simple way of measuring brain activity in every child and see the patterns emerging that might track autism characteristics. … That would be tremendously useful. We know early intervention is extremely important. Right now, for a lot of children, that means 3 years old. What we don’t know yet is if you can intervene at 9 or 12 months and how effective that could be.” Every single child should be hooked up to an EEG? Based on a study that looked at 79 kids, only 46 of whom were in the high risk pool? This seems like an overstatement that should have been challenged in the story. Unchallenged, it contributes to an atmosphere of fear and paranoia around autism spectrum disorders, very real and serious conditions that have led to some very unfortunate hysteria in some quarters.

Omega-3s from fish pack a stronger punch than flaxseed and other oils when it comes to cancer prevention, according to a first-ever University of Guelph study. Prof. David Ma has discovered that marine-based omega-3s are eight times more effective at inhibiting tumour development and growth. "There is evidence that both omega-3s from plants and marine sources are protective against cancer and we wanted to determine which form is more effective." "The mice were exposed to the different omega-3s even before tumours developed, which allowed us to compare how effective the fatty acids are at prevention," said Ma. Based on the doses given in the study, Ma said humans should consume two to three servings of fish a week to have the same effect.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The news release states that the HER-2 form of breast cancer “affects 25 percent of women.” That number seems over-inflated according to other sources.
The Mayo Clinic website states “in about 1 of every 5 breast cancers, the cancer cells have a gene mutation that makes an excess of the HER2 protein.” And Cancer Investigation journal put the number of women with HER-2 positive at 19% for women under 49 years and 15% for those over 50 years old.

The goal: to relieve the scourge of chronic migraines by stopping CGRP in its tracks. But the companies’ fortunes are intertwined, he said, and “the class only wins if headache care in America improves.”

Aiming to prevent migraines before they start

There’s plenty of room for improvement. That medication, Topamax, has been dubbed dubbed “Sleepomax” by doctors and patients because it’s also a heavy sedative. Targeting CGRP is not a particularly new idea. And long-term safety remains a major question mark.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: This was a close call, but we did feel the quote “It’s like you’re possessed” and similar strong statements crossed a line. Yes, migraines can be debilitating, but there are many effective treatments for most migraine sufferers. This story made it sound like the tortures of the damned and that none of the standard treatments helps. Although that is true for some people, it is unlikely to be true for a majority of migraine sufferers. Some attempt to acknowledge that there are effective treatments for many people would have helped balance this out.

In this context, Sylentis has participated at this event presenting the pre-clinical and clinical results of various compounds that are being developed for the treatment of ocular disorders. It must be empathized that this pathology affects more than 5 million in Spain, between 10% and 20% of the population, mostly women, and almost 100% of these being elderly , . In this context, the phase III "Helix" study is being carried out in more than 30 hospitals in Spain, Germany, Estonia, Portugal, Slovakia and Italy, in 300 patients to evaluate the efficacy of this compound in the treatment of the sign and symptoms of dry eye syndrome. Non-clinical studies conducted by Sylentis with SYL1001 have demonstrated it has high ability to inhibit this specific target and block the perception of ocular pain in animals3. The therapeutic application of targeted siRNAs is booming given the specificity of gene silencing for a particular protein in a given tissue and the lack of side effects.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: This release crosses the line into disease mongering with its repeat references to “dry eye disease” and “dry eye syndrome” which are not recognized medical conditions. Dry eyes can be caused by numerous things, ranging from side effects of medications to normal aging.

This can disrupt sleep and temporarily lower oxygen levels. This increases the risk of diabetes. Two-thirds of them (26) were randomly assigned to two weeks of CPAP treatment. The researchers also measured the stress hormone noradrenaline in the blood and continuously monitored blood pressure for 24 hours at home. After two weeks, blood sugar control, as measured by an oral glucose tolerance test, improved for those in the CPAP group compared to the oral placebo group.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: This release shows no awareness of the debate over the diagnosis of “prediabetes,” unquestioningly labeling it a “disorder” affecting 57 million people. But if prediabetes signifies that you are “at risk for developing diabetes,” as the release says, wouldn’t it be more appropriate to call prediabetes a “risk factor” rather than a “disorder”? As this BMJ analysis notes, labeling someone as “prediabetic” carries the potential for harm, so we question any news release that uses the term casually, as this one does.

The reason countless lab animals have given their lives during the testing of experimental drugs is to allow manufacturers and regulators to see that a compound might be toxic, even deadly, before millions of people use it. A big reason Botox and its cousins, such as Myobloc, were OK'd was that preclinical testing showed that after being injected, they did not travel along the body's highways—nerve cells—to the brain and spinal cord. Yes, there was some evidence the toxin slipped into the bloodstream or the lymph system, but Botox in the bloodstream cannot enter the brain, says its manufacturer. In a reversal of the usual sequence in science, researchers have discovered, after millions of people have received the drug, something fundamental about how Botox can act. With the new evidence that Botox can spread to the brain in ways that preclinical tests failed to turn up, it's enough to bring back those Botox-erased frown lines.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: This story is an example of disease mongering.  It is perhaps unnerving to learn that the injection of botulinum toxin into muscle may not be as completely localized, at least in rats, as had been previously thought.   Implying, however, that the adverse events and deaths are somehow related to the evidence presented in this study is incorrect and misleading.  While it makes the story more compelling to the average reader, it is factually incorrect and an unfortunate example of fear mongering.
Though the story included an estimate of the number of adverse events (1,437) that have been reported following the use of this product, in order to understand whether adverse events are frequent or not, it is necessary to know the total number of treatments with this product.

Researchers from Moffitt Cancer Center report that a dendritic cell vaccine that targets the HER2 protein on breast cancer cells is safe and effectively stimulates the immune system leading to regression of early-stage breast cancer. The researchers previously developed a vaccine that helps the immune system recognize the HER2 protein on breast cancer cells. They also show that the vaccine was able to stimulate an immune response in the majority of the patients. Importantly, the immune responses among the patients were similar, regardless of the route of vaccine administration. The study was published in the December 13th online issue of Clinical Cancer Research and was supported by funds received from R01-CA096997, P30-CA016520, Pennies-in-Action®, and the Henle Foundation.

Hovorka's team is one of several working to produce an effective artificial pancreas, also known as a closed loop system or closed loop delivery. Without replacement insulin, people with type 1 diabetes couldn't survive. But, replacing insulin isn't easy. The current study included 24 people with type 1 diabetes and challenged an artificial pancreas prototype in two different real-life scenarios. Several weeks later, the participants came back for another meal and switched overnight regimens.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: We don’t think the story intended to engage in disease-mongering, but the story is framed in such a way that the risk of renal failure following surgery is overly hyped. The second sentence of the story says, “For reasons doctors don’t completely understand, this complication, which is called acute kidney injury (AKI) or acute renal failure, is on the rise, and it dramatically increases a patient’s risk of dying during recovery.” It isn’t until later in the story that we are told, “Overall, about 2% of patients experienced renal failure within two weeks of their procedures.” That should ease patients’ concerns a bit until later in the story it says, “Depending on how researchers define it, studies have shown that it may occur in up to 40% of patients.” This sort of whipsawing can turn readers off to a topic and leave them feeling scared and confused.

It’s yet another piece of evidence showing that the so-called Western diet can worsen the risks for cancer, as well as all sorts of other diseases from heart disease to Alzheimer’s. Chavarro and colleagues studied 926 men who had prostate cancer that hadn’t spread. They were all taking part in the Physician’s Health Study, a giant, ongoing research project that follows thousands of male doctors over their lives. The men answered questions about their diets about five years after getting a diagnosis and were watched for about 10 years. “Our findings with Western diet and prostate cancer-specific mortality, however, were surprising, in part because there are very little data regarding how diet after diagnosis may impact disease prognosis.”

The findings could be important for many men.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The fear-mongering headline of this story was out of step with the strength of the findings. We’d note that journalists often have no control over the headlines of their stories, but it’s a problem that can’t be overlooked here.

The improvements were still evident at 24 weeks, according to the research reported in the Aug. 19 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. While larger studies are needed to confirm the findings, tai chi looks promising as an alternative treatment, Yeh said. "This could represent an ideal exercise for fibromyalgia sufferers. Prior research has shown exercise can improve mood, Wang added. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine has more on tai chi.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The story cites a questionable statistic about the scope of problem. Citing the National Fibromyalgia Association, the story says there are approximately 10 million sufferers of the condition in the U.S. It would have been more appropriate to rely on a number from an disinterested government source. (The National Institutes of Health estimates 5 million as the disease prevalence among adults over 18.)

Moderation is the key with kiwis or any food, he said. In addition, the study looked at the whole fruit, not individual nutrients. Don't start popping lutein in supplement form based on these results, he noted. "Kiwi is not the wonder fruit, but certainly adding kiwi to your diet can help decrease mildly high blood pressure levels." Because this study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Results of a trial in 413 patients showed that the drug, which is activated with a laser to destroy tumor tissue in the prostate, was so effective that half the patients went into remission, compared with 13.5 percent in a control group. “These results are excellent news for men with early localized prostate cancer, offering a treatment that can kill cancer without removing or destroying the prostate,” said Mark Emberton, a University College London consultant urologist who led the trial. The trial involved 47 treatment sites in 10 European countries, most of which were performing VTP for the first time. “The fact that the treatment was performed so successfully by non-specialist centers in various health systems is really remarkable,” Emberton said. The VTP treatment is now being reviewed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for possible license, but it likely to be several years before it can be offered to patients more widely.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The story shares the flaws of the news release it’s based upon.
It says that prostate removal causes lifelong erectile problems, but this is not always the case. Nerve-sparing procedures can preserve potency for a substantial proportion of patients.
In addition, active surveillance is described as monitoring and treating only “when” the cancer becomes more severe. The correct phrasing would be “if and when” the cancer progresses, because many of these cancers will not progress.
The phrasing “kills cancer” in the headline is also questionable, as it sends a false message that low-risk prostate cancer needs to be eradicated. In fact, most men with small, isolated prostate cancers can live for years without treatment.

That cringe-worthy sound may be on the way out. A new procedure used by Phark and other doctors claims to stop the progress of cavities without drills or Novocain. It's intended for patients whose decay has not gone beyond the tooth enamel. But at the intermediate stages, dentists don't have many options. Avoiding the drill has the advantage of preserving and extending the life of the natural tooth.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: 


The premise of this story is that the featured product is an alternative to drilling and filling a cavity. However, this product and others like it are not intended as an alternative to fillings at all, they are used to seal pits that might (or might not) grow into cavities if the patient doesn’t take better care of his or her teeth. In other words, the story misrepresents the health issue that the product is meant to address.

QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The story only includes the perspective of one patient with very severe sleep apnea, but never clarifies how many people with sleep apnea have mild, moderate or severe sleep apnea.

The reason was that the results were overwhelmingly compelling — men taking the drug were not getting prostate cancer. But, as Dr. Scardino pointed out in an editorial five years ago in The New England Journal of Medicine that accompanied the study, it appeared that 6.4 percent of the men who took the drug got fast growing, ominous-looking tumors. The concern was that the drug might be preventing cancers that never spread. Maybe, they thought, by shrinking the prostate, the drug was just making it easier to find aggressive tumors. Now, though, prostate cancer specialists have a new problem: How can they change the drug’s image?
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: Having experts in the field talk about medicating all men instead of providing them with some understanding of the magnitude of the risk seems like disease mongering. And ending the piece with two of these experts (Scardino and Thompson) discussing their own possible plans for taking the drug introduces an imbalance to the piece.

The patients, who were unresponsive to other treatments, were considered to have no other options (refractory). Outcomes from the "ACT-34-CMI" study, a two-year, phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, will be published in an upcoming cardiac issue of Cell Transplantation. Encouraging early clinical trials suggest that cell therapy is an attractive treatment option for these patients, especially trials in which subjects were transplanted with autologous (self-donated) CD34+ cells."

QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The release never defines or describes angina at all. The release treats angina like a disease, rather than as a symptom of underlying health problems. That’s problematic. We do not want to downplay the condition in any way, but it is important to distinguish between symptoms (such as significant chest pain) and underlying causes (such as reduced blood flow to the heart).

The researchers review their experience with nonsurgical correction of congenital ear malformations in 175 infants. EarWell treatment was highly successful in correcting or reducing the severity of congenital ear malformations. But lack of awareness of this nonsurgical alternative is a key limiting factor. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery® is published by Wolters Kluwer. Article: "Classification of Newborn Ear Malformations and their Treatment with the EarWell Infant Ear Correction System" (doi: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000003150)

QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: This is a close one. The release begins by stating that EarWell can help infants “avoid the pain and cost of later surgery.” That’s problematic, given that people aren’t required to undergo a later surgery — it’s purely elective. However, the release later makes clear that these treatment options are designed to address issues related to “teasing, bullying and loss of self-esteem” that could stem from ear deformity or malformation. And those are very real concerns that parents do take into consideration. That makes it a bit of a toss-up. What tipped it into the disease mongering camp was the section heading that states “Nonsurgical Treatment Avoids Later Consequences of Infant Ear Malformations.” What could this mean? Hearing loss? Higher rates of ear infections? Something worse? Eight paragraphs later, the release mentions the “teasing, bullying and loss of self-esteem” as noted above. Those are important things for parents to consider, but they are certainly not a foregone conclusion. And scaremongering language in the section heading, and the huge gap between the section heading and the description of the “consequences” go too far.

Mr. Girgus, 65, who also owns Dendreon stock, said patients like himself were "looking into the abyss." That left some analysts uncertain how well the drug really worked. Dr. Gold said there were about 100,000 men who get such a diagnosis each year. And it had been intended to measure something different — not whether Provenge prolonged life, but whether it delayed the worsening of cancer. And the drug failed to do that by a statistically significant measure.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The story quotes the drug maker’s chief executive estimating that 100,000 American men per year are diagnosed with cancer that has spread beyond the prostate gland and is not benefitting from other therapies. 
The reporter should not have depended on this self-interested source. 
Other news stories, quoting a variety of independent sources, estimated the number of affected men at 40,000 to 60,000 per year.  
In addition, the reporter allows a source with dual conflicts of interest–he is a patient who could benefit from the treatment and a stockholder in the company that makes the drug–to make emotional appeals for approval.
He says many men have been "lost" since the FDA’s failure to approve the drug, and that he and other patients are "looking into the abyss" and just "want a chance" to live.

The findings were published March 25 in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. The study authors pointed out that the most common reason American patients are admitted to a hospital is when there is a suspicion of heart failure -- a tough-to-treat condition in which the heart's pumping action grows gradually weaker over time. Some of those compounds had been pegged as potential telltale signs of heart failure. Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that if further research were able to establish its effectiveness, a breath-driven tool for identifying heart failure would be a helpful diagnostic innovation -- but more so in a doctor's office or clinic than in the hospital. This study is really a proof of concept.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: There’s no disease mongering of heart failure.  But in the way the story addresses early research about this test, it smacks of a subset of disease-mongering.  The story cites the study authors’ reference to suspicion of heart failure as the most common reason American patients are admitted to a hospital. But it is far too early to say whether this test might ever be relevant to most, or even any, of those patients. Is it disease mongering to say that most heart failure patients confront diagnostic challenges of the type raised by these researchers? Or are most cases pretty clear – meaning that most heart failure patients aren’t really threatened by uncertain diagnoses?  These are questions that could have been addressed, weren’t, and therefore, the story made the problem seem bigger than it might really be.

The study shows the benefits of genetic tests that give women with a family history of cancer the chance to take steps to increase their chances of survival, they said. “This is the first study to prove women survive longer with these preventive surgeries and shows the importance of genetic testing when there is a family history of early breast or ovarian cancer,” Dr. Virginia Kaklamani of Northwestern University in Chicago wrote in a commentary about the study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. No woman who had a mastectomy developed breast cancer during the three years of follow-up testing. “Our results confirm that risk-reducing mastectomy is associated with a significant reduction in breast cancer risk,” Domchek and colleagues wrote. She said primary care physicians, gynecologists and women “need to be more aware that these tests exist.”

Dr. Sandhya Pruthi, a breast cancer expert at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who counsels women with BRCA mutations, said the study adds more evidence that the surgery can help save lives, but the choice is never easy.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: 1clip_filelist.xml"/>



 
Because the story lead clearly notes that the study involved only women with BRCA1/2 genetic mutation and it also points out that 10 to 20 percent of breast and ovarian cancers are linked to BRCA1/2 mutations, it could be argued that the story meets this criterion. But then a potentially confusing reference to “women with a family history of cancer” may lead many readers to believe the findings may be relevant to that much larger population of women. Also, at the end of the story it calls breast cancer “the leading global cancer killer of women.” While technically accurate based on current statistics from the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the description obscures the fact that in developed nations (where genetic testing is available) the overwhelming majority of women who develop breast cancer are successfully treated.
Actually, this story dramatically understates the cancer risks facing women who carry BRCA1/2 mutation by confusing the lifetime risk of cancer with the relative risk compared to women who don’t have the mutation. For example, the story erroneously reports that women with the mutations have a “56 to 84 percent higher” risk of breast cancer… when in fact that is their lifetime risk… which is several times higher than the commonly used figure of a 12 percent lifetime risk of breast cancer for women in the general population.

Research published today in Scientific Reports shows that light from RayVio's 293nm ultraviolet (UV) LED is more efficient than sunlight at producing vitamin D3 in skin samples. "This study will lead to a new generation of technology that can be labeled as photopharmacology in which the use of LEDs with targeted wavelengths can cause specific biologic effects in human skin to help treat and prevent chronic illnesses." This device for making vitamin D is ideally suited for patients with fat malabsorption syndromes including inflammatory bowel disease and gastric bypass surgery. The research shows that RayVio's UV LEDs could be used for treating patients that are vitamin D deficient. Thanks to the work of the research team and the pioneering work of the Boston University Photonics Center on UV LEDs, we may soon see innovative treatment options like simple integration with a wearable device could aid millions of people."
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: Without stating the source or elaborating further, the release states that 75 percent of teens and adults in the US are vitamin D deficient. However, noted experts have disputed high claims of deficiency as being a misinterpretation of Institute of Medicine nutrition guidelines.
Being vitamin D deficient in itself is not a disease. It can lead to a loss of bone density, contributing to osteoporosis and fractures. Severe vitamin D deficiency in the US is rare, and the effects of vitamin D on other conditions need to be investigated further.
For these reasons we rate this Not Satisfactory for disease mongering.

After up to 32 years of follow-up, about 20,400 women and 7,570 men developed cancer, the investigators found. Moreover, the benefit of aspirin in reducing overall cancer risk appeared to depend on how much one took. So the more aspirin taken, the more the risk was reduced. Amounts ranged from less than one aspirin a week to 15 or more, the researchers said. The benefit was no longer seen within four years of stopping it, the researchers found.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The story suggests that colorectal cancer is one of the two “leading causes of sickness and death in the U.S. and much of the world.” However, it never supports that statement with figures on the prevalence or incidence of these cancers, or an individual’s lifetime risk. Such figures are easily obtainable from the American Cancer Society.

The tests, created by Mark Pimentel, MD, director of the GI Motility Program and Laboratory, confirm when a patient has developed IBS because of food poisoning, a major cause of the disorder. The new blood tests identify the presence and amount of specific antibodies reacting to the toxins. IBS is the most common gastroenterological disorder in the United States, affecting nearly 40 million people. "The fact that we can now confirm the disease through their blood, not their head, is going to end a lot of the emotional suffering I have seen these patients endure." For more information on IBS and the new blood test for the disorder, watch this video:

First Ever Blood Test for IBS

Cedars-Sinai has entered into an exclusive license agreement with Commonwealth Laboratories for several patent applications covering the blood tests, developed by Pimentel to detect both anti-CdtB and anti-vinculin antibodies in the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The release says IBS affects “nearly 40 million people” in the U.S., and “an estimated 10 percent of the world’s population.” But this isn’t a test for IBS — it’s a test for those with the diarrhea predominant version. It’s not clear how many people we’re talking about, but according to this study, less than half of the people with IBS meet the criteria for the diarrhea-predominant version. The release exaggerates the potential impact of the test in a way that promotes a commercial interest, so we’ll flag it for disease mongering.

Aside from helping to prevent the metabolic syndrome– a cluster of risk factors for heart disease and diabetes- a new study in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology says, the diet can have positive global effects on the individual risk factors: low HDL ("good") cholesterol, high triglycerides, high blood pressure and a high blood sugar rate, as seen by your doctor through a blood test. The syndrome is present when someone has three of those five risk factors. The study notes physical activity is also an important part in preventing the risk factors for the metabolic syndrome. The Mediterranean diet isn't just a little extra olive oil, noted Dr. Robert Eckel, an endocrinologist and past president of the American Heart Association. That translates into 2.9 million young people.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The story included data from the American Heart Association about the numbers /percentage of people who met the criteria for metabolic syndrome, and its prevalence in adolescents.  But it made an awkward and unsupported transition immediately into obesity and a “global epidemic.”  This story – as the opening sentence stated, was about “a cluster of risk factors for heart disease and diabetes.” The study was about risk factors for risk factors. It did not report on end organ disease endpoints. Metabolic syndrome is not a disease.  It’s a fine point.  It’s semantics.  But it’s an important fine point about semantics.  So we grade this unsatisfactory.

“The protein is easy to detect because it is found in urine and would potentially be a very simple test to carry out on men to identify those most at risk of developing the disease,” said Hayley Whitaker of the Cambridge institute, who led the study. Whitaker said that while it could be around five years before the results of this study are translated into a test for doctors to use in clinics, she hoped it would then also help them to determine which patients have aggressive tumors. But PSA testing is problematic because it has low specificity, which generates high false positive rates and leads to unnecessary surgical and radiotherapy treatment. “At the moment, PSA testing is the best method we have to detect prostate cancer but it has significant limitations, so there is an urgent need to find new biomarkers such as MSMB that could be used in screening and diagnosis,” said Rosalind Eeles of the ICR and The Royal Marsden Hospital, who also worked on the study. Commenting on the study, Kate Holmes of the UK’s Prostate Cancer Charity, said they could prove very valuable in future.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION:  The story did engage in a bit of disease mongering with the number of men diagnosed world wide with the disease and reporting that prostate cancer was the second most common cancer cause of death among American men without indicating that in the U.S., the lifetime risk of dying from prostate cancer is 3% .  Most problematic was the statement that "In Britain, around 35,000 men are diagnosed with it and some 10,000 die from the disease." But no time frame was given – no way to give such estimates.

It is also more expensive, and it doesn’t work for every patient. “My symptoms subsided dramatically.”

Provent works like a traditional C.P.A.P. But not everyone finds that Provent alleviates their apnea. In those people, Provent typically doesn’t work. but could not sleep comfortably with the device.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: There seems to have been some disease mongering in the first sentence. Most estimates of sleep apnea in the published literature puts the condition at somewhere between 15 million and 18 million. We could find no reference in PubMed to 28 million Americans suffering from the disorder. This would mean that nearly 1 out every 10 people have sleep apnea. The story also uses marketing language, calling the Provent patch, a “new weapon in the battle against sleep apnea,” and saying that “many patients who struggled with C.P.A.P. call it a godsend.”

“It is not a small difference,” said Dr. Mark Helvie of the University of Michigan Health System, who worked on the study published in the February issue of the American Journal of Roentgenology. His team calculated that a woman who gets a yearly mammogram starting at age 40 cuts her risk of dying from breast cancer by 71 percent compared to a 23 percent reduction in risk if a woman followed the task force recommendations. When they were issued, the task force’s guidelines contradicted years of messages about the need for routine breast cancer screening starting at age 40, kicking off a fury of protest among breast cancer experts and advocacy groups who argued the recommendation of fewer screenings would confuse women and result in more deaths from breast cancer. She said breast mammograms have contributed significantly to reducing deaths from breast cancer, a fact that should not be ignored in favor of mathematical models. It kills 500,000 people globally every year and is diagnosed in close to 1.3 million people around the world.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: While the article does not exaggerate the incidence of breast cancer, it does state that “annual mammograms save 65,000 more women from breast cancer.”  This could lead women to believe that mammography prevents breast cancer when its purpose is to detect breast cancer. Incorrect and misleading. .

Petersen believes that the test they came up with could become a useful tool for any physician, even those without special training in the brain. “But what’s nice about it is that it’s a nice non-cognitive, motor factor so it’s looking at another aspect of brain function.”

MORE: This Alzheimer’s Breakthrough Could Be a Game Changer

Petersen suggests that every physician should get this information on their patients at age 65; that way, they can have a baseline against which to compare any changes as their patients age. “We have either expensive techniques or invasive techniques and it’s not practical to do them from a public health screening standpoint,” says Petersen. MORE: New Test May Predict Alzheimer’s 10 Years Before Diagnosis

While his test is a possible solution to that problem, he acknowledges that the results need be repeated before it’s recommended on a wide scale to physicians across the country. For now, even if doctors identify patients around age 65 who might be at higher risk of developing cognitive impairment, there isn’t much they can do to interrupt the process.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: While we give the story credit for not providing the reader with ominous statistics about the incidence of Alzheimer’s or mild cognitive impairment, the suggestion that everyone over the age of 65 should have this testing certainly pings our scare-mongering radar. As does the story’s inaccurate suggestion that a high score can help diagnose Alzheimer’s disease, when it’s really only indicative of mild cognitive impairment. As does the failure to put a “7-fold increase in risk” in the appropriate overall perspective, as discussed above under Benefits.

MorNuCo Laboratories is elated to share these results with the public, as early detection is widely considered the corner stone of an effective strategy to reduce cancer-related deaths. In this study, the serum presence of a mesothelioma-specific form of the ENOX2 protein (a recently identified marker of malignancy) was found within the serum of asbestos-exposed individuals an average of 6.2 years in advance of clinical symptoms by using the ONCOblot tissue of origin cancer detection test. The ONCOblot® test is based on more than 20 years of basic research. The ONCOblot Test is CLIA registered and meets all current FDA regulations as an LDT. A 510(k) application is being prepared for submission to the FDA to register the ONCOblot test as a medical device.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The news release emphasizes that “Malignant mesothelioma is an aggressive and almost uniformly fatal tumor caused primarily by exposure to asbestos.” However, it fails to note that not only is the disease rare (fewer than 3,000 cases per year in the United States, compared to more than 1.6 million cases and half a million deaths from all types of cancer), but most people exposed to asbestos never get mesothelioma. By implying that this test might be useful for anyone exposed to asbestos, the release sets the stage for a vast sales market of people, most of whom would never have to deal with mesothelioma, regardless of testing.

Novalar and some dentists who advise the company said it might be useful for children, who can injure themselves by biting their lip or tongue without knowing it. With about 300 million anesthesia injections given by dentists each year, company executives say the drug could easily achieve sales of hundreds of millions of dollars a year. “It is reversing the epinephrine.”

The label for the hypertension drug phentolamine contains warnings about heart attacks and occlusion of blood flow to the brain. In the clinical trials there were no serious side effects, Novalar said. Those patients would be expected to have lingering pain, and should not get Oraverse, Dr. Moore said.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The article implictly accepts the drug-maker’s premise that lingering numbness after dental anesthesia is a condition that requires treatment. One could easily find medical sources who disagree.  But the Times didn’t – or at least they didn’t quote them.

THURSDAY, July 20, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- A laser treatment can reduce spots in people's vision known as "floaters," a new study finds. The new research was led by Dr. Chirag Shah and Dr. Jeffrey Heier of Ophthalmic Consultants of Boston. The patients in the YAG group also had improvements in several other measures, including general vision and independence, compared with those in the placebo group, the findings showed. There were no differences between the two groups in harmful side effects, according to the study, which was published July 20 in JAMA Ophthalmology. A limitation of the study was its small size and short follow-up period, the researchers said.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The story hints that many people don’t need treatment: “Floaters become more common with age, and although some people simply get used to them, others are bothered by them or their vision is impaired.”
However, the story should have been stronger on this point–visual floaters are so common that they can be considered normal and the majority of people don’t do anything about them.
The news release, which we also reviewed, noted that “most” people get used to them, in all but the most serious cases. We think the story should have been stronger on this point, too.

LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists have used an “artificial pancreas” system of pumps and monitors to improve blood sugar control in diabetes patients in the first study to show the new device works better than conventional treatment. The new system, which involves patients wearing a matchbox-sized monitor and a similar-sized pump with a tube to deliver insulin into the body, also halved the amount of time blood sugar dropped to worrying or dangerous levels, they said. He said the results were “an important stepping stone” toward bringing an artificial pancreas to the commercial market, but predicted several years yet of refinement before it could be used day and night by patients in normal life. I see the same thing with this system.”

The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation said last month it was teaming up with U.S. drugmaker Johnson & Johnson’s unit Animas, which makes insulin pumps, and DexCom Inc, which makes continuous glucose monitoring devices, to develop and test an artificial pancreas system. The ultimate goal is to create a device that can check patients blood day and night, during and between meals, and deliver insulin as required.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The description of type 1 diabetes in this story is a bit sensational. If type 1 diabetes is left untreated, the story states, "blood vessels and nerves are destroyed, organs fail and patients die." 
While this is technically true, patients with type 1 diabetes are treated and their experiences with the disease, while often frustrating and frightening, are not well-represented by this overly dramatic one-sentence description. We’ll flag this one for disease-mongering.

According to a network meta-analysis research article published in the May 1, 2018 issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (JAAOS), the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) naproxen was ranked most effective in individual knee OA treatment for improving both pain and function, and is considered a relatively safe and low-cost treatment method. This new research analyzed data from multiple trials to determine the relative effectiveness of various nonsurgical treatments for knee OA. "Using a statistical ranking technique, we worked to provide evidence regarding which of the most common NSAIDs are most likely to decrease pain and improve function, and we attempted to fill in the gaps in evidence for more inconclusive treatments such as HA, PRP, and corticosteroids." Authors analyzed 53 randomized controlled trials that examined knee OA treatments for at least 28 days and included a minimum of 30 participants per study group. "While the information in this analysis is helpful to physicians, patients also can benefit from these findings and use it with their doctors to weigh all possible treatment options."
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The news release leads off with the statement that an “estimated 45 percent of people are at risk of developing knee osteoarthritis (OA) in their lifetime.” The journal article also leads with this statistic. However, the “45 percent” figure comes from a study of people living in one county in rural North Carolina. Another recent study estimates a far lower lifetime risk of about 14 percent. The authors of the latter report addressed the discrepancy, writing that the North Carolina study looked at an older population with different sex, race and weight distributions than the US population as a whole… and it noted that people without knee problems might have been less likely to stay in touch with researchers, which could lead to a higher estimate of lifetime risk.

The chemo failure was the latest in a string of personal setbacks. The pills have kept her cancer from growing. There are side effects, of course. And Zelboraf is expensive, though it's free to Anselmo because she's taking it as part of a study. There's no way to predict when.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The opening quote from the patient profiled in this story is dramatic:”‘Oh my God, you’re history.’ It’s like a death sentence.”  Given the poor survival statistics associated with this type of cancer, that type of reaction is certainly understandable. But if a story is going to lead with an alarming statement like that, we’d also expect it to provide some backing in the form of dispassionate, evidence-based figures about survival. Otherwise it’s not clear whether patients typically have weeks or years to live following a diagnosis.

TUESDAY, Oct. 11, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- A small, preliminary study finds that ginger root supplements seem to reduce inflammation in the intestines -- a potential sign that the pills might reduce the risk of colon cancer. However, more study needs to be done, and the researchers aren't yet recommending that people head to the supplements' aisle or start gobbling up more ginger at meal times. Previous research in animals has suggested that ginger can reduce inflammation but isn't potentially toxic to the stomach like aspirin, Zick noted. If more funding becomes available, the researchers hope to launch a larger study, Zick said. But for now, she said, "if you want to embrace ginger because you like the taste, go ahead," but there's no solid evidence that it prevents colon cancer.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: There is no evidence given that the kind of inflammation measured in study participants’ intestines is at all related to colon cancer.
Yet the headline reads: “Ginger Supplements Might Ease Inflammation Linked to Colon Cancer”
Is all stomach inflammation so linked?
Readers may think that inflammation itself is worrisome, when in fact inflammatory markers are always present to varying degrees.

Researcher Dr. Harri Hemila, of the University of Helsinki in Finland, reviewed 13 placebo-controlled trials examining the effect of zinc lozenges on cold infections. "Much of the variation in the published study findings can be explained by the daily dose of zinc administered in the zinc lozenges," said Hemila, who funded the research himself. The study is published in The Open Respiratory Medicine Journal. Allowing the lozenge to dissolve instead of swallowing it seemed to provide a therapeutic effect. Since then, more than a dozen studies have been carried out, but data on the trace mineral's effectiveness has been mixed.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The story says there’s no “cure” for the common cold “but there may be a way to shorten its misery.”  Yet it doesn’t discuss the fact that most colds for most people are self-limiting and of short duration.  And what is the average duration of this “misery”?

The patients underwent a minimally invasive interventional radiology procedure in which, with the help of CT imaging, a needle is guided to the location of the bulging disc and nerve root. Of the 80 patients treated, 81 percent were pain free one year after a single 10-minute treatment session. Six patients required a second pulsed radiofrequency session. Ninety percent of the patients were able to avoid surgical treatment. "Evolving technologies like this image-guided treatment may help a substantial number of patients avoid surgery."
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The release overstates the severity of the problem of low back pain, and it doesn’t need to. Pain is a very real problem in the United States and around the world. But stating that “Low back pain is an extremely common problem that affects at least 80 percent of the population at some point in their lifetime” is emphasizing something that may be intermittent or even acute for a few years and making it seem like it is constant. The actual prevalence of low back pain globally is about 8,500 cases for every 100,000 people, according to the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.
So, while it may technically be true that 80 percent of us will “at some point” experience low back pain, we feel like providing the actual prevalence of low back pain would be a more realistic context.
Further, this study focuses on those with back and leg pain due to a disc herniation. Disc herniations only represent a small fraction of patients with low back pain. Moreover, these patients had symptoms for more than 3 months. Most patients (around 75 percent) with a disc herniation improve over time without invasive treatment. So the actual population studied here is a fraction of the low back pain population that is mentioned in the title and the start of this piece.

Of the 444 patients with lung cancer, 318 died during the three years of follow-up, the researchers wrote. It’s diagnosed in 110,000 women and 118,000 men a year in the United States alone. It wouldn’t be difficult to eat enough soy to be protected, Patel noted. “People should consider eating a diet that is healthy. How can people add soy to their diets?
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: This was a tricky call. The story calls lung cancer “the No. 1 cancer killer across the world,” and gives various lung cancer statistics describing a huge toll in the United States. The story qualifies these statements by noting that the Chinese women in this study were overwhelmingly non-smokers, and that lung cancer in non-smokers is probably a different disease than in smokers. But it never completely closes the loop on what this all means for women in the USA and other Western countries who are trying to make sense of these findings. Smoking accounts for some 87% of lung cancer deaths in the USA, according to the American Cancer Society, and the rate of lung cancer in nonsmoking women is much lower in the USA than it is in China. The upshot is that the findings probably have much less relevance for women in USA than they do for Chinese women. The story should have stated this more clearly.

With roots in autism treatment theories that until now have lived mostly on the Internet, the pediatric clean room plan would be the first of its kind in a mainstream American hospital environment. Basically, it would be pushing a "reset" button on the child's body, with the hope of wiping autistic symptoms away. The Children's Institute plan would be taking what is arguably a fringe movement into the mainstream: It would be the first autism treatment of this kind staged in an American hospital setting. With so many doubts -- and so few answers -- about effective autism treatments among the growing community of families affected by the condition, the institute said openness is vital to the experimental method's success. But a significant portion of parents will feel good about this and watch this with incredible interest.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: This article fails to mention that "autism" is a misnomer and that the correct term is "autism spectrum disorders".  This disorder ranges from the severely disabling to less severe syndromes, such as Asberger’s syndrome.  Readers should be wary about "Hail Mary" stories when the subject is a disorder for which no clear cure now exists, and which can be so very painful and heart-breaking for sufferers and their families.  By stating that "autism" is "skyrocketing," the story engages in disease mongering by using emotional terms with vague meanings.

While patients have access to more quality treatment therapies than ever before, the disease is still regarded as an incurable condition that often leads to death for those affected. The hope is that the therapies will eradicate the disease in a significant proportion of patients and measure disease response more accurately than ever before. As it stands, patients with billions of cancer cells in their bodies and patients with true disease eradication will both appear to be in complete remission using current methods to measure disease response to therapy. More than improving the results of the initial treatment, the MASTER study will treat patients for the necessary time to confirm elimination of minimal residual disease and then discontinue therapy. The MASTER trial is supported by Amgen and Janseen, both with drug and finaincial support.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The release cites an accurate number of new multiple myeloma cases (more than 25,000/year), but the lead phrase “Multiple myeloma is the second most common type of blood cancer in the United States” creates an exaggerated impression. The American Cancer Society calls multiple myeloma “a relatively uncommon cancer.” The ACS estimates it accounts for about 2 percent of all cancer cases and deaths.

Even after the Women’s Health Initiative news broke, some women couldn’t face the changes without hormone treatment. The sheer number of choices today and the need for a thorough initial health assessment make the decision on hormone therapy highly dependent on close communication between a woman and her doctor, experts say. “This requires a thorough exam and a thorough history, and individualized care, but women need to know: It’s not a death sentence or a dependence. The doctors emphasized not just the medical benefits, but that the treatment can enable and boost a woman’s overall day-to-day existence, too. Too many women have been taught to accept suffering in this stage of life, they say.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The article presents several examples of disease mongering language as applied to menopause:
” It’s not a death sentence or a dependence…”
” You don’t have to suffer..”
” treatment can enable and boost a woman’s overall day-to-day existence”
” Too many women have been taught to accept suffering in this stage of life”

In cases where a diagnosis isn't necessarily clear-cut, the DaTscan offers important advances in patient care and treatment, said Dr. Michael Rezak, director of the Movement Disorders Center at Central DuPage Hospital, where the scan is offered. "DaTscan is used in difficult-to-diagnose cases and must be used in conjunction with a clinical evaluation and a patient's response to medications," Rezak said. Before the test, Ramas, of West Chicago, experienced two years of uncertainty about his health as several specialists tried to pinpoint the cause of his joint and tendon pain, fatigue, stiffness in his legs and lack of bladder control. He visited the emergency room at Central DuPage, where he was sent to Rezak, who told him about DaTscan. Since June, 25 men and women of all ages have been tested with DaTscan at Central DuPage, Rezak said.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The article does a poor job describing who this should be used for. Parkinson’s is a clinical diagnosis that is readily made by physicians without the need for such a test. Although the story does report prominently that the DaTscan test is intended for use in “difficult-to-diagnose cases of Parkinson’s disease or other parkinsonian syndromes,” it should have noted that these groups represent only about 5 percent of patients. What’s more, the patient example and other sections of the story would likely lead readers to believe that the test is useful in many patients who do not fit the population for which the test was approved. Indeed, the story generally flips the intended use upside down, creating an impression that the DaTscan detects cases of Parkinson’s disease that other tests and exams may miss, when actually the test is intended to help doctors rule out Parkinson’s in patients who actually have some other condition. A news release from GE Healthcare says the test may help reduce the cost of care by “preventing patients from receiving misdiagnoses or inappropriate treatment.”

These results, published today online ahead of print in the American Journal of Medicine, with an accompanying editorial by the editor-in-chief, show that Plaque HD®, produced statistically significant reductions in dental plaque and inflammation throughout the body as measured by hs-CRP. The original research from the landmark Physician's Health Study, in which Hennekens was the founding principal investigator, was the first to demonstrate that hs-CRP predicted future heart attacks and strokes. This investigator initiated randomized trial was published in collaboration with academic collaborators from the University of Illinois at the Chicago School of Dentistry and the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. Based on these findings, Hennekens and colleagues are drafting an investigator initiated research grant proposal to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under the direction of co-author Patrick E. McBride, M.D., M.P.H., professor of medicine and interim associate dean for faculty affairs at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. This large scale randomized trial will test whether Plaque HD® reduces risks of heart attacks and strokes.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: This release illustrates a recurring problem with disease-oriented rather than patient-oriented evidence. The release ties dental plaque and hs-CRP test levels more tightly to heart attacks and strokes than is justified. It begins by stating, “For decades, research has suggested a link between oral health and inflammatory diseases affecting the entire body — in particular, heart attacks and strokes.” But it doesn’t explain how nuanced those links are. Indeed, the value of CRP testing is hotly debated. It is typically recommended only for people having a hard time deciding whether or not to begin statin drug treatment. The release strongly (and improperly) implies that everyone, regardless of their individual heart disease risk, would benefit from something that lowers hs-CRP levels. Indeed, almost 40 percent of the trial participants were dropped from the hs-CRP comparisons because their levels were already low. If researchers decided that more than a third of the trial participants were unlikely to see any meaningful reduction in their hs-CRP levels, the release should have noted that many people have no reason to think that this product could reduce their heart disease risk.

because it is very good at carrying genetic material into T-cells. But at the 11th hour, a battery of blood tests gave the researchers a clue as to what might help save Emma: her level of one of the cytokines, interleukin-6 or IL-6, had shot up a thousandfold. Some patients have had the cells for years. But Mr. Hoppenot said Novartis was taking a different path with cancer drugs, looking for treatments that would have a big, unmistakable impact on a small number of patients. But such drugs tend to be extremely expensive.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: While certainly a terrible disease, acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a treatable cancer. The 5-year survival rate (percentage of patients who live at least 5 years after their cancer is diagnosed), is more than 85%, according to the American Cancer Society, and many patients who survive that long are considered cured because relapse is rare. This story focused on one of the worst case scenarios, and didn’t provide readers with this larger perspective.
The competing Philadelphia Inquirer story at least briefly referenced the 85% estimate.

Now, says Senay, a study in the Archives of Internal Medicine shows calcium supplements do reduce the risk of fractures in elderly women, but only among those who take them regularly. Calcium recommendations vary according to age. It's important to note that calcium intakes on food labels are based on adult requirements of 1,000 milligrams per day. Remember, Senay urged: Most people can achieve the recommended calcium intake by eating three or four servings of dairy products and other foods that contain calcium per day. Supplements are an additional tool to be used when needed.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The story exaggerates the seriousness of osteoporosis and osteopenia (low bone mass). When we are told that “34 Million Americans have low bone mass,” we have to wonder, how is this defined? What is the seriousness of this condition? We are also told that “1 in 2 women will suffer a fracture in her lifetime.” How many of these fractures are attributable to osteoporosis or osteopenia? While these two statements may be factual, the manner in which they are presented overstates the problem and only serves to alarm the viewer.

However, with breast cancer remaining a major cause of cancer death in women, there is good reason to pursue the search for improved screening methods, according to the study's lead author, Christiane Kuhl, M.D., chair of the Department of Radiology at RWTH Aachen University in Aachen, Germany. Of the 60 cancers detected in the study group over the observation period (7,007 screening rounds), 59 were found only using MRI, one was found also by mammography, and none by mammography or ultrasound alone. The results also highlight the ability of MRI in the detection of more aggressive types of cancer. The new study showed that, consistent with previous research, breast MRI can depict these rapidly growing cancers with high reliability. According to Dr. Kuhl, interval cancers exhibit an adverse biologic profile and are the main driver of breast cancer mortality.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: Breast cancer’s prevalence in cancer-related deaths in women was highlighted but not overstated.
But we aren’t told whether the 20 cases of non-invasive cancer identified were ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). There’s wide debate on whether the presence of these types of abnormal cells should even be referred to as cancer. The lack of clarity on the types of cancer identified and the difference between them earns a Not Satisfactory rating.

The latest findings from Kozyrskyj and her team's work on fecal samples collected from infants registered in the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development study build on two decades of research that show children who grow up with dogs have lower rates of asthma. Her team of 12, including study co-author and U of A post-doctoral fellow Hein Min Tun, take the science one step closer to understanding the connection by identifying that exposure to pets in the womb or up to three months after birth increases the abundance of two bacteria, Ruminococcus and Oscillospira, which have been linked with reduced childhood allergies and obesity, respectively. "The abundance of these two bacteria were increased twofold when there was a pet in the house," said Kozyrskyj, adding that the pet exposure was shown to affect the gut microbiome indirectly--from dog to mother to unborn baby--during pregnancy as well as during the first three months of the baby's life. In other words, even if the dog had been given away for adoption just before the woman gave birth, the healthy microbiome exchange could still take place. What's more, Kozyrskyj's study suggested that the presence of pets in the house reduced the likelihood of the transmission of vaginal GBS (group B Strep) during birth, which causes pneumonia in newborns and is prevented by giving mothers antibiotics during delivery.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: There is no obvious disease mongering here, but the release might plant the suggestion that if readers don’t own a dog and don’t expose their infant to dog-related bacteria, then they may be exposing their children to a greater risk of some form of allergy or even obesity later on. It’s important for releases about association studies like this one was to describe the prevalence of a disease or condition so that people have a sense of what the normal rate of allergies might be in households with or without a dog.

The study also found a significant percentage of women would qualify for other breast screening methods, including breast MRI and genetic testing, Plichta said. The analysis was designed to look at new breast cancer screening guidelines from the American Cancer Society and the American Society of Breast Surgeons. "Furthermore, risk assessment is needed not only to determine who qualifies for mammography, but also who may require screening MRIs and/or genetic testing." Fifty percent of these women met either the ACS or the ASBS requirements for early mammography, Plichta said. Breast cancer risk assessments are typically not a part of standard care for this age group, the researchers noted.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: In the first line of the story it states that “…all women turning 40 should get a breast cancer risk assessment, since half of them may have risks that are high enough to warrant annual mammograms right away.” This sentence alone makes it sound like this risk is in the general population instead of a finding from the study of women visiting a breast specialty clinic.
In addition to mammography-screening mongering, the article states that “the researchers also found that 32 percent of the women met the groups’ eligibility standards for regular screening MRIs, and 25 percent would be eligible for genetic testing.” There is no mention of problems associated with MRI screening or of the significant cost of this screening. Even a co-pay for an MRI can be hundreds of dollars.  Eligibility for genetic testing should be determined by a certified genetic counselor, not by a database review.

Not every patient feels that way. But spinal cord stimulators offer significant relief to only about half the patients who try them. Every patient received conventional pain treatment, but half were also given a spinal cord implant. Another concern is that patients who require high doses of stimulation drain the battery quickly, requiring surgery to replace the device. Doctors say simple adjustments to the device may solve that problem.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The article does not make clear that the study upon which the story is based concerned patients for whom an initial surgery had failed.  The story suggests that the procedure might be an alternative to initial surgery.  The story also mentions complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) as an indication for use of the device.  But the study did not address this condition.  Radicular pain – so-called "neuropathic pain" in the source study is not CRPS.  Finally, the second paragraph suggests that this is an alternative for chronic pain.  This is too bold a message while the jury is not yet in.

"It was life-changing. Now he's trying something that might seem shocking: an electrical current applied to his head - part of a clinical trial at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York. Since then, the technique has been refined. This new approach places them right on the scalp. Could this could work for all kinds of pain?
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The story opens with an extraordinary anecdote, exaggerating both the severity of chronic pain and the potential of the treatment to help. 
Yet it states that up to 1 in 4 Americans suffer from chronic pain, and 1 in 10 have it for over a year. 
The number of people who suffer the kind of pain as the featured patient is likely much smaller than these figures imply. The segment should have stated this. The true prevalence of chronic pain is unknown.  It depends on the definition used and the population surveyed.

But researchers are exploring a new use for medical imaging that could shorten the stay in purgatory, possibly revealing within a few days whether chemo is working. As a practical matter, the goal of researchers is to convince federal regulators to cover the procedure under Medicare and Medicaid, which would open the door to routine use. Graham said there are maybe a dozen published human studies so far, most involving too few patients to draw a firm conclusion. The hope is that, over time, FLT PET would prove reliable for giving a faster answer on whether an experimental treatment is working. That would save companies a lot of money, because they could spot ineffective drugs more quickly and not waste further research on them.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The story dramatizes one patient’s story in a way that overemphasizes the emotional impact not of treatment, but of having to wait for weeks or longer to learn whether a cancer treatment is working. It suggests the novel use of PET scans could "shorten [the patient’s] stay in purgatory" by providing an answer "possibly within days."
The writer uses loaded language to describe the patient’s status, and at the end includes a vivid, dramatic quote in which the patient who did not have access to this PET scan technology compares his situation to "having a rope tied around you and you’re leaning over a canyon at about a 45-degree angle, and you don’t know if someone is going to pull you back in. . . " 
We have no idea whether the patient is receiving the experimental treatment. We learn later that he was diagnosed in 2005 and that with conventional treatments his cancer has remained stable. 
The overall effect is to magnifity the problem and overpromise a solution–a nearly "perfect" illustration of disease-mongering.

Implanted in the patient’s chest after the diseased heart is removed, it uses information gleaned from sensors to mimic the activity of the natural organ. Carmat estimates its device will cost $176,000 to $226,000. The device was developed over 15 years by a team that included Alain F. Carpentier, the French surgeon-scientist who, along with Albert Starr, received the 2007 Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research. SynCardia, based in Tucson, currently makes the only approved temporary artificial heart, having continued development of the groundbreaking Jarvik-7, which Dr. William C. DeVries implanted in a retired dentist named Barney B. Clark in 1982. Another device is being developed by scientists at the Helmholtz-Institute for Biomedical Engineering at the University of Aachen in Germany.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The story concludes: 
The broad "heart disease as leading cause of death" is not directly applicable to the target population for an artificial heart.  One woman’s single vessel coronary artery disease – which qualifies as heart disease – is not another person’s end-stage heart failure. So even with the qualifying followup comments from the company exec, the story let him get away with a disease-mongering premise to start with.

Podiatrists have begun using a laser treatment that combats the infection — or wastes their patients’ money because it doesn’t work, depending on whom you ask. The treatment, in which the podiatrist aims a laser beam at the patient’s toenails to kill the organisms that cause the fungus, costs about $1,000 and is not covered by insurance because it is considered an aesthetic procedure. In this case, there is a chance.”

Even John Strisower, the founder of PinPointe USA, says patients should expect at least a minimal reinfection within five years after laser treatment. There’s no one route of infection, but sources include pedicures and locker room showers. “I’ve had patients come in who have had laser procedures and not seen long-term success.”

Firestone also says that over-the-counter antifungal nail creams and ointments rarely work because they can’t penetrate the nail root.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: This is where the story really sunk low. It frames the story like “Jaws” for people with funky feet.
“For people with toenail fungus, there is no good time to wear sandals. Not even at the beach in July. Toenail fungus causes nails to become thick, yellow and brittle in a way that looks pretty ugly and can be painful.”
We can just see the readers reaching for their shoes as they read that lead. No way are they going to the beach after reading this. It gets worse, though.
“Sufferers can spend years and hundreds of dollars trying to clear the infection with drugs, topical treatments and home remedies, sometimes to no avail.”
When will the agony end, the readers ask themselves. Cue the dramatic music, as Washington podiatrist Stephen J. Kominsky leaps up out of the page to say: “The problem is huge. It is bigger than you can imagine. …I would say 70 percent of the patients who come into my office have fungal infections on their toenails.”
Kominsky goes unchallenged for most of the article, despite his apparent lack of documented proof for any of his statements and the fact that he has every incentive to want to sell these treatments to the feet shy masses.
Finally, profiling one patient who “did not want his full name associated with toenail fungus” paints this as a scourge of society.
This is some pretty classic disease-mongering at play.

But doctors say they should: these veins are not just a cosmetic problem, but can also lead to aches, pain, and heaviness from blood pooling in the legs. A series of sessions is usually required for a large area. “Otherwise they’ll just come back.”

Today, sluggish underlying veins are best addressed with radio-frequency or laser treatment, said Dr. Min, who developed such a laser. She said veins as large as a Sharpie marker can be tackled with foam sclerotherapy. So injecting it is an off-label use.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The story claims that doctors believe everyone with varicose veins should seek out medical care. Excerpt: 
Really?  How many doctors?  Who are these doctors?  Are they doctors who stand to gain from treating this condition? This is a terribly misleading generalization. While it is true that a minority of patients are at risk of more serious medical problems related to their varicose veins, the vast majority of people have nothing to fear and don’t need to see a doctor. The article should have emphasized the benign nature of most varicose veins and identified the uncommon circumstances under which people should seek out medical attention for potential health risks.

Why should women bear the brunt of infertility testing? When it comes to infertility, the burden seems to often fall on women. As SpermCheck’s website puts it, a “trip to a fertility clinic for a semen analysis is not for everyone. For women who are having trouble getting pregnant, the test may very well be one they — and not their squeamish partners — snap up along with over-the-counter ovulation kits. “Men don’t say, ‘Let me go to the urologist and give a semen sample.’” That reluctance has created a $440 million-a-year market for male fertility tests in the U.S., Lopez says.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: One definition of disease-mongering includes the attempt to expand the market for diagnoses – and for products that address those diagnoses.
This story allows the chairman of SpermCheck to say. “This at-home test was created to meet the needs of couples who are considering and just planning on starting a family, those currently having trouble conceiving” and “even those men who are just curious about their sperm count.”
This plants the seed of expanding the market for the test to “the curious”  – a potentially unlimited market.  Nice – if you’re a company chairman.  Less than independent vetting – if you’re in journalism.

As more women postpone motherhood into their 30s, even 40s, they're hitting that age-old constraint: the biological clock. Now, technology is dangling the possibility that women can stop that clock, at least for a while. All told, costs can easily exceed $40,000, money Montoro doesn't have. And yet, even Widra agrees that egg freezing has appeal if it can help avoid the anguish of infertility. The bigger challenge, Sher and others say, is reaching out to younger women — getting them to take action before it's too late.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: Our medical editor who reviewed this story felt there were elements of disease-mongering in the framing of the story. She wrote: “I am not sure that waiting until you are out of the window for a specific biologic function is a disease. The story framing almost makes a disease out of a life choice in this particular example of women who want to risk waiting until they might not be expected to have normal fecundability/fertility and higher risk.”
Is “Nudging Young Women To Think About Fertility” akin to creating a new disease that’s not really a disease?

In a study published in the journal Nature, scientists from the British drugmaker collaborating with the charity Cancer Research UK (CRUK) and Cellzome AG found that the experimental drug, called I-BET151, mimics a chemical tag which is key to preventing the process of activating the leukemia genes. “This ... is an exciting new avenue for drug discovery which we hope will be useful for other types of cancer in addition to MLL-leukaemias,” said Tony Kouzarides of the Wellcome Trust/CRUK Gurdon Institute at Cambridge University, who co-led the study. This disrupts the normal function of MLL by creating a new “fusion protein” that behaves wrongly, switching on genes that drive the development of leukemia. Using I-BET151 to treat leukaemias in mice and human cancer cells in a lab, the researchers found that the chemical could halt the disease, paving the way for more research to be done in first-stage, or so-called Phase I, human trials. “We urgently need better ways to treat children with more aggressive forms of leukemia, such as MLL,” said Lesley Walker, CRUK’s director of information.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The story suggests (as did the news release upon which it was based) that up to 80% of leukemia cases in patients under the age of 2 years involve the MLL fusion protein. Important as this is, it is a bit misleading to the average reader. 
According to the National Cancer Institute the variant is present in up to 5% of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases
The decision to focus on the 80% number can be viewed as disease mongering because it has the clear potential to inflate the importance of the findings.

Mancini presented the results Monday at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association (AHA) in Chicago. The enzyme regulates calcium cycling, which, in turn, is involved in how well the heart contracts, the researchers said. After that, the only option is a transplant. At both six months and a year later, the patients who had received the new gene saw their risk for death, cardiac transplantation, worsening heart failure and hospitalization decline by half. Results were even more heartening at higher doses, where participants had an 88 percent decrease in risk for death, cardiac transplant, hospitalizations and other outcomes, the study authors said.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: Although a quote from one of the researchers and another line in the body of the story refer to patients with “advanced heart failure,” the headline and lead of the story refer to just “heart failure,” which includes a far broader range of people. A company news release defined the trial participants has having moderate to severe heart failure and significantly impaired pumping function of their hearts and less than half the normal ability to transport and utilize oxygen during exercise testing. The story should have been clear from the top about the severity of disease in the participants in this trial. A single additional sentence would have gone a long way in addressing this.

The latest research, conducted by investigators at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, is important not only because it suggests another treatment option for patients with depression, but because it also offers news clues into the physical pathways of depression that could ultimately lead to more effective treatments. The research offers hope to patients who haven’t been helped by traditional antidepressant treatment. That’s probably the best hypothesis.”

Other studies have suggested that SAMe can relieve symptoms of depression. “In the last 60 years of depression research, all the treatments have focused on similar mechanisms of action. This is one of the first few studies that suggests a different mechanism.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: We liked how the story restricted the target population to nonresponders. However, we slap its wrist because it said the study was in adults with depression who failed antidepressant treatment. It was actually major depressive disorder and failure of 6 weeks adequately dosed with a specific class of SSRIs. 
Furthermore, it defines “nonresponders” as patients for whom “antidepressants don’t eliminate symptoms.” Eliminate is too strong, and it produces a broader definition of nonresponder than was used in the study. The trial required subjects to have at least a 16 on a particular measurement of depression symptoms, the HAM-D. According to the story, you’d think a nonresponder would be anybody for whom antidepressants didn’t eliminate symptoms (i.e., those with “normal” HAM-D scores). But that wasn’t the case. Antidepressants may have reduced their symptoms and they could still be nonresponders.
The story’s definition of nonresponder is broader than what most clinicians or researchers woul duse; the standard is two or more failed trials.

Experts described the study results as phenomenal and said the device, developed by German researchers, could eventually change the lives of up to 200,000 people worldwide who suffer from blindness due to a degenerative eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa. “We have shown that people can be provided with enough useful vision for daily life,” he said in a telephone interview. He could even read a clock face and differentiate between seven shades of grey, the researchers said. The implant device, which sits completely within the eye, is a tiny plate, measuring just 3 mm squared and a 10th of a millimeter thick, which has around 1,500 tiny light sensors connected to amplifiers and electrodes. Robert Maclaren, a professor of Ophthalmology at Britain’s Oxford University and a consultant retinal surgeon at the Oxford Eye Hospital, who was not involved in this trial, said he was “very excited” by Zrenner’s results.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The story engages in disease mongering by throwing in some sketchy numbers about the frequency of the disease. It says the device “could eventually change the lives of up to 200,000 people worldwide who suffer from blindness due to a degenerative eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa.” Later it says, “Retinitis pigmentosa in a genetic eye condition that leads to blindness and affects about 1 in 4,000 people worldwide.” By our math, 200,000 out of 6.8 billion people worldwide means that 1 out of every 34,500 people is affected. And if we’re just talking about adults, that number drops to 1 out of every 22,105 people, a far cry from 1 out of every 4,000. If it were truly one out of every 4,000 people worldwide, that would mean that 1.1 million people have the disease.

In some cases, the cause is unclear. Thirty-five study participants had this form of vertigo. Preventative medication was given to 20 of the 35 people with the newly detected type of vertigo. Of these, one-third saw their symptoms reduced or they recovered completely. The others' outcomes were not revealed.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: There is no pathophysiological or biological basis for the disease and only the vaguest of information about the disease as being defined simply by an abnormal test. The story should have provided some counter-balance to this viewpoint — is it really a new diagnosis?

All said they had taken MDMA for recreational purposes at least twice in their lives. Each session lasted at least 4.5 hours, or until all effects of the drug had worn off. This effect, the Bedi and his team suggested, could help people improve their social skills by shielding them from the negative emotions of others. "More controlled research is needed to establish whether MDMA can safely and effectively add to psychotherapy for some conditions and, if so, what the mechanisms of these effects are," Bedi said. Dr. Michael Mithoefer, author of the earlier study on MDMA and PTSD, also urged further exploration of the medicinal potential of the drug.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: There is no discussion of whether problems connecting with others socially is a disease that must be treated. This is a major issue. First, are we talking about social awkwardness or social phobia? There is a real danger of medicalizing a non-medical problem. Second, the study was done in NORMAL VOLUNTEERS. The idea of improving peoples’ ability to connect socially is SPECULATION.

Moon and colleagues studied these responses in 10 athletes who had experienced the condition while exercising or competing in triathlons. One study participant, triathlete Katherine Calder-Becker, said her bouts with SIPE threatened to end her competitive career. Moon said larger studies are needed to replicate the results and learn more about possible adverse side effects of the drug. He also said research is ongoing to further illuminate the causes of SIPE and potential ways of diagnosing it early. In addition to Moon, study authors include Stefanie D. Martina, Dionne F. Peacher, Jennifer F. Potter, Tracy E. Wester, Anne D. Cherry, Michael J. Natoli, Claire E. Otteni, Dawn N. Kernagis, William D. White, and John J. Freiberger.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The release offers no information about the incidence of this condition among swimmers and divers and, because this condition is rare, it could unnecessarily raise some alarms. And while it makes clear that the symptoms of swimming-induced pulmonary edema “often” disappear over the course of 24 hours in the subset of swimmers and divers who have the condition, it also notes that the problem can be fatal, again without providing any incidence data. The reader will likely be more concerned than she or he should be.

The pill is his blood pressure medication. He is responsible for the institute's public health campaign called Mind Your Risks. When blood pressure rises, it strains the tiny blood vessels that keep brain cells alive, Koroshetz says. Koroshetz is using all of these approaches. And he says other people with high blood pressure should follow his lead.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The story strongly suggets that people should take blood pressure medication to lower their risk of dementia. The evidence in the story wasn’t strong enough to cross that line.
At the very least, the story should have provided links to the studies in this sentence: “At least two large studies have revealed an alarming trend among stroke patients.”
It’s also worth noting that the threshold for treatment is under debate, with some saying that blood pressure should be even lower than 130/80. New suggestions like this — that BP control can lower dementia risk — may amplify such concerns by driving even more people in for treatment without a full grasp of the tradeoffs between potential benefits and potential harms.

The scientists, whose work was published Wednesday in the Science Translational Medicine journal, said their findings offered hope for the millions of people who go blind each year because of a worldwide shortage of corneas for donation. “This study ... is the first to show that an artificially fabricated cornea can integrate with the human eye and stimulate regeneration,” said May Griffith of the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, who led the study. The patients were monitored for two years after surgery. The biosynthetic corneas also became sensitive to touch and the treated eyes began producing normal tears, the researchers said. Fagerholm said the patients in this trial had no problems with rejection and did not need long-term immune suppression drugs to help their bodies accept the corneas.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: Because of the tone of the story and the focus on the "millions" who might be saved from blindness and not on the limitations of the study, this story veers into disease mongering. It says, "Loss of vision due to corneal disease or trauma affects over 10 million people a year, but lack of access to donor tissue limits the number of transplants, particularly in poorer countries. In the United States, an estimated 42,000 corneal grafts a year are performed using tissue from posthumous donors, but there are sometimes problems with rejection and experts say failure rates are significant." Both of these statistics needed attribution, especially given that there are conflicting statistics in other coverage of the same study. The statistics do not come from the press release.

Dr. Biesecker acknowledged that there was no guarantee of success. That strategy alone, Dr. Biesecker said, has eliminated the vast majority of candidate genes. Researchers’ ignorance of these control regions and what many of them do might doom the effort. Still, Mr. Del Sontro is preparing for the worst. His disease casts a dark shadow, not just on him, but on his entire family.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The story describes this research through the prism of a single family with a strong history of early atherosclerosis, which is a risk factor for clinical events, but not a fait accompli. The story makes no attempt to quantify how common this situation is. The story should have made it clearer that most cardiovascular disease occurs in individuals with traditional risk factors, and that addressing these factors is an effective way to reduce risk.

"The exactness of bypass surgery is so high that many people are reluctant to do it without tactile as well as visual feedback." Srivastava said it is true that the normal sense of touch is missing from robotic work, and that is a shortcoming, but it can be overcome with practice. The maker of the robotic systems, Intuitive Surgical Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., is an enthusiastic backer of the University of Chicago's initiative. Even though they cost, on average, $1.5 million, the robot systems are gaining popularity. For Mary Lou Coulter, 77, of Westville, Ind., the main aftereffect of her robotic procedure was some soreness and numbness.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: Quoting the marketing director of the company that makes the robotic systems, the story suggests that bypass surgery may be safer than using a stent to keep an artery open, generating fears about the safety of stents. The data about stent risk is complex and in dispute. This implication of greater risk from stenting should not have been reported unless it was investigated further.

Dr. Prem Chattoo, a New York based gastroenterologist, told FoxNews.com that the balloon is placed it into the stomach through the mouth. In addition to eliminating the scarring and risks involved with more invasive options, Chattoo said that the recovery time is also much faster. The hope is that patients can train their body to eat in a much healthier fashion without feeling overly hungry. “We might be able to prevent young, healthy people from having these chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension,” Chattoo said. Chattoo said that even if the balloon were to pop, the saline would be absorbed and pose no harm to the patient.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: A story can be guilty of disease mongering if it conflates a risk factor with a disease. This story clearly treats weight loss as the health goal, even singling out cosmetic reasons as a reasonable rationale for using Orbera. What’s more, based on this story, one could be forgiven for thinking that trying to lose weight is a health problem in itself. As the opening sentence notes: “America’s ongoing battle with weight-loss that [sic] has led to fad diets and invasive surgeries like gastric bypass and stomach stapling.” A doctor quoted in the story, who provides Orbera for his clients, says that Orbera may “be able to prevent young, healthy people from having these chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension.” That would depend on how much weight the people lost, and how heavy they were to begin with. No one medical intervention is going to prevent chronic diseases associated with obesity — and it’s not clear from the story whether Orbera would help them lose weight in the first place.

Chinese manufacturers gave the first hint a week ago that one dose could be enough. Thus the CSL study, rushed out by the New England Journal of Medicine late Thursday, is welcome news. One dose means tight supplies of H1N1 vaccine won't be stretched so thin after all. The U.S. has ordered 195 million doses, based on the hope that 15 micrograms was indeed the right dose. Waiting to get the first inoculation out of the way "is not in anybody's best interest," added Dr. Nancy Nielsen, past president of the American Medical Association.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: 


 
The story reports that the seasonal flu “every year kills 36,000 Americans and hospitalizes 200,000” and that H1N1 swine flu is already causing outbreaks in schools. As a result of reporting these disconnected facts, without also reporting anything about what is known about the severity of swine flu, readers may get the impression that there will be widespread swine flu deaths at schools, perhaps even concluding that if swine is likely to hit more people than seasonal flu, that the death toll could be higher than the 36,000 figure mentioned.
 Although there is a great deal of uncertainty about how many people will be hospitalized or die following swine flu infection, the story should have mentioned something about the outcomes seen so far.

Newswise — Chicago – Chronic back and leg pain sufferers in search of better pain relief options may have a new choice. Given the prevalence of chronic pain, high frequency SCS is an exciting advance for our patients.”



SCS is an increasingly common therapy that delivers electric pulses to the spinal cord, through a small device implanted under the skin, for difficult to treat chronic pain in the trunk and limbs. Identifying a new intervention that does not rely on paresthesia to mask pain is novel to SCS and has the potential to improve pain relief and quality of life for these complex patients. None of the patients in the HF10 therapy group experienced paresthesia. HF10 therapy remained more effective than traditional SCS over the 12 month study period.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The release succumbs to exaggeration, noting that “More than 1.5 billion people worldwide suffer from chronic pain, with lower back pain being the most frequent condition affecting 23 to 26 percent of the population.” The release should’ve kept the discussion limited to back and leg pain and the specific kind of patients who would be candidates for this device — not every person in the world who suffers from chronic pain. By throwing out such numbers, the release takes on a promotional tone — as if its purpose is to increase interest in the procedure from anyone with chronic back pain.

New trials of a breakthrough swallowable sensor have revealed the device is 3,000 times more accurate than current technology used to diagnose many gut disorders. The findings show the revolutionary gas-sensing capsule developed by researchers at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, could surpass breath testing as the benchmark for diagnosing gut disorders, paving the way to solving previously undiagnosed conditions. The vitamin pill-sized capsule, currently being commercialised by Atmo Biosciences, provides real time detection and measurement of hydrogen, carbon dioxides and oxygen in the gut. "Being able to measure these biomarkers at concentrations over 3,000 times greater than breath tests is quite astonishing. The trials were conducted with colleagues from Monash University.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The news release makes it sound like there is an epidemic of undiagnosed gastrointestinal disease occurring worldwide:
Of the one-in-five people worldwide who will suffer from a gastrointestinal disorder in their lifetime, almost a third remain undiagnosed due to lack of reliable tests available to gastroenterologists.
But the news release doesn’t provide any source for this questionable claim.
Moreover, the release suggests that that this technology will help “diagnose many gut disorders” when, in reality — even if it does get marketed (like breath testing) —  it will likely only be applicable for a very short list of very uncommon gastrointestinal ailments listed HERE [Source: Johns Hopkins Medical School].

Mango consumption helped relax blood vessels in as little as two hours after intake. Additionally, some of the participants showed favorable changes in the production of breath methane, an indication of the potential influence on gut fermentation. Measurements were taken during each visit, including heart rate and blood pressure, blood samples and breath samples, which are increasingly used in nutrition studies to evaluate gut health status. The researchers conclude that mangos may be a heart-healthy fruit that may help play a role in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. The research was supported in part by funds from the National Mango Board and USDA.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The release states that “two cups of mangos a day had beneficial effects on systolic blood pressure among healthy postmenopausal women.” However, if the women had healthy blood pressure levels already (as the release indicates), they didn’t need to lower their systolic blood pressure. Treating blood pressure as something that is inherently bad is misleading. High blood pressure can be dangerous. So can low blood pressure. It’s maintaining a healthy blood pressure that is important.

Leptin, they reasoned, tells the brain how much fat is on the body. But what if the researchers put people - fat and thin - on weight-reducing diets and gave them enough leptin to make their bodies think that they were still fat. Would the subjects still show the metabolic changes of starvation? The answer, published in the current issue of The Journal of Clinical Investigation, was that the leptin trick worked. And the leptin study suggests that the weight loss solution may eventually be a pill that tricks the brain into thinking that no weight has been lost.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: Weight loss is framed as starvation. 
The study this piece was based on fed the study subjects 800 kcal/day which is more akin to starvation than dieting. It

"The possibility of getting almost all patients nearly clear and able to live their lives without the burden of this disease impacting them every day is getting close to reality." The disease affects nearly 3 percent of the world's population, according to the World Psoriasis Day consortium, but about half of all patients with psoriasis do not get any treatment, Dr. Gordon said. The new drug works by blocking a protein specifically implicated in psoriasis, called interluekin 23; older drugs affect the immune process more generally. "By doing so, we are able to build new treatments that specifically target the immunological processes of psoriasis while leaving even more of the normal immune system intact." This study was supported by Janssen Research and Development, the manufacturer of guselkumab.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: Psoriasis is a serious health condition, but this release takes it a bit too far. For example, in the fourth paragraph, the release states that psoriasis “also increases a patient’s risk for depression, heart disease and diabetes, among other conditions.” It would have been more accurate to say that it has been associated with, or is linked to, these other conditions. While psoriasis is correlated with an increased risk of multiple adverse health outcomes, it is not known to be the cause of any of them. In most, if not all, cases we know very little about the relationship between psoriasis and those health outcomes. The release also quotes the study’s lead author as saying that “the concept that psoriasis is ‘just something you live with’ is no longer appropriate.” But that source is also cited as saying that about half of all patients with psoriasis do not get any treatment. Whether that is by choice, or because the patients don’t have access to treatments or can’t afford the newer, very expensive drugs, it’s clear that many patients with psoriasis do live with the condition. Those dealing with psoriasis already know the value of treatment, they don’t need their condition written about in a way that may stir additional concern.

WALNUT CREEK, Calif., Jan. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Child screams from the pain of earache; exhausted parent ventures to drugstore in wee hours to find…nothing. "Eardrops don't work," says Dr. Scott Morehouse, founder of ClearPop, "because the Eustachian tube, where the pain occurs, is connected to the mouth, not the outer ear." Moms have flooded https://www.facebook.com/ClearPop with glowing testimonials for this simple drug-free solution that:

EAR INFECTION AND ANTIBIOTICS

Ear infections are the Number One reason kids aged 5 and under receive oral antibiotics.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: As readers of this site know, we are reluctant to give this distinction, but in this case we feel it was warranted. Instead of just acknowledging that earaches are a bother and — as we note above — could potentially be signs of more serious illness, the release stokes fears, saying:
“Due to increasing concern about antibiotic overuse and its links to obesity, celiac disease, and Superbugs, the American Academy of Pediatrics now recommends against the use of antibiotics to treat routine ear infections in children over 2.”
The question is: Do you need to run and buy a product for a problem that likely will go away? Antibiotic or no antibiotic, the release seems to be trying to scare people into buying the product.
In addition, the release propagates the idea that antibiotics would work for ear infections but that doctors are just “reluctant to prescribe” them. This is a problematic idea that could lead to mistrust and pressure to prescribe in the pediatrician’s office.

"It almost completely knocked out the patients' skin test and blood cell allergic reactivity," said senior author Dr. Bruce Bochner, the Samuel M. Feinberg Professor of Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. A rather unlikely pairing - cancer and allergies - Bochner thought to test if a cancer drug could prevent allergic reactions by collaborating with Feinberg's oncology department. He knew that the generally well-tolerated cancer drug was successful in blocking a protein inside a cell called Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK). Anne Marie Singh and Melanie Dispenza are now testing how successful the drug is at targeting allergies to food, such as tree nuts and peanuts. If the results are favorable, the next step would be to get funding to actually test whether taking a BTK inhibitor will improve the ability of food-allergic adults to eat foods they're allergic to.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: We rarely see overt disease mongering in the news releases and stories we review. This is a notable exception. The release notes in the opening paragraph: “The promising data from this pilot study could have greater implications for adults with food allergies,” tantalizing legions of people with allergies to peanuts and other foods. Some news stories jumped on that connection. But the study did not include any people with food allergies, just one patient with a cat dander reaction and one patient with a ragweed reaction.

A product called the OFF!® Clip-On™ repellent device could be an effective tool for preventing bites from the Aedes aegypti mosquito -- the primary vector of Zika, chikungunya, dengue, and yellow fever -- according to an article in the Journal of Medical Entomology. The study was done outdoors in order to replicate real-world conditions. Clip-On caused high mosquito mortality and knockdown rates up to 0.3 meters from the device, enough to protect a single person wearing the device. The effectiveness of the device came as a pleasant surprise to the researchers. Skepticism is inherent to the trade.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: Because this release was distributed at a time when we’re seeing very dramatic and almost panicked news stories and press releases about the Zika virus it points to a form of disease mongering. The device and study seem to prey on the public fear about any exposure to the A. Egypti mosquito, the carrier of Zika and other viruses.

It is designed for patients who have not had surgery. The treatment, which includes several 20-minute procedures and rehabilitation, costs between $3,500 and $4,000.

QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: By describing a patient who “came crawling into my practice,” the story crosses the line into disease mongering. This case represents an extreme example of herniated disc. Many patients are not as bothered by symptoms. The story also starts out by saying that this is a new treatment for herniated discs, but later claims that it can be used to treat a wide variety of back pain conditions. The story also does not explain that this treatment should not be used in people who have had back pain for less than a few months, for whom exercise and time would be the best course of treatment.

The prescription change is a proxy for ineffectiveness, since switching is often the result of treatment failure due to lack of efficacy, side effects, cost, or other factors. Acne is one of the most common diseases in the world. It affects 85 percent of people under the age of 18, but it also regularly impacts adults. David J. Margolis, MD, PhD, a professor of Dermatology, was the study's senior author. The Perelman School of Medicine has been ranked among the top medical schools in the United States for more than 20 years, according to U.S. News & World Report's survey of research-oriented medical schools.

EXPLANATION: Obesity is a disease, according to many major medical groups including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, the American Medical Association, among others. But what we take issue here with is how the Newsweek headline wildly and irresponsibly speculates that this research might be an “obesity cure.” At this point, the research is far too preliminary to be linked with the word “cure” (which is one of our 8 words you shouldn’t use in medical news.)

"With recent research indicating most babies born after 1980 do not acquire Bifidobacterium at birth, our ability to detect significant levels of Bifidobacterium gives pediatricians and parents an immediate indication of whether or not their baby has this beneficial gut bacteria that set them up for lifelong health." Identifying a Disappearing, Yet Critical Piece of Gut Health

Dr. Henrick's previously published findings, which are the basis for the Evivo test, show an inverse correlation between rising infant fecal pH, reduced acetate and lactate, and lower levels of beneficial Bifidobacterium, proving that the infant gut microbiome has been rapidly changing over the last three generations. "The ability to quickly measure levels of Bifidobacterium in a stool sample would enable pediatricians to identify babies with low levels of these beneficial bacteria and take appropriate action." Evolve BioSystems' Evivo is the only baby probiotic clinically proven to restore Bifidobacterium to a baby's gut and reduce potentially harmful bacteria by 80 percent. In a landmark clinical trial, Evivo produced rapid, substantial and persistent stabilization of the infant gut microbiome, to help set a foundation for life-long health.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: This release doesn’t have any scary or over-the-top wording, but it does warn parents that not treating the microbiome in infants may lead to future health problems for their child. And that suggestion is not based on research showing a causal relationship. This appears to be a product looking for a disease that does not exist, or at the very least, a condition that is poorly understood.

Now, the Heart Institute at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center is testing a new method. Researchers hope to screen a total of 640 before they're done. Jordan was one of the more serious cases. That led to unnecessary physical restrictions of athletes. Currently, an EKG and echocardiogram would cost parents a minimum of $2,500, Anderson says.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: Although the health risks of participating in sports (even after detection of some sort of unusual heart feature) are a matter of intense debate among medical experts, this story presents any abnormality as a clear and present danger. There is no evidence presented to rule out a repeat of the Italian experience reported in the story that “led to unnecessary physical restrictions of athletes,” and yet readers are told that the teens who didn’t pass this test had health conditions that put them at imminent risk of death. Based on the statistics reported in this story, if national screening were adopted about 100,000 high students each year would be labeled has having a heart abnormality requiring lifelong monitoring.

“It was really bad,” Joyce, 29, told FoxNews.com. I was really uncomfortable and miserable.”

Joyce tried over-the-counter medications but couldn’t find relief. She consulted an allergist at Weill Cornell Medicine/New York-Presbyterian Hospital, where a clinical trial involving immunotherapy toothpaste was taking place. Joyce, who lives in the Bronx, New York, signed on for the year-long study that required six of the 12 volunteers to brush their teeth for two minutes using two pumps of the toothpaste in either the morning or night, and the other six to use drops under their tongue. Volunteers using the toothpaste were also required to log their usage in a journal.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: This story is built upon the major discomfort that allergy sufferers face and fails to offer any substantive research data backing up its claims.  It talks about “millions” of sufferers, but doesn’t quantify the total with any precision. It also presents a heart-tugging anecdote of a woman faced with the prospect of abandoning her two cats because of insufferable symptoms. We think the story goes too far both in its portrayal of the condition and the benefits of the potential toothpaste remedy.

So imagine my enthusiasm when I learned last fall that the Food and Drug Administration had finally approved the first implantable sensor to continuously measure glucose, beeping or vibrating a warning whenever levels head too high or too low. That night, however, the sensor kept beeping me awake, nearly every hour, warning that my glucose level was too high. I kept following the recommendations of the embedded calculator, taking only very small amounts of insulin to bring my sugar level down. This bionic diabetic was in rapture. Over the next six weeks of testing, I came down to earth as I realized that while the sensor enabled me to drastically cut my usual number of lows, it did not eliminate them.

The study was published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Lead author Dr. David Jenkins, Canada research chair in nutrition and metabolism at the University of Toronto and St. Michael's Hospital, had previously shown the effectiveness of a cholesterol-lowering diet when all the meals were provided to participants. To put the diet to the real-world test, participants received a one-hour counseling session with a dietitian and an illustrated study booklet at the outset and, later, received a 30-40 minute follow up session. In addition to the soy protein, nuts and whole grains, participants in the diet were encouraged to eat peas, beans and lentils. Both groups lost about four pounds over the six months.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: This story tripped our disease-mongering detector by failing to discuss or even mention why someone would care about their cholesterol levels. High LDL cholesterol is not a disease, it is a heart disease risk factor. The LA Times, by comparison, reported: “Cleveland Clinic’s Nissen stressed that researchers did not directly measure rates of coronary heart disease — just LDL cholesterol — so the health effects of the portfolio diet are not yet clear.”
The CNN post makes it sound like lowering cholesterol is an end in and of itself. That’s the kind of mindset that leads to more medical treatment instead of better medical treatment.

It's estimated that every year 12 million Americans go to the doctor seeking help for headaches. "I think there's a subconscious perception that more is better, and that fancier, more expensive tests are better and that equals better care." He only looked at otherwise healthy patients who suffered chronic headaches. Bernstein says she sees lots of desperate patients like Bradford. She has far fewer headaches and when she does have them, they're far less severe.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: We’re flagging the story for several problems that collectively rise to the level of Not Satisfactory:
1. The narrow focus on one patient’s extreme experience with migraines compared to the lack of focus on any meaningful evidence about how to relieve migraine symptoms.
2. The extrapolation of this one patient’s experience to “12 million Americans” and then to “one quarter of the population,” which would be about 80 million people. This seems high, and there is no reference provided for the number.
3. The anecdotal evidence presented as fact without any attempt to back it up. The story says:
Over the years, Bradford, who is 50 years old and lives in Bedford, Mass., has searched desperately for pain relief. She’s been to the doctor countless times for countless tests. “Everything I’ve had, I’ve had twice,” she says. “I’ve had two spinal taps; I’ve had so many nerve blocks I’ve lost count.”
Has she really been to the doctor so many times that it is impossible to count? This feels needlessly dramatic. Perhaps a walk through the woman’s documented medical history would have supported the same point without that feeling of over-dramatization. Even well-meaning people can provide misleading information about their own medical histories, especially if a condition has been ongoing for years.
Those three components make this story feel off-kilter, and take the focus off of the thoughtful exploration of potential solutions.

"It has been shown to reduce impulsiveness in a variety of disorders such as alcohol dependence, schizophrenia and ADHD. There is mounting evidence to show that there is a substantial number of obese people who are food addicts because they have an inability to control their impulsive actions and this drug has shown it can give them more control, which will help overweight people lose weight and so improve their health. The drug, which is sold under a wide variety of brand names around the world, was one of two drugs tested by researchers, the other being Atomoxetine. "Modafinil was found to have an effect on impulsivity in healthy individuals and so would be able to have an even bigger effect on food addicts, who are lacking in certain types of dopamine," said Professor Vlaev. "The drug improves self-control, which is a key factor in determining obesity, so our hypothesis is that this drug should help in treating the disease."

A leading sports medicine expert, he believes we can speed up the body's ability to heal itself with a remarkably simple technique. It's called Platelet Rich Plasma therapy — or PRP. Bornstein was thrilled to get back on the field quickly. He is one of the few patients to get it so far — clinical trials are now testing PRP's safety and effectiveness. Side effects reportedly have been minor; it seems like the biggest problem so far: The needles hurt.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The anchor lead-in – the "hook" for the story – commits egregious disease-mongering.  It says "Every year, Americans make 15 milion visits to doctors because of knee pain and recovering from surgery can take months."  Then, without qualification, it connects that number to the story by saying "But a new, non-surgical treatment could get you up and running in record time."  The clear implication is that this very preliminary approach could be answer for the 15 million visits per year.  That number begs explanation and qualification, which was not provided.

The fear was "overwhelming," he says. So he started taking stimulants. And he couldn't stop thinking about gruesome scenarios, like a murderer coming for his family. And that could explain why patients like James usually stop overheating once they are taking ketamine. James started taking a ketamine nasal spray every other day.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: In addition to using ketamine to treat depression, the story touts “growing evidence it can help people with anxiety, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and perhaps even obsessive-compulsive disorder.” The story dangles unsubstantiated hopes in front of readers with a vast array of mental health diagnoses or concerns.

"It's very dangerous situation." And new research indicates children and teens are more vulnerable than adults, because their brains are less developed and take longer to heal. … It's like a sophisticated video game, but the numbers that are generated from the report are critical in helping to better identify the severity and recovery from the injury." But for students such as Aldrich, who don't know their baseline, extra caution is the doctor's order. He wants her to avoid exerting herself, physically and mentally, because a "bump on the head" is a lot more dangerous than it sounds.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The story cites data on the high incidence of concussions in young athletes. Although the CDC estimates that more than 300,000 sports-related concussions occur annually in the U.S. [http://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5538a1.htm], the broadcast’s claim that one in five high school athletes will suffer a concussion appears to be a gross exaggeration. Without a clear definition of concussion, it is meaningless. A new report from the National Federation of State High School Association estimates that about 7.2 million students participate in high school athletics in the U.S. [http://www.nfhs.org/web/2006/09/participation_in_high_school_sports_increases_again_confirms_nf.aspx] Of these, an estimated 1.2 million—or about one in five—will suffer an injury of some kind. Of those that suffer an injury, a distinct minority will suffer a concussion. A 2004 study of high school athletics in North Carolina found that about 15% of high school football players suffered a concussion during one season. Other research shows that about one in five college football players has a concussion each season.  
The broadcast hints at the danger of repeat concussions, but does not mention the low prevalence of the most feared and devastating outcomes, the so-called post-concussive and second-impact syndromes.  Though there is some evidence that young athletes with two or more previous concussions have subtle but prolonged neuropsychological problems, the story fails to say whether most concussions resolve without incident or long-term effects.

Exactly how this drug curbs drinking is not fully understood, but its use may increase blood pressure, heart rate and feelings of sadness and nausea, thereby blunting the pleasurable effects of alcohol, the researchers said. "Chantix might reduce alcohol consumption by reducing overall enjoyment of the alcohol drinking experience," said study author Emma Childs, a research associate at the University of Chicago. Chantix costs roughly $3 per pill. More research is needed, he noted, but "this medication may be helpful for people with a drinking problem who are also smokers." The study was funded by the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse and the U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The story notes that it “remains to be seen” whether Chantix might ever be recommended to help problem drinkers. However, the overall tone is that the drug could be useful, a message which may encourage people to try using the drug even though this test does not provide evidence that it works to curb alcohol consumption.
More important is this point: The source research study excluded alcoholics.  Because the news article refers to the effect of Chantix on “problem drinkers” without defining what that means, and includes speculation that there might be a “niche” for this drug for those with “alcohol-dependence issues,”  the reader would be expected to think this article might apply to alcoholics.

Of those who do get to a health facility alive, only about 50 percent survive. "Most patients with this disease are older and tend to have other health conditions such as high cholesterol. Vogel's research team reviewed nearly 20,000 cases where patients either had open surgery or an endovascular repair - a minimally invasive procedure that uses a catheter to access the aneurysm. The team then identified patients who took cholesterol-lowering medication before surgery. "However, further research is needed to assess the benefits of using statins before surgical repair of other types of aneurysms."
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: We rarely ding stories on this criterion, but this one struck us wrong because of the mismatch between the first few sentences and what the science found. It says, “Rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is one of the most dramatic medical emergencies a person can face. It usually strikes without warning, killing approximately 50 percent of those who experience it before they reach a hospital. Of those who do get to a health facility alive, only about 50 percent survive.” Are you scared? Well, you probably are hoping that these researchers have found a way to save you from dying unexpectedly before you get to the hospital. But they haven’t. Nor have they found something that is going to guarantee that you won’t die once you reach the hospital, not if the aorta is already ruptured, although we must note that the release is confusing on this point because the provenance of the survival statistics is unclear. What’s also confusing is that the release is conflating an enlarged aorta — which is a serious but manageable condition known as an aortic aneurysm — with a ruptured aorta, which is what leads to people bleeding to death at high rates. The statins might be helpful for people who have an aneurysm that’s surgically repaired; they do nothing in the event of a rupture. In all, the picture painted is far grimmer than the actual context necessary for this release, which is that if people have an aortic aneurysm they might benefit from statins.

The Dundee University-based team say they have used an ultrasound process called shear wave elastography (SWE) to detect prostate tumours. One in eight men will develop the condition at some point in their lives with more than 47,000 new cases being diagnosed every year. The new method aims to get round the problems by targeting the prostate with ultrasound. We can now see with much greater accuracy what tissue is cancerous, where it is and what level of treatment it needs. SWE technology is already used in diagnosing breast cancer and liver diseases.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The story implies that this test ought to be used in all men in the UK as a screening test for prostate cancer, which may find many false positive results. It also doesn’t point out that despite its prevalence, some types of prostate cancer are very growing and may not require treatment. Many more men die with prostate cancer than die because of prostate cancer.

Now, new research from Chalmers has shown that the protein parvalbumin, which is very common in many fish species, may be contributing to this effect.

The link between higher consumption of fish and better long-term health for the brain has been long established. "Because Nathalie had previously shown that parvalbumin passes into the body of the person eating fish, it made sense to study its interaction with human proteins.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: While there is no overt disease mongering, there are subtle influences here.  For example,  the reader is told of a linkage of amyloid and a host of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s and then an author notes: “These diseases come with age, and people are living longer and longer. There’s going to be an explosion of these diseases in the future – and the scary part is that we currently have no cures. So we need to follow up on anything that looks promising.” The clear take away message being conveyed is these disease are of concern and eating fish is the answer.

At this point, specific symptoms can be targeted depending on the patient’s needs. The biggest drawback to TMS, according to advocates, is the limitations on just who can undergo the treatment. Even those who are approved to undergo the treatment face another barrier as TMS is not widely covered by health insurance. The most common, not surprisingly, are headaches. More studies will be needed to determine whether this method can be used as a widespread treatment for other brain-related disorders, but if today’s research is any indication, TMS could be a key to improving the lives of Americans suffering from a multitude of disorders.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: Serious depression is a killer, and treatments are not consistently effective for many people. But the story misleads with its description of depression.
First, the story relates the old neurotransmitter deficit idea–specifically that of serotonin–which has largely been debunked.
We also take issue with the first line of the article: “One of the leading causes of disability in the United States isn’t physical—it’s mental.”
Mental illness is indeed physical, as the article even mentions when it discusses the “physical” brain changes later in the story.

The trial was primarily about the safety of the procedure, and all eight patients came through without significant side effects, he said. The reduction in swelling increases the heart's ability to pump blood, he said. It worked in patients such as Eaton, whose heart attack was 11 years ago, Hare said. The hope was that the immature adult stem cells would turn into heart muscle, replacing the scar tissue. The study shed new light on a question of prime interest to cardiologists: whether the injected stem cells actually transformed themselves into heart muscle, or improved heart function in some other way.

But a number of new controlled trials and meta-analyses like Dr. Moore’s suggest that topical Nsaids are as effective as their oral counterparts for treating osteoarthritis in the knee and hand as well as musculoskeletal injuries like soreness and tendinitis. In clinical trials, the skin creams are linked to a higher rate of redness, irritation and rash. The risks in the most vulnerable population — people with other illnesses, like liver disease, or those on blood thinners — are not known, because these patients are generally excluded from studies. The topical painkillers are not for everyone. Aside from the possible risks to people with other illnesses, the drugs are not helpful for patients with pain throughout the body, like fibromyalgia, and should not be used along with oral Nsaids.

The findings were presented at the American Association of Cancer Research’s annual meeting in Philadelphia. “Increasing the duration of overnight fasting could be a novel strategy to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer,” said Catherine Marinac, UC San Diego doctoral candidate and first author on the paper. “The dietary advice for cancer prevention usually focuses on limiting consumption of red meat, alcohol and refined grains while increasing plant-based foods,” said co-author Ruth Patterson, PhD, UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center associate director for population sciences and program leader of the cancer prevention program. “New evidence suggests that when and how often people eat can also play a role in cancer risk.”

Women in the study reported eating five times per day with a mean nighttime fasting of 12 hours. Researchers recommend large-scale clinical trials to confirm that nighttime fasting results in favorable changes to biomarkers of glycemic control and breast cancer risk.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: There was no overt disease-mongering in the news release.  But there is an element of it in the researcher’s quote: “This is a simple dietary change that we believe most women can understand and adopt.”  This implies a suggestion then, that most women should consider fasting longer at night to reduce risk. That smacks of disease-mongering.

He no longer has prediabetes. Not every Omada Health participant makes the progress they're aiming for. So he says that was a disappointment. And he says the convenience of having the program delivered on a smartphone was key, too. And he says he's pleased with the results of the pilot study of Omada's program.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The term “prediabetes” is controversial — it’s a warning sign that your weight and blood sugar are above the normal range, but not yet at the threshold for diabetes itself. Using the phrase “diagnosed with prediabetes” blurs that line and makes what is essentially a risk factor sound like a condition requiring treatment.

The new-generation hepatitis C regimens use a two- to three-drug combination – a nucleotide analog inhibitor or “nuke” and a NS5A inhibitor in Gilead’s case – to achieves a cure in about eight to 12 weeks, making them faster and more effective than older treatment options. Gilead’s regimen Harvoni, with its own NS5A inhibitor and Sovaldi as the “nuke”, needs to be taken for at least eight weeks. The main goal is to achieve a cure, or sustained virological response, 12 weeks after the completion of therapy. Monday’s data shows Achillion’s NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3102, looks best-in-class, which could make up for its nuke, ACH-3422, being perhaps less effective than Sovaldi, analysts said. The all-Achillion regimen could hit the U.S. market by 2020 in a conservative scenario, Deutsche Bank’s Alethia Young estimated.
QUESTION: Does the story commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The story seems to accept the commonly held premise that all with hepatitis C face doom if they are not treated. There was nothing about the natural history of the disease, or the fact that most people infected with this “liver-destroying virus” never develop symptomatic liver disease. The story does not raise the possibility of mass overtreatment of people with hepatitis C.

What they found was more than minimal differences among the tumors. These genes demonstrated the risk of the disease progression, which was more accurate than the currently used Gleason score test and PSA test. While the findings need further research, larger clinical trials could give better information on individualized treatment for each prostate cancer type. This could lead to a better quality of life and more effective treatment based on which prostate cancer a man is diagnosed with. Patients newly diagnosed with prostate cancer can contact world renowned prostate cancer surgeon and urologic oncologist, Dr. David Samadi, for a consultation or second opinion.
QUESTION: Does the news release commit disease-mongering?
EXPLANATION: The statistics provided about prostate cancer are close to what the American Cancer Society and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have published on their websites. However, the headline for the release — “Are you at risk?” — seems to be blatantly exploiting the results of a preliminary research study to create worry. In addition, men with a family history of prostate cancer should do more than consult Dr. Samadi for a baseline PSA test as suggested by the news release — they should engage in shared decision-making with their provider about their options.
