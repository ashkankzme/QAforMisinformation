The Home Access HIV-1 Test System lets patients collect blood at home, but it must then be sent to a clinic for testing. The British test will probably make it easier for people to be screened for the first time and will allow people to re-screen themselves more frequently. A sizable fraction of the undiagnosed may be people who have been tested, just not recently enough. Adopting some version of the British at-home test could help Americans who have already been tested keep up their screening schedule. And because the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections declined for these men, after the diagnosis, the scientists had reason to believe the self-reports of condom usage were accurate.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story lists the test cost of $45. However, the story would have offered a more complete picture of cost if it had estimated the annual cost of regular screening and provided costs for other tests.

Once inserted, these long-acting methods remove the risk of patient error when a sexually active woman wishes to avoid pregnancy. Their effectiveness rivals that of sterilization. The risk of an unwanted pregnancy with these other methods was especially high among women under 21, whose rate of unintended pregnancy was nearly double that among older women. In real-world use, these methods are associated with a one-year pregnancy rate of less than one per 100 women. With both implants and IUDs, fertility returns quickly as soon as the devices are removed.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: We applaud the way this story examines what may be the “under use” of devices and clearly explains some of the nuance about up-front costs versus the long-term cost of contraception. Bravo for pointing out that the Affordable Care Act now covers these devices, which at one time may have seemed “too expensive” for some patients.
We think it would have been even better if the story had a few actual figures in it – to demonstrate this. For example, one website from Planned Parenthood explains the cost for the copper IUD this way:
“The cost for the medical exam, the IUD, the insertion of the IUD and follow-up visits to your health care provider can range from $500 to $900. That cost pays for protection that can last more than a decade.”
As the story points out – that cost will not fall to an individual patient who is covered under the ACA. But the old prejudices about cost may be part of the reason for the gap in popularity.

The solution: plastic surgery to remove the extra skin, a set of procedures known as body contouring. Intense discomfort that interferes with activity is a common problem after bariatric surgery, says plastic surgeon Sarah Holland, an instructor at Columbia University Medical Center in New York -- and it can be almost constant. To help prevent seromas, special tubes are left inside the body, connected to small plastic drains on the outside. Ultimately, she won her case. Seven weeks after surgery, Baez concluded the pain and effort had been worth the result: an end to the recurrent skin infections in her thighs and abdominal folds.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The costs of contouring are presented as tens of thousands of dollars; in addition, mention is made that they are not necessarily covered by insurers.

Sometimes the situation is truly life-threatening. By late evening she was told she'd need a C-section to deliver her son, Avery. This is the experience many women have. But for many women, being told they need a C-section is unpleasant news. What's lacking are clinical studies.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story said hospitals aren’t charging more for the family-centered cesarean. We’ll judge this nod in the direction of costs to be sufficient for a satisfactory rating, but ideally we’d like to see a dollar estimate for what a traditional cesarean costs. In addition, we’d note that the family-centered cesarean does involve some additional resource costs — for example, extra nursing staff and the logistics of getting the neonatal team into the operating room — that should be considered, even if these are not currently reflected in typical hospital charges.

Of the 32 patients who received the drug that way, 29 were still alive, BioCryst said in late October. He said the drug should be distributed so that hospitals could have it in stock. Anecdotes like Ms. Gurno’s aside, the efficacy of peramivir is still in question, according to the government. Dr. Lurie, the federal official, said there had been 237 requests to use the drug since the emergency use authorization was granted nearly two weeks ago. Right now, Dr. Lurie said, peramivir is the only drug that can be used intravenously so the government had to pay a high price.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: 


The story says the federal government is paying about $2,250 per patient for a standard 5-day treatment course. It also notes that the approved alternative treatments are less expensive.

But are shoppers really convinced that POM can unclog their arteries, cure cancer, and lead to hotter sex? That's the paradox of products such as POM, Silverglade says: The health claims on these products strain the imagination, yet studies have repeatedly shown that health claims sell food. Health.com: 14 health products you probably don't need

Iffy health claims don't mean that products like pomegranate juice should be avoided at all costs, says Keri Gans, R.D., a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association. As long as consumers limit themselves to 8-ounce servings and products with no added sugar, juice can be an excellent source of vitamins and other nutrients, Gans says. The bottom line is that consumers shouldn't believe everything they read on labels.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story says a bottle of POM costs $4, meeting our standard for a satisfactory. It could have specified that the $4 cost refers to 16 oz bottle and not a larger package. There also is no information about how often you’d need to drink the juice to obtain the claimed benefits, so we don’t know if people are supposed to drink a bottle a day or a bottle a week — which would make a big difference on the cost front. (The latter problem may not be the fault of the article, as a quick perusal of the POM website turned up no specific information about serving recommendations from the manufacturer.) .

"The evidence in diabetic humans is very convincing and very strong," added Dr. Phillip Dennis, a senior investigator with the U.S. National Cancer Institute and senior author on the lung cancer paper. Others believed that the finding might influence the choice of drugs in people with diabetes. "We can't ignore this, but we can't say we have FDA [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] approval for metformin for cancer indications." It's also possible, however, that metformin is working more directly on the tumor process, the researchers said. This adds credence to the idea that metformin's value is in its ability to lower overall insulin levels in the body, Cantley said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story explains that "Metformin (originally marketed as Glucophage, though it is now available as an inexpensive generic) has been in use for more than two decades and is currently prescribed to 40 million Americans." Good enough to get a satisfactory score.

There's now a shot for that. The FDA warned, however, that the treatment also has the potential to kill other types of cells, such as skin cells, if injected improperly. Patients can receive as many as 50 injections of the drug in a single treatment, the agency said, with up to six treatments administered no less than a month apart. A top example: Annual sales of the anti-wrinkle drug Botox have surged to $2 billion in recent years. That said, the agency warned Wednesday that the new drug can cause serious side effects, including trouble swallowing or nerve damage to the jaw that can result in an uneven smile or muscle weakness in the face.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story says that the company would not discuss the “potential cost” of the drug until after its launch next month, and that the sales of the anti-wrinkle drug Botox exceed $2 billion per year. That’s enough for a Satisfactory rating. The story could have further informed readers by noting that insurers won’t pick up the tab.

As more women postpone motherhood into their 30s, even 40s, they're hitting that age-old constraint: the biological clock. Now, technology is dangling the possibility that women can stop that clock, at least for a while. All told, costs can easily exceed $40,000, money Montoro doesn't have. And yet, even Widra agrees that egg freezing has appeal if it can help avoid the anguish of infertility. The bigger challenge, Sher and others say, is reaching out to younger women — getting them to take action before it's too late.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story includes the high price tag for freezing eggs and the possibility that a family may need more than a single “freezing.” The story quotes about $40,000 for a safe number of eggs in storage and seems to imply that price includes the in- vitro fertilization required. But we wish they had done a better itemizing more ofl the costs of a high-tech pregnancy, including the possible higher risk of twins and pre-term delivery.

Zamboni proposed that treating it may be as simple as opening them up. "Because my disease is so aggressive, I have been very willing to be equally aggressive in trying to combat it," Stecker says. Although the doctor who treated him in New York found a significant blockage, he was unable to correct it, Stecker says. Stecker says if he had it to do over again, he would have waited for more research. Robert Zivadinov of the Buffalo Neuroimaging Analysis Center in New York says that not only is the procedure unsafe and costly to many patients, it is impeding necessary research.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions that some patients have flown to Europe and spent their life savings on the procedure, and an expert calls the procedure “costly to patients.” So we can probably assume that the procedure is unlikely to be covered by major insurers or Medicare (who would cover those with chronic disability), and that the costs will run into the tens of thousands of dollars or more. This is important information for the typical patient who isn’t wealthy enough to carry this kind of cost burden. The story could have been more explicit about all of this and provided more specifics about the financial aspects of the procedure. However, we think the main point to convey here is that the surgery is expensive and patients will have to pay their own way. The story does this — though barely — so we’ll award a satisfactory.

The therapy was nine sessions on average plus exercises to do at home, which experts say is key to success. Thirty percent of patients assigned to physical therapy wound up having surgery before the six months was up, often because they felt therapy wasn't helping them. Surgery costs about $5,000, compared with $1,000 to $2,000 for a typical course of physical therapy, Katz said. One study participant — Bob O'Keefe, 68, of suburban Boston — was glad to avoid surgery for his meniscus injury three years ago. An imaging test showed a less severe tear and a different surgeon recommended physical therapy.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?

When Eric Rowe turned 50, the question was not whether the Washington lawyer would be screened for colon cancer, but how. Initially regarded as a high-tech novelty, the new procedure has in recent months received key endorsements as a first-line screening test from influential medical groups, notably the American Cancer Society, after several large studies found it to be effective at finding large polyps. Like other mass screening tests including mammography, the overarching question is whether the benefits of virtual colonoscopy outweigh the risks. Currently about half of Americans over 50 are screened for the disease; some shun traditional colonoscopy, which is the only way to remove polyps, because of its invasive nature. Medicare's decision has sparked a furious lobbying campaign.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story describes the cost of virtual colonoscopy compared to standard colonoscopy, although it isn’t clear that $1500 versus $800 is accurate in all settings and also does not include the fact that 20% will require a follow-up colonoscopy. The story also mentions the crucial issue of insurance coverage. While more insurance companies are starting to cover the procedure, many do not. The recent CMS decision not to cover it has been highly influential.

Although the apps are not validated, each one was designed by Northwestern clinicians and based on validated techniques used by therapists. But Northwestern researchers hope participants will provide confidential feedback, via four weekly questions, that will be used to further develop the system. The data will help the system make even better recommendations and provide more personalized treatment. Different apps are expected to work for different people. The study was supported by grant R01 MH100482 from the National Institute of Mental Health of the National Institutes of Health.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that there is no cost associated with downloading the Intellicare apps. But because Intellicare is part of “a national research study” the researchers request that users provide “confidential feedback” weekly to help them further develop the system. Some people may not be comfortable sharing personal data over the internet, with good reason.

But few women are opting for this protection, which goes by the name chemoprevention. In part this may be because many doctors are not even discussing this option with their patients. But there are conflicting views on who meets that “high risk” definition

Chemoprevention should not be confused with chemotherapy. “At the 1.67 percent high-risk threshold,” Georgetown’s Lin says, “every woman age 62 and older would be [considered] high-risk.” That might lead to a situation in which millions of women would be encouraged, unnecessarily,to consider this therapy, along with its potential harmful effects. “A discussion on the use of preventive agents needs to become part of routine care in women at high risk,” she says.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions that these drugs are “covered” by the Affordable Care Act, and that “women with a high risk for breast cancer and a low risk for side effects who try this therapy will not incur out-of-pocket costs.” We’ll call this nod in the direction of costs sufficient for a satisfactory rating, but the story does not discuss these drugs’ prices or the cost of repeated office visits to monitor their side effects. There was an opportunity here for a rich discussion about incurring some upfront cost for a potential for downstream cost savings in terms of lower cancer rates and reduced need for treatment.

According to Ahlquist, Cologuard is the first noninvasive test to detect pre-cancerous polyps, he added. Ahlquist noted that the test still needs to be refined. Ahlquist hopes that the test will be approved and available within two years. Ahlquist noted that the cost of the test has not yet been established. Savings over time on a more accurate test done fewer times could justify the higher cost of the Cologuard test, Ahlquist said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: A hesitant satisfactory score.  The story stated, “the cost of the test has not yet been established. It is expected to cost more than a fecal occult blood test, but far less than a colonoscopy. A fecal occult blood test can cost as little as $23 while a colonoscopy can total $700.”  It is expected by whom to cost in that range?  What’s the source? (Reuters reported a $300-400 cost estimate from the company.)

You can tell by the sniffles and sneezes of the afflicted. But you can also tell by the ads: TV spots selling remedies for drippy, congested noses, itchy eyes and other symptoms are in heavy rotation. People with mild to moderate symptoms have the best chance of full relief, he says. They should be used daily during your vulnerable season or seasons, ideally starting before symptoms do, Eghrari-Sabet says. Over-the-counter treatments should not take the place of professional care — especially if you have never been formally diagnosed with allergies, if you have additional medical problems or if your symptoms persist or worsen, Eghrari-Sabet and Sublett say.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story goes above and beyond our standard here. There is a whole section on costs, which tells consumers to “expect to pay more.” Insurers will no longer cover the cost, the article says, so expect to shell out $17 to $23 for a one-month supply of non-prescription steroid nasal spray. The story also discusses the costs of antihistamines and says store-brand versions are a cheaper alternative to steroid sprays. An example is Walmart’s Equate loratadine tablets, which cost $7 for 60 24-hour doses.

But these methods alone don't give reliable results. Of course, the ultimate goal of this test is to find cancer in people who haven't already been diagnosed. First, he notes, the Hopkins team will need to demonstrate that the test will be useful in patients without symptoms. Then the researchers will need to show that the rate of false alarms remains very low, otherwise people will be sent on needless and expensive medical odysseys. An effective screening test would hold lots of potential for cancer patients, Prasad says.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story makes it clear that cost of the test is currently speculative (“could cost about $500”) and goes even further to caution that: “Johns Hopkins holds the patent and has not licensed it as yet to a company that would ultimately set the price.”

“Patient compliance is a very big issue,” said Dr. Richard Hurt, director of the Nicotine Dependence Center at the , who was not involved in the study. Dr. Hurt said products like nicotine gum and patches “are absolutely essential, but we use them in combinations and doses that match treatment to what the individual patient needs,” unlike smokers who are self-treating. The study did not follow people over time. A government-appointed panel that included nicotine replacement as part of federal guidelines for treatment also came under fire, because panel members had gotten payments from the product manufacturers. The use of replacement products made no difference, whether they were taken for the recommended two-month period (they usually were not), or with the guidance of a cessation counselor.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: All three stories at least mentioned the total amount of money being spent on nicotine replacement products or the growth in that spending. None of the stories actually explained how much these products cost or compared them to the costs of cigarettes. The cost of an 8-week regimen of nicotine patches is $160-200.

It is also more expensive, and it doesn’t work for every patient. “My symptoms subsided dramatically.”

Provent works like a traditional C.P.A.P. But not everyone finds that Provent alleviates their apnea. In those people, Provent typically doesn’t work. Dr. Lee A. Surkin, a cardiologist and sleep medicine specialist in Greenville, N.C., said patients typically start with a 10-day trial pack that costs $27.50.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story offered one of the most thorough discussions of costs we have seen in a description of an emerging device. It provides a price for a 30-day supply of the patches and for a 10-day trial pack. It also points out, helpfully, that “Unlike C.P.A.P., Provent is not covered by Medicare and most major insurers, though some doctors say they expect that will change in the near future.”

The team used this opportunity to see how stimulating the brain affects memory. Fried said the findings suggest stimulating the brain just as memories are forming is key. They also saw signs the treatment might have an effect on memory. Dr. Sandra Black, a brain researcher at the University of Toronto who wrote an editorial on the current study, said the findings could have implications for early stage Alzheimer’s disease if tests were developed to identify this process early through imaging or genomics. “Although the current evidence is preliminary, is based on small samples and requires replication, the potential application of deep-brain stimulation in amnestic disorders is enticing,” Black wrote.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?

About $60,000 of the cost would be incurred in the first eight weeks, when the drug is given more frequently. That median expenditure now, he said, is $87,000 for a little over a year of treatments. Even to try the drug for the first seven-week cycle to see if it works would cost over $50,000. Mr. Schimmer’s note was entitled “Folotyn Prices High, Reiterate Outperform.” He estimated annual sales of the drug in the United States reaching about $300 million by 2014. “A peripheral T-cell lymphoma patient,” he said, “at first blush will see this therapy as a very good thing.”

Allos, which is still unprofitable, has lost $350 million since its founding in 1992 and failed to win approval of a previous drug.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?

So should people concerned about their risk of colorectal cancer consider Celebrex? The study, published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, received financial support from Pfizer, which sells Celebrex. This is not the first study to suggest Celebrex and similar drugs — known as COX-2 inhibitors - may reduce the risk of developing colon cancer, he said, but people need to balance that potential benefit with the higher risk of cardiovascular complications. But to people who have no underlying cardiovascular problems and a particularly high risk of colon cancer - they were diagnosed with it before perhaps, or have a strong family history - regular screening may not be enough, Chan noted. Those who had been on Celebrex were also more likely to develop advanced polyps during that final year.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story manages to work costs into the discussion: “At a cost of several dollars per day, depending on dosage, [Celebrex] is much more expensive than older pain relievers such as ibuprofen.”

Patients can do it at home. It can be very unpleasant. Dupixent is for the hard-core cases that aren’t helped by anything else. The agency gave it both priority review and breakthrough therapy status, speeding it through the approval process. “Of the adults with uncontrolled moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in the United States, it is estimated that 300,000 are most in need of new treatment options,” Regeneron said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: This is a barely passing satisfactory rating–the story did disclose the cost of $37,000, but overlooked some important details when it then tried to explain that manufacturers think the actual cost to patients will be lower.
The full picture is more complicated. Drug company patient-assistance programs — which help patients cover co-payments and other out-of-pocket costs — are abhorred by economists because they shield patients from treatment costs and undermine the ability of insurers to steer patients to less expensive options.
In addition, an accompanying video states “a billion and a half dollars” was spent developing the drug but doesn’t point out that the purported development cost is small compared with the potential profits. If all 300,000 people the manufacturers of this drug say are “most in need of treatment options” receive this drug, the total cost could be as high as $11 billion a year, funds that must be diverted from other healthcare priorities or come from higher premiums or taxes. That broader analysis was missing in this story.
An independent draft analysis showed dupilumab did improve health outcomes compared to usual care but with additional costs, and that the drug did fall below commonly cited standards for cost-effectiveness. Still, the study relied on some uncertain variables and found the drug was most cost effective for patients with severe conditions.

People with psoriasis who haven’t seen improvement with standard treatments now have a new option. The drug also comes with a more serious warning, as well. Because of these events, the labeling for Siliq will include a Boxed Warning, and the drug will only be available through a restricted REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program. In order to prescribe it, doctors must be certified with the program and must counsel patients about this risk. He adds that the data on Siliq suggests that it is not only effective in treating psoriasis, but that many patients experience improvement in anxiety and depression, as well.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: We’ll give this story credit for mentioning cost, when it states “pricing information is not available at this time.” However, the story would have been stronger if it had explained the known costs of similar injectable drugs, as we mention in our review of the FDA news release on this drug, and as discussed here. It’s likely this new drug would be in a similar price range.

Hard charging baby boomers and Generation X-ers are wearing out their joints at younger ages and turning to joint replacement surgery - but is it a quick fix? The biggest variable is patients themselves. That said, some patients are determined to push the envelope, and some doctors give their blessing. Patients say that regaining function after surgery requires enormous mental and physical effort. "Pre-hab"—building up strength before the surgery—is just as important as re-hab afterward, they say.

They say it will enable the body to produce more of a natural compound that supports a healthy metabolism. “We are filling a space by combining natural compounds with scientific validation.”

The active ingredients in Basis are nicotinamide riboside, a substance that makes NAD and is found in traces in many foods such as milk, and pterostilbene, an antioxidant found in blueberries. If Elysium Health were developing Basis as a drug, it would have to conduct clinical trials with humans to prove that it works, and the Food and Drug Administration would have to sign off on its scientific evidence before it could be sold as medicine. “What does it mean, to improve metabolic health? And what exactly is being repaired in the body?
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?

“A doctor who has a patient in pain has a lot of options,” such as medications and physical or talk therapy, said lead author Andrew Vickers, from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. “This provides evidence that they would be justified in considering… acupuncture,” he told Reuters Health. It’s usually “not their first approach to address the condition,” he said - rather people seek acupuncture when traditional care fails to stop their pain. But, he added, “I would sincerely say more than 75 percent of my patients will see improvement.”

Vickers said people who are considering acupuncture should first make sure their acupuncturist is appropriately qualified and licensed. In those cases, he said, acupuncture is very safe - and the main downsides are costs and the inconvenience of getting to a clinic.

But researchers said it’s still unclear what types of patients might benefit from the treatment and by how much. That post-stroke condition is known as neglect. “They’re less likely to become completely independent.”

Most of those patients can improve with therapy and exercises, she said, but the process is often slow, and keeping people in the hospital during it is costly. He said that larger studies at multiple treatment sites are needed to determine how helpful magnetic stimulation can be in stroke recovery. The ideal option might end up being a combination treatment that involves stimulation in certain patients and other therapies that address a range of skills important for regaining function, Barrett added.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story states that the transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) machine costs about $50,000, but it could also have noted — as WebMD did — that there are costs associated with training clinicians to use the machine. In addition, neither story tried to estimate what a course of treatment might cost patients or their insurers — information which probably could be gleaned by looking at the costs of TMS treatment for depression. Although there was room for improvement here, we think the story does enough to merit a satisfactory.

The researchers estimated that shifting standard practice by 30 percent to the wrist approach, along with same-day discharge, could save the United States $300 million per year. Expanding that practice to hospitals nationwide might save the United States $300 million in health-care spending per year. Health-care costs for the 600,000 patients who receive PCI each year in the U.S. are estimated to be $10 billion. Of the study’s patient population receiving PCI, 9 percent received the procedure in which doctors used wrist access. According to Amin, improved technology has allowed wrist access to become a viable route to the coronary arteries, even for complex cases, and should be considered for more patients.

"However, there is a shortage of good quality corneas that can be used for transplantation." The researchers went one step further and gave contact lenses to the patients. Griffith said a German study recently found that donated corneas cost about $2,500. The next step in research, Griffith said, is to create a "new generation" of cornea implants and test them on a wider variety of patients. The study appears in the Aug. 25 issue of Science Translational Medicine.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: This is the only story of the three reviewed to discuss costs. As for cost, Griffith said the biosynthetic corneas "in theory" should be cheaper than donated corneas. Griffith said a German study recently found that donated corneas cost about $2,500.

But a number of new controlled trials and meta-analyses like Dr. Moore’s suggest that topical Nsaids are as effective as their oral counterparts for treating osteoarthritis in the knee and hand as well as musculoskeletal injuries like soreness and tendinitis. In clinical trials, the skin creams are linked to a higher rate of redness, irritation and rash. The risks in the most vulnerable population — people with other illnesses, like liver disease, or those on blood thinners — are not known, because these patients are generally excluded from studies. Still, in one of the only head-to-head trials between topical and oral Nsaids, subjects taking the pills had a much higher rate of indigestion, diarrhea, abdominal pain, abnormal liver tests and anemia than those using the creams. The topical painkillers are not for everyone.

TUESDAY, Nov. 13, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- For black Americans suffering from heart disease, meditation might help prevent heart attacks, strokes and early death, a small new study suggests. An outside expert, however, said the study is too limited in size and scope to allow conclusions as to whether meditation really reduces risk of death or disease. The new study focused on Transcendental Meditation. He added, however, that meditation would work as well among whites and other populations. Even though the findings in this study were statistically significant, the new study was too small to be conclusive, Fonarow said.

So it cannot be completely ruled out that XL184 somehow stopped bone growth without killing the cancer. A late-stage trial could begin as early as next year, he said. Dr. Jacques said he ordered the review after being contacted by federal lawmakers questioning why their constituents could not get the drug. But some analysts said that should be enough for reimbursement. However, the panel gave very low scores to evidence that the drug would help prostate cancer patients other than the type who participated in the clinical trial, which were men with advanced cancer, but no or minimal symptoms.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story provided the costs for the FDA approved Provenge ($93,000/patient); as XL184 is under study and not available for sale, there was no information about what its costs might be.

Larger studies, of more-diverse groups of MS patients, are needed, he said. The study’s lead researcher agreed on the need for more work. Muscle weakness was the most common side effect in this study, van der Walt said. It affected 42 percent of the study patients, though it went away within two weeks. Larger studies, van der Walt said, should look at whether Botox is more effective for some tremors than others.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story explains: “the cost could range from $500 to $1,000 Australian dollars, which are roughly equal to U.S. dollars. In the U.S., Botox treatments can cost $455-$575 per injection site.”

It defies common sense, she says, for scientists to conclude that breast self-exams do women more harm than good. What is clear is that studies don't supply an answer that fits all women. She stopped routinely teaching self-exams to patients after the large trials in China and Russia showed no benefit. Some evidence does suggest that self-exams done properly could make a difference. But finding a lump also is no reason to panic, given the limited accuracy of the self-test.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: It doesn’t cost anything to do a breast self-exam. 
The story does mention potential harms of increased doctor visits and unnecessary diagnostic procedures triggered by self-exams, with additional cost implied.

The lower-fat diet provided participants with 24% of calories from fat, of which 11% was from MUFAs. Although these findings demonstrate that an avocado a day alongside a moderate-fat diet has the potential to reduce bad cholesterol, the team notes that their research was a controlled feeding study. Still, the team believes their findings indicate that people should consider replacing saturated fatty acids in their diet with healthier fats from avocados and other sources. It should be noted that this research was supported by the Hass Avocado Board, but the researchers say the organization played no other role in the study. Our Knowledge Center article on the health benefits of avocado reveals some of the other ways the food may be good for us, as well as the potential risks of avocado consumption.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The article does not mention a direct price for avocados, but it does mention that avocados tend to be expensive in many parts of the country at certain times of the year.

But it's important to know that the weight loss that's typical for users of the drug -- 5 to 10 percent of total weight -- will be less than many dieters expect. And many consumers may be put off by the drug's significant gastrointestinal side effects, including flatulence, diarrhea and anal leakage. While Americans spend an estimated $1 billion on nonprescription weight loss products, few if any of those products have undergone the rigorous testing that is required by the FDA for prescription medications. At the current recommended prescription dose -- 120 milligrams taken up to three times per day, for example up to 360 milligrams daily -- about 70 percent of users experience gastrointestinal complications, Klein says. That's because Orlistat works by blocking fat absorption in the intestine.

The paper outlines the results of an international clinical trial, led by Jeff Elias, MD, of the University of Virginia Health System, that evaluated the scalpel-free approach called focused ultrasound for the treatment of essential tremor (ET), a condition that afflicts an estimated 10 million Americans. The trial participants all had tried existing medications, without success. The site includes a list of frequently asked questions and will be updated as UVA prepares to make the treatment available. The procedure is not for everyone with essential tremor. The essential tremor research has been supported by InSightec, the Focused Ultrasound Foundation and the BIRD (US-Israel Binational Industry Research and Development) Foundation.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release mentions cost, saying, “Because the approach is so new, insurance plans will not yet cover the procedure, though that may change in the coming months. The cost at UVA has not yet been determined.”  But the procedure is still neurosurgery which is inherently expensive.  Readers might benefit from knowing the cost of the current alternative surgical approach to treating this condition, deep-brain stimulation. The fact that other language in the release does come close to marketing this procedure for the medical center is also troubling.

The story of the health system's success is a story of persistence, confidence, hope and a strict adherence to a very specific approach. Fifteen years ago, suicide prevention care at Henry Ford, like in many places, was mostly reactive. When patients came in talking about suicide, health providers took notice. The Henry Ford therapists are trained to break that barrier. The behavioral health provider in Nashville implemented the Henry Ford approach for nearly 200 patients who'd already made a suicide attempt.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: At issue in the story is the health system’s so-called “perfect depression care,” which incorporates depression screening into primary care. Patients deemed to have, or be at risk of, depression are then given appropriate treatment. It’s difficult to pin a specific cost to this. The matter is further complicated by the fact that treating depression can also save money by driving down costs related to associated health problems. However, the story notes that Centerstone — a separate health system that has adopted the Henry Ford Health System’s model for a smaller cohort of patients — did do a cost/benefit analysis and found that it resulted in savings of more than $400,000 per year. While we’ll award a Satisfactory, we think there was a muddling here of Henry Ford’s global screening strategy with the intense care provision in the Centerstone model. It is not appropriate to apply the cost analysis of the latter to the former. In addition, it can be argued that screening every patient at every visit it wasteful. The story reads/sounds somewhat like a paean to doing as much as you can and adopting a kitchen-sink approach rather than a carefully honed and efficient one.

They’re all in the brain. For example, a study tested the approach in 23 young adults, around age 24. It should be acknowledged that some researchers involved in many of these studies have financial ties to GlassesOff. Then the brain must coordinate activity across sets of neurons to assemble these features into recognizable objects like chairs, faces, letters or words. Reading at our normal pace, the brain has only about 250 milliseconds to do this work until the eyes automatically move onto the next letter or word.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?

Authors of the study—published yesterday in the Lancet—believe many more people could benefit from antidepressant medication. The study results represent the most comprehensive evidence currently available, they wrote. Approximately 37 percent of these people received no treatment. Experts not involved in the research agreed the results were significant. James Warner, an Imperial College London psychiatrist, added: “Depression causes misery to countless thousands every year and this study adds to the existing evidence that effective treatments are available.”
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Without mentioning any numbers, the story does say that the costs of antidepressant drugs tend to be lower than the other major treatment approach for depression, which is talk therapy.
The story would have been stronger with cost data. For example, the four drugs found most effective  in the analysis– mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline — cost $8 to $12 for 30 tablets, according to the web site GoodRx. The study says, “All of the most effective antidepressants are now off patent and available in generic form.”
It also doesn’t mention that talk therapy may have more value for some patients because it can equip people with tools for life, and severe depression needs to be treated by a combination of drugs and talk therapy.

approval was a belated triumph for the drug’s original developer, BioSpecifics Technologies of Lynbrook, N.Y., on Long Island. It tested that drug for numerous uses, including herniated disks. With Dr. Korn’s help, BioSpecifics licensed the drug to Auxilium in a matter of weeks, receiving $5 million initially. Auxilium and BioSpecifics hope that the half-century-old collagenase might eventually become as versatile as Botox, another bacterial product. With its belated success, BioSpecifics has sold off its ointment business.

So, yes, the flu vaccine can prevent illness, but it's hard to detect major effects on public health in the data. On the other hand, the evidence suggests that there's no harm in getting a flu shot, either. That seems to be the same conclusion that other studies have drawn — the flu vaccine is modestly helpful, and doesn't hurt. Because these aren't experiments — ideally we'd have randomized controlled trials — they're more prone to bias and therefore less reliable. Beyond public health measures (making sure you have good hand hygiene and avoiding the office when you're sick), the flu shot is the best medical intervention we have for preventing infection.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: While the story only touches on the costs of flu shots in passing, saying that they’re relatively cheap, we’ll give them the benefit of the doubt on this category.  At least at two points in the story, the issue of costs are raised.  We would have liked it even better had the story mentioned the actual range of possible costs for the flu vaccine.  A quick web search shows the prices ranging from $10 to $30, based on information from the CDC.  And free shots are regularly available at public health centers as well.

The treatment also “nearly universally eliminated” the need for preventive infusions of clotting factor a few times a week, the scientists said. The results, published Wednesday online in the New England Journal of Medicine, represent “another example of the gene-therapy renaissance,” Matthew Porteus, a pediatrician at Stanford University, wrote in an accompanying editorial. Still, he noted, the study has some limitations. In addition, he said, researchers need to find ways to provide the therapy to a broader group of people, including children, and to figure out how to reduce the costs involved. Still, the therapies can produce at least some offsetting savings.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Although this therapy is not yet available for patient use, the story makes a point of noting that the cost may well be “stratospheric,” should it make it to market.
If approved, such treatments are expected to command stratospheric prices. For example, a separate Spark gene therapy for a rare type of childhood blindness, which is on track for Food and Drug Administration clearance soon, could cost $1 million per patient for infusions in both eyes, according to some Wall Street analysts.
Still, the therapies can produce at least some offsetting savings. Porteus noted in his editorial that the hemophilia therapy resulted in savings of about $200,000 a year per patient because of the elimination of clotting-factor infusions.

The group numbers about 7,500 patients a year in the United States. About 600 patients in the United States fall into that category every year. Even so, Yescarta's cost is likely to stoke the ongoing debate about high drug prices. Twenty-eight percent had neurological “events,” such as severe confusion; three patients died of complications caused by the treatment. He said the therapy already has been life-changing for many of his patients — and for him.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story states the cost of this new therapy. It also contrasts it to the other approved drug for CAR T-cell therapy. However, it would have been helpful to know if this cost includes all the related hospital care and services, or is simply the cost of the drug itself. It also would have been useful to compare it to other treatments for this form of cancer, such as chemotherapy or transplantation.

It's an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy — shock treatments — for patients who have not responded to drugs or psychotherapy. It can cost as much as $400 for a 37-minute session and require multiple treatments. The cost, however, is less than an extended hospital stay. The NeuroStar system resembles a dentist's chair. The devices cost around $100,000, Cochran said, who has treated 45 patients with the therapy.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story provides the reader with information on the cost so it meets the criterion.  We would have liked a bit more information.  For example, how durable is the response and will patients need repeated treatments? Based on the literature to date, patients may need to undergo treatment every 2-3 months.  We are told that each treatment costs about $400 and the total cost is $8-12,000.  That means each patients receives 20-30 treatments.  There are ancillary costs associated with each trip that we would have liked to have included. Nonetheless, we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt.

There is only “moderate’’ evidence that the newly approved prostate cancer drug Provenge helps patients, according to an analysis done for Medicare that was made public on Wednesday. The Medicare review might be more designed to limit off-label use of the expensive drug, such as for patients who already have symptoms. The review for Medicare said there was insufficient evidence to judge whether Provenge would work if used off-label. But the analysis for Medicare said that there were issues in how the trials were designed that made it difficult to assess how effective Provenge really was. “Historically, moderate means that CMS will reimburse the product for its on-label indication,’’ she wrote.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story appropriately reports that Provenge treatment costs $93,000 per patient and is satisfactory based on the criterion. However, the costs should ideally be put into context and compared to alternative treatments. An editorial published along with the Provenge trial in the New England Journal of Medicine noted the costs of alternative treatment is $1,800 per patient.

Published today in the Journal of Oncology Practice, the study also determined that a systemized process of referrals resulted in significant improvements in 30-day readmission rates, hospice referral, and receipt of chemotherapy after discharge in patients with advanced cancers. This is the first study to demonstrate that among advanced cancer patients admitted to an inpatient oncology service, standardized use of triggers for palliative care consultation is associated with substantial improvement on multiple quality measures. The integration of palliative care improves symptom control and decreases unwanted health care use, yet many patients are never offered these services. Consultation with the palliative care team included establishment of goals of care, advance care plans using standardized communication protocols, transition planning and symptom assessment and treatment using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS). The palliative team was composed of one board certified PC physician, one nurse practitioner, one social worker, a chaplain, and one to two trainees.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The news release makes several general statements about the costs of not referring patients early to palliative care.
It’s not clear whether the cost savings at a large hospital like Mount Sinai would carry over to smaller hospitals across the country that might not have the requisite staff already in place. Additionally, a statement about the implications of costs incurred by patients for early palliative care would improve the release.

Fading, close-up vision is one of the more vexing and ubiquitous consequences of growing older. Without the glasses, she can’t read anything. Both of the new implants, Raindrop and KAMRA, go into only one eye. It’s functioning in your day-to-day life.”

Ekstadt has the privilege of being the first person in the nation to get the Raindrop outside of a clinical trial. "You need to be monitored by your surgeon during that period of time.”

One downside: the implants aren’t covered by insurance or Medicare, says Hamilton, adding “the cost is around $4,000 to $5,000.”

There are other risks with the procedure, but they are rare, according to clinical trials.

It may seem novel for a nonbeauty company to get into skin care, but these days, it really isn’t, Mrs. Lewis said. There are more than 100 algae-derived ingredients used in cosmetics worldwide, Mrs. Lewis said. The patent-pending alguronic acid in Algenist is a “single, purified, highly bioactive compound,” said Tony Day, the vice president for research and development at Solazyme, and therefore delivers “much higher activity to the skin” than products using only a microalgae extract. Dr. Dana Sachs, an associate professor of dermatology at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, wrote in an e-mail after looking at Algenist’s dossier that “the claims on cell regeneration and elastin synthesis are based on in vitro models, which is hard to extrapolate to in vivo, and again no statistical significance is presented, so this is a weak claim.”

Dr. Day, who has a doctorate in biochemistry, said that statistical significance was found but not included in press materials. And, according to the company, a study of 30 women showed that after 10 days of using the Algenist serum, they had a 25 percent decrease in wrinkles as shown by silicone replicas of their faces.

That has led doctors to feel most at ease giving very aggressive treatments to almost everyone. The drawback of that study, Dr. Glick notes, is that it was not a large prospective randomized clinical trial, the gold standard in medicine. What if some women with estrogen-fed tumors do benefit from chemotherapy? And while some, including Dr. Winer, predict that the use of chemotherapy will almost certainly decline in the years ahead, for now most doctors are sticking with the current guidelines, waiting for expert advice from national panels on what to do. In many cases, it is patients who want the most aggressive treatment.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: There is no discussion of the cost of chemotherapy and no mention of potential cost savings for women who might not benefit as much from treatment; however, this is not very relevant to this story, as there is a suggestion that less treatment might be better, with a cost savings implied.

More often than not, these studies produce mixed data that don’t tell researchers much about whether it is safe and effective for humans. Each one represents a different human organ system, such as lungs, heart and intestines. The project has received support from the National Institutes of Health and the FDA. He suspects that in the beginning the chips will be used to “complement and supplement” animal studies, but will eventually become routine practice. The information is essential to reduce the risk for this side effect of oncology drugs.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The Newsweek report generally addresses the costs to put a new drug on the market, and it states that “Incorporating the chips into drug testing could save millions of dollars and years of time on research.”
We’ll reward the story’s impulse to address cost with a Satisfactory rating, but we’d note that the issue is more complicated than readers may appreciate based on the coverage. The article starts by projecting benefits – cost of drug development and time to FDA approval. And only later does it imply that the new technology initially will add to the cost because it will be done along with the old technology (animal studies). Only if it is as good or better may it be a substitute. Then the question is whether it will indeed be cheaper. It may be cheaper if the chips are less expensive than animal studies or if they better identify agents that do or don’t work in humans. But costs are difficult to predict and the totals can add up quickly — for example, a vial of human lung cells costs over $700. This all seems very speculative at this point.

A painless way to prevent cavities in adults is gaining traction. When Featherstone put his patients on personal treatment plans, he found the strategy worked. That's still important in some cases, Featherstone says, but without fixing the underlying problem of bad bacteria, patients just keep coming back for more fillings. But if you catch decay early, Featherstone says, it can be reversed using fluoride treatments like varnish and concentrated toothpaste and gels. And he expects that at some point all dentists will follow a preventive protocol.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story does include a discussion of price, reporting that a fluoride varnish treatment can cost $23 to $55, while a filling can cost $86 to $606. That’s enough to be rated Satisfactory.
However, the story also should have stated that those numbers aren’t a head-to-head comparison, since the varnish treatment must be repeated many times over many years–which would add up. In fact, a cost-effectiveness analysis done by one of the quoted experts concluded the “Caries Management System” he advocates costs almost $1,800 for every cavity or lost tooth prevented.

But a new study suggests an existing medication may help. Drugs in this class -- called anticholinergics -- have been linked with mental decline, he said. And oxybutynin doesn't interfere with the metabolism of tamoxifen, Leon-Ferre said, calling that an important consideration for breast cancer survivors. The patient said endocrine therapy had caused hot flashes so severe that she could not sleep. The research was scheduled to be presented Friday at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in Texas.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Using the lead researcher as a source, the article states that most insurers cover oxybutynin; that a month’s supply can range from $21 to $42; and that the cost could be less, depending on the type of insurance a patient has.
Kudos to HealthDay for explicitly addressing cost.

The drug also improved overall airway function, an effect researchers hadn't expected, Israel said. But, this powerful cancer drug can't be recommended for them on the basis of this small study, Israel and other specialists noted. Side-effects were not as severe as expected, he added. "Further studies will be needed to assess its utility in moderate asthma." Two generic versions of the drug were launched last year, which could make it less pricey than new-wave asthma drugs headed for the market, Israel added.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: We were glad the story addressed costs, but actual figures would have been more helpful. It says imatinib “might provide a relatively inexpensive new treatment for asthma patients. Two generic versions of the drug were launched last year, which could make it less pricey than new-wave asthma drugs headed for the market, Israel added.”
While it may cost less than other options, this treatment isn’t what we consider inexpensive, even off-patent. Generic imatinib costs $96.53 to $276.53 per tablet, according to Drugs.com.

Gene therapy is well-suited for treating inherited brain diseases. But within a few years, five of them had developed leukemia from the treatment.

EXPLANATION: While some therapeutic strategies appear to have been approved in China and Europe, according to the story, none has been approved in the Unites States, suggesting that cost information isn’t yet relevant. But the story does indicate how expensive these therapies might be, by mentioning a breathtaking bit of pricing by one European company: $1.4 million per injection.
This is enough to rate as Satisfactory, though the story could have done more to help patients understand what pricing might look like for gene therapies, which is surely on the minds of the venture capitalists funding the research.

Dr. Douglas P. Zipes, a professor at the Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis, said the new device could someday displace existing models used in many patients Every month, about 10,000 patients in this country get a defibrillator, either for the first time or as replacements for devices whose batteries have worn out. Hundreds of patients who received the model have had to undergo new operations to replace it. But Dr. Bardy estimated that the device could work in about 25 percent of patients who now get a defibrillator. Dr. Bardy said the cost of the new device is about the same as a standard defibrillator. However, he said it could help reduce health care costs, because implanting it is much simpler.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: 
The story notes that the cost of the device would be similar to that of existing devices, but that implantation is simpler, which might make those costs lower. It would have been helpful to specify the estimated cost of existing implantable defibrillators.

Because although colonoscopy certainly has its advantages, direct evidence that it’s the best way to prevent deaths from colorectal cancer is not one of them. But there is a menu of options beyond colonoscopies — and they’re not necessarily any better or worse, according to the USPSTF’s recently finalized updated recommendations for screening among average-risk adults. (Wender doesn’t recommend the OTC tests that are available.) So why do so many people prefer it to the poop test? No one is arguing colonoscopy is a bad test.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: We’ll give this story a Satisfactory rating in this category since it does mention the $1,000 cost of a colonoscopy and that one of the two at-home screening tests costs about $25.  But readers would benefit more by knowing the average costs of the two alternatives, rather than just the cost of one.

And another mainstream expert is much more disapproving. A major attraction of the technique is the hope that it can help patients avoid drugs, which often have side effects. These issues, they say, can be represented on a “brain map,” the initial EEG readings that serve as a guide for treatment. Dr. Norman Doidge, a psychiatrist at the Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research at Columbia and the author of “The Brain That Changes Itself” (Viking, 2007), said he considered neurofeedback “a powerful stabilizer of the brain.” Practitioners make even more enthusiastic claims. When it comes to to the actual devices, Dr. Kerson, at the International Society for Neurofeedback and Research, cautioned that they should never be used without experienced supervision.

Boolbol is scheduled to present the findings Thursday at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's breast cancer symposium in San Francisco. In June, the radiation-free device won the blessing of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel. Looking at the volume of tissue excised, the researchers said not much more tissue was removed when the device was used compared to tissue removed in the initial and subsequent surgeries among the control-group patients, Boolbol said. However, she thinks more research is needed. The expected cost of the MarginProbe in the United States, if approved, is not yet known, said Michael Graffeo, a spokesman for its maker, Dune Medical Devices.

It's a mind-controlled robotic arm that has pressure sensors in each fingertip that send signals directly to Copeland's brain. That makes it very challenging to perform simple tasks like grasping a foam coffee cup without crushing it, McLoughlin says. "But the brain hasn't lost its ability to feel." Of course, mind-controlled robots are still years away from consumer applications, McLoughlin says. And there's no good way to control them without implanting electrodes in the brain.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story states: “At the moment, they [robotic arms with touch sensitivity] are still too expensive, too bulky and too finicky to be used outside a laboratory setting.”
While the story could have helped provide more context by explaining the cost of the experimental surgery on the patient–even without speculating on the cost of the robotic arm itself–this is enough to merit a satisfactory rating.

EXPLANATION: This was a strong point for the story, which did provide some information on cost. “The study did not address whether screening is cost-effective. In the U.S., cholesterol tests cost around $80 and usually are covered by health insurance, though much lower prices often are negotiated. The study authors in England estimated that if cholesterol testing costs $7 and gene testing costs $300, it would cost $2,900 for every person identified as having the disorder.” We wish the story would have noted the cost of gene testing in the U.S. but otherwise found this satisfactory.
The story also could have noted that although statin drugs are generic and relatively inexpensive, the long-term costs of treatment from childhood onward are likely to be significant.

For any individual woman, the odds of developing “contralateral” breast cancer — that is, in the opposite breast — are still lower than 200-to-1 per year. The trial included 1,918 postmenopausal women who had what’s called hormone-receptor positive breast cancer, in which the hormones estrogen or progesterone fuel the proliferation of cells. The women had taken another breast cancer drug, tamoxifen, for several years and then were started on an aromatase inhibitor, which doctors usually prescribe for five years. Experts said the study was significant because some women and their doctors choose to continue aromatase inhibitors past the standard five years. Dr. Debra Patt, a breast cancer specialist at Texas Oncology who was not involved in the study, called the difference of a few percentage points in the risk of recurrence (95 percent vs. 91 percent) “substantial.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions costs. Letrozole, the aromatase inhibitor used in the trial, is available as a generic for less than $100 a month.

Dr. Prem Chattoo, a New York based gastroenterologist, told FoxNews.com that the balloon is placed it into the stomach through the mouth. Patients are treated in office and are kept under mild to moderate sedation. In addition to eliminating the scarring and risks involved with more invasive options, Chattoo said that the recovery time is also much faster. The hope is that patients can train their body to eat in a much healthier fashion without feeling overly hungry. Chattoo said that even if the balloon were to pop, the saline would be absorbed and pose no harm to the patient.

A three-year randomized controlled clinical trial has found that two topical creams are effective in most primary, low-risk superficial BCC, comparing favorably with photodynamic therapy (PDT), as reported by investigators in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology. There are over two million cases a year in the U.S. and the lifetime risk of developing a BCC before the age of 85 years is one in five people. "The main advantages of noninvasive treatments are good cosmetic outcome, preservation of surrounding tissue, and potential for home application of either creams," explained lead investigator Marieke Roozeboom of the Department of Dermatology, Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands. "Throughout the last two decades there has been a growing interest in these non-surgical therapies, which offer the possibility of avoiding surgery and reducing demands on busy medical practices." "When choosing a treatment for an individual patient with a superficial BCC, other factors like age, compliance, and patient preferences should always be taken into account.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The news release notes that “Fluorouracil has the advantage of being less expensive than imiquimod,” a statement for which we rank this satisfactory. But it would have been more complete if we had been told how much cheaper, and how the topical treatments compare with the cost of surgical removal or photo-dynamic therapy.

And even the company’s founder and CEO acknowledges the test can’t provide clear and definitive answers on which treatments women should try next if they’re struggling with infertility. But the report doesn’t note that just 1 percent of women have that condition in the first place, making the odds still overwhelmingly in her favor. Beim, the Celmatix CEO, said the test is already bringing “tremendous” value, in part by providing guidance that can act as a “tiebreaker” to help patients and their doctor decide which treatment to prioritize. That patient is now considering an egg donor. The patient asked a good question: What would we do differently if we had this genetic analysis?
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?

The research involved about 200 medical interns — residents in their first post-graduate year, which is often one of the most intense periods of doctor training. Sarah Dalechek, a first-year psychiatry resident at that university, said her program requires two month-long rotations of 16-hour overnight shifts in an emergency room. The study involved interns at Yale University and the University of Southern California. The online program included sessions about how to put feelings of stress or despair into perspective. Previous research has shown benefits from similar web-based therapy in other settings.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story says the study involved a free online program developed in Australia. Knowing that it is free may be incentive enough for some individual doctors or their hospitals to look into it — so this is useful information.

Trouble is, the moderation wore off in a few days, and the DBS also interfered with the animals' social behavior. That got Halpern thinking about a newer system — one that doesn't stimulate continuously, like DBS, but switches on briefly only after sensing a trouble signal, much like a pacemaker monitors and responds to abnormal heart rhythms. The intermittent system controlled overeating much better than the continuous or random protocols — and nearly as well as in a separate group of mice that got zapped manually by a researcher watching their behavior on video. Plus, the treatment seemed specific to the food addiction. Figuring out if this biomarker would also work in people is challenging.

The study included 18,201 people in 1,034 clinical sites in 39 countries and was consistent worldwide, the sponsors said. Although the study was financed by the drug makers, which raises the issue of bias, it met the gold standard for medical research as a randomized, double-blinded trial in which doctors and patients did not know who took which pill until the end. The companies’ stock soared after they released a brief statement about the stroke and bleeding benefits in June. The first new drug, Pradaxa, from the German drug maker Boehringer Ingelheim, was introduced in the United States last fall. Its New York-based makers are marketing powerhouses with the top two best-selling drugs in the world, Lipitor from Pfizer and Plavix from Bristol-Myers Squibb.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentioned that it was expected that the drug reported on would cost $8/day as compared with <$1/day for warfarin.

But she added that an ongoing study in the United Kingdom involving 200,000 women should more definitively determine the test's value. But none proved as accurate as CA-125 after a Harvard scientist developed a mathematical model combining trends in test results and a patient's age. One expert said the study is an important step but definitely needs follow-up work. Over the study's nine years, 85 women had ultrasounds and eight had surgery. Among the study participants was Liz Stegall, who enrolled at the request of the family of Linda Nelson Taylor, a friend who died of ovarian cancer that wasn't diagnosed until it was advanced.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story does mention how much the blood test and ultrasound cost. The story could have raised the question of whether this might be too expensive given that thousands of women must be tested in order to find one case of ovarian cancer.

Marketed as "Coolief", the procedure uses radio frequency to target and mute the nerves responsible for sending pain signals from the arthritic knee to the brain. Because it was just approved by the FDA in April, the treatment is not widely available yet, but pain centers across the country are beginning to offer it. Some of the reported risks from the procedure include bleeding and infection. For some patients with structural problems of the knee, the procedure won't help, said pain specialist Dr. Edgar Ross, associate professor of anesthesia at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Coolief can be repeated if necessary, but it's not a permanent solution.

And one chapter of the book is devoted to neurofeedback. On the other hand, Rabiner says, neurofeedback may offer something other treatments can't. But it will take better research to figure out whether neurofeedback can live up to that promise, Rabiner says. But other children got a placebo -- a race car that paid no attention to their brain waves. Until a large study comes along using this sort of approach, parents and consumers will have to decide for themselves whether neurofeedback is worth the time and effort.

And it worked to improve not just one risk factor for heart disease, but many. There's a lot of hype over mobile health interventions these days, Chow says. "And mobile health – and text messaging, maybe, in particular – represents both a scalable and affordable approach." It can be hard to view those everyday decisions in light of more distant consequences, like having another heart attack or not living as long a life as desired. Chow and Eapen say the study has its limitations.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: This is a tricky one. The story does not explicitly address cost, except to call text messaging “a scalable and affordable approach.” For many (or most) patients, the cost of receiving four text messages a week would likely be negligible — covered by an individual’s phone plan or by nominal text rates. However, not everyone owns a mobile phone, a fact that makes access (and cost) a more significant issue. However, the story does deliver on this point. The story discusses both the number of U.S. adults who own mobile phones (90 percent) and the fact that text messages are more accessible than other forms of mobile health communication (such as apps, which require patients to own smartphones or other smart devices). So, while we’d prefer a more in-depth discussion here, we’ll award a Satisfactory rating for the story’s nod in this direction.

But that was only the case among people who stuck with the diet study over a few months. The new supplement used in this study is less unpleasant — but there’s still room for improvement, said Astrup. Neither the researchers nor the participants knew who was receiving the seaweed supplement. For Mette Kristensen, one of the study’s authors, the message seems clear: “If you actually comply with the treatment, you do have the improvement in weight loss.”

However, effects on blood pressure were less promising. According to the researchers, the higher sodium content of the alginate drink — a little over one gram per dose, or about half a teaspoon of salt — could have offset any potential blood-pressure reducing effect of the supplement.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story explained that alginate as an aid to weight loss is already available in pill form, selling for around $45 for a seven-day supply.

That's important because many patients stop taking other drugs due to side effects or frequent dosing. But with many cheaper, heavily advertised treatments, doctors view its expected high cost as a drawback. Denosumab would be the first osteoporosis treatment that is such a monoclonal antibody — a type of immune cell cloned from the same parent cell to bind to a specific substance. Denosumab, an injection just under the skin, would have to compete against eight major types of pills and injected medicines, including estrogen and generic and brand-name Fosamax pills, long the market leader. Spine bone density loss was far smaller for those given the drug.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?

CAD is becoming more widespread, said Dr. Joshua Fenton, an associate professor of family and community medicine at the University of California, Davis, and lead study author. Now, with about 75 percent of mammograms adding it, it is even more common, Fenton said. Dr. Daniel Kopans, a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School and senior radiologist in the breast imaging division at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the study provides additional information to doctors and women, but has some limitations. One limitation of the study, he said, is that the researchers cannot say for sure it was the computer-aided detection that made the difference. Other factors could have played a role, such as the radiologists becoming more experienced, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story points out that Medicare pays an additional $11 for mammography readings that use CAD.  It would also be useful for readers to know that women can’t choose whether to have their mammograms read using CAD or not using CAD.

Calcium deposits develop as a response to plaque formation along the artery walls, Shaw said. Doctors learned in the 1990s that these calcified plaques show up on CT scans, and can be used to determine whether a person is suffering from hardening of the arteries, Shaw said. "The best use is in patients who have no symptoms, but the value of the test is not well known." People with many calcium deposits can improve their long-term prospects by eating right, exercising, and taking medication to treat heart risk factors such as high blood pressure, elevated blood cholesterol and type 2 diabetes, Shaw said. The findings appear in the July 7 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story helpfully notes that the CAC test costs about $100, which matches price quotes from other sources, though the price may be higher in some parts of the country. The story would have been even more useful had it noted that the cost of the test may not be covered by insurance.

But that leaves patients and doctors in an untenable situation. Those findings made Dr. Modic ask: Why do a scan in the first place?

"This [new] drug has a lot of advantages over warfarin." With apixaban, patients can use a standard dose that doesn't need monitoring and adjusting, Ansell said. The study was funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer, the makers of apixaban. Ansell expects drugs in this class will have a major effect on how atrial fibrillation is managed in the future. "This represents a very important therapeutic advance in the care of patients with atrial fibrillation."
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentioned that apixabane would cost more than warafarin, and included a quote from a company spokesperson to indicate that the exact price is uncertain as the medication has not yet been approved.  The story also presented a reasoned examination of total costs for the use of warafin that accounted not just for per pill costs but also the expenses associated with the routine blood draws to examine warafarin levels.

The findings underscore the danger of rushing to adopt a procedure before careful studies have been conducted to fully determine its benefits, Boden and others said. "This study was limited to a fairly select group of patients with very stable symptoms." Those concerns had led doctors to curtail their use of the newer devices, and the new findings are expected to have a similar effect on angioplasty overall. "I think this will cause a tilt toward more patients with stable conditions choosing medical therapy and more people who have more severe disease getting bypass surgery, which both relieves symptoms and reduces the risk for heart attack and death." Although about one-third of patients who initially got medical treatment later turned to angioplasty, the findings show how much medical treatment of heart disease has improved, Boden said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions that angioplasty typically costs $50,000.  While it would have been helpful to have a sense for the cost of angioplasty in in comparison to medical therapy, the story does give a sense of the cost burden to the healthcare system by providing procedures that don't benefit a significant proportion of patients.

The massive National Lung Screening Trial enrolled 53,000 current or former smokers to try to settle the debate. The best advice for avoiding lung cancer remains to quit smoking, said NCI Director Dr. Harold Varmus. It is most often diagnosed at advanced stages, and the average five-year survival rate is just 15 percent. Many smokers already had sought out spiral CTs, even though the American Cancer Society hasn't recommended the test - citing a lack of clear evidence that they work - and most insurance doesn't cover the $300 to $400 cost. Nor is it clear if the study results are applicable to all smokers.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: 


The story reports that these scans typically cost $300-400 and are not generally covered by insurance. The story would have been better if it had clearly pointed out that the potentially huge cost of such a screening program, because hundreds of smokers had to be scanned to extend one life in this trial and follow-up tests and treatments cost much more than the initial scan. Nonetheless, we’ll give it the benefit of the doubt on this criterion. The New York Times never specified the scans’ costs.

"As a whole, the study is negative," study author Dr. Robert Coleman, a professor of medical oncology at the University of Sheffield in England, said during a Thursday news conference on the findings. The focus was on disease-free survival. Anderson Cancer Center, was not involved in the study but put it in perspective. Other studies underway may provide a clearer answer, she said. Since the current study was presented at a meeting, its findings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: We won’t require a discussion of costs in this story because the use of zoledronic acid for early stage breast cancer is still up in the air.

One of the recommendations was that statins should be prescribed to anyone with a 7.5 percent risk or higher of developing heart disease over the next 10 years. There’s an online tool that people or their doctors can use to calculate their risk of heart disease, which is based on age, sex, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Statins, which include Lipitor, Mevacor, Crestor and Zocor, are extremely popular. Limiting factors should be a patient's own preference about taking a daily pill, price and the risk of diabetes, they said. “There is no longer any question as to whether to offer treatment with statins for patients for primary prevention, and there should now be fewer questions about how to treat and in whom,” Dr. Philip Greenland, an expert in preventive medicine at Northwestern University and a senior editor of the journal, and Dr. Michael Lauer of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute wrote in a commentary.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: While the New York Times skipped the cost question, NBC gave readers the numbers they needed to know. It said that “Statins, which include Lipitor, Mevacor, Crestor and Zocor, are extremely popular. They’re prescribed to about 15 percent of U.S. adults, at a cost ranging from about $4 a month for the cheapest generic version to $600 for a pricey name-brand.” That’s a huge cost range and, multiplied out for the millions more Americans who are being encouraged to take statins, represents a significant potential increase in health care spending. To inform readers even more fully, the story could have looked at what those global costs would add up to for the entire country. It also could have explained what researchers mean when they say that the drugs are “worth it” and how the value of treatment was calculated in the study.

Podiatrists have begun using a laser treatment that combats the infection — or wastes their patients’ money because it doesn’t work, depending on whom you ask. The treatment, in which the podiatrist aims a laser beam at the patient’s toenails to kill the organisms that cause the fungus, costs about $1,000 and is not covered by insurance because it is considered an aesthetic procedure. In this case, there is a chance.”

Even John Strisower, the founder of PinPointe USA, says patients should expect at least a minimal reinfection within five years after laser treatment. There’s no one route of infection, but sources include pedicures and locker room showers. “I’ve had patients come in who have had laser procedures and not seen long-term success.”

Firestone also says that over-the-counter antifungal nail creams and ointments rarely work because they can’t penetrate the nail root.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story did a good job on this point. It noted that one treatment “costs about $1,000 and is not covered by insurance.” It put this into a larger context by saying, “Last year, Americans spent $354 million on prescription and over-the-counter treatments for toenail fungus, according to IMS Health, a health-care information company.” And it described at the end of the story how one patient has tried to fend off reinfection by buying a $130 sterilization kit for his shoes.

Experts generally recommend that people at average risk of colon cancer start screening tests for the disease at age 50. Positive results on the screen prompt a follow-up colonoscopy to investigate the source of the blood. Immunochemical FOBT is now largely replacing the older test. But as far as cutting the risk of death from colon cancer, stool testing is similarly effective, according to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. A screening colonoscopy averages around $3,000.

An emerging treatment for a common hospital-acquired infection could be (slightly) less gross in the future. Kao is one of the authors of the paper and a gastroenterologist at the University of Alberta. Other efforts to take the “poop” out of the poop pills—to just include the bacteria thought to be behind the benefits—have failed. But most importantly, the study found no difference in effectiveness between the two therapies. Though the procedures were done in a Canadian hospital, the FMTs delivered by colonoscopy cost nearly $500 USD more than the capsules, which cost about $300.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job of pointing out one advantage of the pill approach compared to delivery via colonoscopy–the reduced cost. “There was a significant difference in cost. Though the procedures were done in a Canadian hospital, the FMTs delivered by colonoscopy cost nearly $500 USD more than the capsules, which cost about $300.”

The reason was that the results were overwhelmingly compelling — men taking the drug were not getting prostate cancer. But, as Dr. Scardino pointed out in an editorial five years ago in The New England Journal of Medicine that accompanied the study, it appeared that 6.4 percent of the men who took the drug got fast growing, ominous-looking tumors. The concern was that the drug might be preventing cancers that never spread. Maybe, they thought, by shrinking the prostate, the drug was just making it easier to find aggressive tumors. Now, though, prostate cancer specialists have a new problem: How can they change the drug’s image?

With roots in autism treatment theories that until now have lived mostly on the Internet, the pediatric clean room plan would be the first of its kind in a mainstream American hospital environment. Basically, it would be pushing a "reset" button on the child's body, with the hope of wiping autistic symptoms away. The Children's Institute plan would be taking what is arguably a fringe movement into the mainstream: It would be the first autism treatment of this kind staged in an American hospital setting. With so many doubts -- and so few answers -- about effective autism treatments among the growing community of families affected by the condition, the institute said openness is vital to the experimental method's success. But a significant portion of parents will feel good about this and watch this with incredible interest.

Of the initial 19,066 participants with a negative initial LDCT scan, 444 (2 percent) were diagnosed with lung cancer at the time of the last available follow-up. An additional 75 patients (0.4 percent of the initial negative group) were diagnosed with lung cancer between the first and second annual screening. The researchers determined that eliminating the first annual screening after the initial negative test might have resulted in, at most, an additional 28 lung cancer deaths in the LDCT group (186 vs. 212 deaths per 100,000 per years) over the course of the study. "Our analysis suggests that annual screens may not be warranted for patients who have had an initial negative scan, and future risk prediction and cost-effectiveness models could incorporate these data to improve screening guidelines," Patz said. He added that improving the accuracy of LDCT screening for lung cancer would also significantly reduce the number of annual screens.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?

And there is evidence that excess calcium can increase the risk of heart disease, the group wrote. Most people need to take supplements to reach levels above 30 nanograms per milliliter, he added. But, the committee concluded, a level of 20 to 30 nanograms is all that is needed for bone health, and nearly everyone is in that range. Vitamin D is more complicated, the group said. It is not clear how or why the claims for high vitamin D levels started, medical experts say.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Most people know roughly what a bottle of vitamin D supplements might cost them, so the lack of information on cost is not a significant gap. We appreciate that the story provided data showing the large and growing amount our society is spending on vitamin D supplements ($430 million in 2009), with apparently little health benefit to show for it.

Powerful medications and frequent use of her inhaler could not prevent repeated trips to the emergency room. Since then, about 650 patients across the country have had the procedure. But several five-year studies showed no long-term safety issues. The one-time cost of $20,000, they say, is dwarfed by the tens of thousands of dollars in hospital bills and medication costs that a severe asthmatic can easily accumulate in a single year. Dr. McEvoy argued that it made economic sense, and earlier this year Health Partners agreed.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story discusses the high price of the procedure and the unwillingness of most insurers to cover it.

However, we’ll give the benefit of the doubt here.

The paper, issued by the American Society of Clinical Oncologists (ASCO) and published July 12 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology essentially brings guidelines in alignment with today's practice. It also reduced the risk of the cancer spreading to other parts of the body. Aromatase inhibitors are not effective in this age group, the experts note. Yes, in two areas: preventing recurrent disease in other parts of the body and in preventing a second, separate breast cancer. On the other hand, Burstein pointed out, the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole recently became available as a generic, which should lower the cost significantly.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story specifically points out that generic tamoxifen costs $21.90 a month and the aromatase inhibitor, Arimidex®, costs $379.80 a month. The story was also quick to note that a generic form of Arimidex® is now available and costs much less. Going one step further, the story included a discussion of how the cost of treatment can factor into the decision-making process.

“It was really bad,” Joyce, 29, told FoxNews.com. I was really uncomfortable and miserable.”

Joyce tried over-the-counter medications but couldn’t find relief. She consulted an allergist at Weill Cornell Medicine/New York-Presbyterian Hospital, where a clinical trial involving immunotherapy toothpaste was taking place. Joyce, who lives in the Bronx, New York, signed on for the year-long study that required six of the 12 volunteers to brush their teeth for two minutes using two pumps of the toothpaste in either the morning or night, and the other six to use drops under their tongue. Volunteers using the toothpaste were also required to log their usage in a journal.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?

Dr. Eric P. Winer, chief of women’s cancers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said that even women who completed their five years of tamoxifen months or years ago might consider starting on the drug again. There was virtually no difference in death and recurrence between the two groups during the five years of extra tamoxifen. Whether these differences are big enough to cause women to take the drug for twice as long remains to be seen. Dr. Judy E. Garber, director of the Center for Cancer Genetics and Prevention at Dana-Farber, said many women have a love-hate relationship with hormone therapies. Perhaps the most important question is what the results mean for postmenopausal women.

Approved by the Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday for treating advanced-stage melanoma, the virus — called Imlygic, which was developed in part in a Massachusetts lab — is a modified version of the herpes virus that both attacks the cancer and sparks the immune system into action against tumors. “This is huge for the whole field, and for cancer patients,” said John Bell, a senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute in Canada. “After that, there were no side effects.”

Such muted side effects point to a major benefit of this new approach, doctors and patients said. John O’Donnell, a retired math teacher in Piscataway, N.J., was one of those who tried the combination therapy, but ultimately responded only to Imlygic. But he kept with the Imlygic, and the lung tumors soon disappeared.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story nods to costs when it says the company will charge the patient $65,000 for a treatment. But they actually will be trying to charge insurance companies this amount.  How widely will it be covered and when? How many courses of treatment will be necessary? We’ll give the benefit of the doubt here but the story could have done more to clarify.

To gage the effects of lifestyle habits, the researchers developed a score based on the results of the health professionals survey, then applied it to the physicians' study. While there were fewer cases and less detailed data collected in the physicians' study, the score was similar in both populations, indicating the potential benefit of healthy lifestyle habits in warding off lethal prostate cancer, said the authors. Reducing intake of processed meats would cut the risk by 12 percent, they reported. These lifestyle habits align with other recommendations to prevent diabetes and heart disease." This study was supported by grants from the Prostate Cancer Foundation and the National Institutes of Health.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The study evaluated the combined effect of six lifestyle habits on prostate cancer mortality. Those six factors were, as described in the journal article: “not currently smoking or quit 10 or more years ago, body mass index under 30 kg/m2, high vigorous physical activity, high intake of tomatoes and fatty fish, and low intake of processed meat.” It’s tough to put a price tag on those lifestyle choices. How much does “high vigorous physical activity” cost? How much does it cost to avoid eating processed meat? It would be easy to say this category doesn’t apply. But the release does address the issue, saying the study findings underscore “the ongoing need for more effective prevention measures and policies to increase exercise, improve diet quality and reduce tobacco use in our population….It takes co-operation and effort from multiple areas, like insurance companies, employers, policy makers and city planners, to figure out how to creatively support and encourage more exercise into most busy adults’ working day.” Recognizing the need for policies that support these lifestyle changes is important — and addresses the cost issue in a meaningful way.

Still, the finding is “reassuring” because previous research had linked high selenium with higher cholesterol levels, said study author Dr. Eliseo Guallar, from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. The picture of selenium’s health benefits — or possible health risks — has been anything but clear. It’s also available in supplement form, and costs about $2 for a month’s supply. Researchers measured participants’ cholesterol levels at the beginning of the study and after six months on the selenium supplements or placebo. While Guallar said the results are “good news” in showing that high selenium intake is probably not a risk for high cholesterol, he wanted to add a note of caution.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story says a month’s supply of selenium costs about $2. But many people may be getting selenium in their daily multivitamin, and may not need to buy more.

Physicians will "be able to use a simple blood test and then know that this woman is at increased risk or reduced risk of a preterm birth," said Graves, whose laboratory performed the research in the study. The test wasn't as effective at 24 weeks of gestation. The test may cost $150 to $250, Graves said. Even if the test is found to indicate that a birth will be premature, physicians would have limited options. The study appears in the May issue of the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology.

Health benefits, including weight loss, seem to be a byproduct of the program, said Dr. David Katz, director of the Yale University Prevention Research Center. For the study, Lumeng's team collected data on more than 43,700 Michigan preschool-age children between 2005 and 2013. "The children may be served healthier meals at Head Start than other children." "We know that better sleep is linked with less obesity," she added. "It [also] may be that when kids go to Head Start, it reduces stress in the household and frees up time and resources at home to dedicate to healthier eating patterns," she noted.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story states early in the article that the Head Start Program is free to impoverished children ages 3-5.

Still, the news is expected to be greeted favorably by doctors and patients and by Wall Street. Dr. Ramsey, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington, was briefed on the results by Vertex. In a note to clients Tuesday evening, before the results were known, an analyst at ISI Group, Mark Schoenebaum, said that an improvement of 10 percent would be a “home run’’ that could lead to $600 million in annual sales for the drug. The company is awaiting results of a second trial of the drug, this one in younger children. But since there are only about 1,200 Americans who are candidates for the drug, the price is likely to be tens of thousands of dollars a year.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: It discusses the drug’s costs, which are expected to be substantial. Given the relatively small population that the drug might be of benefit to, price considerations are important. The story briefly notes both aspects.

For 63-year-old Lynn Kaufman, the battle against migraines consumed her life. Kudrow is one of hundreds of doctors investigating a new class of drugs that block calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a molecule that spikes during a migraine attack. The aim of the medication is to stop a migraine before it even starts. However, the price tag could be as much as $10,000 a year. Another advantage: it could lead to a decrease in the amount of medications used by patients to handle headaches acutely.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story tells us the drug, if approved, may cost $10,000 a year. This is very useful context.

"This was indeed a small study," acknowledged corresponding study author Joe Vinson, a professor of chemistry at the University of Scranton, in Pennsylvania, but he noted that prior research has been conducted in both France and Japan. "Those studies demonstrated that patients experienced somewhat mild weight loss. "While this of course needs to be confirmed with follow-up, I do think the subject is absolutely worthy of further exploration," Vinson added. In the second section, participants took a 1,050-milligram capsule. Each patient ultimately cycled through each section.

Doing away with a painkilling injections, or nerve blocks, as a test to determine the root cause of the back pain didn't hurt patients who went on to have their pain treated by zapping nerves with electrodes. Patients don't care much about the finer points of diagnostic accuracy. But some pain experts defend the value of the diagnostic tests. The study's suggestion on how to manage back pain also runs counter to current guidelines from major medical groups. Doctors may not change their approach anytime soon, however.

"But the dose [given] is a lot more than conventionally given for any condition." And since the study period lasted only two months, there was no way to tell whether such a high dose produced any toxic long-term effects. The cost of vitamin D supplements would be roughly comparable with both of these remedies. Experts wondered if women with higher blood levels would experience such dramatic cramp relief as observed in the study. Graham and Rabin agreed that much larger trials should be done before they would recommend vitamin D3 use to any of their patients for cramp relief.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story did explain that “The cost of vitamin D supplements would be roughly comparable with (NSAIDS or birth control pills).”  It didn’t give a ballpark cost, but we’ll give it the benefit of the doubt for nodding in the direction of addressing cost.

But doctors are free to use devices off label. ) Doctors on the advisory board for Zeltiq Aesthetics have put the word out about it on television news segments. Hourlong treatments are best spaced out by two months, said Dr. Dover, who charges $700 per spot. That said, a doctor with a Zeltiq device isn’t hard for patients to find. (His partner, Dr. David J. Goldberg, was an investigator for Zeltiq.)
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story states the price for the Zerona device: $1,700 to $3,800 for six sessions. The price of Zeltiq is also reported but is not as clear: We learn only that one doctor charges "$700 per spot"–but not how many treatments are provided or needed, what constitues as "spot," and so on.

Experts commenting on the findings said they had “enormous potential to change clinical practice” and raised the question of whether most stroke patients with motor skill problems should be treated with this relatively cheap type of antidepressant. A few previous small trials had already suggested that giving drugs like Prozac, which belongs to a drug class known as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), might improve motor skill recovery after stroke. Commenting on the study, Robert Robinson and Harold Adams from the University of Iowa in the United States, said it could change the way doctors treat stroke victims in future, but more research is needed to see if the effects continue over time. Roger Bonomo, director of stroke care at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, said another way to look at the implications of this trial would be as justification for treatment of post-stroke depression before it progresses. “If motor function is also more likely to improve, then treating before symptoms of depression emerge is likely to be even more beneficial.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: It mentions that the drug is available generically and is generally inexpensive. It also discusses the economic impact of stroke, teeing up the potential downstream cost savings, in terms of disability care avoided, if the benefit of fluoxetine in this setting proves to durable.

Abaloparatide and Forteo are synthetic peptides that help grow and strengthen bone, Miller said. Forteo is covered by Medicare, Miller said. There were no differences among the groups in other serious side effects, such as nausea and heart palpations, Miller said. There needs to be a large head-to-head trial between Forteo and abaloparatide, she said, to really see which drug is better. An editorial accompanying the study said which drug is selected may be less important than identifying and starting an approved treatment.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Although it is not known how much abaloparatide will cost at this stage, the article does discuss the cost of its would-be competitor, Forteo, which costs about $2,500 a month for those without insurance.

Testimonials like that are a big reason dry needling has caught on with some physical therapists, athletes and other patients, Briggs says. Burgoon’s group has persuaded some states to bar physical therapists from the practice. But it said higher quality studies were needed. Will insurers pay for this? About 6,000 have taken courses in dry needling in the past few years, Zylstra says.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story nicely calls out different questions that readers might have, including whether insurance will pay for the therapy. It answers, “Many will not. Charges for patients can range from $10 to $75 per session, says Edo Zylstra, CEO of KinetaCore, a company that offers intensive three-day weekend courses in dry needling to physical therapists.”

It's only been implanted in a few dozen people who were studied for a matter of months, limiting information about its long-term use and safety. It's also not clear when the pacemaker may be publicly available, and its cost is unknown. And the existing version of the device won't work for most pacemaker patients because it lacks some key features. Still, a new company-funded study shows that "this is now a possibility" that could reduce infections and the severity of pacemaker surgery, said study author Dr. Vivek Reddy, director of the Cardiac Arrhythmia Service at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Still, he said, the new device will probably be more expensive than other pacemakers, and may pose special risks of its own.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story explains that this is in the “early testing” phase, so it’s understandable that a cost estimate might not be given.
In the second paragraph, the story states that the cost is unknown.
And an independent expert postulated that “the new device will probably be more expensive than other pacemakers.”

The article reports that the device provides clear visualization of the surgical site where the tumor was removed, thereby improving communication between the surgeon and radiation oncologist. The study also noted that the device provides a helpful guide for post-treatment mammograms and other long-term follow-up to check for any cancer recurrence in these patients. The authors said use of the marker facilitated their shift toward these shorter courses of radiotherapy. By providing better targeting, they said, the marker could also play a role in facilitating the use of external beam partial breast irradiation. "The marker tells us where the tumor was and helps us determine appropriate forms of treatment, whether with partial breast irradiation or standard whole breast irradiation and a boost dose at the end of the treatment process."
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The news release declares the cost of treatment will be cut “by approximately 25%” without indicating a starting cost for treatment without the implant.
But the release does go in to some detail on how cost savings were estimated: During the three-year span of the study, the marker facilitated many physicians to shift from traditional external beam radiation to the shorter course hypo-fractionated radiation therapy, which results in a cost savings. The patient outcomes remain similar, however.

The drug costs at least $350 a month, plus the price of doctor's visits. It's unclear whether the findings will make a dent in an addiction that affects millions of Americans. The study, published in today's Journal of the American Medical Association, was funded by the maker of the drug, Johnson & Johnson Inc.'s Ortho-McNeil Neurologics. All volunteers were encouraged — but not required — to stop drinking. The Topamax group cut back to six drinks a day, on average, assuming everyone who dropped out of the study relapsed into heavy drinking.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story provided an estimate for the cost of the treatment as well as the reminder that the costs for the doctor’s visit also needed to be factored in.

Newswise — Chicago — A single breath may be all it takes to identify the return of lung cancer after surgery, according to a study posted online today by The Annals of Thoracic Surgery. Being able to identify this lung cancer “signature” through a simple breath test has emerged as one of the most promising ways to diagnose the disease. Now the test is being used to monitor for disease recurrence. “We hope that the breath analysis can serve as the primary screening tool for cancer recurrence and a CT scan ordered only if the breath test suggests that there has been a change,” said Dr. van Berkel. The pump is reusable; the balloon, microchip, and lab test together cost around $20, all supporting the increasing acceptance of breath tests as a cost-effective, easy-to-perform, non-invasive, and rapid option for the diagnosis of lung cancer.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release does mention that the cost of materials to conduct the test is “around $20” which is considerably less than the cost of CT scan imaging which is now being used. It is unclear, however, how much patients would be actually charged. The release should’ve been clearer about the actual cost to patients.

The boxes aren’t the only option for safe sleeping, of course, but health officials say they’re a useful part of a broader safe-sleep education program. Baby Box University, Baby Box Co.’s educational platform, maintains a website that coordinates the educational component of the program. The boxes provide a clutter-free sleep space that has been shown to reduce accidental and unexpected deaths, she said. The boxes are a new idea for many Americans. She said the program was eye-opening for how much information she learned about how to prevent sudden unexpected infant death.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story does say that these boxes are being distributed for free, but by a for-profit company that requires parents to “register” at a website in order to receive one.
We think the collection of information on new parents may benefit the for-profit company. The story would have been stronger if it faced that issue squarely. See more on this under the funding and conflicts of interest criteria section below.

The pocket-watch-sized device is billed as "a pacemaker for the brain," the newest cutting-edge treatment for as many as 4 million adults whose severe depression is not relieved by psychotherapy, drugs or even shock treatments. At the heart of the debate is this: The only rigorous clinical trial of the device -- which is approved to treat severe epilepsy -- failed to demonstrate effectiveness in alleviating depression. The device has also attracted attention on Capitol Hill, where the Senate Finance Committee has spent two years looking into decision-making at the FDA. A report by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, an influential mental health insurer in Boston, called it "experimental, investigational and unproven." "Hundreds of psychiatric thought leaders and patients are rallying around the device" for "the worst of the worst" cases of depression, he said.

Not only “does it reassure us that several surgical procedures are effective,” she said, it demonstrates that surgery “should be done as early as possible” once it becomes clear that a child is not responding to two anti-seizure medications. “The study in kids shows if you reduce the time from the onset of seizures from the 15 to 20 years you see in adults down to four to five years, the outcome is much better. Yet the cases were judged to be a success because the seizures decreased in frequency over time. Success rates ranged from 87 percent to 100 percent depending on the type of surgery used to correct the child’s particular brain abnormality. Rather than pay $35,000 to $50,000 on surgery that might cure the problem and prevent further damage to the child, insurance companies prefer to demand that more drugs be tried, even if the odds of them working in drug-resistant cases is small, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The article does an outstanding job of noting the cost of surgery, although the article could have been stronger if it had pointed out the estimated costs of drug therapies, hospitalizations and sometimes institutionalization of children and adults who are severely disabled by some forms of seizure disorders.

The research offers hope to patients who haven’t been helped by traditional antidepressant treatment. That’s probably the best hypothesis.”

Other studies have suggested that SAMe can relieve symptoms of depression. Dr. Nelson, who was not involved in the Harvard study, said the results need to be replicated in a larger study, and that more information is needed on dosing, side effects and long-term treatment with SAMe, among other things. “In the last 60 years of depression research, all the treatments have focused on similar mechanisms of action. This is one of the first few studies that suggests a different mechanism.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: There’s a nice summary of costs and lack of insurance coverage, citing the editorial.
 However, we were surprised to see in this summary that “the cost is relatively low” when the cited editorial states “SAMe is relatively expensive.” This mistake may have been unintentional, and while it’s the exact opposite conclusion of the one in the source, we are inclined not to dock the article a point because the rest of the summary provides balance about copays and, most importantly, tells its readers the absolute monthly cost of the supplement.

a total of 28 studies showing results from nearly 5,000 patients were considered. "While recommendations for dosage and duration of treatment require further study, the efficacy of the medicinal properties of cranberry products has been well-established." The review explains that the medicinal properties of cranberries may be attributed to their unique polyphenol, proanthocyanidins - or PACs, for short. According to the authors, scientists and practitioners continue to explore the use of alternative therapies in the prevention of common infections as part of the global movement to reduce antibiotic use and resistance. It is estimated that one third of women in the United States will get a UTI by the age of 24.2

"Findings like this," adds Dr. Luis, "give practitioners a viable, inexpensive, non-antibiotic option to help patients reduce the recurrence of an uncomfortable and potentially debilitating infection."
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that “cranberry products are low cost,” which is fair enough and is sufficient to earn this a satisfactory rating. The issue of cost is, however, complicated by the fact that the release offers no information on what sort of cranberry products a patient may use. Is one glass of cranberry juice per day sufficient? Does one need to consume the whole berries? Or should patients take over-the-counter cranberry-based supplements? Costs would vary depending on how one chooses to pursue the vague directions discussed in the release.

Lights out for the 69-year-old meant sleeping for a couple of hours before being jolted awake in the middle of the night and lying there electrified. What's more, a recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the bulky CPAP machines — standard treatment for many patients with sleep apnea — doesn't help prevent heart attacks or stroke, although it does help patients sleep better and improve mood. Inspire is an invasive procedure, so it is not recommended as a first-line treatment and not everyone is a candidate.

But because the study was stopped early, a full analysis of the harms caused by screening scans is still months away. In the study, even experienced radiologists at major cancer centers had a high rate of false positives, suggesting that the rate would be even higher in the real world. And it’s possible that many of those scanned unnecessarily could be seriously harmed. “Even in these highly controlled settings, about 1 percent of the people had surgery or a part of their lung removed for something they thought was cancer and it wasn’t.”

(CNN) A one-time treatment with Luxturna, the first US Food and Drug Administration-approved gene therapy for an inherited disorder, will cost $425,000 per eye. One-time-only treatments for rare genetic disorders are still unique, he noted. The drug will be available in the United States in early spring, with an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 people in the US standing to benefit from this treatment, according to Spark. In the phase 3 clinical trial, 27 out of 29 participants -- 93% -- who received the gene therapy demonstrated a gain in functional vision as assessed by a mobility test performed in a maze, according to the company. Similar to Luxturna, Kymriah is a one-time treatment, and its price tag is $475,000.

Two things, though: It wasn’t clear from the story if the patients in the trial had both eyes treated, which would make the more accurate price tag $850,000 vs the talking point of “$425,000 per eye.”

Two days later, she says her foot felt bruised, but she didn't have enough pain to require medication. But most insurers won't pay for it, because they consider it experimental. Duggal says foot specialists don't really know what causes the pain of plantar fasciitis. But while inflammation can be involved in plantar fasciitis, it doesn't seem to be the cause, Duggal says. Meanwhile, foot specialists and their patients are left with a smattering of low-tech treatments that they say all plantar fasciitis patients should try, whether or not they eventually go on to shock-wave therapy.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Cost is a major part of the story here and NPR doesn’t gloss over it. The cost of shockwave treatment can range anywhere from $500 to several thousand dollars, NPR reports, and usually is not covered by insurance. NPR could have added some useful context  by mentioning that the shockwave machines themselves can be very expensive to purchase and operate. This can create an incentive for physicians who have bought such a machine to promote shockwave treatments to patients who may not need them. In addition, it would have been helpful to know how this treatment’s costs differ from those of other common treatments.

At-home sperm tests are a fairly new idea, Imler said, but SpermCheck Fertility is not the first one. For Brittany Scott, a Cortland resident whose husband took the SpermCheck Fertility test, however, it seemed a little more complicated than a pregnancy test. Scott said she wished the test had been available when the couple was struggling to conceive their first child. The male reproductive system should not be oversimplified, Brannigan said. There are several characteristics of sperm alone — at least three that aren't addressed by SpermCheck — that affect male fertility.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story says, “The test costs about $40; the average cost of a semen analysis in a doctor’s office is about $100.” As a comparison, the story says, “There are also several at-home sperm analysis kits available online. They each include a microscope and cost at least $80.”

It is designed for patients who have not had surgery. The treatment, which includes several 20-minute procedures and rehabilitation, costs between $3,500 and $4,000. It is less than half the cost of surgery but is rarely covered by insurance. I would say a quarter of my patients fall asleep.”

The decompression therapy is used to treat herniated discs, ruptured discs, sciatica, bulging discs, degenerative discs, posterior facet syndrome and spinal stenosis/arthritis. “Decompression on the West Coast is a dime a dozen, but here in the Midwest, they are almost unaware of it.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?

But a U.S. expert wasn’t convinced by the results, which run counter to other published studies. “The majority of them are showing no benefit,” said William W. Wong, a nutrition researcher at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston who wasn’t involved in the new work. The new study, published in the journal Menopause, is based on 90 Chinese women. The work was supported by Frutarom Netherlands, which also donated the supplements. He said it was “hard to believe” that soy would have an effect on these women.

Participants taking 4,000 international units - more than six times the daily 600 IUs the Institute of Medicine currently recommends for most adults and children - received the most benefit, says Dr. Anas Raed, research resident in the MCG Department of Medicine and the study's first author. The dose, now considered the highest, safe upper dose of the vitamin by the Institute of Medicine, reduced arterial stiffness the most and the fastest: 10.4 percent in four months. Two thousand IUs decreased stiffness by 2 percent in that timeframe. The test essentially measures the speed at which the blood is moving, and in this case, fast is not good, Raed says. Vitamin D also reduces inflammation, an underlying mechanism for obesity related development of coronary artery disease, says Raed.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release responsibly notes that obtaining more vitamin D is a potentially simple endeavor for most individuals. They can drink more milk, for example, or purchase a relatively inexpensive supplement.

MONDAY, Jan. 4, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Newer blood pressure drugs are as safe and effective as older medications, new research suggests. Scientists at the NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City said their findings settle a longstanding debate about which of two types blood-pressure lowering medications studied are better. Although ACE inhibitors were developed 10 years earlier, both types of drugs showed similar effects in the analysis, challenging previous findings that suggest ACE inhibitors have greater benefits. According to the new analysis, published online Jan. 4 in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings, the only difference between the medications is that ARBs are more easily tolerated. However, when trials were conducted at similar times, one drug was not more effective than the other, the findings showed.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: We’ll give the story a grudging satisfactory in this category since it mentions, as a closing statement, that many ARBs are now generic, which means their cost is lower than brand-name equivalents.  But the story would be more helpful to readers if it provided an idea of the comparative costs for the two types of drugs, as well as an average annual cost, since patients remain on them for long periods of time, if not for life. Though more ARBs are now available generically, the costs of generic ARBs generally remain higher than for ACEIs. For many doctors and patients, the use of ACEIs may still be preferred simply because they’re cheaper – even given similar efficacy and a slightly greater need to stop them due to side effects.

Moreover, they warn that while regular screening might help doctors catch cancer earlier, it also comes with a high price tag and added risks to patients. Everybody agrees that CT “does find the early stage lung cancer,” said Dr. Heidi Roberts, a lung cancer researcher from Women’s College Hospital, Toronto who wasn’t involved in the new study. That’s consistent with the findings of the National Lung Screening Trial in the U.S., which in November released data — published online in the New England Journal of Medicine last week — showing that 20 percent fewer middle-aged heavy smokers died of lung cancer when they were screened annually with a CT scan compared to a standard, less detailed chest X-ray. And screening comes with an inherent risk of false-positives — scans which suggest a lung cancer that turns out not to be there. While doctors ruled out cancer, those patients would have undergone further tests, sometimes including biopsies, which can cause complications including infection and bleeding.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story emphasizes cost several times, including the estimate of a few hundred dollars per scan.

It's unclear how many patients have had to stop or chosen to stop treatment for depression due to side effects. Finally, her psychiatrist, suspicious that her body might process medication differently than most, recommended a genetic test to see why Ellis wasn’t responding to the prescriptions. “Once the genetic testing became available it provided Sarah with more than just physical relief," says Dr. Matthew B. Stanley of the Avera Medical Group in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Related: Is Your Medication Helping or Hurting? While the results are striking, this technology is not a guarantee of complete resolution of depressive symptoms or medication side effects.

For biochemist Peter Molan, honey's ancient power to heal is not a matter of faith. The most promising research, he and many other scientists say, focuses instead on bioactive honey's potency as a topical application. (And there's wide agreement among medical professionals that people should not test the treatment themselves by slathering their cuts and burns with honey from the pantry shelf.) Rose Cooper, a microbiologist and honey expert at the University of Wales Institute at Cardiff, remains cautiously optimistic that the increased use of honey dressings will help better information to emerge. "Honey is not a panacea," she said in a telephone interview, but it has been used by British doctors for several years, and with its growing use elsewhere in the world, "health-care professionals will be more likely to consider honey in treating wounds, and so more data will accumulate."

During the one-year follow-up period, patients went to an academic bariatric center of excellence as part of their treatment. Dr. Sharaiha noted that these findings do not suggest that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty will replace the two surgical treatments as weight-loss interventions. Instead, these results show that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is another possibility that patients and health-care providers should consider when discussing options. When examining cost, researchers reported endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty resulted in the lowest-cost, with an average institutional procedure cost of $12,000, compared to $22,000 for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and $15,000 for laparoscopic banding. "For years, patients seeking weight-loss interventions had limited options because they could not tolerate or did not want surgery, or it was not even an option for them," added Dr. Sharaiha.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release does a good job here, comparing the average cost of three different procedures: “researchers reported endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty resulted in the lowest-cost, with an average institutional procedure cost of $12,000, compared to $22,000 for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and $15,000 for laparoscopic banding.” However, the release also notes that banding and gastrectomy involve spending more time in the hospital, and it’s not clear if those costs are solely for the procedures, or if they are for both the procedures and the hospital stay. Some clarification there would have been valuable.

Those who got the therapy also had significantly more improvement in other measures of symptoms, according to the study that will appear today in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Some neurologists remain unconvinced about the benefits of the therapy. Nausieda said much of the benefit found in the study could be due to a placebo effect. Beyond that, doctors need to do a better job of optimizing drug therapy, he said, noting that there are thousands of potential combinations of drugs that can be used to control symptoms. In a sense it's a field of science that works backward: Stimulation is applied to the brain, some people get better, and doctors try to figure out why.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story reports that the procedure costs about $120,000. 
But we wish it had given the price of the many drugs and treatments used in conventional therapy for Parkinson’s disease. As a consequence, the reader is led to believe the cost comparision is $120,000 vs. $0. In fact it’s $120,000 vs. some other number, perhaps a higher one. Some comparison would have been useful.

PharmaJet says the ability to give precise doses helps to save money.

Scientists at Tufts University identified the foods that seem to contribute the most to the risk. But, here's the flip side: The researchers also found there's a significant risk in eating too little of certain healthy foods. Diet was linked to nearly 319,000 of these deaths. Now, the task of estimating death or disease linked to diet is tricky. The problem: Most Americans consume much more.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story addresses cost at both the individual and societal level, noting that poor diets are “linked to billions of dollars in healthcare spending. For instance, diabetes costs the U.S. $245 billion a year. In the U.S., a women with diabetes incurs, on average, about $283,000 in lifetime health care costs. (Many cost studies don’t separate Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.).” That’s helpful context..

The vaccine has been tested, but never under real-world conditions in regular doctors’ offices. Everyone in the study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, was at least 60 years old, and the researchers didn’t include anybody for whom the live vaccine is not recommended. But researchers cautioned that because they did not follow patients over the longer term, they didn’t know how effective the vaccine is years later. Despite the FDA’s approval, the vaccine has not caught on as much as some had hoped. “The human cost of shingles is enormous,” said Michael Oxman, who studies infectious diseases at the University of California, San Diego, and was involved in a previous study of the vaccine.

Its practitioners believe it will transform orthopedics. Based on my experience with it, I think they are right. Ferrell told me not to use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, such as ibuprofen, for a week after the injection because the goal is to encourage, not stifle, inflammation. Still, “it has significant cost savings” compared with surgery, Ferrell says. Those who seek this treatment must look for a clinician with considerable PRP experience — someone who does the procedure several times a day, not once or twice a month — and who has a good success rate, Ferrell says.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story attempted to discuss cost by citing the difference in price between shoulder surgery ($13,000) and the PRP treatment ($1,000, in this case for two injections). This is sufficient enough for a Satisfactory rating, but barely.
While this does give readers some idea of the possible cost difference in treatments, there is no assurance that the charges in the author’s case are typical for those for the general public. It is simply one single data point which is fairly useless to the public. And, since there is no evidence of benefit or how many shots one might require, cost could be all over the place.

The improvement at six months was still present almost a year after the study's start. Lisa Jarvis has more details on that at the Haystack blog. But a key takeaway is that the medicine gets at a root cause of cystic fibrosis in some people rather than just relieving their symptoms. But these results, even with plenty of caveats, suggest the drug is on the right track. The effectiveness of VX-770 looks "best case," he wrote.

The research group plans to treat four more patients with CLL before moving into a larger Phase II trial. The results provide “a tumor-attack roadmap for the treatment of other cancers,” including those of the lung and ovaries as well as myeloma and melanoma, researchers said. The treatment appears safe, but researchers said more study was needed. In addition, the long-term viability of the treatment is still unknown. Further study will show whether the latest results “reflect an authentic advance toward a clinically applicable and effective therapy or yet another promising lead that runs into a barrier that cannot be easily overcome,” Urba said in an NEJM editorial.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: While WebMD missed the cost component, Reuters smartly raised this issue and discussed how future research will be funded. “All of the funding for the University of Pennsylvania’s gene therapy work has come from the academic community, but the work is expensive. ‘We are looking for corporate partners as we head into Phase II trials,’ Kalos said.”

Among more than 200 stroke victims, TNKase (tenecteplase) was about twice as effective as alteplase in restoring blood flow to the brain, and it also resulted in less disability, the scientists found. For either drug to be most effective, it needs to be given as soon as possible after a stroke occurs. In this study, patients were given the drugs within 4.5 hours after the onset of a stroke, Campbell said. The researchers specifically looked to see which drug was better at restoring blood flow to clot-blocked blood vessels in the brain, and which drug resulted in patients having better outcomes. Bleeding into the brain, the most serious side effect of either drug, occurred in 1 percent of patients, regardless of which drug they received, Campbell said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story explained that tenecteplase costs about $5,800 in the U.S. compared with about $8,000 for alteplase.

Therefore, quitting leads to a quick drop in endorphin levels, he said. Using acupuncture methods to treat addictions such as smoking is not new, White said, but there is still no clear evidence that treatment with needles has any therapeutic effects either. But the government organization had only dealt with drugs - not new technology - for smoking cessation, which has slowed down the process, Camera said. Usually three convincing studies involving large groups of human patients are needed before the FDA decides to approve a treatment. Still, Laser Therapeutics’ Camera said, the treatment won’t work on everybody.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story explains that the company profiled "charges $350 for a one-time treatment that takes less than an hour, and offers free extra treatments to patients who are still struggling with quitting in the following 6 months. Other companies do a few shorter therapy sessions as part of their regular treatment plan."

The study results appear as an "article in press" on the website of the Journal of the American College of Surgeons ahead of print. "This approach allows us to intervene at an earlier time rather than waiting for patients to come back in after the problem has already developed past the point of being able to manage it on an outpatient basis." Patients were enthusiastic about the app's ease of use and the reassurance they felt having their wounds regularly monitored. This protocol also has a cost-savings component, in addition to the patient safety and satisfaction aspects. Citation: Feasibility of an Image-Based Mobile Health Protocol for Postoperative Wound Monitoring.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The news release addresses the overall cost of post-surgical infections and the potential for cost savings using the monitoring app. The lead author of the study is quoted saying that preventing readmissions due to infection could lead to “significant savings to the health system,” and the release notes that “capturing specific numbers related to cost-savings was not part of this study.”
The news release helpfully states that providers have to pay for training and in some cases smartphones for patients, and pay staff to monitor the data in a “dedicated transitional care program.”
The the app itself is free for patients to download, which isn’t explicitly mentioned. There’s no mention of whether hospitals have to pay to use it.

The disinfecting success of initial experiments still need to be confirmed, said lead research David Brenner. However, Brenner and his colleagues wondered if a much narrower spectrum of ultraviolet light, far-UVC, might be a safer option. Two flu experts were encouraged by the findings. "Immunization and antiviral medications are also important, but again, have limitations. It appears that low-dose far-UV light is safe and effective, and has the advantage of inactivating a wide range of disease-causing viruses."
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: It’s mentioned “lamps with this type of UV light currently cost less than $1,000 … but (according to the study author) that price would likely fall if the lamps were mass-produced.” The article gets credit for addressing this issue, but the tone seemed a bit speculative.

That’s a major achievement in a group whose cancer is emboldened by every treatment failure. Now she was in a much more dangerous category: children whose leukemia no longer responds to chemo. But her parents had hope that the transplant would keep her cancer at bay. As it happened, Fry, head of the blood-cancer section in NCI’s pediatric oncology branch, had already launched the world’s first trial using CAR T-cell therapy to focus on CD22. It seemed an equally promising target that could broaden the therapy’s impact, researchers thought.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The CAR T-cell therapy is currently available only in clinical trials, where costs presumably aren’t an issue (a point the story might have made for readers who aren’t familiar with clinical trials).
That leaves the question of how much this therapy may cost if it becomes more widely available. And this is where the story offers some valuable insight: “It is also far from clear that such a personalized approach — possibly costing hundreds of thousands of dollars — is economically viable on a large scale.” In other words, to quote the story again: “big questions surround the therapy.”

Current guidelines have vastly increased the number of people who are eligible to take statins. So, the investigators asked, could a scan identify those whose actual risk is lower than what was calculated? According to today’s guidelines, half had risk scores high enough that a statin would be recommended or should be considered. But guidelines then were more conservative, and in accordance with them, the subjects did not take the drugs. It turned out that the actual incidence of heart attacks or disabling chest pain in those with zero calcium was half or less than what the risk calculator predicted.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story reports that a CT scan looking for calcium in coronary arteries “typically costs between $75 and $100. Still, it is generally not covered by insurance and so is not often used to assess risk.” That’s enough information to clear our bar handily, although we’d note that such scans can also turn up lung nodules that require additional follow-up and related costs.

Currently, an EKG and echocardiogram would cost parents a minimum of $2,500, Anderson says. If an ongoing program of testing happens, the hospital would try to tap into third-party funding, donations and grants, Towbin says.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?

Amgen said the drug will be available within the next two weeks and cost $825 per 60 milligram injection based on wholesale acquisition cost. “I believe it will have gradual uptake in the commercial setting given that this is a silent disease and existing therapies are pretty good,” Schmidt said. He estimates U.S. annual peak sales of $750 million to $1 billion in osteoporosis. Amgen last month applied for U.S. approval to market the drug for reduction of fractures and other skeletal-related problems in patients with advanced cancer. The approval comes with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) that includes a medication guide for patients and information for healthcare providers that explains the risks and benefits of the drug, the FDA said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: According to the story, each injection is estimated to cost $825 and people will require two injections per year. There is no mention of whether insurance companies will cover the cost, particularly since cheaper drugs for osteoporosis are available.

The researchers say such testing is needed because there are at least 600 stem cell clinics in the U.S. offering one form of stem cell therapy or another to an estimated 100,000-plus patients, who pay thousands of dollars, out of pocket, for the treatment, which has not undergone demanding clinical study. “That could be, but both this idea and the notion that a placebo effect could be involved would be surprising, given that some patients are still doing very well years after their study treatment ended,” says Dr. Shapiro. He adds that these findings are important because while use of a patient’s own stem cells for regenerative therapy is extraordinarily popular, the treatments may be untested and are often poorly regulated. None of these techniques have been studied because clinics maintain that use of a patient’s own cells is not a drug. Funding for this study was from Mayo Clinic’s Center for Regenerative Medicine.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that patients may pay “thousands” out of pocket. It could have offered some information on the cost of alternative therapies, which would have put the cost burden in context.

Results are currently published in the medical journal Chest. The research team was led by James Tsung, MD, MPH, Associate Professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine and Department of Pediatrics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and former clinical fellow Brittany Pardue Jones, MD, who's currently Assistant Professor in the Department of Pediatrics at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Further research is needed to investigate the impact of lung ultrasound on antibiotic use and stewardship. Physicians are affiliated with the renowned Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, which is ranked among the highest in the nation in National Institutes of Health funding per investigator. Mount Sinai's Kravis Children's Hospital also is ranked in seven out of ten pediatric specialties by U.S. News & World Report.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: This release earns praise for clearly mentioning the cost savings derived from the use of chest ultrasounds versus chest X-rays in treating patients in the study — $9,700 from 191 patients. The release could have been even even more helpful by adding information showing chest ultrasounds cost about two-and-a-half times less than chest X-rays ($140 versus $370 respectively). The release also might have mentioned that there’s a large initial outlay for ultrasound machines that may make them too expensive in the developing world. Another upfront cost not mentioned is the expense of training emergency medicine physicians (and presumably also internal medicine, pediatric and family medicine physicians) to do this procedure.

While rTMS has ardent supporters, its effectiveness is still debated, and there is little evidence showing how long the results last. Experts differ over whether it’s smart to cover new techniques if they haven’t proved superior to established methods. One key measure — known as the “number needed to treat” — found that one patient became symptom-free for every 12 who were treated. There’s a huge range in my clinical experience.” Carpenter, a physician, says research has not found any safety issues for patients returning for additional treatments, but cost is a factor. That 19-member panel voted 10 to 5 last year that studies of the treatment showed it to be as good as or better than usual care for depression.

The results appeared in the February online edition of the New England Journal of Medicine. At the start of the trial, 660 adults with DME were enrolled: their average age was 61 years and 90 percent had type 2 diabetes. One year after starting treatment, all participants had improved vision. “The results clearly remove any doubts about anti-VEGF drugs’ efficacy in treating DME. Physicians now have robust data to help them counsel patients and make informed decisions regarding treatment options,” says study co-author Lloyd P. Aiello, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School, Director of Joslin’s Beetham Eye Institute, co-head of Joslin's Section of Vascular Cell Biology, and founding chair of the DRCR Network.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The costs of the three anti-VEGF drugs evaluated in the study were listed as about $1960 for aflibercept (Eylea), $1200 for ranibizumab (Lucentis) and $70 for bevacizumab (Avastin), per injection. This is satisfactory, although since a treatment course involves multiple injections, we’d like to have seen the total cost of treatment compared without having to do the math ourselves.

New research calls into question what’s in those IV bags that nearly every hospitalized patient gets. Some doctors are hoping the results will persuade more hospitals to switch. IVs are one of the most common things in health care. They’re widely used in Europe and Australia. The fluids cost about the same — a dollar or two per IV — and many suppliers make both types, so switching should not be hard or expensive, doctors said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: In comparing the costs of normal saline vs. balanced fluids, the article states “the fluids cost about the same — a dollar or two per IV — and many suppliers make both types, so switching should not be hard or expensive.”
This is sufficient for a satisfactory rating, but readers should be aware that even a difference of a few pennies per bag would have a significant impact at the institutional level, and a massive impact on the national level.

“I think one can give it a try,” said Dr. Meenu Singh, a pediatrician at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in Chandigarh, India, who led the new work. “But giving zinc over a long period of time for prevention should be done very carefully,” she told Reuters Health. The bottom line: After seven days of treatment, those taking the supplements had less than half the chance of still being sick. Exactly how well zinc works is a matter of future research, and the one day estimate may well change, the researchers note. They add it is currently unclear what dose and particular formulation of the supplement will be most helpful.

Still, the findings could help smooth the way for regulatory approval, wider use of the drugs by doctors and possibly reimbursement by insurers. In the studies detailed on Sunday, both drugs reduced the bad cholesterol by about 60 percent, to about 50 milligrams per deciliter from about 120 at the start of the studies. Analysts say the drugs will have billions of dollars in annual sales and will be taken by millions of people who cannot lower their cholesterol enough using statins alone or cannot tolerate statins. But merely looking at cholesterol levels can be misleading. By a measure known as the hazard ratio, the risk of cardiovascular events was reduced by 53 percent.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: It’s difficult to estimate costs for drugs that haven’t yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, so we feel this article did an exceptional job discussing the projected costs of PCSK9 inhibitors. The piece quoted executives at CVS Health who said these drugs may cost $7,000 to $12,000 a year, which may strain health care budgets if many people use them. Furthermore, insurers may be hesitant to pay for PCSK9 inhibitors until there is proof that they prevent heart attacks, strokes and death, it said.
Despite the potential high costs, analysts estimated the drugs will have billions of dollars in annual sales, the article added.

Researchers say they have taken a big step towards developing a test that can tell people if they have cancer long before the first symptoms show up. The blood test detected the majority of cancers in people with four of the biggest cancer killers: breast, colon, lung and ovarian cancer, the team at Johns Hopkins University said. The test is a long way from being used to screen for cancer, but the study shows a way to get there, the team reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine. It was even more accurate in finding late-stage cancers, but the goal would be to catch cancer in its earliest, easiest-to-treat stage. And then it will have to be shown that using the test allows doctors to intervene sooner and help people.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: This story gets a satisfactory in this category by including, “The genetic sequencing is also expensive right now – on the order of several thousand dollars for the 30,000 repeats the team did. But costs are coming down steadily, he said.”

Carmat estimates its device will cost $176,000 to $226,000. The device was developed over 15 years by a team that included Alain F. Carpentier, the French surgeon-scientist who, along with Albert Starr, received the 2007 Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research. SynCardia, based in Tucson, currently makes the only approved temporary artificial heart, having continued development of the groundbreaking Jarvik-7, which Dr. William C. DeVries implanted in a retired dentist named Barney B. Clark in 1982. Another device is being developed by scientists at the Helmholtz-Institute for Biomedical Engineering at the University of Aachen in Germany. Citing World Health Organization data that shows heart disease is the world’s leading cause of death, Mr. Conviti, the Carmat chief executive, estimated the potential market at “a minimum” of 100,000 patients a year in the United States and Europe.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story explains that the company "estimates its device will cost $176,000 to $226,000. When all expenses are considered, including hospital and surgical expenses, it says it will cost just over $315,000, about the same as a transplant."

It also changed the measurement of success and lengthened the trial to give the drug more time to work. “We knew the drug was safe and biologically active,” H. Thomas Watkins, chief executive of the company, said in an interview. More patients on the drug had the required improvement in symptom severity. “And we are in a field where we haven’t even had anything fair.”

Benlysta, which is given by infusion once every four weeks, inhibits the action of a protein in the body called B-lymphocyte stimulator, which helps B cells in the blood respond to infections. The company said high levels of the protein might spur the immune system to attach the body’s own tissues.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The article comments that Benlysta will be far more expensive than current treatments but doesn’t give an order of magnitude. Nonetheless, we’ll give it the benefit of the doubt.

The last study is a warning to people who get screening tests that aren't recommended, or who question whether screening can ever hurt. The new study was the first big one to examine a newer screening tool, HPV tests, with or without Pap smears in routine practice. The new study gives "very, very solid support" for screening less often, Lichter said. HPV tests were twice as good as Paps for predicting risk. Adding a Pap after a negative HPV test did little to improve risk prediction.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story does not list the costs of all the screenings mentioned, but we give it a passing grade for at least addressing the issue of costs-versus-benefits. The story says, “HPV tests cost $80 to $100 compared to $20 to $40 for Paps.”

But Latisse does not appear to be a silver bullet for hair loss. The result is an enhanced, refortified hairline rather than a brand new head of hair. “We keep on moving back that time, but I think there’s absolutely no doubt that it’s going to be done.”

He believes hair cloning will be commercially available within 10 years. (Even Mr. Paduda has now switched to Propecia, citing cost.) But the fact is that many men — and women — simply do not accept baldness easily.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story provided a more thorough discussion of costs than we have seen in many stories about cosmetic products. It says, “It is, however, expensive: a month’s supply of Latisse can cost up to $150, and that is in amounts appropriate for use merely on the eyelashes. Rogaine, which is also available over the counter now, costs about $25 a month, and a month’s supply of Propecia runs about $75.”

The researchers also found a similar type of blood test could determine gestational age, which is used to calculate the due date of the baby. The scientists analyzed 20,000 genes to find the ones that were active during pregnancy and labor. The test, if it does turn out to work in clinical trials, would be cheaper than ultrasound, said Quake. There's a lot more work to be done before these tests becomes available, including clinical trials. But the findings are promising, particularly because premature delivery is such a serious problem.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Experimental health tests don’t have public price tags. However, this story gives readers a rare and helpful ballpark estimate, and one that compares it to an alternative (ultrasound): “It might be tens or hundreds of dollars, rather than thousands,” a study author told BuzzFeed.

CHICAGO (AP) — It was launched decades ago as an anesthetic for animals and people, became a potent battlefield pain reliever in Vietnam and morphed into the trippy club drug Special K.

Now the chameleon drug ketamine is finding new life as an unapproved treatment for depression and suicidal behavior. Ketamine’s potential for almost immediate if temporary relief is what makes it so exciting, said Dr. Jennifer Vande Voort, a Mayo Clinic psychiatrist who has used ketamine to treat depression patients since February. “It truly has revolutionized the field,” changing scientists’ views on how depression affects the brain and showing that rapid relief is possible, said Yale University psychiatrist Dr. Gerard Sanacora, who has done research for or consulted with companies seeking to develop ketamine-based drugs. There are about 150 U.S. ketamine clinics, compared with about 20 three years ago, said society co-founder Dr. Megan Oxley. Until there are answers, Zarate of the mental health institute said ketamine should be a last-resort treatment for depression after other methods have failed.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story said one woman paid $3,000 “so far” for her treatments and “scrambles to find a way to pay for another one” as the effects wear off.
It also reported that a “typical” treatment at one clinic “involves six 45-minute sessions over about two weeks, costing $550 each. Some insurers will pay about half of that….”

Now health officials are warning doctors that preventing the disease will take more than just writing a prescription. It's the first time anybody's shown that taking a pill can prevent HIV – and it was the first new weapon against HIV unveiled in many years. That'll help avoid creating viruses resistant to the drug when patients miss doses. For the same reason, patients should get an HIV test periodically while on the drug. • Above all, tell patients they must take the drug every day – not just when they've had risky sex.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Strong point.  The story said, “There’s one other thing, the CDC says. Make sure patients understand that warding off HIV isn’t cheap. Each pill currently costs around $36, which adds up to more than $13,000 a year. Some insurers might pay, but some might balk”

In the study, published on Jan. 10 in Circulation, the researchers say these calcium scores allow physicians to go beyond the traditionally calculated risk factors to determine which blood pressure treatment strategy may be most appropriate for a particular patient. To determine if coronary artery calcium scores could inform blood pressure recommendations too, the researchers used data from 3,733 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) who had systolic blood pressures between 120 and 179 millimeters of mercury. Thus, even though their calculated heart disease risk is relatively low and their blood pressure is below traditional cutoffs for treatment, the researchers say people in this category with calcium over 100 are high risk and may benefit from more aggressive blood pressure treatment. Participants with high systolic blood pressure between 160 and 179 millimeters of mercury had high event rates ranging from 20 to 40 heart disease events per 1,000 person-years regardless of their calcium scores. The researchers caution that results are from an observational study, and a randomized trial would be needed to confirm the recommendations.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The news release says that coronary artery calcium scans “aren’t usually covered by insurance and can range in cost from $100 to $400.”

“What we found is that there is pretty good correlation,” said the study’s lead author Dr. Perry Pickhardt, professor of radiology at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison. That may spare the patients from additional testing and additional costs. Despite DXA scans being safe and cost effective, Pickhardt and his colleagues say the test is underused. Dr. Sumit Majumdar, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study, said a lower threshold for bone density would catch most cases of osteoporosis and limit “incidentaloporosis” - incorrect osteoporosis diagnoses “discovered” while doctors were looking for something else. Pickhardt said the screenings would have to target the right groups of people to prevent overdiagnosis.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story explained the cost of DXA tests and CT scans.

The results of the clinical trials, presented this week at a meeting in Hawaii, shocked and surprised stroke physicians. The three studies reported this week (which will eventually be published in the New England Journal of Medicine) tested the hypothesis in a rigorous way. Removing the clot wasn’t better than standard care in either group — those with a lot or a little brain tissue to lose. Why endovascular treatment wasn’t better is a mystery that the researchers are struggling to explain. The answer could be in the patients, the device or the timing of the procedure.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Nice job on this.  The story reported:
“Insurance companies and Medicare, the health insurer for the elderly, already cover the endovascular procedure. It costs about $23,000 compared with $11,000 for acute stroke treatment using intravenous clot-dissolving drugs, known as thrombolytics.”
(and)
“Will it change practice? That’s a good question,” said Koroshetz. “The payers may look at this and wonder if they should continue paying for these procedures. If it gets to that point, then clearly things will change.”

The study “has wide-reaching implications,” said Dr. Louise Wilkins-Haug, director for maternal-fetal medicine and reproductive genetics at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, who was not involved in the research. “Individuals need to be careful” to ensure that companies use rigorous laboratory procedures and support accuracy claims with data, she added. Most tests that were highly accurate were conducted on a mother’s blood, not urine. “It’s very important to educate health care providers that pregnant women are buying these tests.”

Another type of test not studied by the researchers has become popular because it is cheaper and can be done at home. Rebecca Griffin, a founder of the biggest seller, Intelligender, said two independent studies found it 90 percent accurate at 10 weeks.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story quotes one price estimate of about $250 for the testing. We would have liked more detail about whether new details on accuracy of the tests might change their status in the marketplace, or whether insurability status might change.

The test represents a first in the rapidly developing field of “liquid biopsies,” which use gene sequencing technology to screen blood samples for trace amounts of DNA associated with different cancers. But the move by Pathway, a privately owned maker of genetic tests ranging from cancer risk and heart health to drug response, underscores a growing debate over how much genetic information should be made available to healthy people if it is not yet clear how it can improve their health. Several oncology experts said liquid biopsy tests like Pathway’s, while exciting, still require large clinical studies proving they help people beat cancer through early detection. The tests must be ordered by a doctor, based on a patient’s risk profile. A positive test will require additional checks to find where the cancer is growing.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentioned the cost of the test, but the competing Bloomberg story gave a more detailed breakdown of costs. There was no mention of insurance coverage, or of total costs of work ups of positive tests and the need for continual testing.

That's when she opted for bariatric surgery. Friedman kept the weight off for almost 10 years. She's not alone, says Dr. Rabindra Watson, Assistant Clinical Professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, Division of Digestive Diseases. So Friedman opted for a less invasive procedure to make her stomach smaller again. And research conducted over the past decade suggests it works.

A report on the researchers' work was published in the Sept. 2 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Further trials of the new test are planned, the researchers said. But Siegel said such testing, which has been in use for more than a century, isn't always accurate. "The test also indicates rapidly whether difficult-to-treat, drug-resistant forms are present," he said. The test was created by the California-based corporation Cepheid, which plans to seek U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for the test, which went on sale late last year in Europe.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: This story does more than pay lip service to cost, flagging it as the key to making this test available in the developing world. It notes the price tag of the diagnostic machine itself and says that the $63 cost per test may be discounted by more than half in developing world countries. It fails however to compare the cost of the new test with the existing TB test. Even more important, it fails to explain that a $20 or $30 expense, which might sound modest to U.S. readers, would actually represent a huge cost burden in many developing world countries, where annual per capita health care expenditures are sometimes less than $30. A close call, but since the story made a good-faith effort to address this issue, we’ll award a satisfactory with deficiencies noted.

And for now, the research is preliminary, so it's too early to know for sure if the treatment is appropriate to be used for any kind of depression. The cost of the surgery is about $50,000, she said. Previous research by Mayberg and others suggested that deep brain stimulation had potential as a treatment for depression. The workings of deep brain stimulation as a whole are a mystery, although Mayberg said it may work by changing the brain's rhythms. Dr. Samuel James Collier, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Austin, predicted that even if deep brain stimulation turns out to be an effective treatment for depression, it'll be far from the first line of defense.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: We would have liked to have seen a little more information on costs, but we are glad that costs are mentioned up high. In the third sentence, the story says, “The surgery necessary to allow deep brain stimulation is extremely expensive” Later it says, “The cost of the surgery is about $50,000”. It would have been interesting to note whether deep brain stimulation is covered by Medicare or any insurance companies for treatment of any disorders, including Parkinson’s.

At this point, specific symptoms can be targeted depending on the patient’s needs. The biggest drawback to TMS, according to advocates, is the limitations on just who can undergo the treatment. Even those who are approved to undergo the treatment face another barrier as TMS is not widely covered by health insurance. The most common, not surprisingly, are headaches. More studies will be needed to determine whether this method can be used as a widespread treatment for other brain-related disorders, but if today’s research is any indication, TMS could be a key to improving the lives of Americans suffering from a multitude of disorders.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Cost is mentioned in the photo caption. And, the reader will find a cautionary comment lower in the story warning that “TMS is not widely covered by health insurance,” although other TMS stories indicate that insurance companies are slowly coming to the table.

Lupron therapy grew from the mercury camp. Geier's promotional materials said he has treated hundreds of children with Lupron and has launched nine ASD Centers in eight states. Lupron critics said autism parents may not understand the dangers. The drug is not approved for children – except a rare few with premature puberty – because it can impair bone development crucial to growth, said Dr. Gary Berkovitz, chief of pediatric endocrinology at the University of Miami medical school. Other doctors said Geier's studies were small, were not scientifically sound and were published in journals that do not follow the standard practice of having experts review the methods.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story says that Lupron costs about $5,000 a month but is seldom covered by insurance. Good job to address both points.

Over the past decade, doctors in the United States and internationally have begun using it to treat mTBIs. The nature of the human brain makes it particularly susceptible to chronic injury. The organ requires large amounts of energy under normal circumstances, and even more to heal when injured. Hyperbaric therapy, he said, can return them to full function, even years after the injury. He began to examine how hyperbaric treatment affects the brain, and this work has become his focus.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions that “patients typically receive between 40 and 60 hour-long hyberbaric treatments spread over two to three months” and that a treatment “typically cost between $200 and $400 per session and is rarely covered by insurance.”

Exactly how this drug curbs drinking is not fully understood, but its use may increase blood pressure, heart rate and feelings of sadness and nausea, thereby blunting the pleasurable effects of alcohol, the researchers said. Chantix costs roughly $3 per pill. Whether the drug might someday be approved to help problem drinkers cut back remains to be seen, said the researchers, who acknowledged that the study's small size is a limitation. More research is needed, he noted, but "this medication may be helpful for people with a drinking problem who are also smokers." The study was funded by the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse and the U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.

TST specificity in this group was only 62 percent. In the second double-blinded trial, researchers were primarily concerned with testing how accurate C-Tb was in HIV-positive patients and in young children--populations in which the accuracy of the TST and the IGRA is known to be compromised. In contacts, mirroring the findings with QFT-GIT, there was a strong trend in increasing C-Tb test positivity with M. tuberculosis exposure (figure 1). These phase III trial results demonstrate that C-Tb is safe, has comparable diagnostic performance to QFT-GIT and addresses the problem of false positive TST results in BCG vaccinated persons. The field-friendliness and high specificity offered by the C-Tb test could allow for improved targeted treatment of M. tuberculosis-infected persons in also in resource-constrained settings, where IGRAs are too complicated to implement.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: This release provides a very good discussion of costs, stating, “There is also a dramatic price difference between the two diagnostic tests. According to Dr. Ruhwald, a TST costs about $2; an IGRA is 20 to 40 times more expensive depending on setting.” This gives readers a clear idea of the fiscal advantage of using the new test.

Novalar and some dentists who advise the company said it might be useful for children, who can injure themselves by biting their lip or tongue without knowing it. With about 300 million anesthesia injections given by dentists each year, company executives say the drug could easily achieve sales of hundreds of millions of dollars a year. “It is reversing the epinephrine.”

The label for the hypertension drug phentolamine contains warnings about heart attacks and occlusion of blood flow to the brain. In the clinical trials there were no serious side effects, Novalar said. Those patients would be expected to have lingering pain, and should not get Oraverse, Dr. Moore said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?

“It could reduce the number of invasive procedures that are being performed for specific genetic conditions,” said Dr. Diana Bianchi of Tufts University School of Medicine, who worked on the new study. “If parents are using it to determine gender and then terminate the pregnancy based on that, that could be a problem,” she told Reuters Health. That leaves some room for error, which could be important if parents are making medical decisions based on the results — such as whether or not to get an invasive procedure to look for genetic disorders. Bianchi said one study had estimated the blood test costs about 255 pounds in the UK (about $413), all included. While it’s available over the Internet, she said her team had only looked at hospital-based test performance.

The hope is to find more melanomas sooner. "The diagnosis of melanoma is the most serious one a dermatologist makes, and we have sleepless nights worrying about it," said Pariser, who consulted for the device's maker, Mela Sciences Inc. of Irvington, N.Y., on its presentation to FDA. For now, experts say MelaFind will help dermatologists make better decisions on which moles to remove. Another concern was that doctors could misinterpret the device's feedback, particularly error messages when a mole cannot be scanned. The agency also worried about its use by general doctors not accustomed to identifying suspicious skin moles.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story takes the rare step of talking about costs from three different angles. The cost to the physician. The cost to the patient. And the cost to insursers. “Doctors will pay a one-time fee of $7,500 to lease and receive training on the device. Patients will pay $150 out of pocket for a MelaFind scan, which analysts say may limit use to more affluent patients who are willing to pay extra for the latest medical care. Mela Sciences does not plan to ask insurers to cover the device until several years from now, after it is more widely used.

But conventional germicidal lamps aren’t safe for humans to be around. Now, Brenner and his colleagues have show that UVC light can effectively kill airborne influenza. “Think about doctor’s waiting rooms, schools, airports and airplanes—any place where there’s a likelihood for airborne viruses.” And unlike the flu vaccine, he says, far-UVC light is likely to be effective against all airborne microbes, including newly emerging virus strains. “We don’t see cost as being a limiting factor here.”

UVC lamps could also have potential implications in clinical settings, as well — in the operating room during surgeries, for example. “There has been no way of killing viruses in the air in public spaces, and this is an approach that may solve that problem.”
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The lead author of the study is quoted as saying “The lamp we’re using at the moment costs less than $1,000, and you can imagine that if it were put into general circulation, the price would drop dramatically … we don’t see cost as being a limited factor here.”
The first part of the quote gives a frame of reference, though “less than $1,000” is somewhat ambiguous. The second part also is speculative, so this is a barely passing satisfactory.

Those with asthma had a history of allergies, and none had been treated with corticosteroids for at least four weeks prior to the start of the study. To do this, all of the study volunteers were given all three tests. Each test is non-invasive, requiring only the use of exhaled air. The electronic nose was able to correctly differentiate healthy people from those with physician-diagnosed asthma in 87.5 percent of the cases. We also need to know if it's good for diagnosing all types of asthma."

TUESDAY, Oct. 11, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- A small, preliminary study finds that ginger root supplements seem to reduce inflammation in the intestines -- a potential sign that the pills might reduce the risk of colon cancer. However, more study needs to be done, and the researchers aren't yet recommending that people head to the supplements' aisle or start gobbling up more ginger at meal times. Previous research in animals has suggested that ginger can reduce inflammation but isn't potentially toxic to the stomach like aspirin, Zick noted. If more funding becomes available, the researchers hope to launch a larger study, Zick said. But for now, she said, "if you want to embrace ginger because you like the taste, go ahead," but there's no solid evidence that it prevents colon cancer.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story says that a month’s supply of ginger supplements typically runs about $10 – $30.

Larger studies in many more patients are needed before the drug will be available, though, she says. The benefit is small and studies have been inconsistent, says researcher Rachelle Doody, MD, head of Alzheimer’s disease research at Baylor College of Medicine. Called solanezumab, the drug attaches to a protein called beta-amyloid that builds up and clumps together to form sticky plaques that riddle Alzheimer's patients' brains. The latest results come from a combined analysis of a 1,012-patient study and a 646-patient study, both of which involved people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. The results really became clear when the researchers looked only at those patients with mild, early-stage disease.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Though it is too early to have a firm price, the story notes that similar drugs can cost hundreds of dollars per month. This price reference is more specific than the one in the AP story.

Turns out there’s a simple blood test that could tell her. The test doesn’t measure the quality of the eggs and it’s not a guarantee of fertility. For Alyssa Gold, the AMH test was a wakeup call. At her regular gynecology visit, Gold took the AMH test and received news she didn’t wanted to hear but it helped her take the next right step for her. She’s grateful to the Baby Deadline Test for giving her that option.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: We’re giving this a Satisfactory rating since the story did mention that the test “usually costs less than $100.”
The story would have been stronger if it had explained if insurance companies typically cover the test–especially if it’s being given to women without any history of infertility. There also may be associated costs with follow-up testing.

Her report is the latest warning from researchers who suspect that stents are being overused and may even be causing heart attacks and deaths. After a few days have passed, though, there is little or no chance of preventing heart damage. But many doctors open the artery anyway, thinking it may still have long-term benefits and prolong the patients’ lives. The median time since the heart attack was eight days. The ones who might benefit, they say, are a small minority — perhaps 10 to 15 percent — who cannot take the class of heart medicines known as beta blockers, which have been proved to increase survival after a heart attack.

and Medicare to devise a plan to restrict the device’s spread to places where doctors had sufficient skill to implant them safely. The result was a requirement that a hospital should be doing at least 50 surgical aortic valve replacements a year to have access to the technology. Former skeptics like Dr. Cohn now recommend the procedure for high-risk patients. More recent 2015 data from Medtronic indicates that its valve is better than surgery for high-risk patients, resulting in fewer deaths, at least in the first two years. And new data from another large study by Edwards found that patients at intermediate risk did better with the newest version of its valve than would be expected with surgery in the first 30 days, when most deaths occur.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: We’ll award a Satisfactory here with some reservations. Although the article addresses the cost of the procedure, and in particular of the valve, readers should have been told how the cost compares to conventional surgery, rather than just the bottom line risks for hospitals. Here’s how the story presents it: “It’s a hard proposition when $32,500 goes right out the door to Edwards,” the valve manufacturer, he said. The hospital gets about $40,000 from Medicare, which is fine if there are no complications. But older patients, in their late 80s and 90s, often end up with four-, five- or even seven-day hospital stays. “We could lose $25,000,” he said.”
According to the Healthcare Blue Book, a reasonable charge to the consumer for heart valve surgery is $50,000.

More than 50 percent of those who participated in the study experienced clinically meaningful improvements in their low back pain with disability, according to Munk. Previous studies of the effectiveness of massage were conducted in controlled research situations. In this study, patients were referred by a physician to a massage therapist. While the study results are promising, much more work needs to be done, Munk said: "The fact of the matter is that chronic lower back pain is very complex and often requires a maintenance-type approach versus a short-term intervention option." Additional investigation is needed to replicate the results of the initial study and to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of massage therapy, Munk said.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: We give the release credit for stating that massages are generally not covered by insurance and that patients typically pay out-of-pocket. And the release provided some important context about cost with this statement from the lead author: “Generally, people wonder if it is worth it. Will it pay to provide massage to people for an extended period of time? Will it help avoid back surgeries, for example, that may or may not have great outcomes? These are the types of analyses that we hope will result from this study.”
While massage is now offered in nearly all cities and towns, not all readers know how much they will need to shell out for the 10 sessions used in this study.
A one hour massage averages $60 an hour nationally, so 10 sessions would cost about $600. That’s something people considering this type of therapy would like to know.

And it's clear that experts are still scratching their heads about just how Provenge works. That's better than the only other approved treatment for such advanced cancers. The primary mystery is how Provenge extends life, since it doesn't shrink prostate tumors, as far as anyone can tell. Deep in the data is further mystery. But, after all, Provenge is just the first cancer immunotherapy on the market.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story itself only says "it’s pretty pricey."  But those words provide a hyperlink to another NPR story that discloses the drug cost as $93,000.  It would have taken the same amount of space to just state the cost in the current story.  Why make people click away to get the cost in another story?  Is the need to improve click rates driving this? Regardless, we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt on this.

“I think the take home message is that robotic (surgery), looking at our study, had certain beneficial outcomes compared to open and laparoscopic procedures,” said study leader Jim Hu at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. Hu and his team analyzed surgery data from a national government database to see if the costlier robotic surgeries were cost effective with extra benefits over older techniques. The open-surgery group also stayed in the hospital about one day longer than the robotic group. The trade-off was the cost, with robotic prostate removal costing about $10,000 on average, roughly $700 more than laparoscopic surgery and $1,100 more than open surgery. David Penson, a surgeon at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who was not part of the study, said more consideration should have been given to the state of patients afterwards.

They also conducted memory tests. The control arm of the study, those not involved in Experience Corps, exhibited age-related shrinkage in brain volumes. The researchers were particularly interested in the results, considering that people with less education and who live in poverty are at greater risk for cognitive decline. Carlson says it's not entirely clear which elements of Experience Corps account for the improved memory function and increased brain volumes. She says the program increases involvement in so many different kinds of activities that retired people may not have engaged in otherwise.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The program under study welcomes study participants as volunteers, so there is no “cost” to them.  It is not a drug or device, but we still might encourage the next release to quantify the costs a bit better. Bare minimum Satisfactory for this mention: “Experience Corps is a national program, however it can be costly and isn’t available everywhere.”

Every room in your house could be susceptive to some form of an air pollutant, but now there is a new device and app that says it can help you breathe easier by tracking air quality. The device collects data such as indoor temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, fine dust particles and VOCs. It analyzes the data in real-time and gives an Awair score on a 0 to 100 color-coded scale, 0 being the worst air quality. The app also provides Mayo Clinic “message cards” that give relevant information and recommendations for ways to keep your indoor environment healthy. The Awair app is free to download, but each device costs $199 dollars.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story states that the Awair app is free, but that each air monitoring device costs $199 dollars. Presumably, one would need multiple devices to monitor air quality throughout a residence.

June 2, 2010 (San Francisco) -- A quick spray of a new drug may help men who suffer from premature ejaculation last nearly six times longer, new research suggests. Nonetheless, doctors like Irwin Goldstein, MD, director of San Diego Sexual Medicine at Alvarado Hospital in San Diego, tell WebMD they're excited because this is the first time a drug is being rigorously tested for men with really serious premature ejaculation problems. A total of 358 of the men gave themselves three quick sprays of PSD502 to the head of the penis five minutes before sex and then wiped it off right before penetration. The rest of the men used a placebo spray. All used the product for three months, for a total of 23,000 doses.

Dr. Neil M. Bressler of Johns Hopkins University, the chairman of the group that conducted the trial, said a two-line improvement in vision would allow some people to read normal-size print or to drive again. With this successful Phase 3 trial, insurers will now be more likely to pay for such off-label use. He said treatment with Lucentis in the clinical trial virtually eliminated those incidents. The trial involved 691 patients, some of whom had both eyes treated, resulting in 854 total eyes. Results of the trial were published online on Tuesday by the journal Ophthalmology.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION:  Kudos!  This story reported on the costs of the drug Lucentis as well as the less expensive Avastin.

Lomaira should be used together with regular exercise and a reduced-calorie diet. The limited usefulness of agents of this drug class (anorectics), including Lomaira, should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use. Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. These are not all of the potential side effects of phentermine. These are not all of the potential side effects of phentermine.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: This release makes the specific point that this newly approved dosage of the drug Lomaira (phentermine hydrochloride USP) will cost eligible patients “no more than 50¢ per tablet for the duration of treatment” if they qualify for the manufacturer’s assistance program. It makes the point that many insurance plans will not cover the cost of weight management drugs and that the low cost of this formulation should aid those who are prescribed it. The low-cost aspect of the drug is mentioned in both the headline and in the first paragraph of the release. The release would have been stronger had it mentioned the basic cost of the drug, regardless of any manufacturer’s qualifying discount.

And if patients are given a choice of catheterization sites, what factors should they consider? She and others say they know of no other physician in the Washington area who favors the radial approach. "There's no data out there to suggest it is worse and growing evidence that it may be better," said Shah, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, who performs 60 to 70 percent of procedures through the wrist. Some senior interventional cardiologists say they worry that the method may be hyped. Raybuck, who learned to perform the procedure in Quebec 12 years ago, estimates he uses it fewer than two dozen times annually, and only when circumstances require it.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions that using the wrist may better enable patients to avoid an "expensive overnight hospital stay" and that Medicare reimbursement was the same even though this route for catheterization may involve more physician time. But the story didn’t include any specific cost information about this new approach.  Shouldn’t the physicians interviewed know whether their charge to patients depends on the vessel used? Nonetheless, we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt on this criterion.

Yet, despite decades of research, there isn't a drug on the market today that prevents them by targeting the underlying cause. So, four pharmaceutical companies rejiggered their approach. At that price, Mauskop and other neurologists expect insurance companies to require patients to have tried just about everything else first. The other hitch at this stage is a lack of long-term safety data. Right now, the longest patients have been on one of these new therapies is one to two years.

"Increasing screening rates among under-screened women is of paramount importance." Earlier this year, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force gave an "A" rating to HPV primary screening alone for women aged 30 to 65. Offering HPV testing using self-collection by mail has a lot of potential to reach women who are the highest risk of being screened: those who don't access regular medical care." Researchers provided study participants with self-collection brushes along with instructions for how to take a sample from inside the vagina. The brush samples were then tested in a lab for HPV and other sexually transmitted infections.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release does not place a pricetag on HPV screening — which would include the test kit, analysis and follow-up clinical visit. However, the release does explicitly say that “there is more work to be done, such as identifying ways to make the self-collection process more efficient and cost-effective.” That acknowledgment is enough to earn it a satisfactory rating here.

Soon, it seems, women like Dunham with endometriosis pain will have a new option for relief. The reason is simple: Women with the condition are growing excess tissue in their abdomen that they can’t shed. So it’s no surprise it takes between three and 11 years after the onset of symptoms to diagnose endometriosis. In the trials, women who took the drug had greater bone loss than did those who received placebo, and this wasn’t entirely surprising. The drug’s side effects also concerned her, as did the lack of knowledge about its long-term impact.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job of describing the monthly cost ($850) for women who do not have health insurance. The inference is that insurers will cover the cost for others.

Since they came on the market in 2000, they have been widely used by patients -- but usually only as a second-line therapy when older drugs had failed to work or when their side effects had become intolerable. Now a large new analysis involving 250,000 patients shows that these medications may be as effective and safe as their older cousins, the angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE inhibitors. That led many doctors and standards groups to conclude that ACE inhibitors were more effective than ARBs. But some doctors and researchers were puzzled by the fact that in head-to-head comparisons between the two classes of drugs they appeared to equally safe and effective. If there really was such a big difference between the medications, why didn't it show up in these types of studies?
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: While the story could have been a bit more specific, it gets points for stating that most ACE inhibitor drugs, and many ARB drugs, are now available in generic form, which means the cost for the medications would usually be considerably less than their comparative name-brand compounds. We’ll rate this Satisfactory, but we’d add that though more ARBs are generically available, this class of medications continues to be more expensive than ACEIs. For patients struggling to meet the cost of their medications, this is a major consideration, and important information for any news story.

The findings don’t prove that the drugs, called statins, ward off aggressive cancer. But they jibe with previous studies suggesting that getting cholesterol levels under control might help reduce the risk of life-threatening disease, researchers said. “If a person’s on the fence about taking a statin medication for their heart, this is another potential benefit they may have by taking one of these,” he told Reuters Health. The researchers also couldn’t tell whether men started using statins before or after they were diagnosed with aggressive cancer. But Freedland said that other strategies for lowering cholesterol — such as eating better and exercising regularly — are ways almost everyone can lower their disease risks in the meantime.

Such results are why the treatment is on track to become the first gene therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration. And childhood leukemia is just the start for a field that has attracted intense interest in academia and industry. And although checkpoint inhibitors are off the shelf, with every patient getting the same drug, CAR T-cell therapy is customized to an individual.

Grupp is especially pleased that the advance will be available first to children.

It was the early days of gene hunting, and the CF gene was a big prize. At the time, scientists predicted that a genetic test for CF was just around the corner. But they also thought a drug to treat the disease was in reach. But for people who do have that mutation, the drug works remarkably well. They're also likely to be expensive.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: It doesn’t come until the last sentence in the story, but it also leaves listeners and readers with a pretty sobering reality: “The time from gene discovery to successful drug may be shortening, but there are only a handful of successful drugs so far, and for a while at least, the appearance of new ones will be slow. They’re also likely to be expensive.

“On self-report, many of the folks in the active group reported they felt better,” Baker, who led the study, told Reuters Health. Baker said researchers have failed so far to come up with effective drugs to treat mild cognitive impairment, just as there is no known treatment to stave off the normal memory decline that comes with age. At the end, those who got the drug did better on psychological tests of executive function - whether or not they had mild cognitive impairment. But Baker said people who got the hormone were more likely to report improvements in their ability to focus during the day. “We recommend commonly that people start exercising when they are having mild cognitive impairment,” Baker said.

After five days of treatment with tablets made from only the dried and powered leaves of Artemisia (which has been prepared and analyzed using methods developed by Weathers and postdoctoral fellow Melissa Towler), all 18 patients fully recovered. In recent years, she has turned her attention to the use of DLA as an alternative to conventional antimalarial drugs. In effect, the dried leaves constitute a robust natural combination therapy, one whose benefits far surpass those of ACT and other combination drugs. Growing Artemisia annua and producing and testing the tablets, Weathers noted, are ideal local business that can provide jobs in impoverished areas and greatly expand access to antimalarial therapy. There are more than 40 WPI project centers throughout the Americas, Africa, Asia-Pacific, and Europe.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release mentions this would be an “inexpensive treatment option” and goes into some detail about the economics of the region where the drug was tested and the advantage of a low cost therapy.
“Another advantage of DLA over conventional malaria treatments is its low cost and the relative simplicity of its manufacture, Weathers said. While the processes for manufacturing ACT is costlier and requires a higher degree of expertise, producing DLA tablets can be accomplished with simpler equipment and a modest amount of training. Growing Artemisia annua and producing and testing the tablets, Weathers noted, are ideal local business that can provide jobs in impoverished areas and greatly expand access to antimalarial therapy.”
Normally we like to see specific costs but in this case, an attempt is made to discuss the challenges and opportunities of developing a low cost therapy which seems appropriate here.

However, with breast cancer remaining a major cause of cancer death in women, there is good reason to pursue the search for improved screening methods, according to the study's lead author, Christiane Kuhl, M.D., chair of the Department of Radiology at RWTH Aachen University in Aachen, Germany. Of the 60 cancers detected in the study group over the observation period (7,007 screening rounds), 59 were found only using MRI, one was found also by mammography, and none by mammography or ultrasound alone. The results also highlight the ability of MRI in the detection of more aggressive types of cancer. The new study showed that, consistent with previous research, breast MRI can depict these rapidly growing cancers with high reliability. According to Dr. Kuhl, interval cancers exhibit an adverse biologic profile and are the main driver of breast cancer mortality.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Although the news release does not specify the exact price tag, it makes the reader aware that MRI screening is often avoided due to higher cost than other screening options:
“MRI screening has not been considered necessary for women at average risk, and there has been resistance to expansion of MRI into this population due, in part, to concern over higher costs.”
It would have been helpful if the release had stated whether or not this rapid MRI will have a lower cost than traditional breast MRI.

No new safety problems cropped up in the 27,500 patient study called Fourier, Amgen said. But those who control budgets wanted concrete proof that the drug could actually reduce the risk of heart attacks and death before making it easier for patients to get the medicine. The company said Repatha would be well on its way to becoming a $1 billion seller if all prescriptions written had been filled. The primary and secondary goals of the study are composites of several adverse outcomes. The primary goal also included need for a new artery-clearing procedure and hospitalization for angina.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: To its credit, the story mentions the high cost of the drug Repatha — $14,000 per year — and cites reluctance on the part of some insurers to cover that cost without more substantive data on its efficacy.  The news release issued by the drug’s manufacturer, Amgen, didn’t include either point.

In experiments, the technique – which is based on the way non-visual parts of the brain respond to light – was much more effective than sustained bright light similar to that from devices sometimes used to combat sleep disorders or seasonal depression. “Jet lag itself is really a nuisance syndrome as it is self-resolving,” said senior author Jamie Zeitzer, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Stanford University School of Medicine in California. “However, the treatments that are developed for jet lag can be used for less prevalent, though far more significant societal problems including delayed sleep in teens (in whom we have an ongoing clinical trial using the flash technique) and shift workers who try to flip between a night time schedule for work and a day time schedule for leisure,” he told Reuters Health by email. “For moving your system to an earlier time, such as would be necessary when traveling West-to-East, light during the last few hours of the night is ideal.”

The night flashes require special technology and equipment, beyond just a smartphone, which are still in development, Zeitzer said. In a previous study, the short flashes of light at night did not interrupt sleep or reduce its quality, he added.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: While no costs were discussed, the suggestion that the device might be expensive was made: “The night flashes require special technology and equipment, beyond just a smartphone, which are still in development, Zeitzer said.” We’ll consider this nod in the direction of cost sufficient for a Satisfactory rating, since it would be difficult to say exactly how much such a device would cost at this stage.

DUARTE, Calif. -- A City of Hope-led study found that the use of low-dose aspirin (81mg) reduces the risk of breast cancer in women who are part of the California's Teacher's Study. We also did not find associations with regular aspirin since this type of medication is taken sporadically for headaches or other pain, and not daily for prevention of cardiovascular disease." "We thought that if aspirin can inhibit aromatase, it ought to reduce the likelihood that breast cancer would develop and it could also be an effective way to improve breast cancer patients' prognosis once they no longer take the more potent aromatase inhibitors." The team of researchers chose to focus on low-dose "baby" aspirin, because not only is it inexpensive and readily available as potential means of prevention, but because there are already a lot of people already taking it for prevention of other diseases such as heart disease and even colon cancer. Research reported in Breast Cancer Research was supported through grants from the National Cancer Institute and the California Breast Cancer Research Fund under grant numbers: R01 CA77398 and 97-10500.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release notes, near the bottom, that low-dose aspirin is inexpensive. That’s enough to earn it a satisfactory rating here since low-dose aspirin is indeed inexpensive. Costs for a bottle of 300 tablets currently range from $3.47 to $12.49 according to an online search.

A new cold and flu test can precisely diagnose a dozen winter ailments and reduce unneeded use of antibiotics, says the company that sells it. Physicians say the test is accurate and the most comprehensive available, but some say its long processing time limits usefulness in emergency rooms.

No sublingual immunotherapy products have yet been approved in the United States, however. Dr. Harold Nelson, an allergist at National Jewish Health in Denver, said that the body of evidence indicates that sublingual immunotherapy beats antihistamines and other medications used to control hay fever symptoms. In an interview, he noted that antihistamines reduce symptoms by about 12 percent to 15 percent, on average. In addition, the long-term effectiveness of the grass-pollen tablets is not yet fully clear. Like allergy shots, the oral immunotherapy takes time.

And putting the chemotherapy on top of tumors should be more effective than systematically delivering it through the bloodstream. One randomized trial done more than a decade ago involving 105 patients in the did show a striking benefit. “It’s maximally invasive,” said Dr. Sugarbaker, who often removes the “spare parts” — organs a patient can live without, like the spleen, the gall bladder, the ovaries and the uterus. The incision was sewn up around the tubes so the chemotherapy would not leak. Mr. S. left the hospital eight days later, happy to have undergone the treatment.

More people in the bypass group had complications right after the surgery. More of those undergoing lap-banding, however, needed repeat surgeries (13 percent vs. 2 percent). There are various theories to explain why gastric bypass may be superior, including one that attributes the success to changes in hormones that control the metabolism of blood sugar. And certain procedures may still be preferable for certain patient populations, added Roslin, such as bands for patients with lower BMI who don't have so many metabolic challenges. An editorial accompanying the studies noted the results should be interpreted with caution since longer-term data is not yet available.

The hope is that the implanted cells will replace those injured by the disease. It is likely to be several years before such a treatment can reach the market, if it works. Still, even starting the trial could be a boost to Advanced Cell, which often makes headlines but has struggled to raise money. Dr. Peter J. Francis, an associate professor at the Oregon Health and Science University, which will be a site for the trial, says the eye is a good place to test stem cell therapy because it is accessible. Also, he said, there is less chance of rejection of the implanted cells because the eye is shielded somewhat from the body’s immune system.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story does mention the cost per dose of two competing drugs, Lucentis and Avastin (which are actually two different formulations of the same drug that are made by the same company, Genentech). Lucentis is the version of the drug meant for the eye, whereas Avastin is approved and sold as a cancer treatment. However, doctors can use Avastin off-label in the eye with much smaller doses than cancer patients need. The result is that the cost per dose is vastly lower for Avastin than it is for Lucentis. A head-to-head trial of Avastin and Lucentis is now underway that will probably have important implications for pricing and prescribing of these drugs. (If Avastin works just as well as Lucentis, more doctors will presumably switch to it at much lower cost to patients.) Moreover, allegations have surfaced recently that Genentech is providing questionable financial inducements for doctors to use the more costly Lucentis instead of Avastin. Given the significance of these developments for anyone who needs or may need treatment for AMD, we feel the story could have and probably should have gone into a bit more detail about why these two drugs have such wildly different costs.
We also think that if the story is interviewing a company about its plans to seek marketing approval in just a few months, they certainly could get some kind of pricing estimate from them. Nevertheless, by at least mentioning costs, the story accomplishes more than most other health articles that we review and does enough to satisfy the minimum for this criterion. We’ll award a satisfactory.

"In my opinion, everybody should be taking either a vitamin D supplement, take a prescription that the doctor recommends," Holick says. The evidence is strongest for colorectal cancer, she says. The fact that the government is funding the study is an indicator that the idea has traction. An Institute of Medicine panel is working on a vitamin D update, which may come out this summer. But the group is not expected to embrace the newer claims being made for vitamin D supplementation.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The cost of testing for vitamin D levels was provided.  No information about the costs of vitamin D supplements, but we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt on this one.

Though scientists spent years looking for genes, they found none that were reproducibly associated with a marked effect. The next step was to ask whether those variants really could predict who had prostate cancer. But some said that if the test leads to more screening, it is not necessarily a good thing. “We are just feeding off of this cancer phobia.”

What is needed, and what the new test does not provide, is a way to decide which cancers are dangerous and which are not, Dr. Isaacs said. Still, he said the new test could help patients if it was used with caution.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story included a cost for the test.

The test has the potential to help curb overtreatment in cancer care. Conversely, the test also suggested some tumors were more aggressive than doctors had believed. Only 10 percent who are candidates for monitoring choose it now. The newest test was developed by Genomic Health Inc., which has sold a similar one for breast cancer since 2004. The gene test shifted about half of the men into either a lower or a higher risk category.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The cost of the new test – and of one that recently came on the market – were listed (> $3,000 each). And the story explained it’s not known if insurers will pay for the tests.

Experts have known for some time that light therapy can improve the mood of people who feel especially down when the days get shorter and gloomier. But now a study has found that light therapy also works in treating non-seasonal depression. The research, published Wednesday in JAMA Psychiatry, is significant because major depression is one of the most common mental health disorders in the United States and one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. The researchers said enough clinical evidence now supports mental health professionals recommending light therapy as a treatment for depression. Although the light therapy helped many patients, it provided the most benefit to those who were also taking the antidepressant.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story squeaks by on this with mention that light therapy is “cheap” and easy to use. We would have preferred some numbers giving prices for the light sources that patients typically use at home and some estimate for a therapeutic course of psychotherapy (which is often provided in combination with light therapy).

In cases where a diagnosis isn't necessarily clear-cut, the DaTscan offers important advances in patient care and treatment, said Dr. Michael Rezak, director of the Movement Disorders Center at Central DuPage Hospital, where the scan is offered. "DaTscan is used in difficult-to-diagnose cases and must be used in conjunction with a clinical evaluation and a patient's response to medications," Rezak said. Before the test, Ramas, of West Chicago, experienced two years of uncertainty about his health as several specialists tried to pinpoint the cause of his joint and tendon pain, fatigue, stiffness in his legs and lack of bladder control. He visited the emergency room at Central DuPage, where he was sent to Rezak, who told him about DaTscan. Since June, 25 men and women of all ages have been tested with DaTscan at Central DuPage, Rezak said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: 


Yes, the story reports that a DaTscan costs about $1500. Oddly, instead of reporting what the hospitals featured in the story charge for a scan, the story attributes the price estimate to a quote taken from an article by Medscape Medical News. But there is a much higher price listed on the web site of the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research, which estimates a DaTscan costs almost $3000. Still, because the story does address cost we will give it credit on this criterion.

Women are typically tested some time in their teens for anemia -- the severe form of iron deficiency -- using a quick and affordable hemoglobin test. The Bright Futures questions alone did not predict iron deficiency or anemia. Yet, the researchers' risk assessment questionnaire was equally poor. "I think we need to establish the optimal timing for an objective assessment of adolescent iron deficiency and anemia." Murray-Kolb and Paul also worked on the study in The Journal of Pediatrics, along with Eric W. Schaefer, a biostatistician in the Department of Public Health Sciences.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release mentions that existing hemoglobin tests are affordable, but that screening for iron-deficiency below the level of anemia can be costly. This squeaks by as discussing “costs” but we wish figures had been offered. Is affordable $2 or $20? Is costly $100 or $500? Numbers would help readers better understand the cost implications of screening.

because it is very good at carrying genetic material into T-cells. Some patients have had the cells for years. But Mr. Hoppenot said Novartis was taking a different path with cancer drugs, looking for treatments that would have a big, unmistakable impact on a small number of patients. But such drugs tend to be extremely expensive. For the patients who had no response whatsoever, the team suspects a flawed batch of T-cells.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The study addresses costs nicely, noting that any commercial treatment resulting from this research will probably be very expensive. It notes that other targeted cancer treatments cost more than $5,000 a month. And it provides the estimate of experimental cost ($20K per patient).

Nima is not FDA-approved and it's not intended for medical use, but the company intends it as a "consumer" tool to use when dining out, Sundvor said. The company plans to deliver the product by the middle of next year after they've tested it more thoroughly, Sundvor. Marilyn Grunzweig Geller, chief executive officer of the Celiac Disease Foundation, said she is not familiar with the new gluten-sensing device and was unable to comment on it directly. "Certainly an FDA-approved device that could help people determine if they were accidentally ingesting gluten could go a long way to helping people and would be useful." As for Nima, Sundvor said, "We're doing a huge amount of testing and one thing we want to be sure of before we start shipping is that we're 99.9 percent accurate."
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story clearly states the cost of the “pre-order” version of Nima and the cost of “test pods.”

The patch, which is lined with microscopic needles that dissolve into the skin, could provide a painless alternative to hypodermic needles and make visits to the doctor's office or clinic for a traditional flu shot a thing of the past. In a mouse study reported Sunday in the online edition of Nature Medicine, Prausnitz's team found the patch improved the immune system's antibody memory and was more efficient at clearing the lungs of the flu virus, compared to a placebo and hypodermic needle-delivered vaccine. Prausnitz attributed the better performance to the skin's abundance of the types of cells most adept at generating immune responses. The muscle into which needles deliver vaccine is not nearly as active immunologically. It is estimated to affect more than 10 percent of the adult population.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story relays a researcher’s guess that the patch technology will be no more expensive than the standard flu vaccine once it is mass-produced. That’s enough for a satisfactory given the early stage of development. At least it’s more than the competing AP story did.

When it comes to preventing blood clots after a knee replacement, good old aspirin may be just as effective as newer, more expensive drugs. The new U-M study suggests patients may be adequately protected if they take aspirin alone from day one. Those reasons include shorter surgical times, less invasive procedures and use of regional anesthesia that allows early mobilization after surgery, Hallstrom says. "Patients can get it over the counter for pennies, while the other anticoagulants require monitoring, injections, frequent dose adjustments and are extremely expensive." Although warfarin costs a few dollars for a 30-day supply, its cost approaches that of the other anticoagulants when doctor visits for monitoring are factored in, Hallstrom says.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The cost differences between aspirin and anticoagulant drugs are listed and the potential savings by using aspirin are highlighted.

It eventually attracted attention in cardiology circles, where the scans' costs and benefits are the subject of much debate. They say the test's value is limited because it doesn't identify which plaque are stable and which could rupture and cause a heart attack. The American Heart Association did not endorse the legislation, which Khera estimates could result in millions of Texans being screened. Dr. William Zoghbi, director of Methodist Hospital's Cardiovascular Imaging Institute, said the cancer risk numbers reported in the study are actually fairly low compared to other tests that take X-rays of the chest area, such as a regular CAT scan or coronary angiography. The Texas law will require insurance companies pay $200 of the bill for patients to get the test every five years.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: 


 
The story not only mentions the cost of a scan to individuals ($100 to $500), it also notes that about $50 million dollars was spent on this type of scanning nationwide in 2008. A longer story could have also reported on the costs of additional testing and treatments triggered by screening apparently healthy individuals.

The effect was so marked that the trial was stopped early for ethical reasons, so that patients in the control group could be offered the new drug. The results of both trials were published online by The New England Journal of Medicine in addition to being presented here. To be sure, more than half of patients with metastatic melanoma would not be helped all that much by either drug. In the trial, sponsored by Roche and led by Dr. Paul B. Chapman of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, 38 percent of participants had to stop taking the drug or lower the dose because of side effects, including rash and joint pain. The new trial of this drug, by contrast, involved patients who were getting treated for the first time.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The significant costs of both drugs were mentioned.  Nice job.
