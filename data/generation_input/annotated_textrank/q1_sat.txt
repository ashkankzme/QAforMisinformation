Furthermore, the higher upfront costs of LARC methods are no longer an impediment for women with insurance obtained through the Affordable Care Act. Megan L. Kavanaugh, a senior research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, which studies reproductive health, said in an interview that “all new insurance plans obtained through the act’s exchanges fully cover all contraceptive methods without any co-payments or other out-of-pocket costs.” Title X family planning clinics and Planned Parenthood clinics are more likely than other sources to offer LARC methods, she said. In a paper published two years ago, European experts predicted that “after decades of dominance by ‘the Pill,’ it is likely that in the future, long-acting reversible contraceptives will become the first-line contraceptive option, owing to their superior contraceptive effectiveness in real-life use, cost effectiveness as well as their established safety profile.” ■ There is no need to get frequent supplies and no additional costs once they are inserted, making them highly cost effective.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: We applaud the way this story examines what may be the “under use” of devices and clearly explains some of the nuance about up-front costs versus the long-term cost of contraception. Bravo for pointing out that the Affordable Care Act now covers these devices, which at one time may have seemed “too expensive” for some patients.
We think it would have been even better if the story had a few actual figures in it – to demonstrate this. For example, one website from Planned Parenthood explains the cost for the copper IUD this way:
“The cost for the medical exam, the IUD, the insertion of the IUD and follow-up visits to your health care provider can range from $500 to $900. That cost pays for protection that can last more than a decade.”
As the story points out – that cost will not fall to an individual patient who is covered under the ACA. But the old prejudices about cost may be part of the reason for the gap in popularity.

The cost of contouring can run into the tens of thousands of dollars, depending on how many procedures are needed. Most insurers pay for bariatric surgery, but they often consider contouring to be cosmetic, rather than medically necessary, and thus not covered under their policies.

Hospitals aren't charging more for it — so cost doesn't seem to be a major factor.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story said hospitals aren’t charging more for the family-centered cesarean. We’ll judge this nod in the direction of costs to be sufficient for a satisfactory rating, but ideally we’d like to see a dollar estimate for what a traditional cesarean costs. In addition, we’d note that the family-centered cesarean does involve some additional resource costs — for example, extra nursing staff and the logistics of getting the neonatal team into the operating room — that should be considered, even if these are not currently reflected in typical hospital charges.

The government is paying an average of only $450 a course for those other drugs — only one-fifth of what it is paying for peramivir. Many doctors want to provide the treatment for 10 days instead of the recommended 5, she said, so the 10,000 courses the government ordered might actually treat as few as 5,000 patients.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?

All for about four bucks a bottle.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story says a bottle of POM costs $4, meeting our standard for a satisfactory. It could have specified that the $4 cost refers to 16 oz bottle and not a larger package. There also is no information about how often you’d need to drink the juice to obtain the claimed benefits, so we don’t know if people are supposed to drink a bottle a day or a bottle a week — which would make a big difference on the cost front. (The latter problem may not be the fault of the article, as a quick perusal of the POM website turned up no specific information about serving recommendations from the manufacturer.) .

A top example: Annual sales of the anti-wrinkle drug Botox have surged to $2 billion in recent years. A Kythera representative said Wednesday that the new treatment likely won't be available until June, as it must train doctors to administer Kybella, and that the company would not have more details about the potential cost of the drug until after its launch.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story says that the company would not discuss the “potential cost” of the drug until after its launch next month, and that the sales of the anti-wrinkle drug Botox exceed $2 billion per year. That’s enough for a Satisfactory rating. The story could have further informed readers by noting that insurers won’t pick up the tab.

The whole process — a week of hormones, plus the procedure to collect the eggs — runs $12,000 to $14,000. All told, costs can easily exceed $40,000, money Montoro doesn't have. "I think it's fantastic," she says, "but I think it's so incredibly expensive." In his office later, Copperman empathizes and says he hopes the procedure eventually becomes easier and cheaper.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story includes the high price tag for freezing eggs and the possibility that a family may need more than a single “freezing.” The story quotes about $40,000 for a safe number of eggs in storage and seems to imply that price includes the in- vitro fertilization required. But we wish they had done a better itemizing more ofl the costs of a high-tech pregnancy, including the possible higher risk of twins and pre-term delivery.

Robert Zivadinov of the Buffalo Neuroimaging Analysis Center in New York says that not only is the procedure unsafe and costly to many patients, it is impeding necessary research.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions that some patients have flown to Europe and spent their life savings on the procedure, and an expert calls the procedure “costly to patients.” So we can probably assume that the procedure is unlikely to be covered by major insurers or Medicare (who would cover those with chronic disability), and that the costs will run into the tens of thousands of dollars or more. This is important information for the typical patient who isn’t wealthy enough to carry this kind of cost burden. The story could have been more explicit about all of this and provided more specifics about the financial aspects of the procedure. However, we think the main point to convey here is that the surgery is expensive and patients will have to pay their own way. The story does this — though barely — so we’ll award a satisfactory.

His wife had undergone a colonoscopy, the gold-standard exam that costs about $1,500, but Rowe's internist recommended an alternative that was less invasive and expensive: a virtual colonoscopy, which uses three-dimensional images from a CT scan to detect benign polyps or cancers. "It sounded good to me," said Rowe, pleased that he could schedule the $800 procedure for 7:45 a.m. at a downtown medical building.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story describes the cost of virtual colonoscopy compared to standard colonoscopy, although it isn’t clear that $1500 versus $800 is accurate in all settings and also does not include the fact that 20% will require a follow-up colonoscopy. The story also mentions the crucial issue of insurance coverage. While more insurance companies are starting to cover the procedure, many do not. The recent CMS decision not to cover it has been highly influential.

A novel suite of 13 speedy mini-apps called IntelliCare resulted in participants reporting significantly less depression and anxiety by using the apps on their smartphones up to four times a day, reports a new Northwestern Medicine study. But participants robustly used the IntelliCare interactive apps as many as four times daily -- or an average of 195 times -- for eight weeks of the study. They spent an average of one minute using each app, with longer times for apps with relaxation videos. Participants had access to the 13 IntelliCare apps from Google Play and received eight weeks of coaching for the use of IntelliCare. Individuals can download the apps free with no financial obligation.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that there is no cost associated with downloading the Intellicare apps. But because Intellicare is part of “a national research study” the researchers request that users provide “confidential feedback” weekly to help them further develop the system. Some people may not be comfortable sharing personal data over the internet, with good reason.

Insured women with a high risk for breast cancer and a low risk for side effects who try this therapy will not incur out-of-pocket costs, because this treatment was included in the Affordable Care Act as mandated, no-charge preventive care.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions that these drugs are “covered” by the Affordable Care Act, and that “women with a high risk for breast cancer and a low risk for side effects who try this therapy will not incur out-of-pocket costs.” We’ll call this nod in the direction of costs sufficient for a satisfactory rating, but the story does not discuss these drugs’ prices or the cost of repeated office visits to monitor their side effects. There was an opportunity here for a rich discussion about incurring some upfront cost for a potential for downstream cost savings in terms of lower cancer rates and reduced need for treatment.

A fecal occult blood test can cost as little as $23 while a colonoscopy can total $700. Ahlquist noted that the cost of the test has not yet been established. It is expected to cost more than a fecal occult blood test, but far less than a colonoscopy.

EXPLANATION: A hesitant satisfactory score.  The story stated, “the cost of the test has not yet been established. It is expected to cost more than a fecal occult blood test, but far less than a colonoscopy. A fecal occult blood test can cost as little as $23 while a colonoscopy can total $700.”  It is expected by whom to cost in that range?  What’s the source?

The non-prescription steroid nasal sprays are selling for about $17 to $23 for a one-month supply (at the typical two-squirts per nostril adult starting dose). When prescription drugs are first available over the counter, most consumers end up paying more, because their insurers no longer cover the cost. Worth knowing: so far, insurers have continued to pay for similar prescription sprays, Eghrari-Sabet says. For example, Walmart sells Equate loratadine tablets (the same active ingredient as Claritin) for about $7 for 60 24-hour doses
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story goes above and beyond our standard here. There is a whole section on costs, which tells consumers to “expect to pay more.” Insurers will no longer cover the cost, the article says, so expect to shell out $17 to $23 for a one-month supply of non-prescription steroid nasal spray. The story also discusses the costs of antihistamines and says store-brand versions are a cheaper alternative to steroid sprays. An example is Walmart’s Equate loratadine tablets, which cost $7 for 60 24-hour doses.

As they report Thursday in the journal Science, they're hoping their idea would eventually lead to a $500 test that can screen for cancer and identify people with the disease when it's in its earliest stages and more treatable.

QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?

Unlike C.P.A.P., Provent is not covered by Medicare and most major insurers, though some doctors say they expect that will change in the near future. In the meantime, a 30-day supply of the patches costs $65 to $80. Dr. Lee A. Surkin, a cardiologist and sleep medicine specialist in Greenville, N.C., said patients typically start with a 10-day trial pack that costs $27.50.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story offered one of the most thorough discussions of costs we have seen in a description of an emerging device. It provides a price for a 30-day supply of the patches and for a 10-day trial pack.

So the total cost of using Folotyn will be less than for many other drugs with lower monthly prices. Genzyme’s Clolar for pediatric leukemia costs about $34,000 a week, though the company says that only two weeks of treatment are typically needed. Genzyme’s drug Campath, for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, costs about $5,000 a week for several weeks. GlaxoSmithKline is charging up to $98,000 for a six-month treatment course of Arzerra, a drug approved in late October for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which strikes about 15,000 Americans a year. About $60,000 of the cost would be incurred in the first eight weeks, when the drug is given more frequently. That median expenditure now, he said, is $87,000 for a little over a year of treatments.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story goes into some detail about the cost of Folotyn, which is extraordinarily high. The story also does a great job of comparing the cost of the drug to other expensive cancer drugs. Costs were the main focus of the story.

It’ll cost $37,000 a year but the drug’s makers, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi, have stressed that’s the wholesale price and make a point of saying there will be programs to help people pay for it. “The Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC) of Dupixent in the United States is $37,000 annually. Actual costs to patients, payers and health systems are anticipated to be lower as WAC pricing does not reflect discounts, rebates or patient assistance programs,” it said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: This is a barely passing satisfactory rating–the story did disclose the cost of $37,000, but overlooked some important details when it then tried to explain that manufacturers think the actual cost to patients will be lower.
The full picture is more complicated. Drug company patient-assistance programs — which help patients cover co-payments and other out-of-pocket costs — are abhorred by economists because they shield patients from treatment costs and undermine the ability of insurers to steer patients to less expensive options.
In addition, an accompanying video states “a billion and a half dollars” was spent developing the drug but doesn’t point out that the purported development cost is small compared with the potential profits. If all 300,000 people the manufacturers of this drug say are “most in need of treatment options” receive this drug, the total cost could be as high as $11 billion a year, funds that must be diverted from other healthcare priorities or come from higher premiums or taxes. That broader analysis was missing in this story.
An independent draft analysis showed dupilumab did improve health outcomes compared to usual care but with additional costs, and that the drug did fall below commonly cited standards for cost-effectiveness. Still, the study relied on some uncertain variables and found the drug was most cost effective for patients with severe conditions.

In addition, neither story tried to estimate what a course of treatment might cost patients or their insurers — information which probably could be gleaned by looking at the costs of TMS treatment for depression. Although there was room for improvement here, we think the story does enough to merit a satisfactory.

“The femoral artery is the traditional route, but when we go in through a vessel in the wrist, we see less bleeding, fewer complications, less pain and discomfort, higher patient satisfaction, shorter hospital stays, and lower costs.” The research, published Feb. 20 in JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions, suggests that the lower costs of the wrist approach largely are due to the fact that patients experience fewer complications and can be discharged earlier, compared with procedures that access the heart through the larger, deeper artery in the groin. The analysis demonstrated an average cost of $13,389 for the wrist approach with same-day discharge, compared with $17,076 for the groin approach with at least one night of hospitalization, resulting in a cost savings of about $3,700 for outpatients who get the wrist-access procedure. Independent of the length of stay, the wrist approach costs about $900 less than the groin approach, on average.

Reductions in emergency room visits and hospitalizations over the course of a year resulted in savings of more than $400,000.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: At issue in the story is the health system’s so-called “perfect depression care,” which incorporates depression screening into primary care. Patients deemed to have, or be at risk of, depression are then given appropriate treatment. It’s difficult to pin a specific cost to this. The matter is further complicated by the fact that treating depression can also save money by driving down costs related to associated health problems. However, the story notes that Centerstone — a separate health system that has adopted the Henry Ford Health System’s model for a smaller cohort of patients — did do a cost/benefit analysis and found that it resulted in savings of more than $400,000 per year. While we’ll award a Satisfactory, we think there was a muddling here of Henry Ford’s global screening strategy with the intense care provision in the Centerstone model. It is not appropriate to apply the cost analysis of the latter to the former. In addition, it can be argued that screening every patient at every visit it wasteful. The story reads/sounds somewhat like a paean to doing as much as you can and adopting a kitchen-sink approach rather than a carefully honed and efficient one.

Talking therapies are thought to be about as effective as antidepressant medication, but these are often much more expensive.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Without mentioning any numbers, the story does say that the costs of antidepressant drugs tend to be lower than the other major treatment approach for depression, which is talk therapy.
The story would have been stronger with cost data. For example, the four drugs found most effective  in the analysis– mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline — cost $8 to $12 for 30 tablets, according to the web site GoodRx. The study says, “All of the most effective antidepressants are now off patent and available in generic form.”
It also doesn’t mention that talk therapy may have more value for some patients because it can equip people with tools for life, and severe depression needs to be treated by a combination of drugs and talk therapy.

Based on the literature to date, patients may need to undergo treatment every 2-3 months.  We are told that each treatment costs about $400 and the total cost is $8-12,000.  That means each patients receives 20-30 treatments.  There are ancillary costs associated with each trip that we would have liked to have included. Nonetheless, we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt.

The analysis is part of a controversial review by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to determine whether to pay for Provenge, which costs $93,000 per patient and extended lives by about four months in clinical trials. While Medicare generally pays for drugs that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, its debate over paying for Provenge has raised concerns among some cancer patients, doctors and investors who say the government is sending a warning shot that it will not automatically pay for high-priced medicines.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story appropriately reports that Provenge treatment costs $93,000 per patient and is satisfactory based on the criterion. However, the costs should ideally be put into context and compared to alternative treatments. An editorial published along with the Provenge trial in the New England Journal of Medicine noted the costs of alternative treatment is $1,800 per patient.

QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The news release makes several general statements about the costs of not referring patients early to palliative care.
It’s not clear whether the cost savings at a large hospital like Mount Sinai would carry over to smaller hospitals across the country that might not have the requisite staff already in place. Additionally, a statement about the implications of costs incurred by patients for early palliative care would improve the release.

Incorporating the chips into drug testing could save millions of dollars and years of time on research.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The Newsweek report generally addresses the costs to put a new drug on the market, and it states that “Incorporating the chips into drug testing could save millions of dollars and years of time on research.”
We’ll reward the story’s impulse to address cost with a Satisfactory rating, but we’d note that the issue is more complicated than readers may appreciate based on the coverage. The article starts by projecting benefits – cost of drug development and time to FDA approval. And only later does it imply that the new technology initially will add to the cost because it will be done along with the old technology (animal studies). Only if it is as good or better may it be a substitute. Then the question is whether it will indeed be cheaper. It may be cheaper if the chips are less expensive than animal studies or if they better identify agents that do or don’t work in humans. But costs are difficult to predict and the totals can add up quickly — for example, a vial of human lung cells costs over $700. This all seems very speculative at this point.

If you pay out of pocket, a varnish treatment costs from $23 to $55, compared with a filling, which ranges from $86 to $606, according to the American Dental Association. Some higher-end plans cover two fluoride treatments per year, while cheaper plans tend not to cover any.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story does include a discussion of price, reporting that a fluoride varnish treatment can cost $23 to $55, while a filling can cost $86 to $606. That’s enough to be rated Satisfactory.
However, the story also should have stated that those numbers aren’t a head-to-head comparison, since the varnish treatment must be repeated many times over many years–which would add up. In fact, a cost-effectiveness analysis done by one of the quoted experts concluded the “Caries Management System” he advocates costs almost $1,800 for every cavity or lost tooth prevented.

The equipment, which costs $1,800, is advertised as “a sophisticated advancement of neurofeedback.” Mr. Their exceptionally generous insurance covered neurofeedback, so they decided to give it a try, with sessions twice a week for the next five years. Still, as practitioners lobby for broader acceptance, including insurance recognition, a sure sign of neurofeedback’s increasing popularity is the number of companies selling supposedly mind-altering systems to use at home.

In Europe, where the device is available, each probe (one per patient) sells for about 600 euros or $760, he said. The expected cost of the MarginProbe in the United States, if approved, is not yet known, said Michael Graffeo, a spokesman for its maker, Dune Medical Devices. This is much less than the cost of re-operation, he noted.

In the US, cholesterol tests cost around $80 and usually are covered by health insurance though much lower prices often are negotiated. The study authors in England estimated that if cholesterol testing costs $7 and gene testing costs $300, it would cost $2,900 for every person identified as having the disorder.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: This was a strong point for the story, which did provide some information on cost. “The study did not address whether screening is cost-effective. In the U.S., cholesterol tests cost around $80 and usually are covered by health insurance, though much lower prices often are negotiated. The study authors in England estimated that if cholesterol testing costs $7 and gene testing costs $300, it would cost $2,900 for every person identified as having the disorder.” We wish the story would have noted the cost of gene testing in the U.S. but otherwise found this satisfactory.
The story also could have noted that although statin drugs are generic and relatively inexpensive, the long-term costs of treatment from childhood onward are likely to be significant.

The hitch: Top reproductive endocrinologists point out that there’s no evidence the $950 DNA test can actually help women conceive. (Another example: a new $89 test that claims to tell women how their DNA could influence the level of a beneficial fatty acid in their breast milk.) Fertilome — not to be confused with a line of weed killers and other gardening products with the same name — launched in January with a $1,900 price tag. Insurers don’t cover it; after it became clear that patients were balking at the bill, Celmatix cut the price in half. Dr. Aimee Eyvazzadeh, a reproductive endocrinologist in private practice in the Bay Area, is among a few doctors who’ve been given vouchers by the company to offer the test for $500. (A round of IVF can cost $13,000.) At Eyvazzadeh’s recommendation, Smith spent about $200 buying dietary supplements like fish oils, turmeric, cayenne pepper, resveratrol, and berberine from Amazon and Walmart.

The texts that patients received were semi-personalized, based on background information about each person, such as smoking status and preferred name. "If we are going to reach a global population, we need solutions that are both scalable and affordable," Eapen says.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: This is a tricky one. The story does not explicitly address cost, except to call text messaging “a scalable and affordable approach.” For many (or most) patients, the cost of receiving four text messages a week would likely be negligible — covered by an individual’s phone plan or by nominal text rates. However, not everyone owns a mobile phone, a fact that makes access (and cost) a more significant issue. However, the story does deliver on this point. The story discusses both the number of U.S. adults who own mobile phones (90 percent) and the fact that text messages are more accessible than other forms of mobile health communication (such as apps, which require patients to own smartphones or other smart devices). So, while we’d prefer a more in-depth discussion here, we’ll award a Satisfactory rating for the story’s nod in this direction.

A first-of-its-kind osteoporosis drug lowers the risk of bone fractures better than some existing treatments, two studies suggest, and could soon add a more expensive but easier to manage treatment option to the booming market. Genetically engineered drugs, made by altering a cell's DNA or other genetic material, all cost more than $10,000 a year. Those drugs' annual retail cost can range from $385 for generic Fosamax, to roughly $1,250 for most brand-name pills, to $11,100 for injected Forteo, which must be injected daily. "You're going to have blowback by insurers" over how much they will pay, he said, but Amgen might try to charge more than $10,000 per year. Amgen spokeswoman Kerry Beth Daly said the company has not yet set a price for the drug, but will try to keep it affordable. She said pricing also will reflect denosumab's twice-a-year dosing.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Pricing for this drug is not yet available; however, the story suggests that it could be expensive, with similarly engineered drugs costing more than $10,000 a year.  In addition, the costs of currently prescribed osteoporosis medications are provided.

EXPLANATION: The story mentioned that apixabane would cost more than warafarin, and included a quote from a company spokesperson to indicate that the exact price is uncertain as the medication has not yet been approved.  The story also presented a reasoned examination of total costs for the use of warafin that accounted not just for per pill costs but also the expenses associated with the routine blood draws to examine warafarin levels.

EXPLANATION: 


The story reports that these scans typically cost $300-400 and are not generally covered by insurance. The story would have been better if it had clearly pointed out that the potentially huge cost of such a screening program, because hundreds of smokers had to be scanned to extend one life in this trial and follow-up tests and treatments cost much more than the initial scan. Nonetheless, we’ll give it the benefit of the doubt on this criterion. The New York Times never specified the scans’ costs.

They’re prescribed to about 15 percent of U.S. adults, at a cost ranging from about $4 a month for the cheapest generic version to $600 for a pricey name-brand.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: While the New York Times skipped the cost question, NBC gave readers the numbers they needed to know. It said that “Statins, which include Lipitor, Mevacor, Crestor and Zocor, are extremely popular. They’re prescribed to about 15 percent of U.S. adults, at a cost ranging from about $4 a month for the cheapest generic version to $600 for a pricey name-brand.” That’s a huge cost range and, multiplied out for the millions more Americans who are being encouraged to take statins, represents a significant potential increase in health care spending. To inform readers even more fully, the story could have looked at what those global costs would add up to for the entire country. It also could have explained what researchers mean when they say that the drugs are “worth it” and how the value of treatment was calculated in the study.

Last year, Americans spent $354 million on prescription and over-the-counter treatments for toenail fungus, according to IMS Health, a health-care information company. The treatment, in which the podiatrist aims a laser beam at the patient’s toenails to kill the organisms that cause the fungus, costs about $1,000 and is not covered by insurance because it is considered an aesthetic procedure.

"It takes co-operation and effort from multiple areas, like insurance companies, employers, policy makers and city planners, to figure out how to creatively support and encourage more exercise into most busy adults' working day.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The study evaluated the combined effect of six lifestyle habits on prostate cancer mortality. Those six factors were, as described in the journal article: “not currently smoking or quit 10 or more years ago, body mass index under 30 kg/m2, high vigorous physical activity, high intake of tomatoes and fatty fish, and low intake of processed meat.” It’s tough to put a price tag on those lifestyle choices. How much does “high vigorous physical activity” cost? How much does it cost to avoid eating processed meat? It would be easy to say this category doesn’t apply. But the release does address the issue, saying the study findings underscore “the ongoing need for more effective prevention measures and policies to increase exercise, improve diet quality and reduce tobacco use in our population….It takes co-operation and effort from multiple areas, like insurance companies, employers, policy makers and city planners, to figure out how to creatively support and encourage more exercise into most busy adults’ working day.” Recognizing the need for policies that support these lifestyle changes is important — and addresses the cost issue in a meaningful way.

Hoping to reduce her thighs and midsection without the risks and inconvenience of liposuction, she paid $2,300 for six treatments from a chiropractor in the Denver area. Nonetheless, a brochure for Zerona states patients can collectively “lose up to 9 inches without the pain or down time of surgery.” Nationwide, medical spas, chiropractors, cosmetic surgeons, plastic surgeons and dermatologists now offer Zerona for $1,700 to $3,800 for six sessions. Recently, she paid $2,100 for six treatments at Parker Day Spa in Parker, Colo. Hourlong treatments are best spaced out by two months, said Dr. Dover, who charges $700 per spot.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story states the price for the Zerona device: $1,700 to $3,800 for six sessions.

THURSDAY, May 9, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- Scientists report positive results in early testing of a wireless pacemaker that's placed in the heart instead of being connected to it via wires from the upper chest. It's also not clear when the pacemaker may be publicly available, and its cost is unknown.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story explains that this is in the “early testing” phase, so it’s understandable that a cost estimate might not be given.
In the second paragraph, the story states that the cost is unknown.
And an independent expert postulated that “the new device will probably be more expensive than other pacemakers.”

These methods decrease the time it takes for patients to complete radiation treatment -- and are estimated to cut the cost of treatment by approximately 25%. In the course of this three-year study, Dr. Cross and colleagues also documented a favorable shift toward use of hypo-fractionated radiation treatment, a shorter form of radiation associated with a substantial reduction in treatment costs. The article also noted that there was a shift during the three-year course of the study toward increasing use of hypo-fractionated radiation methods.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The news release declares the cost of treatment will be cut “by approximately 25%” without indicating a starting cost for treatment without the implant.
But the release does go in to some detail on how cost savings were estimated: During the three-year span of the study, the marker facilitated many physicians to shift from traditional external beam radiation to the shorter course hypo-fractionated radiation therapy, which results in a cost savings. The patient outcomes remain similar, however.

Rather than pay $35,000 to $50,000 on surgery that might cure the problem and prevent further damage to the child, insurance companies prefer to demand that more drugs be tried, even if the odds of them working in drug-resistant cases is small, he said. But a major problem facing these children is getting insurance companies to pay for such surgeries, said Dr. Schomer of Beth Israel.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?

Based on Medicare allowable charges, the per-injection costs of each drug at the doses used in this study were about $1850 for Eylea, about $60 for Avastin, and about $1200 for Lucentis. Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis participants on average required nine injections in the first year of the study and five in the second year.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release states that based on Medicare allowable charges, each injection of Eylea costs $1,850, Lucentis is $1,200 per injection and Avastin is $60 per injection. Patients received nine monthly injections, on average. This is good detail, although total costs of all treatments (medication plus laser) would have been even more helpful.

In his editorial, Dr. Nelson notes that SAMe is typically not covered by insurance companies, and that although the cost is relatively low, it is still more than the drug co-payments required by most health plans. A monthly supply of the same brand of supplement studied would be about $143, the editorial notes.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: There’s a nice summary of costs and lack of insurance coverage, citing the editorial.
 However, we were surprised to see in this summary that “the cost is relatively low” when the cited editorial states “SAMe is relatively expensive.” This mistake may have been unintentional, and while it’s the exact opposite conclusion of the one in the source, we are inclined not to dock the article a point because the rest of the summary provides balance about copays and, most importantly, tells its readers the absolute monthly cost of the supplement.

The comprehensive meta-analysis and assessment of human clinical trials, published in the official journal of the American Urological Association, The Journal of Urology®, assures practitioners and their patients that cranberry products are a low cost, low risk and effective way to help prevent recurrent UTIs.1
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release notes that “cranberry products are low cost,” which is fair enough and is sufficient to earn this a satisfactory rating. The issue of cost is, however, complicated by the fact that the release offers no information on what sort of cranberry products a patient may use. Is one glass of cranberry juice per day sufficient? Does one need to consume the whole berries? Or should patients take over-the-counter cranberry-based supplements? Costs would vary depending on how one chooses to pursue the vague directions discussed in the release.

EXPLANATION: The price tag of this new treatment is the focus of this article. The story also discusses the models of treatment proposed by the manufacturer.  Well done.
Two things, though: It wasn’t clear from the story if the patients in the trial had both eyes treated, which would make the more accurate price tag $850,000 vs the talking point of “$425,000 per eye.”

The devices can cost as much as $30,000. Do patients with defibrillators make up for some of that expense with fewer hospitalizations or doctor visits? Patients whose devices transmitted spent less time, on average, in the hospital when they were admitted — 3.3 days compared with 4 days — and their hospital costs were $1,600 less per admission.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION:  Mixed bag. The story explained that the devices "can cost as much as $30,000."  And there was one data point from one study on one device that users’ hospital costs were $1,600 less per admission.  But the device costs are variable and device performance will be variable.  We’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt but it painted the cost picture with really broad strokes.

EXPLANATION: Cost is a major part of the story here and NPR doesn’t gloss over it. The cost of shockwave treatment can range anywhere from $500 to several thousand dollars, NPR reports, and usually is not covered by insurance. NPR could have added some useful context  by mentioning that the shockwave machines themselves can be very expensive to purchase and operate. This can create an incentive for physicians who have bought such a machine to promote shockwave treatments to patients who may not need them. In addition, it would have been helpful to know how this treatment’s costs differ from those of other common treatments.

"The results of our analysis are especially important for patients, given that many ARBs are now also generic, which reduces their costs," he added.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: We’ll give the story a grudging satisfactory in this category since it mentions, as a closing statement, that many ARBs are now generic, which means their cost is lower than brand-name equivalents.  But the story would be more helpful to readers if it provided an idea of the comparative costs for the two types of drugs, as well as an average annual cost, since patients remain on them for long periods of time, if not for life. Though more ARBs are now available generically, the costs of generic ARBs generally remain higher than for ACEIs. For many doctors and patients, the use of ACEIs may still be preferred simply because they’re cheaper – even given similar efficacy and a slightly greater need to stop them due to side effects.

Gomaa's hope is that vaccine patches will cost less than vaccinations do now. Its analysis concluded that a dose of measles vaccine with the patch would cost just under $1, while a typical shot would cost $1.65. A 2016 study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the use of vaccine patches could save on cooling costs and could cut down on waste. But that didn't take into account the costs of getting the patch to market. The potential cost savings wouldn't happen until the patches were in "routine use," the CDC noted. Portal is aiming to get its cost down to $3 or $4 per injection. The company says its flu vaccine "starter kit," which can vaccinate 500 people, costs $900.

Still, “it has significant cost savings” compared with surgery, Ferrell says. The average treatment is two injections, which costs about $1,000 at his practice, whereas rotator-cuff surgery runs about $13,000, he says, although insurance often covers most of the costs of surgery.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story attempted to discuss cost by citing the difference in price between shoulder surgery ($13,000) and the PRP treatment ($1,000, in this case for two injections). This is sufficient enough for a Satisfactory rating, but barely.
While this does give readers some idea of the possible cost difference in treatments, there is no assurance that the charges in the author’s case are typical for those for the general public. It is simply one single data point which is fairly useless to the public. And, since there is no evidence of benefit or how many shots one might require, cost could be all over the place.

This protocol also has a cost-savings component, in addition to the patient safety and satisfaction aspects. Study authors note that SSIs are the most expensive hospital-acquired infection, costing an average of nearly $30,000 per wound-related readmission and an estimated $3-10 billion annually. "If you could imagine saving the cost from the number of patients whose readmission you were able to prevent, that result could provide significant savings to the health system," Dr. Gunter said. Although capturing specific numbers related to cost-savings was not part of this study, Dr. Gunter said it is an important area of focus for future studies.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The news release addresses the overall cost of post-surgical infections and the potential for cost savings using the monitoring app. The lead author of the study is quoted saying that preventing readmissions due to infection could lead to “significant savings to the health system,” and the release notes that “capturing specific numbers related to cost-savings was not part of this study.”
The news release helpfully states that providers have to pay for training and in some cases smartphones for patients, and pay staff to monitor the data in a “dedicated transitional care program.”
The the app itself is free for patients to download, which isn’t explicitly mentioned. There’s no mention of whether hospitals have to pay to use it.

Currently, an EKG and echocardiogram would cost parents a minimum of $2,500, Anderson says. A key challenge now is making these tests affordable; most medical insurance plans won't cover them. Simon's Fund, a non-profit organization, donated $5,000 to honor Cerda Navarro for screenings. Children's Hospital paid the rest, around $42,000, according to Children's spokesman Jim Feuer. He now takes daily blood pressure medication and is allowed to jog and do other light physical activities.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story reports that this sort of screening would typically cost $2500 and that the cost is a challenge. The story might have made the challenge more obvious by noting that screening all high school athletes would cost $20 billion.

Amgen said the drug will be available within the next two weeks and cost $825 per 60 milligram injection based on wholesale acquisition cost. Prolia, which is given by injection once every six months, works to decrease the destruction of bone and increase bone mass and strength by inhibiting proteins that activate bone-destroying cells.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: According to the story, each injection is estimated to cost $825 and people will require two injections per year. There is no mention of whether insurance companies will cover the cost, particularly since cheaper drugs for osteoporosis are available.

The researchers say such testing is needed because there are at least 600 stem cell clinics in the U.S. offering one form of stem cell therapy or another to an estimated 100,000-plus patients, who pay thousands of dollars, out of pocket, for the treatment, which has not undergone demanding clinical study.

Feifel charges about $500 for each injection and $1,000 for an intravenous infusion, which takes effect more quickly. Insurers don't cover the cost because the treatment is still considered experimental. Also, ketamine treatment is expensive because patients need to be monitored so closely. For the past year, Paul has been getting ketamine every four to six weeks.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?

Furthermore, the reduction in chest X-rays in the investigational arm resulted in an overall cost savings of $9,200, and length of stay in the Emergency Department was decreased by 26 minutes.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: This release earns praise for clearly mentioning the cost savings derived from the use of chest ultrasounds versus chest X-rays in treating patients in the study — $9,700 from 191 patients. The release could have been even even more helpful by adding information showing chest ultrasounds cost about two-and-a-half times less than chest X-rays ($140 versus $370 respectively). The release also might have mentioned that there’s a large initial outlay for ultrasound machines that may make them too expensive in the developing world. Another upfront cost not mentioned is the expense of training emergency medicine physicians (and presumably also internal medicine, pediatric and family medicine physicians) to do this procedure.

Supporters say rTMS is worth the cost — between $6,000 and $12,000 for the four-to-six-week treatment — because it enables people such as Curtis to resume productive lives. Skeptics question the price tag in light of uncertain benefits. In December, when Curtis first had a magnetic coil placed on her scalp while a $70,000 machine sent pulses into part of her brain, she had already spent a decade trying seven different prescription medications in her battle with depression. The costs of ECT — typically about $3,300 for four weeks of thrice-weekly treatments, according to AHRQ data — are covered by most private insurers as well as by Medicare and Medicaid. Six of the 10 said it represented a “reasonable” value for its cost; four saw it as a low value. “The initial treatment with rTMS is $12,000: That’s a lot of generic Prozac or Effexor,” which are cost-effective antidepressants with long track records, said Joel Rubinstein, associate medical director of Harvard Pilgrim HealthCare, an insurer that does not cover rTMS.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The costs of rTMS, and the market forces that work to encourage or restrain use of this technology, are well described.

Executives at CVS Health, a leading pharmacy benefits manager, recently said that PCSK9 inhibitors might cost $7,000 to $12,000 a year and would strain health care budgets because so many people might use them.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: It’s difficult to estimate costs for drugs that haven’t yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, so we feel this article did an exceptional job discussing the projected costs of PCSK9 inhibitors. The piece quoted executives at CVS Health who said these drugs may cost $7,000 to $12,000 a year, which may strain health care budgets if many people use them. Furthermore, insurers may be hesitant to pay for PCSK9 inhibitors until there is proof that they prevent heart attacks, strokes and death, it said.
Despite the potential high costs, analysts estimated the drugs will have billions of dollars in annual sales, the article added.

And desperate patients are shelling out thousands of dollars for treatment often not covered by health insurance, with scant evidence on long-term benefits and risks. The price tag so far is about $3,000, but “it’s worth every dime and penny,” said the 36-year-old. Typical treatment at his clinic involves six 45-minute sessions over about two weeks, costing $550 each. Some insurers will pay about half of that, covering Khare’s office visit cost.

The test costs about $63 in Europe, but the company has agreed to provide it for less than half that in poor countries, said John Bishop, Cepheid's chief executive officer, as quoted in a story by the Associated Press. The machine costs around $30,000, but would be priced under $20,000 in poor countries, he told the AP. The one potential drawback to the new test would be the expense, he said, adding, "The key question is what's it going to cost?"
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: This story does more than pay lip service to cost, flagging it as the key to making this test available in the developing world. It notes the price tag of the diagnostic machine itself and says that the $63 cost per test may be discounted by more than half in developing world countries. It fails however to compare the cost of the new test with the existing TB test. Even more important, it fails to explain that a $20 or $30 expense, which might sound modest to U.S. readers, would actually represent a huge cost burden in many developing world countries, where annual per capita health care expenditures are sometimes less than $30. A close call, but since the story made a good-faith effort to address this issue, we’ll award a satisfactory with deficiencies noted.

In the third sentence, the story says, “The surgery necessary to allow deep brain stimulation is extremely expensive” Later it says, “The cost of the surgery is about $50,000”.

The massage therapist designed and provided a series of 10 massages -- at no cost to the patient -- in a clinical treatment environment, mimicking the experience of people who choose to seek massage therapy in the real world. Generally, massage is not covered by insurance, Medicaid or Medicare. "The study can give primary care providers the confidence to tell patients with chronic low back pain to try massage, if the patients can afford to do so," Munk said. "Massage is an out-of-pocket cost," she said. "Generally, people wonder if it is worth it. Additional investigation is needed to replicate the results of the initial study and to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of massage therapy, Munk said. Will it pay to provide massage to people for an extended period of time?
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: We give the release credit for stating that massages are generally not covered by insurance and that patients typically pay out-of-pocket. And the release provided some important context about cost with this statement from the lead author: “Generally, people wonder if it is worth it. Will it pay to provide massage to people for an extended period of time? Will it help avoid back surgeries, for example, that may or may not have great outcomes? These are the types of analyses that we hope will result from this study.”
While massage is now offered in nearly all cities and towns, not all readers know how much they will need to shell out for the 10 sessions used in this study.
A one hour massage averages $60 an hour nationally, so 10 sessions would cost about $600. That’s something people considering this type of therapy would like to know.

Although it is a cancer drug, Avastin is often used off-label for eye diseases because it is far cheaper than Lucentis, costing only $20 to $100 a dose, compared with $2,000 for Lucentis. Avastin is undercutting sales of Lucentis, which totaled $1.1 billion in the United States last year. Organizers of the trial conceded that a major reason Lucentis was chosen was that Genentech, which is now owned by Roche, agreed to provide the drug free of charge and to contribute $9 million in additional financing — but only if Lucentis were used. With this successful Phase 3 trial, insurers will now be more likely to pay for such off-label use.

Because patients tend to recover faster, Mazhari said, she discharges some patients the same day, avoiding an expensive overnight hospital stay. Questions about the best method of performing cardiac catheterizations, one of the most common procedures in medicine and among the most profitable for hospitals -- Medicare reimburses GWU about $10,600 for an angioplasty involving one stent -- reflect some of the issues in the roiling health-care debate. Can it cut costs by reducing hospital stays?
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story mentions that using the wrist may better enable patients to avoid an "expensive overnight hospital stay" and that Medicare reimbursement was the same even though this route for catheterization may involve more physician time. But the story didn’t include any specific cost information about this new approach.  Shouldn’t the physicians interviewed know whether their charge to patients depends on the vessel used?

However, the release does explicitly say that “there is more work to be done, such as identifying ways to make the self-collection process more efficient and cost-effective.” That acknowledgment is enough to earn it a satisfactory rating here.

That’s not to mention cost: The drug’s price is listed at $850 per month. But for some, the risks and costs may be worth it.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story does a good job of describing the monthly cost ($850) for women who do not have health insurance. The inference is that insurers will cover the cost for others.

The other piece of good news regarding the medications is that ACE inhibitors, as well as many ARBs, are now generic -- meaning that the cost difference is minimal.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: While the story could have been a bit more specific, it gets points for stating that most ACE inhibitor drugs, and many ARB drugs, are now available in generic form, which means the cost for the medications would usually be considerably less than their comparative name-brand compounds. We’ll rate this Satisfactory, but we’d add that though more ARBs are generically available, this class of medications continues to be more expensive than ACEIs. For patients struggling to meet the cost of their medications, this is a major consideration, and important information for any news story.

Kalydeco costs in the neighborhood of $300,000 per year. They're also likely to be expensive. The time from gene discovery to successful drug may be shortening, but there are only a handful of successful drugs so far, and for a while at least, the appearance of new ones will be slow.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: It doesn’t come until the last sentence in the story, but it also leaves listeners and readers with a pretty sobering reality: “The time from gene discovery to successful drug may be shortening, but there are only a handful of successful drugs so far, and for a while at least, the appearance of new ones will be slow. They’re also likely to be expensive. Kalydeco costs in the neighborhood of $300,000 per year.”

What’s more, the hormone, which was provided free by the manufacturer in the study, today costs $700 for a single shot, Baker said. But that’s jumping the gun, she warned, because the treatment is still experimental and GHRH is not approved to treat mental decline.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Not only did the story estimate cost – $700 for a single shot – but it put it up high in the 5th paragraph along with caveats about “jumping the gun.”

ACT, the current recommended therapy, is expensive to produce and is in short supply in areas hit hardest by the disease. Another advantage of DLA over conventional malaria treatments is its low cost and the relative simplicity of its manufacture, Weathers said. While the processes for manufacturing ACT is costlier and requires a higher degree of expertise, producing DLA tablets can be accomplished with simpler equipment and a modest amount of training. Growing Artemisia annua and producing and testing the tablets, Weathers noted, are ideal local business that can provide jobs in impoverished areas and greatly expand access to antimalarial therapy.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release mentions this would be an “inexpensive treatment option” and goes into some detail about the economics of the region where the drug was tested and the advantage of a low cost therapy.
“Another advantage of DLA over conventional malaria treatments is its low cost and the relative simplicity of its manufacture, Weathers said. While the processes for manufacturing ACT is costlier and requires a higher degree of expertise, producing DLA tablets can be accomplished with simpler equipment and a modest amount of training. Growing Artemisia annua and producing and testing the tablets, Weathers noted, are ideal local business that can provide jobs in impoverished areas and greatly expand access to antimalarial therapy.”
Normally we like to see specific costs but in this case, an attempt is made to discuss the challenges and opportunities of developing a low cost therapy which seems appropriate here.

MRI screening has not been considered necessary for women at average risk, and there has been resistance to expansion of MRI into this population due, in part, to concern over higher costs.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Although the news release does not specify the exact price tag, it makes the reader aware that MRI screening is often avoided due to higher cost than other screening options:
“MRI screening has not been considered necessary for women at average risk, and there has been resistance to expansion of MRI into this population due, in part, to concern over higher costs.”
It would have been helpful if the release had stated whether or not this rapid MRI will have a lower cost than traditional breast MRI.

Repatha, with a list price of more than $14,000 a year, was approved based on its ability to dramatically lower “bad” LDL cholesterol in patients who require more intensive therapy on top of widely-used statins, such as Lipitor, or who are unable to tolerate statins. But those who control budgets wanted concrete proof that the drug could actually reduce the risk of heart attacks and death before making it easier for patients to get the medicine.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: To its credit, the story mentions the high cost of the drug Repatha — $14,000 per year — and cites reluctance on the part of some insurers to cover that cost without more substantive data on its efficacy.  The news release issued by the drug’s manufacturer, Amgen, didn’t include either point.

The night flashes require special technology and equipment, beyond just a smartphone, which are still in development, Zeitzer said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: While no costs were discussed, the suggestion that the device might be expensive was made: “The night flashes require special technology and equipment, beyond just a smartphone, which are still in development, Zeitzer said.” We’ll consider this nod in the direction of cost sufficient for a Satisfactory rating, since it would be difficult to say exactly how much such a device would cost at this stage.

The team of researchers chose to focus on low-dose "baby" aspirin, because not only is it inexpensive and readily available as potential means of prevention, but because there are already a lot of people already taking it for prevention of other diseases such as heart disease and even colon cancer.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release notes, near the bottom, that low-dose aspirin is inexpensive. That’s enough to earn it a satisfactory rating here since low-dose aspirin is indeed inexpensive. Costs for a bottle of 300 tablets currently range from $3.47 to $12.49 according to an online search.

The ultimate cost-effectiveness of sublingual immunotherapy has also yet to be determined; in the UK, for example, Grazax treatment costs about 2.25 pounds ($3.50) per day. In theory, that could pay off if long-term use of allergy medications was cut, but that has yet to be shown. Grazax, for instance, is taken daily, starting several months before the start of the next grass-pollen allergy season and continuing for three years thereafter.

The cost of the surgery and Hipec, including hospitalization, ranges from $20,000 to more than $100,000, doctors said. While and insurers generally pay for the operation, the heated treatment may not be covered. But doctors added it may be if it is described merely as chemotherapy.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: Good job on this, stating “The cost of the surgery and Hipec, including hospitalization, ranges from $20,000 to more than $100,000, doctors said. While Medicare and insurers generally pay for the operation, the heated treatment may not be covered. But doctors added it may be if it is described merely as chemotherapy.”

For uninsured patients, the cost of having spine stimulation devices can range from $15,000 to $50,000 or more, according to a 2008 report funded by the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries. Spine stimulation is usually approved only after patients have not responded to other treatment, according to Blue Cross Blue Shield. Also, the procedure isn't covered by all insurance companies, so out-of-pocket costs to patients can be very high. It is, however, covered by Medicare, he said.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story did great on this criterion. It said the cost of spine stimulation devices “can range from $15,000 to $50,000 or more, according to a 2008 report funded by the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries.” It also mentioned the procedure “isn’t covered by all insurance companies, so out-of-pocket costs to patients can be very high.” One quibble we did have is that it isn’t clear whether the device to stimulate the dorsal root ganglion is different in cost than the other types of spinal cord stimulation.

Along with discovering that the use of laparoscopy for the surgical treatment of GERD has increased significantly in the last decade, the researchers also found that, on average, the minimally invasive approach reduced length of hospital stay by approximately two days, and open operations were more than $9,000 more expensive than minimally invasive procedures. "We found that laparoscopic surgery is associated with significantly lower costs. In addition, indirect costs of the open approach, including an impaired ability to work, time off from work, and intangible costs of postoperative pain and healing, are difficult to measure but also favor the laparoscopic approach," said Dr. Patti.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story focused on costs, including information about the relative cost comparison between what are called “open” surgeries and those done laparoscopically (with a thin flexible tube.)

U.S. prisons are experimenting with a high-priced monthly injection that could help addicted inmates stay off opioids after they are released, but skeptics question its effectiveness and say the manufacturer has aggressively marketed an unproven drug to corrections officials. But each shot costs as much as $1,000, and because the drug has a limited track record, experts do not agree on how well it works. Proponents say Vivitrol could save money compared with the cost of locking up a drug offender — about $25,000 a year for each inmate at the Sheridan Correctional Center, 70 miles southwest of Chicago.

When used in the eye, Avastin costs about $50 a dose, compared with about $2,000 for Lucentis.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The story does mention the cost per dose of two competing drugs, Lucentis and Avastin (which are actually two different formulations of the same drug that are made by the same company, Genentech). Lucentis is the version of the drug meant for the eye, whereas Avastin is approved and sold as a cancer treatment. However, doctors can use Avastin off-label in the eye with much smaller doses than cancer patients need. The result is that the cost per dose is vastly lower for Avastin than it is for Lucentis. A head-to-head trial of Avastin and Lucentis is now underway that will probably have important implications for pricing and prescribing of these drugs. (If Avastin works just as well as Lucentis, more doctors will presumably switch to it at much lower cost to patients.) Moreover, allegations have surfaced recently that Genentech is providing questionable financial inducements for doctors to use the more costly Lucentis instead of Avastin. Given the significance of these developments for anyone who needs or may need treatment for AMD, we feel the story could have and probably should have gone into a bit more detail about why these two drugs have such wildly different costs.
We also think that if the story is interviewing a company about its plans to seek marketing approval in just a few months, they certainly could get some kind of pricing estimate from them. Nevertheless, by at least mentioning costs, the story accomplishes more than most other health articles that we review and does enough to satisfy the minimum for this criterion. We’ll award a satisfactory.

Light therapy is cheap, easy to use and comes with few side effects compared to medication such as antidepressants, said lead author Raymond Lam, a professor of psychiatry at the University of British Columbia.

During an FDA advisory panel meeting, committee members were mostly positive about DaTscan, though one neurologist objected to the average $1,500 cost of a scan versus $150 for a month's supply of carbidopa or levodopa medications for a Parkinson's patient, according to Medscape Medical News.
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: 


Yes, the story reports that a DaTscan costs about $1500. Oddly, instead of reporting what the hospitals featured in the story charge for a scan, the story attributes the price estimate to a quote taken from an article by Medscape Medical News. But there is a much higher price listed on the web site of the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research, which estimates a DaTscan costs almost $3000. Still, because the story does address cost we will give it credit on this criterion.

Blood tests for iron deficiency without anemia have been developed but they are more costly and difficult to obtain in the doctor's office compared to hemoglobin testing for anemia. Women are typically tested some time in their teens for anemia -- the severe form of iron deficiency -- using a quick and affordable hemoglobin test. Sekhar and colleagues hoped to determine risk factors for iron deficiency without anemia that could pinpoint which women could benefit most from this more costly testing. In addition to timing, further research will be needed to determine which blood test for iron deficiency without anemia is accurate, cost-efficient and practical for routine doctor's office use.
QUESTION: Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The release mentions that existing hemoglobin tests are affordable, but that screening for iron-deficiency below the level of anemia can be costly. This squeaks by as discussing “costs” but we wish figures had been offered. Is affordable $2 or $20? Is costly $100 or $500? Numbers would help readers better understand the cost implications of screening.

He hopes the new treatment will eventually replace bone-marrow transplantation, an even more arduous, risky and expensive procedure that is now the last hope when other treatments fail in leukemia and related diseases. But such drugs tend to be extremely expensive. A prime example is the Novartis drug Gleevec, which won rapid approval in 2001 for use against certain types of leukemia and gastrointestinal tumors. It can cost more than $5,000 a month, depending on the dosage. Dr. June said that producing engineered T-cells costs about $20,000 per patient — far less than the cost of a bone-marrow transplant. Scaling up the procedure should make it even less expensive, he said, but he added, “Our costs do not include any profit margin, facility depreciation costs or other clinical care costs, and other research costs.”
QUESTION: Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?
EXPLANATION: The study addresses costs nicely, noting that any commercial treatment resulting from this research will probably be very expensive. It notes that other targeted cancer treatments cost more than $5,000 a month. And it provides the estimate of experimental cost ($20K per patient).

He also said that although initially there will be start-up costs, he thinks the price will be no more than traditional flu vaccines once it is mass-produced.

The reported cost for a 30-day supply of rivaroxaban is approximately $379 to $450; heparin is estimated at $450 to $890. Although warfarin costs a few dollars for a 30-day supply, its cost approaches that of the other anticoagulants when doctor visits for monitoring are factored in, Hallstrom says. Some doctors choose powerful anti-clotting drugs like heparin (Lovenox) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto), but it hasn't been clear whether these expensive prescription drugs work any better than cheap, readily available aspirin.

The story not only mentions the cost of a scan to individuals ($100 to $500), it also notes that about $50 million dollars was spent on this type of scanning nationwide in 2008. A longer story could have also reported on the costs of additional testing and treatments triggered by screening apparently healthy individuals.
