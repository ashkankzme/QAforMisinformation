That seems to be a fair basis\u00a0upon which to\u00a0identify women who might be candidates for some kind of medical treatment of\u00a0menopause symptoms. The story could have\u00a0provided data on how many women suffer from moderate to severe hot flash symptoms, to give a better\u00a0idea of how widespread the problem is.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The non-contact sports included were cheerleading, cross country, cycling, tennis and track.\n\"This important work provides insight into a tool that may yet prove useful in the recognition and management of concussion,\" said Jeffrey Kutcher, MD, FAAN, with the The Sports Neurology Clinic in Brighton, Michigan.\nEach of the concussed athletes had their brain blood flow measured with the advanced ultrasound headset within an average of six days after the injury.\nThe American Academy of Neurology, an association of 30,000 neurologists and neuroscience professionals, is dedicated to promoting the highest quality patient-centered neurologic care.\n\"This research suggests that this advanced form of ultrasound may provide a more accurate diagnosis of concussion,\" said Hamilton.\n", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The release doesn\u2019t engage in disease mongering.
