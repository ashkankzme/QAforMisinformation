Instead, there are several errors in the description of what happens in heart disease that may serve to mislead or confuse readers about the impact of coronary calcium: 1) Coronary arteries carry blood to the heart muscle (they feed the muscle), not away from the heart as the story states; and 2) The problem with coronary plaque buildup isn\u2019t that it causes the\u00a0heart to \u201cwork harder to pump blood through the body\u201d as the story states; it is that narrowing in the coronary arteries deprives the heart muscle of blood, causing angina (chest pain), and \u00a03) Clots in coronary arteries don\u2019t break off and cause strokes in the brain; the rupturing of plaque leads to blockage in the coronary arteries, again depriving the heart muscle of blood (causing a \u201cheart attack\u201d or myocardial infarction).", "answer": 0}, {"article": "\"The truth is that quit smoking programs, like other programs that treat addictions, often have fairly low success rates.
