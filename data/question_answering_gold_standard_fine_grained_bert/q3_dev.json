But instead of going on a penis, it goes in a vagina, which is why it's also sometimes referred to as an internal condom. For more information, BuzzFeed Health spoke with two experts who could demystify this lesser-known contraceptive:\n\n* Dr. Harry Fisch, clinical professor of urology and reproductive medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College, and chief corporate officer of Veru Healthcare, which distributes FC2\n\n* Dr. Lauren Streicher, associate clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "There is a good discussion of the drawbacks of condom use, for both male and female condoms.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "In 1992, Harvard neuroscientist Richard Davidson embarked on an unusual research project to study the brains of Buddhist monks who spent thousands of hours meditating.\nThe study did caution that 30 of the 103, or about one-third, of the participants in the meditation group reported an \"adverse event,\" most often an increase in pain due to yoga.\nThe participants in the small study ranged in age from 20 to 70 and had suffered from back pain for an average of 7.3 years.\nThe study looks at adults with chronic low back pain, one of the leading cause of disabilities in the United States and one reason why more and more people are addicted to painkillers.\nLed by Daniel C. Cherkin of Group Health Research Institute in Seattle, the experiment involved randomly assigning 342 adults with the condition to meditate, talk with a psychologist or continue with their normal techniques for addressing the pain, such as medication.\n", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story notes: \u201cThe study did caution that 30 of the 103, or about one-third, of the participants in the meditation group reported an \u2018adverse event,\u2019 most often an increase in pain due to yoga.\u201d It\u2019s good to see that included. Since the story is effectively comparing MBSR to CBT and conventional treatment, it would also have been worth noting \u201cadverse events\u201d for those groups in the study. According to the study, 10 percent of the CBT group also experienced \u201cadverse events,\u201d and no adverse events were mentioned for the control group.\nDefining \u201cadverse events\u201d would also have been good, since it\u2019s not clear whether they mean momentary pain or a debilitating flare-up of long-term pain. According to the study, the pain\u2013for both MBSR and CBT groups\u2013was \u201cmostly temporary\u201d and no \u201cserious\u201d adverse events were reported. Those things are worth mentioning. (It\u2019s also worth finding out what \u201cmostly\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d mean.)", "answer": 1}]
