First, while the release mentions Eli Lilly\u2019s funding, it doesn\u2019t make clear Lilly\u2019s financial ties to cetuximab. Lilly manufactures cetuximab and receives royalties on Erbitux worldwide (though it is marketed by different companies, depending on where it is being sold).

Second, many readers, possibly most readers, may not have access to the journal article. And if an institution knows that information is worth mentioning to readers (such as whether researchers had conflicts of interest), then an institution should not make readers put in extra legwork to find that information. And there is certainly relevant information to share here. The lead author reported working as a consultant for Lilly. Two co-authors are Lilly employees.
