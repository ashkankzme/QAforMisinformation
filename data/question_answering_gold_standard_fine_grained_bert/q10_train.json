At first glance, many readers are likely to think that the rate of lung cancer in the Augusta area has more than doubled since the last time there was a lung-cancer screening initiative. That would be incorrect, given that this appears to be the first such initiative focusing on the Augusta area. Rather, the rate of lung cancer among \u201chigh risk\u201d patients screened in the Augusta initiative was more than double that of high risk patients screened during a national screening initiative launched in 2002.
