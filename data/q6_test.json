[{"article": "Scientists say they have created a new drug that can attack ovarian and lung cancers in patients for whom other treatments have failed.\n\nThe U.K.-based researchers used a new drug along with chemotherapy medication known as paclitaxel on 25 women with high-grade, serous ovarian cancer, and 40 participants with squamous non-small cell lung cancer. The cancers had spread across the bodies of each participant, who did not respond to standard treatment.\n\nOver half of patients with ovarian cancer and over a third with lung cancer saw their tumors shrink, according to the study, which was published in the Annals of Oncology.\n\nThe cocktail also stopped the cancer growing for almost six months, which is unexpected for patients with advanced-stage cancers who were unresponsive to currently available treatments, including chemotherapy, the authors said.\n\nRead more: Most common childhood cancer is likely caused by lack of exposure to infections, major study finds\n\nThe research was led by scientists at The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, as well as teams in nine institutions across the U.K.\n\nIt built on previous research by the ICR that showed ovarian cancer cells resistant to treatment generally have higher levels of a molecule called p-S6K, which aids the growth of the disease. The scientists hypothesized the cancer could use this molecule to render chemotherapy ineffective.\n\nVistusertib attacks proteins called mTOR1 and 2, which turn on the p-S6K protein. Combined with paclitaxel chemotherapy, the scientists were able to block cancer cells from harnessing p-S6K. That is why the patients\u2019 tumors shrunk, the study suggests.\n\nDr. Susana Banerjee, consultant medical oncologist at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust and team leader in gynecological cancers at ICR, who is leading the phase II trial, commented in a statement: \u201cEffective treatment options for women with relapsed ovarian cancer are limited, so these results are very encouraging.\n\nCommenting on the next stage of the research, she said: \u201cIn the larger phase II trial we\u2019ve recruited 140 women with relapsed ovarian cancer across the U.K. to standard chemotherapy (paclitaxel) or paclitaxel in combination with vistusertib. We need to wait for these results, expected later this year, to see how effective this approach is compared to chemotherapy alone.\u201d\n\nProfessor Udai Banerji\u200b, author of the study and deputy director of the Drug Development Unit at The ICR and Royal Marsden, acknowledged in an interview with Newsweek the cohort of patients was small, \"however anything more than 20 patients usually gives one a rough idea [of the effectiveness of a treatment].\"\n\nDr. Dean A. Fennell, professor and consultant in thoracic medical oncology at the University of Leicester, who was not involved in the study, told Newsweek the study presents an \u201cexciting result.\u201d\n\nHe was particularly surprised by the magnitude of the response triggered by vistusertib combined with paclitaxel, which is closely related to standard chemotherapy.\n\nHowever, Fennell said the study tripped up in that there was no predictive link between mutations and response to treatment. \u201cIn other words, there was no sign of who might benefit the most with treatment,\" he explained.\n\nHe continued: \u201cThis combination of vistusertib and paclitaxel appears promising in lung cancer. Confirmatory studies will be essential and if positive would broaden our armamentarium for fighting this cancer.\u201d\n\nThis article has been updated with comment from Professor Udai Banerji\u200b.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "There was no information about conflicts of interest.

It is estimated that the condition affects one in 110 children in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"There is a serious unmet need in the autism world, where diagnosis is currently done by subjective reports, and after the child has missed many developmental milestones,\" said lead researcher Joy Hirsch, a professor of functional neuroradiology, neuroscience and psychology, and director of the Functional MRI Laboratory at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City.\n\n\"It is now possible to develop an objective imaging diagnostic,\" she said. Indeed, the researchers found a difference between autistic brains and typical brains in the level of responsiveness in language areas, Hirsch noted.\n\n\"What we can measure are signals in the brain, in a specific language area, that are depressed in autistic children and normal in typical children,\" she said.\n\nAlthough this study was done with school-aged children and teens, the same test can be done with children as young as 18 months, Hirsch noted. \"We know this technique can be used on young children,\" she said.\n\nThe report was released in the May 31 online edition of Radiology, in advance of publication in the August print issue.\n\nFor the study, 12 children with autism and 15 children without the condition underwent functional MRI (fMRI) exams. Both groups of children ranged in age from 4 to 17 years.\n\nWhile the children were undergoing the fMRI, the researchers played recordings of their parents talking to them and watched for brain activity in areas of the brain responsible for hearing and understanding language.\n\nThe researchers found no differences in the activity in the hearing area of the brain between the two groups. However, in the language comprehension area, there was significantly more activity among typical children than among children with autism, Hirsch's group noted.\n\nTo further test this screening approach, another group of 27 autistic children, aged 5 to 17, underwent fMRI and the researchers were able to identify 26 of them as autistic.\n\nDr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York in Lake Success, said that \"although the investigators did indeed find significant differences on neuroimaging between controls and autistic children, the clinical utility from a diagnostic standpoint is unclear.\"\n\nThere are important limitations to the study, Adesman said.\n\nFor one, this study was done in school-aged children, many of whom were actually teenagers, so it is impossible to know if these differences in neuroimaging would also be found in younger patients, Adesman pointed out.\n\n\"It is during the toddler/preschool years that autism typically presents and needs to be diagnosed,\" he explained.\n\n\"The other major limitation of this study is that the investigators did not look at whether these brain differences are specific to children with autism, or if they would also be seen, for example, in children with language delays who are not autistic,\" Adesman said.\n\nHirsch noted the study is preliminary and, as such, has some limitations. For one, it is not known whether this technique can identify autism across the entire spectrum of the disorder.\n\n\"There are questions about how this varies across the severity of autism. Also, can we distinguish autism from other forms of developmental delay?\" she asked. \"These are things that aren't known.\"\n\nFurther work is needed to refine the test, Hirsch added. \"This is not the diagnostic that you can package and send to all community health centers in the United States. This is an announcement that this can be done,\" she said.\n\nThis test costs no more than a standard MRI, which runs around $1,500, Hirsch noted.\n\nAnother expert, Dr. Robert F. Lopez-Alberola, chief of pediatric neurology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, said that \"it's nice to have an objective measure, but it doesn't really do much.\"\n\nUltimately, he said, \"the diagnosis of autism is a clinical diagnosis. I see this as having more implications for research into the pathophysiology of autism.\"\n\nHowever, if this test could be done in really young children, it might help identify autism so that treatment can begin early, Lopez-Alberola suggested. \"We know the earlier we begin interventions, the greater the likelihood of better outcome,\" he said.\n\n\"Although this technique holds promise for identifying infants at risk for autism, it still needs to be determined whether the atypical patterns of brain activation are specific to autism,\" said Geraldine Dawson, chief science officer for Autism Speaks.\n\n\"It is possible that children who have delayed language but not autism would also show the same pattern. Regardless, this research is promising as a method for identifying young children at risk for autism,\" Dawson said.\n\nFor more on autism, visit the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "HealthDay continues its laudable tradition of listing the story\u2019s sources at the end of the piece..

Among the group of participants, 482 tumor, benign and germline samples were looked at. The researchers analyzed the samples and looked for genetic differences that made it so the researchers could categorize the study participants into groups regarding targeted treatments specific to their prostate cancer.\n\nWhat they found was more than minimal differences among the tumors. They concluded that five different types of prostate cancer were found based on 100 genes. These genes demonstrated the risk of the disease progression, which was more accurate than the currently used Gleason score test and PSA test.\n\nPrior research had shown six of the genes were linked to prostate cancer, however researchers noted in the published study that it turns out the other 94 genes had not been associated with prostate cancer until now.\n\n\"If five types of the disease exist, how does this change popular medical opinion on prostate cancer screening?

Both analyze multiple genes in a biopsy sample and give a score for aggressiveness, similar to tests used now for certain breast and colon cancers.\n\nDoctors say tests like these have the potential to curb a major problem in cancer care \u2014 overtreatment. Prostate tumors usually grow so slowly they will never threaten a man's life, but some prove fatal and there is no reliable way now to tell which ones will. Treatment with surgery, radiation or hormone blockers isn't needed in most cases and can cause impotence or incontinence, yet most men are afraid to skip it.\n\n\"We're not giving patients enough information to make their decision,\" said Dr. Peter Carroll, chairman of urology at the University of California, San Francisco. \"You can shop for a toaster\" better than for prostate treatment, he said.\n\nA study he led of the newest test \u2014 the Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score \u2014 is set for discussion Wednesday at an American Urological Association meeting in San Diego.\n\nThe results suggest the test could triple the number of men thought to be at such low risk for aggressive disease that monitoring is a clearly safe option. Conversely, the test also suggested some tumors were more aggressive than doctors had believed.\n\nIndependent experts say such a test is desperately needed but that it's unclear how much information this one adds or whether it will be enough to persuade men with low-risk tumors to forgo treatment, and treat it only if it gets worse. Only 10 percent who are candidates for monitoring choose it now.\n\n\"The question is, what's the magnitude of difference that would change the patient's mind?\" said Dr. Bruce Roth, a cancer specialist at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nOne man may view a 15 percent chance that his tumor is aggressive as low risk \"but someone else might say, 'Oh my God, let's set the surgery up tomorrow,'\" he said. \"I don't think it's a slam dunk.\"\n\nAlso unknown: Will insurers pay for the expensive test without evidence it leads to better care or saves lives?\n\nThe newest test was developed by Genomic Health Inc., which has sold a similar one for breast cancer since 2004. Doctors at first were leery of it until studies in more groups of women proved its value, and the same may happen with the prostate test, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, the American Cancer Society's deputy chief medical officer.\n\nThe company will charge $3,820 for the prostate test and says it can save money by avoiding costlier, unnecessary treatment. Another test for assessing prostate cancer risk that came out last summer \u2014 Prolaris by Myriad Genetics Inc. \u2014 sells for $3,400.\n\nBoth companies can sell the tests without Food and Drug Administration approval under separate rules that govern lab diagnostics. Myriad Genetics has published nine studies on Prolaris involving more than 3,000 patients. Genomic Health has not published any results on the prostate test, another thing that makes doctors wary. Yet it has a track record from its breast cancer test.\n\nAbout 240,000 men in the U.S. are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year, and about half are classified as low risk using current methods. Doctors now base risk estimates on factors such as a man's age and how aggressive cells look from biopsies that give 12 to 14 tissue samples. But tumors often are spread out and vary from one spot to the other.\n\n\"Unless you can be sure your biopsy has hit the most aggressive part that's in the prostate, you can't be sure\" how accurate your risk estimate is, explained Dr. Eric Klein, chief of urology at the Cleveland Clinic, who led early development of the Oncotype prostate cancer test.\n\nFor one study, researchers used prostates removed from 440 men. They measured the activity of hundreds of genes thought to be involved in whether the cancer spread beyond the prostate or proved fatal. A second study of biopsies from 167 patients narrowed it down to 81 genes, and researchers picked 17 that seemed to predict aggressiveness no matter the location in the tumor.\n\nA third study used single needle-biopsy samples from 395 UCSF patients scheduled to have their prostates removed. The gene test accurately predicted the aggressiveness of their cancer once doctors were able to see the whole prostate after surgery.\n\nUsing one current method, 37 of the 395 men would have been called very low risk and good candidates for monitoring. Adding the gene test put 100 men into that category, said another study leader, Dr. Matthew Cooperberg of UCSF. The gene test shifted about half of the men into either a lower or a higher risk category.\n\n\"It went both ways \u2014 that was the remarkable thing. In any category of risk it added independent information compared to the standard criteria we use today,\" Carroll said. \"More work needs to be done, but, in my opinion, this is a very good start.\"\n\nHowever, Dr. Kevin McVary, chairman of urology at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine and a spokesman for the Urological Association, said the test must be validated in more men before it can be widely used.\n\n\"It's not there yet,\" he said.\n\nUCSF just got a federal grant to see how men choose treatments and whether this test might sway them.\n\n\"We throw all these numbers at them. Are they really going to make a better decision?\" Cooperberg said.\n\nDean Smith, 60, a retired marketing executive from Mill Valley, Calif., is following his doctor's advice to monitor the cancer he was diagnosed with in March. He said a gene test may have made him more comfortable with that decision.\n\nAt least six of his friends suffered side effects ranging from urinary leakage to inability to have sex after having their prostates removed.\n\n\"I would suspect that having cancer and having to live with it would be very difficult for them,\" but it doesn't bother him, Smith said. \"I will die from something other than prostate cancer, I guarantee you.\"\n\nCopyright 2013 The Associated Press.

Patients often expect a scan. But now researchers are warning that the radiation patients get each time computerized tomography is used to detect injuries and disease will cause thousands of extra cancers in coming years.\n\nA new study from the National Cancer Institute projects 29,000 excess cancers from the 72 million CT scans that Americans got in 2007 alone. Nearly 15,000 of those cancers could be fatal.\n\nCT-related cancers will impose a similar burden each year \u2014 unless the number of scans and the radiation dose-per-scan can be reduced.\n\n\"Physicians [and their patients] cannot be complacent about the hazards of radiation or we risk creating a public health time bomb,\" says Dr. Rita Redberg, editor of Archives of Internal Medicine, which is publishing the paper in this week's issue.\n\nChildren, younger adults and women are especially susceptible. Two-thirds of the excess cancers will occur in women, the NCI researchers say.\n\nA separate study in the journal documents needlessly high radiation exposures from CT scans at four San Francisco-area hospitals.\n\nThat study looked at actual radiation doses for 11 common types of CT scans in more than 1,100 patients. For the same body part, the doses varied enormously from one hospital to another and even within the same hospital. The researchers found a 13-fold range between the highest and lowest radiation dose.\n\nThat means many unsuspecting patients are getting considerably more radiation than they need for an adequate CT image.\n\n\"For the same body part, the same patient with abdominal pain being evaluated for possible cancer, there can be a profoundly different radiation dose,\" says Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman, a radiologist at the University of California at San Francisco who led that study.\n\nSmith-Bindman says neither doctors nor patients appreciate the amount of radiation exposure that U.S. patients are accumulating from CT scans. The number of scans has increased at a rate of 10 percent a year recently, jumping from 3 million scans in 1980 to more than 70 million a year today.\n\n\"It's often said that the radiation dose of a chest X-ray is comparable to flying across the continent,\" Smith-Bindman says, referring to natural radiation exposures at high altitudes. \"But a CT scan can be comparable to 500 transcontinental flights.\"\n\nShe adds that a single CT scan can deliver about the same radiation dose that survivors of the atomic blasts at Nagasaki and Hiroshima endured.\n\n\"I think we need to pause and think about whether the extra information [from CT scans] really helps us make a diagnosis,\" Smith-Bindman says. \"In most cases it does, and we should be using CT scanning in those cases. But in other situations it doesn't ... and the potential for harm outweighs the benefits.\"\n\nShe says patients should start asking doctors if they really need a particular CT scan, and if so, whether it can be done with minimal radiation exposure. It's especially important for younger adults and parents to ask the questions.\n\nSmith-Bindman says radiation exposures can be cut substantially by eliminating unnecessary CT scans \u2014 both initial scans and repeat or follow-up scans now often done routinely. Also some fancier CT studies, involving multiple \"slices\" through the body in a single examination, can be replaced by simpler CT tests, conventional X-rays or tests such as ultrasound or MRI that don't involve radiation.\n\nAnother way is to reduce the amount of radiation involved in each scan.\n\nDr. James Thrall, chairman of the American College of Radiology, agrees. He says at his institution, the Massachusetts General Hospital, doctors who order a CT scan or other imaging study must list the reason. A computer program feeds back an \"appropriateness score.\" A low score indicates the test is unlikely to be necessary.\n\n\"Our experience over the last five years has been rather phenomenal,\" Thrall says. Instead of an annual growth rate of 12 percent in CT scans, it's now about 1 percent, lower than the hospital's annual growth in patient load. \"That means we're doing fewer scans per person,\" he says.\n\nTo cut down on unnecessarily high radiation doses, Thrall says, the College of Radiology is also developing an \"alarm\" system that will alert hospitals when their CT scan exceeds an acceptable dose. That will require hospitals to feed dose data to a central computer run by the radiology group.\n\nIn the long run, experts say, newer-generation CT scanners will come equipped to prevent excessive radiation doses. But it will take a while for thousands of current machines to be replaced.\n\nThrall doesn't agree with the National Cancer Institute's projection of 29,000 excess cancer deaths a year from CT radiation.\n\n\"I think it's almost undoubtedly less than 29,000,\" he says. \"But in one respect, it doesn't matter whether it's 29,000 or 1,000.

Available methods for men include condoms, vasectomies and withdrawal.\n\nBetter birth control options are needed for men. In 2012, 40 percent of all pregnancies worldwide were unintended, according to the Guttmacher Institute.\n\n\"The study found it is possible to have a hormonal contraceptive for men that reduces the risk of unplanned pregnancies in the partners of men who use it,\" said one of the study's authors, Mario Philip Reyes Festin, MD, of the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland. \"Our findings confirmed the efficacy of this contraceptive method previously seen in small studies.\"\n\nThe prospective Phase II single arm, multi-center study tested the safety and effectiveness of injectable contraceptives in 320 healthy men ages 18 to 45. The participants had all been in monogamous relationships with female partners between the ages of 18 and 38 for at least a year. The men underwent testing to ensure they had a normal sperm count at the start of the study.\n\nThe men received injections of 200 milligrams of a long-acting progestogen called norethisterone enanthate (NET-EN) and 1,000 milligrams of a long-acting androgen called testosterone undecanoate (TU) for up to 26 weeks to suppress their sperm counts. Healthcare professionals gave the men two injections every eight weeks. Participants initially provided semen samples after eight and 12 weeks in the suppression phase and then every 2 weeks until they met the criteria for the next phase. During this time, the couples were instructed to use other non-hormonal birth control methods.\n\nOnce a participant's sperm count was lowered to less than 1 million/ml in two consecutive tests, the couple was asked to rely on the injections for birth control. During this period known as the efficacy phase of the study, the men continued to receive injections every eight weeks for up to 56 weeks. Participants provided semen samples every eight weeks to ensure their sperm counts stayed low. Once the participants stopped receiving the injections, they were monitored to see how quickly their sperm counts recovered.\n\nThe hormones were effective in reducing the sperm count to 1 million/ml or less within 24 weeks in 274 of the participants. The contraceptive method was effective in nearly 96 percent of continuing users. Only four pregnancies occurred among the men's partners during the efficacy phase of the study.\n\nResearchers stopped enrolling new participants in the study in 2011 due to the rate of adverse events, particularly depression and other mood disorders, reported by the participants. The men reported side effects including injection site pain, muscle pain, increased libido and acne. Twenty men dropped out of the study due to side effects.\n\nDespite the adverse effects, more than 75 percent of participants reported being willing to use this method of contraception at the conclusion of the trial.\n\nOf the 1,491 reported adverse events, nearly 39 percent were found to be unrelated to the contraceptive injections. These included one death by suicide which was assessed not to be related to the use of the drug. Serious adverse events that were assessed as probably or possibly related to the study included one case of depression, one intentional overdose of acetaminophen, and a man who experienced an abnormally fast and irregular heartbeat after he stopped receiving the injections.\n\n\"More research is needed to advance this concept to the point that it can be made widely available to men as a method of contraception,\" Festin said. \"Although the injections were effective in reducing the rate of pregnancy, the combination of hormones needs to be studied more to consider a good balance between efficacy and safety.\"\n\nThe study, \"Efficacy and Safety of an Injectable Combination Hormonal Contraceptive for Men,\" will be published online at http://press. , ahead of print.\n\nOther authors of the study include: Hermann M.

But in some individuals too many platelets are produced \u2013 a condition known as thrombocytosis, thought to affect about half a million people in the UK over the age of 40.\n\nResearchers say that raised platelet counts are as good a predictor of getting any cancer as a lump in the breast is for breast cancer.\n\n\u201cThis is a clue which can be used in practice by GPs to help them select patients for further investigation \u2026 most excitingly in some patients who may not already have other symptoms of cancer to achieve earlier diagnosis,\u201d said Sarah Bailey, co-author of the research from the University of Exeter.\n\nPrevious studies have suggested a link between thrombocytosis and various cancers, with recent guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence advising high platelet counts could be a sign of cancer of the oesophageal, stomach, lung or uterus.\n\nBut it remained unclear whether the condition could signal an increased risk of all cancers, and how it ties in with factors such as age and sex.\n\nWriting in the British Journal of General Practice, Bailey and colleagues report how they examined data from almost 50,000 individuals aged 40 or over who had been given a blood test by their GP. The patients were selected at random from a national database.\n\nIn total, over 31,000 patients found to have a raised platelet count, and nearly 8,000 without, were included in the analysis.\n\nWithin a year of the blood test, the team found that cancer was more common among those who had thrombocytosis: 11.6% of men and 6.2% of women were found to have cancer compared to 4.1% of men and 2.2% of women without a raised platelet count. In the general population about 1% of individuals over the age of 40 develop cancer each year.\n\nFor comparison, among women aged between 50 and 59 who have discovered a breast lump, the proportion who are found to have breast cancer is 8.5%.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe found cancer was more commonly diagnosed in men with raised platelet counts than it was in women with raised platelet counts and we believe that is because there are more causes of raised platelet counts in women that are not cancer,\u201d said Bailey.\n\nThe team add that cancer was more common among for those who had thrombocytosis for longer. Of the men who had a raised platelet count of the same value or higher six months after being diagnosed with thrombocytosis, 18.1% developed cancer, while for women the figure was 10.1%.\n\nWhile many different types of cancer were present in both groups, the team found that breast and prostate cancers were less common among those with thrombocytosis than in the general population, while lung and colorectal cancers were more common.\n\nFor about a third of cases of lung and colorectal cancer in patients with thrombocytosis, there had been no other symptoms that raised the suggestion of cancer. That, say the researchers, makes testing for raised platelet count a valuable tool, and could speed up cancer diagnosis by at least three months for thousands of patients a year.\n\nRichard Neal, professor of primary care oncology at the University of Leeds who was not involved in the research, welcomed the study.\n\n\u201cThis is an excellent study that demonstrates the potential for a commonly used blood test to identify some patients with cancer earlier,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis work should begin to change practice, so that GPs should be testing patients with raised platelet counts for cancer, especially those without other potential cancer symptoms,\u201d he added.\n\nDr Jasmine Just, Cancer Research UK\u2019s health information officer, said more research was need to confirm whether further tests following a high platelet count would save lives.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of possible reasons a person\u2019s platelet count might be high, and in most cases it won\u2019t be down to cancer,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cMeasuring platelet count in patients who don\u2019t otherwise warrant a blood test is not necessarily a good idea.

Previously, the cancer society had recommended yearly screenings starting at age 40.\n\nThe American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBS) subsequently changed its guidelines to mirror the new cancer society recommendation, Plichta said.

But they also recommend that patients seek the best colonoscopists by, for example, asking pointed questions about how many polyps they find and remove. They also say patients should be scrupulous in the unpleasant bowel cleansing that precedes the test, and promptly report symptoms like bleeding even if they occur soon after a colonoscopy.\n\nThe American Cancer Society says that even if the test is less effective than many had believed, it has no plans to change its recommended intervals between screenings \u2014 the test still prevents most cancers, but the expense and risk of the test argue against doing it more often.\n\nThe cancer society and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also are focusing on developing measurements of quality so that doctors who do colonoscopies can assess themselves and improve.\n\nBut gastroenterologists say that, if nothing else, the study points up the paucity of evidence for the common suggestion that anyone who had a clean bill of health from a colonoscopy is almost totally protected for at least a decade.\n\n\u201cWe have to not overpromise,\u201d said Dr. Ransohoff, who wrote an editorial accompanying the colonoscopy paper. \u201cWe need to look at the evidence, and we shouldn\u2019t go beyond it.\u201d\n\nThe new study matched each of 10,292 people who died of colon cancer to five people who lived in the same area and were of the same age, sex and socioeconomic status. The researchers asked how many patients and control subjects had had colonoscopies and whether the doctors had removed polyps. Then the researchers compared the groups and asked how much the colon cancer death rate had declined in people who had had the screening test.\n\nThe results were \u201ca shock,\u201d said Dr. Nancy N. Baxter, the lead author of the paper and a colorectal surgeon at the University of Toronto. When she saw them, she said, \u201cI asked my analyst to rerun the data.\u201d\n\nNow, researchers say, the challenge is to find out why the test missed so many cancers, in particular, those on the right side of the colon, and whether the problem can be fixed.\n\nAbout 148,000 people will learn they have colon cancer this year, the American Cancer Society reports, and nearly 50,000 will die of it.\n\nIt might be that Canadian doctors were not sufficiently skilled. About a third of the colonoscopies were done by general internists and family practitioners who might not have had the experience to do the test well.\n\nBut, said Dr. Douglas K. Rex, director of endoscopy and professor of medicine at Indiana University, that cannot be the entire explanation because at least one study, as yet unpublished, involving California Medi-Cal patients also found the test missed many cancers on the right side of the colon.\n\nThat leaves several other possibilities.\n\nPerhaps patients did not sufficiently cleanse their bowels of fecal material, a particular problem for the right side of the colon.\n\n\u201cAfter the prep has been completed, mucus and intestinal secretions start rolling out of the small intestine and colon,\u201d Dr. Rex explained. The secretions, he added, pour from the base of the appendix into the right side of the colon and are \u201cvery sticky\u201d and can obscure polyps.\n\nOne solution, supported by six studies, is to be sure there is just a short time between when patients finish taking the strong laxative that cleanses their bowel and the colonoscopy, Dr. Rex said. That usually means taking half of the laxative the night before the screening test and the rest in the morning, something that often is not done, he added, but that he and others recommend.\n\nCancer may also be different in the right colon, researchers said.\n\nFlat and indented polyps tend to cluster in the right colon. And so do another kind, serrated lesions, which, some studies indicate, might turn into cancer much more quickly than typical polyps.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that we will never get as good a result\u201d in the right colon, said Robert Smith, director of screening for the American Cancer Society.\n\nStill, he said, that does not mean that patients should have more frequent colonoscopies. The tests are \u201chugely expensive,\u201d he said, and insurers may not pay for more frequent colonoscopies. The test also carries a small risk of perforating the bowel. Even if colonoscopies miss some cancers, colon cancer remains a rare disease and, after a colonoscopy, \u201cthe likelihood that you have cancer is very, very low,\u201d Dr. Smith said.\n\nDr. Harold C. Sox, editor of the Annals of Internal Medicine, is choosing another option. He is having a stool test, the fecal occult blood test, between colonoscopies. It looks for blood in the stool, which can arise from colon cancer.\n\nDr. Smith does not advocate that strategy, saying that the stool test can have false positives from things like red meat or broccoli that have nothing to do with colon cancer. He worries that frequent stool tests will lead to frequent false alarms and frequent colonoscopies without making much of a dent in the colon cancer death rate.\n\nCT colonoscopies, so-called virtual colonoscopies, are not a solution, some screening experts said.\n\n\u201cThe issues are prep quality, flat lesions, serrated lesions and people not being careful enough in the inspection process,\u201d Dr. Rex said. There is no evidence, he added, that a virtual colonoscopy will help with the inspection process. And, he said, \u201cit almost certainly is not as effective a technology as colonoscopy for flat and serrated lesions.\u201d\n\nInstead, patients should be compulsive about their bowel prep and be sure the test is done by one of the best colonoscopists in their area, gastroenterologists said. Doctors should find polyps in at least 25 percent of men and 15 percent of women. They should take at least eight minutes to withdraw an endoscope from the colon. And they should do a high volume of screening. Dr. Smith said a high volume was at least three or four colonoscopies a day.\n\nAfter the test, patients can ask whether the doctor got to the right side of the colon and how that was documented.\n\nColon cancer experts said people should realize that even if colonoscopies prevent just 60 percent of colon cancer deaths, that still is a lot. Mammograms, for example, prevent 25 percent of breast cancer deaths, and the PSA test for men has not been shown to prevent prostate cancer deaths.\n\n\u201cIf I was to provide one main message, it would be that colonoscopies are the way that colon cancer mortality gets reduced,\u201d Dr. Ransohoff said. \u201cColonoscopy is a good test, but it isn\u2019t completely effective.

But the authors of a new study believe giving it early may slow and even reverse some disease-related disability.\n\n\"The expectation in MS has always been to try to slow down the progression of the disease. Now we can tell our patients that a significant number can actually improve by reversing their disability,\" said lead researcher Dr. Gavin Giovannoni. He is a neurology professor at Queen Mary University of London in England.\n\nThe treatment is not without its downsides, however. Because of the potential for side effects, people who received this treatment have to undergo monthly blood and urine tests for four years after the last dose, Giovannoni said.\n\nGiovannoni described Lemtrada as an immune system \"rebooter.\" First, it depletes the immune system, then it allows it to recover, he explained.\n\nDuring the time when the immune system is depleted, there is a risk of infection over eight to 12 weeks, including herpes infections, he said.\n\nAlso, when the immune system rebuilds itself, \"a significant number of people, about 40 percent, will develop another autoimmune disease,\" Giovannoni said. These include Graves' disease (a thyroid disorder) and a bleeding/bruising disorder called idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), which occurs in about 2 percent of patients, he noted.\n\n\"But these diseases can be treated, so it's not like MS. It's kind of trading in your MS for another autoimmune disease,\" Giovannoni said.\n\nStill, one MS specialist who reviewed the new study said patients need to be cautious about taking the drug.\n\nLemtrada is not for every patient with MS and the decision to use it should be carefully considered, said Dr. Dhanashri Miskin, an attending neurologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\n\"Although the safety profile is generally manageable for the right patient, risks probably outweigh benefits in patients with mild or early stage disease,\" Miskin said.\n\nThe decision to start Lemtrada should be made in the context of the risks, including infusion-associated reactions, infections, and autoimmune adverse events, she said. \"Although alemtuzumab [Lemtrada] treatment is associated with safety risks, those risks are manageable in most patients,\" Miskin said.\n\nThe new trial of more than 600 patients with relapsing-remitting MS was funded by Sanofi Genzyme and Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, the drug's makers.\n\nMS occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the protective sheath around nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. People can suffer muscle weakness, numbness, vision problems and difficulty with balance and coordination. Relapsing-remitting MS is the most common type, with symptoms suddenly worsening and then going into remission.\n\nFor this study, Giovannoni and colleagues treated 628 patients with relapsing-remitting MS who had not responded to at least one other MS drug. Lemtrada was given to 426 patients, while 202 received another drug, interferon beta-1a.\n\nThe researchers assessed disability levels at the start of the study and every three months for two years. By the study's end, nearly 28 percent of those given Lemtrada had improved by at least one point on a 10-point disability test, versus about 15 percent of those receiving interferon, the researchers found.\n\nMoreover, patients receiving Lemtrada were 2.5 times more likely to have their thinking skills improve compared to those given interferon. And they were more than twice as likely to see improvement in their ability to move without tremor or clumsiness, the findings showed.\n\nThe findings held after researchers adjusted the results to make sure the gains weren't led by those recovering from relapses.\n\nGiovannoni believes the drug could offer real relief from MS symptoms. Not only does alemtuzumab improve disability, but most patients go into long-term remission of at least five to eight years, he said.\n\n\"Some patients have been going 12 years without any evidence of disease activity,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Bruce Bebo, executive vice president for research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, \"Restoring lost function is a significant unmet need for people living with MS.\"\n\nThis study examines previous findings related to the reversal of some disability in those receiving alemtuzumab, he said. \"I am encouraged by these results and urge others to pursue potentially restorative approaches to treatment,\" Bebo said.\n\nGiovannoni pointed out that most of the drug's benefits are obtained early in the disease. \"If you really want this drug to have a big impact, you should use it as early as possible.

In both test groups, only about 3 percent of the people had heart attacks, suffered \"major\" complications, needed hospitalization for chest pain or died during two years of tracking, researchers found.\n\nWhich prompts a big question: Could the use of stress tests or expensive scans become less frequent for heart patients, replaced by more watchful waiting?\n\n\"We were very pleasantly surprised,\" said Dr. Pamela Douglas, Ursula Geller professor of research in cardiovascular diseases at Duke University, and the study\u2019s lead author.\n\nResults of the federally funded trial \u2014 Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain (PROMISE) \u2014 were presented at the American College of Cardiology\u2019s 64th Annual Scientific Session in San Diego.

The rest took stress tests \u2014 either an exercise electrocardiogram, a stress echocardiography or a nuclear stress test, which uses radioactive dye. Stress tests measure the heart's response to exertion, letting doctors see or hear any disease.\n\n\"The remarkable thing about the study is ... these were quite high-risk patients, but the actual [bad] event rate was very low ...

Taking a statin is a rational way of lowering some of the risks of eating a fatty meal.\u201d\n\nStill, Peter Weissberg, medical director at the British Heart Foundation (BHF) health charity, said Francis\u2019 idea should not be taken too literally.

However, daily intake of tomatoes may give better protection.\" \n\n \n\n Karppi says it's the chemical lycopene that gives tomatoes and other fruits/vegetables their rich red color, that is helping to protect the brain. Tomatoes are particularly high in the powerful antioxidant that acts like a sponge, soaking up rogue molecules called free radicals that if left unchecked can damage cells.\n\nResearchers tested the level of lycopene in the blood of more than 1,000 Finnish men aged 46 to 65, starting in 1991. Scientists then followed the men on average for more than a decade to record the number who had strokes.\n\nThe scientists found that those with the highest levels of lycopene were 55% less likely to have a stroke than those with the lowest amounts in their blood.\n\nThough the study looks promising, experts say that we can't necessarily give all of the credit to lycopene.\n\n\"It's a compelling study and it fits with other data that we have about risk of stroke and vegetable and fruit consumption,\" explains Dr. Daniel Labovitz, director of the Stern Stroke Center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York. \"But it's not proof that if you eat tomatoes you're going to have less risk of stroke.\"\n\nLabovitz also points out that the group of men who had fewer strokes were younger, had lower blood pressure and smoked less than the group more prone to stroke. Though the researchers tried to take these lifestyle factors into account when calculating their findings, it may be that these things influenced the outcomes.\n\nIn other words, perhaps better health habits - not necessarily just the lycopene - lead to fewer strokes.\n\nLycopene has attracted a lot of attention in recent years because it's such a powerful antioxidant. If we don't eat enough lycopene-packed foods, experts suspect too many free radicals get left in the body, damaging blood vessels by helping to form fatty deposits. When these deposits build up, a blockage forms. If that vessel is in the brain, the blockage can cause a stroke.\n\nBut the foods we eat are complex and filled with many nutrients, making it tough to prove what is really providing benefits.\n\n\"Eating tomatoes is a good thing, but we don't know if there is really anything unique about tomatoes apart from other fruits and vegetables that reduce stroke risk,\" explains Dr. Walter Willett, chair of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nTomatoes could contribute to reducing stroke in other ways, Willett says, because they are a good source of potassium, which is known to reduce blood pressure. Elevated blood pressure is major risk factor for stroke.\n\nSo are lycopene packed tomatoes really the magic fruit? It seems the jury is still out, but researchers suggest we eat healthy as they continue to search for answers.\n\n\"This is one more reason to consume fruits and vegetables - at least 5 a day - and it's good to include tomatoes in that mix,\" Willett said.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "There was\u00a0excellent input from independent experts on stroke and nutrition.

The results were presented Monday at the Society of Interventional Radiology's annual meeting, in Los Angeles.\n\n\"Patients overall were able to improve their physical function in the knee after the procedure, and there were no adverse events related to this treatment,\" said lead researcher Dr. Sandeep Bagla.\n\nBagla is director of interventional radiology at the Vascular Institute of Virginia in Woodbridge. Boston Scientific, maker of the microparticles, funded the study.\n\nMuch of the pain that comes from knee arthritis actually stems from inflammation in the lining of the knee joint, also called the synovium, Bagla said. In fact, small blood vessels created by degenerative arthritis feed this inflammation by increasing blood flow to the lining.\n\nTo treat this, Bagla and his colleagues decided to try blocking those tiny blood vessels using microparticles -- spheres about a tenth of a millimeter in size made from a synthetic gel-like material.\n\nThe microparticles are inserted using a catheter run through a pinhole-sized incision, in a procedure that lasts between 45 and 90 minutes, Bagla said.\n\n\"It's an outpatient procedure, and no physical therapy is required before or after this procedure,\" he said.\n\nThe small pilot study -- the first U.S. clinical trial of this procedure -- involved 20 patients with moderate to severe arthritis pain. Only 13 had undergone the procedure by the time of Monday's annual meeting, and only eight had made it to the one-month follow-up, Bagla said.\n\nThose eight patients averaged a 58-point decrease in pain, as measured on a 100-point visual scale used to estimate pain, Bagla said. They started with an average baseline of 72, which means their pain was brought down to manageable levels, he said.\n\nPhysical function of their knee also improved, based on an index used to judge the effects of osteoarthritis, Bagla added.\n\nOverall, the two scales represented an 80 percent improvement in function, the researchers concluded.\n\nBagla said no side effects are expected because the procedure only blocks additional blood flow to the knee, rather than cutting it off altogether.\n\n\"You don't normally have this degree of increased blood supply to this lining. We're not blocking normal blood vessels to the knee or leg or bone or cartilage,\" he said.\n\nFinal results from this clinical trial are expected to be released this summer. Researchers are already kicking off a second, larger trial to better understand how the procedure works and which patients it might benefit, Bagla said.\n\nThey think it will be most appropriate for people between ages 40 and 70 who aren't ready to go through knee replacement, or people who are on chronic pain medication for their knee arthritis, Bagla said.\n\n\"Perhaps we can demonstrate and prove patients do not need to be on these medications and can alternatively go through a minimally invasive procedure like this to reduce their knee pain,\" Bagla said.\n\nDr. Suresh Vedantham, president of the Society of Interventional Radiology, called the new procedure \"very promising,\" given that it focuses on the inflamed knee lining that causes the pain.\n\n\"This therapy is very well-targeted to that particular mechanism, and certainly it should be investigated further,\" said Vedantham, who wasn't involved with the study.

This research builds upon previous studies demonstrating that art, music, and other similar therapies can effectively reduce symptoms of dementia without medication. By using tablet devices to employ these therapies, however, patients and providers also benefit from a computer's inherent flexibility.\n\n\"The biggest advantage is versatility,\" said Vahia. \"We know that art therapy can work, music therapy can work. The tablet, however, gives you the option of switching from one app to another easily, modifying the therapy seamlessly to suit the individual. You don't need to invest in new equipment or infrastructure.\"\n\nResearchers loaded a menu of 70 apps onto the tablets for the study. The apps were freely available on iTunes and varied greatly in their cognitive complexity--from an app that displayed puppy photos to one that featured Sudoku puzzles.\n\nThe researchers found that tablet use was safe for every patient, regardless of the severity of their dementia, and that with proper supervision and training, the engagement rate with the devices was nearly 100 percent. The study also found that the tablets demonstrated significant effectiveness in reducing symptoms of agitation, particularly--but not exclusively--among patients with milder forms of dementia.\n\nVahia cited several examples of the tablet's potential to improve a patient's condition. One particular patient, who only spoke Romanian, was very withdrawn and irritable, and medications were ineffective in controlling his symptoms.\n\n\"We started showing him Romanian video clips on YouTube, and his behavior changed dramatically and instantaneously,\" said Vahia. \"His mood improved. He became more interactive. He and his medical support team also started using a translation app so that staff could ask him simple questions in Romanian, facilitating increased interaction. These significant improvements are a clear testament of the tablet's potential as a clinical tool.\"\n\nBased on such promising outcomes, the Geriatric Psychiatry Outpatient Services clinical team is expanding the use of tablet devices as a means to control agitation in dementia patients at McLean.

Scientists are hard at work trying to determine how and why that\u2019s that case, as well as which bacteria are beneficial\u2014and how to protect them. A recent study published in adds to the growing evidence that fiber might be a critical gut-nourishing nutrient. (Unfortunately, less than 3% of Americans eat the government-recommended amount daily.)\n\n\u201cYou really hold the reins to guiding this community [of bacteria] through the choices you make,\u201d says Justin L. Sonnenburg, PhD, associate professor in the department of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University School of Medicine and author of . Sonnenburg was not involved with this study, but research from his lab also suggests that fiber plays a big role in promoting good bacteria.\n\nThe authors of the new study wanted to look at what changes in diet do to one particular gut microbe species: a strain that\u2019s been associated with leanness and better glucose tolerance in mice. They wrangled a group of 49 overweight and obese adults, took stool and blood samples and asked them to follow a six-week calorie-restricted diet (between 1,500-1,800 calories per day) while increasing their fiber intake. The diet was followed by six weeks of eating normally. They kept a food journal throughout, and the researchers biopsied their fat tissue.\n\nThe people who had more in their gut from the very start had better clinical measures after they completed the diet, compared to the people with less of the bacterium. Both groups of people lost the same amount of weight, but the high- group had a stronger decrease in visceral fat than the others, says study author Patrice D. Cani, PhD, professor and group leader of the Metabolism and Nutrition Research Group at Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain in Belgium. \u201cWe discovered that the patients who exhibited higher amounts of were the patients who had a very strong improvement in cholesterol, in glycemia, in waist to hip ratio and also a reduction in different parameters in both cardiovascular disease and risk factors.\u201d\n\nHigher levels of , the findings suggest, seem to have favorable effects on health.\n\nThe good news is that your initial levels are not your fate. People who started out with lower stores of had more after they followed the fiber-rich calorie-restricted diet. You can increase these bacterial populations by eating fiber, Cani\u2019s research suggests, which acts as a prebiotic in the gut and has a beneficial effect on some bacteria.\n\nNow, Cani says he is working on an experiment with obese and diabetic patients to administer alone, without any dietary modifications, to see what effect it has on insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease risk factors. \u201cIf we can improve these different parameters, that would be something great,\u201d he says.\n\nHere\u2019s why fiber is so important to intestinal flora: your gut microbes feed on it and produce short-chain fatty acids, which get absorbed into the bloodstream and regulate the immune system and attenuate inflammation, Sonnenburg says. \u201cThat means if you\u2019re not eating dietary fiber, your immune system may be existing in kind of a simmering pro-inflammatory state,\u201d he says\u2014the very state that predisposes us to different Western diseases. \u201cOur diet and deteriorated microbiota are really a major piece of the puzzle in trying to understand why Western diseases are rising like crazy.\u201d\n\nSonnenburg says that when researchers try on mice what many of us do on a regular basis\u2014eat food depleted of dietary fiber\u2014their gut microbes behave erratically. \u201cThey turn and start eating the mucus lining of the intestine,\u201d says Sonnenburg, \u201cbecause that\u2019s also a carbohydrate source and it\u2019s kind of a fallback food for them.\u201d In mice on a low-fiber diet, the mucus lining thins to about half of its normal width, he says. It\u2019s so far unclear whether the same thing happens in humans, but Sonnenburg thinks it might. \u201cWe start to see these correlates that we think over the course of decades in a human could lead to something problematic,\u201d he says.\n\nLoading up on fiber-fortified processed foods isn\u2019t likely a good way to increase the kind of fiber that benefits the gut. Studies done on single fibers\u2014those, like inulin, which are added to foods\u2014haven\u2019t shown to have the same effects as fiber that occur naturally in whole foods. \u201cAll of the vegetables we\u2019re encouraged to eat by our mothers and by the government guidelines, these are all filled with fiber, and filled with a diversity of fiber, and probably the best route for encouraging a diverse microbiota,\u201d Sonnenburg says.\n\nNuts, seeds, whole grains, legumes and even dark chocolate are high in fiber\u2014as are vegetables. \u201cYou can eat massive amounts of plant material and it can be incredibly good for you, you can feel really satisfied and full,\u201d Sonnenburg says. \u201cI find that a really nice way to eat\u2014just kind of gorging myself on plant material.\u201d", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story includes one source who was not affiliated with the relevant study, but makes clear that the source is a vocal proponent of the idea that a high-fiber diet is important for maintaining a \u201chealthy\u201d gut microbiome and that the microbiome can have a significant impact on health.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Dr. Eric P. Winer, chief of women\u2019s cancers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said that even women who completed their five years of tamoxifen months or years ago might consider starting on the drug again.\n\nTamoxifen blocks the effect of the hormone estrogen, which fuels tumor growth in estrogen receptor-positive cancers that account for about 65 percent of cases in premenopausal women. Some small studies in the 1990s suggested that there was no benefit to using tamoxifen longer than five years, so that has been the standard.\n\nAbout 227,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year in the United States, and an estimated 30,000 of them are in premenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive cancer and prime candidates for tamoxifen. But postmenopausal women also take tamoxifen if they cannot tolerate the alternative drugs, known as aromatase inhibitors.\n\nThe new study, known as Atlas, included nearly 7,000 women with ER-positive disease who had completed five years of tamoxifen. They came from about three dozen countries. Half were chosen at random to take the drug another five years, while the others were told to stop.\n\nIn the group assigned to take tamoxifen for 10 years, 21.4 percent had a recurrence of breast cancer in the ensuing 10 years, meaning the period 5 to 14 years after their diagnoses. The recurrence rate for those who took only five years of tamoxifen was 25.1 percent.\n\nAbout 12.2 percent of those in the 10-year treatment group died from breast cancer, compared with 15 percent for those in the control group.\n\nThere was virtually no difference in death and recurrence between the two groups during the five years of extra tamoxifen. The difference came in later years, suggesting that tamoxifen has a carry-over effect that lasts long after women stop taking it.\n\nWhether these differences are big enough to cause women to take the drug for twice as long remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cThe treatment effect is real, but it\u2019s modest,\u201d said Dr. Paul E. Goss, director of breast cancer research at the Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nTamoxifen has side effects, including endometrial cancer, blood clots and hot flashes, which cause many women to stop taking the drug. In the Atlas trial, it appears that roughly 40 percent of the patients assigned to take tamoxifen for the additional five years stopped prematurely.\n\nSome 3.1 percent of those taking the extra five years of tamoxifen got endometrial cancer versus 1.6 percent in the control group. However, only 0.6 percent of those in the longer treatment group died from endometrial cancer or pulmonary blood clots, compared with 0.4 percent in the control group.\n\n\u201cOver all, the benefits of extended tamoxifen seemed to outweigh the risks substantially,\u201d Trevor J. Powles of the Cancer Center London, said in a commentary published by The Lancet.\n\nDr. Judy E. Garber, director of the Center for Cancer Genetics and Prevention at Dana-Farber, said many women have a love-hate relationship with hormone therapies.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t feel well on them, but it\u2019s their safety net,\u201d said Dr. Garber, who added that the news would be welcomed by many patients who would like to stay on the drug. \u201cI have patients who agonize about this, people who are coming to the end of their tamoxifen.\u201d\n\nEmily Behrend, who is a few months from finishing her five years on tamoxifen, said she would definitely consider another five years. \u201cIf it can keep the cancer away, I\u2019m all for it,\u201d said Ms. Behrend, 39, a single mother in Tomball, Tex.

Even many women who are premenopausal at the time of diagnosis will pass through menopause by the time they finish their first five years of tamoxifen, or will have been pushed into menopause by chemotherapy.\n\nPostmenopausal patients tend to take aromatase inhibitors like anastrozole or letrozole, which are more effective than tamoxifen at preventing breast cancer recurrence, though they do not work for premenopausal women.\n\nMr. Peto said he thought the results of the Atlas study would \u201capply to endocrine therapy in general,\u201d meaning that 10 years of an aromatase inhibitor would be better than five years.

Hands-only CPR is simpler and easier to remember and removes a big barrier for people skittish about the mouth-to-mouth breathing.\n\n\"You only have to do two things. Call 911 and push hard and fast on the middle of the person's chest,\" said Dr. Michael Sayre, an emergency medicine professor at Ohio State University who headed the committee that made the recommendation.\n\nHands-only CPR calls for uninterrupted chest presses - 100 a minute - until paramedics take over or an automated external defibrillator is available to restore a normal heart rhythm.\n\nThis action should be taken only for adults who unexpectedly collapse, stop breathing and are unresponsive. The odds are that the person is having cardiac arrest - the heart suddenly stops - which can occur after a heart attack or be caused by other heart problems. In such a case, the victim still has ample air in the lungs and blood and compressions keep blood flowing to the brain, heart and other organs.\n\nA child who collapses is more likely to primarily have breathing problems - and in that case, mouth-to-mouth breathing should be used. That also applies to adults who suffer lack of oxygen from a near-drowning, drug overdose, or carbon monoxide poisoning. In these cases, people need mouth-to-mouth to get air into their lungs and bloodstream.\n\nBut in either case, \"Something is better than nothing,\" Sayre said.\n\nThe CPR guidelines had been inching toward compression-only. The last update, in 2005, put more emphasis on chest pushes by alternating 30 presses with two quick breaths; those \"unable or unwilling\" to do the breaths could do presses alone.\n\nNow the heart association has given equal standing to hands-only CPR. Those who have been trained in traditional cardiopulmonary resuscitation can still opt to use it.\n\nSayre said the association took the unusual step of making the changes now - the next update wasn't due until 2010 - because three studies last year showed hands-only was as good as traditional CPR. Hands-only will be added to CPR training.\n\nAn estimated 310,000 Americans die each year of cardiac arrest outside hospitals or in emergency rooms. Only about 6 percent of those who are stricken outside a hospital survive, although rates vary by location. People who quickly get CPR while awaiting medical treatment have double or triple the chance of surviving. But less than a third of victims get this essential help.\n\nDr. Gordon Ewy, who's been pushing for hands-only CPR for 15 years, said he was \"dancing in the streets\" over the heart association's change even though he doesn't think it goes far enough. Ewy (pronounced AY-vee) is director of the University of Arizona Sarver Heart Center in Tucson, where the compression-only technique was pioneered.\n\nEwy said there's no point to giving early breaths in the case of sudden cardiac arrest, and it takes too long to stop compressions to give two breaths - 16 seconds for the average person. He noted that victims often gasp periodically anyway, drawing in a little air on their own.\n\nAnonymous surveys show that people are reluctant to do mouth-to-mouth, Ewy said, partly because of fear of infections.\n\n\"When people are honest, they're not going to do it,\" he said. \"It's not only the yuck factor.\"\n\nIn recent years, emergency service dispatchers have been coaching callers in hands-only CPR rather than telling them how to alternate breaths and compressions.\n\n\"They love it. It's less complicated and the outcomes are better,\" said Dallas emergency medical services chief Dr. Paul Pepe, who also chairs emergency medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.\n\nOne person who's been spreading the word about hands-only CPR is Temecula, Calif., chiropractor Jared Hjelmstad, who helped save the life of a fellow health club member in Southern California\n\nHjelmstad, 40, had read about it in a medical journal and used it on Garth Goodall, who collapsed while working out at their gym in February. Hjelmstad's 15-year-old son Josh called 911 in the meantime.\n\nHjelmstad said he pumped on Goodall's chest for more than 12 minutes - encouraged by Goodall's intermittent gasps - until paramedics arrived. He was thrilled to find out the next day that Goodall had survived.\n\nOn Sunday, he visited Goodall in the hospital where he is recovering from triple bypass surgery.\n\n\"After this whole thing happened, I was on cloud nine,\" said Hjelmstad. \"I was just fortunate enough to be there.\"\n\nGoodall, a 49-year-old construction contractor, said he had been healthy and fit before the collapse, and there'd been no hint that he had clogged heart arteries.\n\n\"I was lucky,\" he said.

IsoPSA proved significantly superior to PSA in two key indications: discriminating between prostate cancer and benign conditions; and identifying patients with high-grade disease. The former indication is potentially useful for using IsoPSA for screening by primary care physicians, while the second is helpful for urologists in identifying patients who would benefit from curative intent therapy and other applications.\n\nThe results show that if validated and adopted clinically, IsoPSA could significantly reduce the rate of unnecessary biopsies by almost 50 percent. \"The methodology used in the IsoPSA assay represents a significant departure from conventional ways to define biomarkers in blood, and may be applicable to improving other cancer biomarkers,\" said Dr. Klein.\n\n\"Due to its inherent simplicity, requiring only a blood draw and presenting information to the physician in familiar context using a single number - just like PSA itself - we are quite hopeful in IsoPSA's future utility after further validation studies,\" said Mark Stovsky, M.D., co-author and staff member, Cleveland Clinic Glickman Urological & Kidney Institute.\n\nThe IsoPSA test was developed by Cleveland Diagnostics, a company co-founded by Cleveland Clinic, in which it has financial interest.

But a new study suggests these drugs may also help keep dementia at bay.\n\nThe researchers said that the key is to start blood thinners, such as warfarin, soon after atrial fibrillation is diagnosed. That's true even for people at low risk of a stroke who wouldn't normally be given blood thinners.\n\n\"We found that people who are on warfarin -- the most common blood thinner used to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation -- experienced very low rates of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease,\" said lead researcher Dr. T. Jared Bunch. He's director of heart rhythm research at Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute in Murray, Utah.\n\nAtrial fibrillation is a common heart abnormality that affects nearly 3 million American adults. It causes the heart to beat abnormally or quiver. This causes blood to pool, and then it can clot.\n\nAtrial fibrillation can cause dementia by damaging tiny blood vessels in the brain through repeated tiny clots or small bleeds that people aren't even aware of, Bunch explained.\n\nWhile many patients are initially given aspirin, Bunch said aspirin's benefit in cutting the risk for dementia is limited, and patients should be started on warfarin or another blood thinner.\n\nAlthough the study looked at patients taking warfarin (Coumadin), newer drugs -- including rivaroxaban (Xarelto) and apixaban (Eliquis) -- should reduce the risk of dementia even more, Bunch said.\n\nIn patients with atrial fibrillation, the risk of stroke is usually measured using the so-called CHADS score, the researchers said. This score assigns points for several risk factors, such as age, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes and a previous stroke.\n\nA score of zero to one usually means blood thinners aren't needed because the risk for stroke is low. For patients with scores above one, blood thinners are considered necessary, as these patients are judged to be at moderate to high risk, according to the researchers.\n\nIn this study, however, the investigators said they found that even a short delay in giving blood thinners to patients at low risk for stroke increases the risk for dementia.\n\nIn patients considered at low-risk for stroke, delaying blood-thinning treatment increased the risk for dementia 30 percent. In high-risk patients, a delay increased the risk 136 percent, the researchers reported.\n\nThe longer the delay in giving blood thinners, the more the risk for dementia, the researchers said.\n\nFor the study, Bunch and his colleagues looked at information from more than 76,000 atrial fibrillation patients who had no history of dementia. The average age of the study participants was 69, and 57 percent were male. The researchers looked at when treatment began: either within 30 days of atrial fibrillation diagnosis, which was considered immediate; or after a year, which was considered delayed.\n\n\"Once you are diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, starting stroke-prevention strategies immediately is essential. We shouldn't wait longer than a month to begin treatment,\" Bunch said. \"The delay in treating can be devastating to patients when they start developing mental decline years later,\" he added.\n\nThe results of the study were scheduled for presentation Friday at the meeting of the Heart Rhythm Society in Chicago. Findings presented at meetings are generally viewed as preliminary until they've been published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nAccording to Dr. Byron Lee of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), \"There is a growing body of literature supporting the connection between atrial fibrillation and dementia.\" Lee is a professor of medicine and director of the electrophysiology laboratories and clinics at UCSF.\n\n\"Therefore,\" he said, \"we need to be extremely aggressive in treating atrial fibrillation patients with anticoagulants [blood thinners] when indicated.

A mere sip would leave her vomiting and gasping for breath. If she were even touched by someone with milk on their hands, she would break out in hives and a bright red rash.\n\n\"We just had to keep her away from milk,\" said Reagan's mother, Lissa. \"We couldn't have it around the house. At preschool she had to sit by herself. We brought her food to birthday parties. We couldn't go to restaurants. It was very hard.\"\n\nToday, however, Reagan, 9, of Ellicott City, can drink as much milk as she wants and eat anything.\n\n\"She eats ice cream. She eats cheese. She eats yogurt. She drinks chocolate milk. She eats any food anybody else can,\" Lissa Roberts said. \"It's a miracle.\"\n\nReagan is one of a small number of children who have undergone an experimental treatment that is showing promise for treating milk, peanut and other food allergies. The approach, known as oral immunotherapy, involves slowly desensitizing the immune system by painstakingly ingesting increasing amounts of whatever triggers the reaction.\n\n\"It's pretty encouraging,\" said Robert A. Wood, chief of pediatric allergy and immunology at Johns Hopkins, who led the study that Reagan participated in at the Hopkins Children's Center in Baltimore. \"We've still got a long way to go, but I never thought we'd get this far.\"\n\nAlthough the approach appears to be highly effective for some children with milk and peanut allergies, the researchers conducting the studies and others caution that much more research is needed to prove and perfect the approach and that it is far from ready for widespread use. No one should try the approach on his own, because the treatments themselves can trigger potentially life-threatening reactions.\n\n\"It's still very investigational,\" said Wesley Burks, chief of the division of pediatric allergy and immunology at Duke University, who has produced promising results in children with peanut allergies. \"We're very hopeful. But there are lot of things we need to do to understand it better, make it more effective and make sure it's safe.\"\n\nThe strategy is being tested in a handful of small studies that are part of a surge of research in a field that for years showed little progress.\n\n\"There's been a substantial uptick in the amount of research,\" said Marshall Plaut of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which has more than doubled the funding for food-allergy research since 2007. \"I think it's time to be cautiously optimistic.\"\n\nIn addition to the oral immunotherapy studies, scientists are in the early stages of testing an experimental suppository, a Chinese herbal remedy and variations of oral immunotherapy that might be safer and more effective.\n\n\"There's definitely been a spike in the amount of work going on,\" said Hugh A. Sampson, a professor of pediatrics, allergy and immunology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York who leads a federally funded consortium studying food allergies. \"Five years ago there was almost nothing going on in people with respect to therapies, whereas now there are a variety of different therapies being looked at.\"\n\nThe spike in research has been driven by increasing evidence that food allergies are becoming more common, occurring earlier in life and lasting longer. About 12 million Americans are estimated to suffer from food allergies, including about 3 million children. Some evidence suggests that peanut allergies may have doubled in children in the past decade.\n\nThe reason for the trend is the subject of intense research and debate. There are several theories, including changes in how food is processed and children's not being exposed to certain foods early in life. Evidence has also been mounting for the \"hygiene hypothesis,\" which blames growing up in increasingly sterile homes, making the immune system overreact to ordinarily harmless substances, including food.\n\nWhatever the cause, researchers have long struggled to develop therapies. Food allergies can trigger symptoms ranging from rashes and hives to responses believed to cause perhaps 200 deaths each year in the United States. Currently, food-allergic people have only two options: to avoid the substance that causes their reaction or to try to stop a reaction with an injection of epinephrine.\n\nThat leaves parents of allergic children scouring food labels, avoiding restaurants, sending their children to school and parties with specially made food and snacks, and still worrying about inadvertent contact with peanuts, milk, eggs and other ubiquitous foods.\n\n\"It's hard to live,\" said Angie Duty of Durham, N.C., whose 9-year-old son, Sam, was intensely allergic to peanuts before undergoing the therapy as part of one Burks's studies. \"Sam doesn't like to be different, but of course he is different and we have to explain that to him.\"\n\nAlthough doctors have long used shots to desensitize people allergic to pollen and other substances, early attempts to do the same for food allergies ended in failure.\n\n\"The side effects were so great that they were as bad if not worse than the disease itself,\" Burks said.\n\nBut a small number of researchers in recent years have begun trying the approach again, this time by orally administering the protein in the food that triggers the allergic reaction.\n\nWith doctors standing by in case of a severe reaction, each study subject undergoes careful testing to determine the maximum dose he or she can safely tolerate. Once that is established, the participants are sent home to sprinkle that amount of purified protein on their food for a week or two; then they return to the research center in to see if the dose can be increased. The procedure is repeated for months or even years to slowly raise the amount they can safely consume.\n\n\"It's a way of sort of rerouting or tricking the immune system to no longer be allergic to that food,\" said Stacie Jones, chief of allergy and immunology at the Arkansas Children's Hospital, who has been working Burks to test the approach for peanut allergies.\n\nIn a study involving 19 children who were severely allergic to milk, Wood found that within four to six months most of the children significantly increased the amount of milk protein they could tolerate. After between about nine months and two years, about half of the children could safely consume as much milk or food containing milk as they wanted.\n\n\"These are children who could have died from a teaspoon of milk before,\" Wood said.\n\nIn March, Burks and Jones reported the results of a pilot study involving 33 children with peanut allergies. The children started by ingesting peanut protein powder equivalent to one one-thousandth of a peanut. Four of the children had to drop out because of allergic reactions, but six of nine children who underwent the treatment for 2 1/2 years have been able to stop the peanut powder and have now gone six to eight months without reacting to eating peanuts. \"It's fabulous,\" said Janet Vande Berg of Durham, N.C., whose 9-year-old daughter, Caroline, can eat peanuts for the first time in her life. \"It makes a huge, huge difference in the quality of life for both the kids and the families. It just takes the stress away.\"\n\nThe researchers are tracking the remaining children in the study to see if any others achieve similar results and have followed up with a more stringent study in which 13 children received a similar treatment and seven received a placebo.\n\nAfter about 10 months, all seven children on the placebo were still allergic, whereas none of the 13 on the peanut powder had reactions when they were challenged. All the children are now receiving the treatment and are being followed to see if they remain desensitized and perhaps become \"tolerant,\" meaning they no longer need to consume daily doses of peanuts or peanut protein to maintain their ability to eat peanuts freely.\n\n\"I think it's an important advance in the field,\" said the NIH's Plaut. \"It's a small number of subjects, so it's hard to draw full-blown conclusions. But it's the first data that suggest you may be able to achieve something like this in food allergies.\"\n\nIt remains far from clear, however, what proportion of children will benefit, how long the benefit might last and what proportion will need to continue to consume at least some milk or peanuts every day to maintain their protection. While some children, such as Vande Berg, appear to completely lose their allergies, others seem to just be able to eat more of the milk or food before reacting. But even that can be helpful.\n\n\"We know this therapy at least protects them from accidental ingestion so they won't have a life-threatening reaction,\" said Jones, the Arkansas researcher. \"At the very least it's providing some security for these families.\"\n\nBurks and Jones are part of the federal consortium, which is studying the same approach for eggs at research institutions across the country, including Johns Hopkins, and conducting detailed immunological studies to try to get a better understanding of how the treatment works.\n\nMeanwhile, researchers in London are studying 640 babies at high risk for food allergies to see if exposing them to peanuts early in life reduces their chances of developing the allergy in the first place.\n\n\"There are a lot of people putting ideas out there and producing some promising preliminary data,\" Plaut said. \"That makes me think there will be some important developments in the future.\"", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "A broad range of experts in the field and a funding agency spokesperson were all quoted as sources of information for this story.\u00a0 ", "answer": 1}, {"article": "MONDAY, April 2, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- A vaccine to prevent breast cancer's return in women with a history of the disease has triggered the desired immune response in early research.\n\nThe vaccine under development is aimed at preventing recurrence in women who have a form of tumor known as HER2-positive, according to researcher Dr. Diane Hale, a research resident in general surgery at Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston, in San Antonio.\n\nShe is set to present results of the study on Monday at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in Chicago.\n\nThe vaccine, known as the \"HER2-based peptide vaccine AE37,\" is designed to harness the power of the patient's immune system, based on its reaction to a cancer-linked peptide (protein).\n\n\"The theory is that once you form that [immune] response to the specific peptide, if the body has a recurrence, it will recognize that cancer as a bad thing, a foreign thing,\" Hale explained in an association news release.\n\nThe study is a phase 2 study, meant to evaluate the vaccine's effectiveness and any side effects. Phase 3 studies are needed before the vaccine could be approved.\n\nThe science is early, Hale stressed, and it will take at least five years before the vaccine could conceivably be available if ongoing studies bear out.\n\nHER2-positive breast cancer tests positive for a protein known as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, or HER2, which promotes the tumor cell growth. About one of every five breast cancers involves cancer cells that churn out an excess of HER2 due to a genetic mutation. HER2-positive breast cancers are often more aggressive than other types, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nThe goal of the vaccine, Hale said, is to educate the body to respond to that HER2-based peptide, so it will recognize the cancer when it recurs and attack it.\n\n\"If your immune system has been educated by the vaccine to recognize the tumor cells, we think it will allow the immune system to take care of any individual [cancer] cells trying to set up shop,\" explained Dr. Elizabeth Mittendorf, a surgical oncologist at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. She is the principal investigator on the trial.\n\nThe study involved 217 breast cancer survivors who had gone through their treatment and were free of disease at the start of the trial. The women were randomly assigned to receive either the vaccine paired with an immune stimulant, or the immune stimulant alone.\n\nThe women received monthly injections for six months. The researchers then conducted a variety of tests to gauge each woman's immune system response.\n\nThe investigators found that in the vaccinated group, 86 percent of patients showed a significant response, compared with 27 percent of those in the \"control\" group who did not get the injection.\n\nHow to explain the 27 percent who responded without the vaccine? \"For the controls, even without having their immune systems 'educated' towards HER2 specifically, they may still mount a response because they have previously seen HER2 within their own cancer,\" Hale said.\n\nThose who were vaccinated also displayed a decrease in certain cells that suppress the immune system. That is a good thing, Hale said, because \"an increase in these cells has been found to be associated with [cancer] recurrence.\"\n\nDon Diamond, director of translational vaccine research and a professor of virology at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., reviewed the findings and said, \"Their approach is well thought out and makes sense.\"\n\nStill, the study remains very preliminary, he cautioned. \"Whether it actually has an increase in survival remains to be seen,\" he said.\n\nThat study will be done, Hale said, and they plan to follow the women for three years and look at survival differences.\n\nBut until the vaccine is linked to an actual survival benefit or improvement in tumor status, Diamond said, no one can say if it helps the patients in a meaningful way.\n\nNumerous vaccines to prevent breast cancer recurrence are currently under study, he noted.\n\nFindings presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nTo learn more about immune-based cancer therapies, visit the American Cancer Society.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The article contained quotes from a different researcher who was very cautious about drawing conclusions from the current study\u2019s findings.\nWe do wonder,\u00a0 though, what it means when the story says that the independent expert \u201creviewed the findings.\u201d\u00a0 What did he review?\u00a0 Since the researcher\u2019s findings hadn\u2019t even been presented yet when the story was written, did the independent observer review the short abstract that appeared in the conference program?\u00a0 Did he have access to a more complete data set or a more complete description of the work?", "answer": 1}, {"article": "July 7, 2010 -- The FDA says it has approved the use of micro-sized implantable telescopes to improve vision in patients with end-stage, age-related macular degeneration.\n\nThe tiny device, called an Implantable Miniature Telescope (IMT), is designed to replace the natural lens.

There are two forms of AMD, a wet form and a dry form.\n\nAbout 8 million people in the U.S. suffer from this condition, and nearly 2 million of them already have significant loss of vision. The device is intended for patients 75 and older with severe to profound vision impairment that has been stable over time due to blind spots from end-stage AMD.\n\n\"This innovation has the potential to provide many people with an improved quality of life,\" Jeffrey Shuren, MD, JD, director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, says in the news release.\n\nThe IMT comes in two models; one model provides 2.2 times magnification and the other 2.7 times. It is designed to magnify and project images onto a healthy portion of the afflicted person's retina. It is intended for use in only one eye because the other eye is used for peripheral vision, the FDA says.\n\nBefore implantation, patients will be trained with an external telescopic device to see if they may benefit from the product. Training would also be needed to verify that there is sufficient peripheral vision in the untreated eye.\n\nThe miniature telescope was developed by VisionCare Ophthalmic Technologies Inc. of Saratoga, Calif.\n\n\"This is truly a breakthrough technology for AMD patients as their treatment options have been limited until now,\" says Kathryn A.

Todd McAllister of Cytograft Tissue Engineering in California and colleagues implanted lab-grown blood vessels into 10 patients with advanced kidney disease in Argentina and Poland from 2004 to 2007.\n\nEarly results for two of these patients were announced in 2005. In 2007, the scientists published preliminary findings for another 4 patients in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nIn this most recent study, published Friday in the medical journal Lancet, scientists reported on the new blood vessels in those same patients and 4 others.\n\nDialysis patients need a vessel, or shunt, to connect them to dialysis machines. This can be made from their own vessels. But because dialysis is done so regularly, kidney patients often run out of healthy vessels and need an artificial one, often made out of gortex. Those are prone to infection and inflammation.\n\nIn the study, doctors took a small snippet of skin from patients. Cells from those samples were grown in a lab, to help them produce proteins like elastin and collagen. From those, scientists made sheets of tissue that were rolled into blood vessels 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 centimeters) long.\n\nThe vessels were finished after 6 to 9 months. All of the vessels were implanted into patients' upper arms, to connect them to dialysis machines.\n\nThe vessels failed in three of the patients, which experts said was not surprising in patients so seriously ill. One other patient withdrew from the study and another died of unrelated causes.\n\nIn the five remaining patients, the vessels worked for at least 6 to 20 months after they were implanted.

In contrast, the historical OS rate with standard of care concurrent chemotherapy and traditional radiation was 16 months at the time when the study was designed.\n\nThe findings are the final results of the single institution, Phase II study and represent the longest follow-up to date of stage 3 lung cancer patients who have received proton therapy, said Joe Y. Chang, M.D., professor, Radiation Oncology and the study's corresponding author.\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women in the U.S. According to the American Cancer Society, more than 222,500 people will be diagnosed and 155,870 will die from the disease in 2017, with the majority of patients still being diagnosed when the disease is in an advanced stage.\n\n\"Advanced lung cancer patients with inoperable disease traditionally have been treated with concurrent chemotherapy and conventional photon radiation therapy. However, the therapy can be very difficult for patients due to associated toxicities and because many patients are also dealing with comorbidities,\" explained Chang.\n\nProton therapy is an advanced type of radiation treatment that uses a beam of protons to deliver radiation directly to the tumor, destroying cancer cells while sparing healthy tissues. Protons enter the body with a low radiation dose and stop at the tumor, matching its shape and volume or depth. They deposit the bulk of their cancer-fighting energy right at the tumor, thereby reducing the dose to cardiopulmonary structures, which impacts the toxicity, functional status, quality of life and even survival for patients, explained Chang.\n\n\"With our study, we hypothesized that proton therapy would offer a survival benefit to patients and reduce treatment-associated toxicities, which can be very serious,\" he said.\n\nThe study opened at MD Anderson in 2006; in this research, Chang and his colleague report on the study's five-year results.\n\nFor the prospective Phase II trial, 64 patients with inoperable, Stage III non-small-cell lung cancer were enrolled. The study's primary endpoint was OS. The researchers hypothesized that the median OS would increase from historical data of 16 months on standard therapy to 24 months. Secondary endpoints included distant metastasis and local and regional recurrence rates. Toxic effects of treatment in both the acute and late settings also were analyzed.\n\nMedian follow up was 27.3 months for all patients, and 79.6 months for alive patients. At five years, the median OS was 26.5 months, and the corresponding five-year OS was 29 percent. Median progression-free survival was 12.9 months, with a five-year progression-free survival of 22 percent.\n\nIn sum, 39 patients experienced a relapse, with distant sites representing 62 percent of all recurrences. Local and regional recurrence rates were low, 16 percent and 14 percent, respectively.\n\nAmong the acute and late toxic effects diagnosed in patients were: esophagitis, pneumonitis and cardiac arrhythmia. Of note, said Chang, no patients developed the most severe, or grade five, toxicities, as seen in patients who receive standard of care.\n\nChang noted his study is not without limitations. Of greatest significance: the study was designed more than a decade ago. While the study's survival, recurrence rates and toxic effects are still favorable when compared to rates associated with the most advanced traditional photon radiation therapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), technology to diagnose and stage the disease, as well all treatment modalities have significantly improved.\n\n\"When the study opened, PET imaging had just been approved for lung cancer staging. The image quality was poor and didn't include a CT component in most facilities across the country,\" said Chang. \"Obviously, the technology has improved dramatically over the last decade and has made a significant impact on diagnosis and staging. Also, delivery of both the conventional intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and proton therapy (IMPT), have improved, thereby reducing side effects for both treatment modalities.\"\n\nFor example, MD Anderson proton therapy patients with advanced lung cancer now can receive IMPT. The technique uses an intricate network of magnets to aim a narrow proton beam at a tumor and \"paint\" the radiation dose onto it layer by layer. Healthy tissue surrounding the tumor is spared, and side effects are even more reduced than earlier proton delivery, said Chang.\n\nChang also noted the advancements in cancer biology and immunotherapy and that both are important areas of research focus in combination with proton therapy.\n\nIn addition to Chang, other authors on the all-MD Anderson study include: Stephen Hahn, M.D., Ritsuko Komaki, M.D., Pamela K.

The women completed questionnaires about their diet every four years for 18 years.\n\nDuring the study period, 405 participants had heart attacks. Women who ate the most blueberries and strawberries were 32 percent less likely to have a heart attack, compared to women who ate berries once a month or less. This held true even among women who ate a diet rich in other fruits and vegetables.\n\nThis benefit was independent of other heart risk factors such as advancing age, high blood pressure, family history of heart attack, body mass index, exercise, smoking, and caffeine and alcohol intake. The findings appear online Jan. 14 in the journal Circulation.\n\nThe study can't say specifically what about the berries seemed to result in a lower risk of heart attack among these women, or that there was a direct cause-and-effect link between eating the berries and lowered heart attack risk. But blueberries and strawberries contain high levels of compounds that may help widen arteries, which counters plaque buildup, the researchers said. Heart attacks can occur when plaque blocks blood flow to the heart.\n\n\"Berries were the most commonly consumed sources of these substances in the U.S. diet, and they are one of the best sources of these powerful bioactive compounds,\" said study lead author Aedin Cassidy. \"These substances, called anthocyanins -- a flavonoid -- are naturally present in red- and blue-colored fruits and vegetables, so they are also found in high amounts in cherries, grapes, eggplant, black currants, plums and other berries.\"\n\nMen are likely to benefit from eating berries as well, although this study included only women, said Cassidy, who is head of the department of nutrition at Norwich Medical School at the University of East Anglia, in England.\n\nAlthough more research is needed to confirm these benefits, \"these data are important from a public health perspective because these fruits can be readily incorporated into the habitual diet,\" the study concluded.\n\nDr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a preventive cardiologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, noted that this was a \"huge study that followed women for a long period of time.

The results are presented in the journal The Lancet Oncology.\n\nRectal cancer affects some 2,000 men and women in Sweden every year. Preoperative radiotherapy was gradually introduced in the early 1990s, with a consequent improvement in prognosis for people with rectal cancer and reduction in the risk of local recurrence.\n\n\"Back then we showed that preoperative radiotherapy reduces the risk of local recurrence by over 50 per cent for patients with rectal cancer,\" says principal investigator Anna Martling, senior consultant surgeon and professor at Karolinska Institutet's Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery. \"Thanks to our results, radiotherapy is recommended to many rectal cancer patients.\"\n\nHowever, radiotherapy can cause adverse reactions and the optimal radiotherapeutic method and the interval between it and the ensuing surgery have been mooted. The study now presented in The Lancet Oncology is based on the claim that the adverse effects of rectal cancer treatment can be reduced by administering more but lower doses of radiation for a longer time, or by increasing the interval between radiotherapy and surgery. These hypotheses have now been tested in a study in which rectal cancer patients were randomly assigned to three different treatment arms:\n\u2022 Delayed surgery with short-course (5x5 Gy) radiotherapy followed by surgery after 4-8 weeks.\n\u2022 Delayed surgery with long-course (25x2 Gy) radiotherapy followed by surgery after 4-8 weeks.\n\nThe results of the study show that patients with delayed surgery develop fewer complications with equally good oncological outcomes.

Most treatments initially rely on medications that are often expensive, usually ineffective and frequently cause unwelcome side effects. And unfortunately there is no cure.\n\nMany practitioners and patients have turned to diet as a possible treatment, but many of the dietary recommendations have not been backed by clinical trials.The study, the largest of its kind, measured the degree of relief from low FODMAP, a frequently recommended diet, which stands for Fermentable Oligo-Di-Monosaccharides and Polyols.\n\nThis diet excludes many compounds found in wheat, certain fruits and vegetables, garlic, onions and sugar substitutes.\n\nOver a six-week process, registered dietitians educated and monitored the progress of more than 90 IBS patients. Roughly half followed a prescribed low FODMAP diet, and half were a control group that used a common-sense regimen, cutting down on large meals, binges and known irritants such as caffeine and alcohol.\n\nThe results were impressive: More than 50 percent of the patients on the low FODMAP diet had major improvement of their abdominal pain, compared with 20 percent of the control group.\n\nThere was also more improvement of other bothersome symptoms compared to the control group: bloating, diarrhea and stool urgency.\n\nEswaran collaborated with William Chey, M.D., professor of internal medicine, Kenya Jackson, Sivaram G.

Many are pushing for cannabis as a treatment for the abuse of opioids and illegal narcotics such as heroin, and as an alternative to painkillers.\n\nIt's a tempting sell in New England, hard hit by the painkiller and heroin crisis. But there's a problem: There is very little research showing marijuana works as a treatment for such addictions.\n\nAdvocates argue a growing body of scientific literature supports the idea, pointing to a study in the Journal of Pain this year that found that chronic pain sufferers significantly reduced their opioid use when taking medical cannabis. Another study, published last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found cannabis can be effective in treating chronic pain and other ailments.\n\nThe research falls short of concluding marijuana helps wean people off opioids - Vicodin, Oxycontin and related painkillers - and heroin, though. Many medical professionals say there's not enough evidence for them to confidently prescribe it.\n\nIn Maine, which is considering adding opioid and heroin addiction to the list of conditions that qualify for medical marijuana, Michelle Ham said marijuana helped her end a years-long addiction to painkillers prescribed for a bad back and neck. Tired of feeling \"like a zombie,\" the 37-year-old mother of two decided to quit cold turkey, which she said brought on convulsions and other withdrawal symptoms. Then, a friend mentioned marijuana, which Maine had legalized in 1999 for chronic pain and scores of other medical conditions. Ham gave it a try in 2013 and said the pain is under control and she hasn't gone back on the opioids.\n\n\"Before, I couldn't even function. I couldn't get anything done,\" Ham said. \"Now, I actually organize volunteers, and we have a donations center to help the needy.\"\n\nBolstered by stories like Ham's, doctors are experimenting with marijuana as an addiction treatment in Massachusetts and California. Supporters in Maine are pushing for its inclusion in qualifying conditions for medical marijuana. Vermonters are making the case for addiction treatment in their push to legalize pot.\n\nAuthorities are also desperate to curb a sharp rise in overdoses; Maine saw a 31 percent increase last year, and drug-related deaths in Vermont have jumped 44 percent since 2010. Vermont officials also blame opioid abuse for a 40 percent increase over the past two years of children in state custody.\n\n\"I don't think it's a cure for everybody,\" said Maine Rep. Diane Russell, a Portland Democrat and a leader in the state effort to legalize marijuana. \"But why take a solution off the table when people are telling us and physicians are telling us that it's working?\"\n\nMost states with medical marijuana allow it for a list of qualifying conditions. Getting on that list is crucial and has resulted in a tug of war in many states, including several in which veterans have been unsuccessful in getting post-traumatic stress disorder approved for marijuana treatment.\n\nThis month, Pennsylvania became the 24th state to legalize medical marijuana. Sen. Mike Vereb, a Republican, called on lawmakers to take on what he called \"the number-one killer in Pennsylvania\" - opioid abuse.\n\n\"Opioid abuse has no party, has no color, has no religion,\" Vereb said. \"Let's face it, that's the killer.

People are dying and, as a result, we ought to use things that are proven to be effective,\" said Dr. Richard Saitz, chair of the Department of Community Health Sciences at the Boston University School of Public Health.\n\nCannabis could have limited benefits as a treatment alternative, said Harvard Medical School's Dr. Kevin Hill, who last year authored the JAMA study that found benefits in using medical marijuana to treat chronic pain, neuropathic pain and spasticity related to multiple sclerosis. But he urged caution.\n\n\"If you are thinking about using cannabis as opposed to using opioids for chronic pain, then I do think the evidence does support it,\" he said. \"However, I think one place where sometimes cannabis advocates go too far is when they talk about using cannabis to treat opioid addiction.\"\n\nThe findings in the Journal of Pain study that found chronic pain sufferers reduced their opioid use when using medical pot were limited because participants self-reported the data.\n\nSubstance abuse experts argue there are already approved medications. It would also be wrong to portray marijuana as completely safe, they say, because it can also be addictive. But supporters point to doctors like Dr. Gary Witman, of Canna Care Docs, who has treated addicts with cannabis at his offices in Fall River, Stoughton and Worcester, Massachusetts. Since introducing the treatment in September, Witman said 15 patients have successfully weaned themselves off opioids.

Keating, associate professor of medicine and public health at Harvard Medical School and lead author of a report on the study published online Dec. 7 in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.\n\n\"There are areas where hormone deprivation therapy has been shown to have a clear benefit,\" Keating said. \"We're not suggesting that men who need hormone deprivation therapy should not have it. But lots of men get the therapy where it has not been shown to have a benefit.\"\n\nOne example is so-called PSA-recurrent cancer. Hormone deprivation therapy is started, Keating said, when levels of cancer-associated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increase after surgery or radiation therapy, but there are no other indicators of danger.\n\n\"There has never been a trial showing an overall benefit in such cases,\" she said. \"When you can have potentially serious adverse effects, you want to show caution.\"\n\nSimilarly, Keating said, no trial has shown an overall benefit for androgen deprivation therapy in cases where \"watchful waiting\" is chosen rather than radiation therapy or surgery for prostate cancer, Keating said.\n\n\"One third of men over 65 who don't have surgery or radiation get this therapy,\" she said. \"Yet its effects have never been studied in a controlled trial.\"\n\nPrevious studies have shown potential dangers related to androgen deprivation therapy in older men, Keating said. The study she led looked at its effects on about 37,000 men treated for prostate cancer at Veterans Affairs hospitals.\n\nSurgical removal of the testes was associated with a 40 percent increased risk for heart disease and a more than doubled risk for heart attack. Use of multiple hormone-blocking agents was associated with a 27 percent increased risk for heart disease.\n\nThe greatest risk was found for drugs that target gonadotropin-releasing hormone: 159.4 cases of diabetes per 1,000 person-years, compared with 87.5 for men who did not have androgen deprivation therapy, as well as a 35 percent increased risk for sudden cardiac death, a comparable increase in heart attack risk and a 22 percent increased risk for stroke.\n\nObservational studies, which include all people with a condition, can never conclusively prove cause and effect, Keating acknowledged, because \"the thing we can't account for is whether people who are on a treatment are different from those who aren't.\" But detailed evidence about the potential dangers of androgen deprivation therapy has not emerged from the more rigorous controlled trials that have been done \"because they have looked only at cardiovascular deaths, and most patients who have heart attacks do not die of those heart attacks,\" she said.\n\nDr. Peter Albertsen, a professor and chief of urology at the University of Connecticut Health Center, said that \"the point of this paper is to help physicians understand that long-term use of this therapy carries consequences.\" Albertsen wrote an accompanying editorial in the journal.\n\nAnti-hormone therapy was developed to treat the pain and other problems of advanced prostate cancer, Albertsen said, and so it was generally used for only three to five years.\n\n\"Now, many more men are being started on androgen deprivation therapy long before there are any symptoms of prostate cancer so they may be on it for up to 15 years,\" he said. \"We are beginning to realize that there can be significant problems in terms of cardiovascular risk.

That may spare the patients from additional testing and additional costs.\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the study, however, experts wrote that using CT scans to gauge bone density could lead to some people being incorrectly diagnosed, particularly if people at low risk are tested.\n\nIn this study, the average age was about 59 years old - six years younger than the age at which the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government-backed panel, recommends all women begin being screened for osteoporosis. The disease affects over 12 million Americans over 50.\n\nThe panel also suggests younger women at an increased risk for bone fractures should be screened, but there\u2019s no recommendation for men of any age.\n\nDespite DXA scans being safe and cost effective, Pickhardt and his colleagues say the test is underused. CT scans, however, are considered overused - with more than 80 million performed in the U.S. during 2011.\n\nFor the new study, the researchers analyzed test results from 1,867 patients, who had both types of scans performed within six months of each other over a 10-year period, to see if their CT scans showed osteoporosis as well as the DXAs.\n\nOverall, about 23 percent of the people were diagnosed with osteoporosis, about 45 percent were diagnosed with some bone-weakening and about 32 percent were healthy based on their DXAs.\n\nThe researchers then found that their ability to accurately diagnose those same patients with osteoporosis from a CT scan depended on what threshold for bone density they used.\n\nDr. Sumit Majumdar, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study, said a lower threshold for bone density would catch most cases of osteoporosis and limit \u201cincidentaloporosis\u201d - incorrect osteoporosis diagnoses \u201cdiscovered\u201d while doctors were looking for something else.\n\nAt the lower threshold, the researchers found 9 percent of those diagnosed with osteoporosis were misdiagnosed.\n\nPickhardt said the screenings would have to target the right groups of people to prevent overdiagnosis.\n\n\u201cObviously it\u2019s something we need to worry about, but if you apply it to a population that\u2019s suitable for diagnosis you wouldn\u2019t run that risk,\u201d he said.\n\nMajumdar, a professor of medicine at the University of Alberta in Canada, said CT scans are better tests, but stomach scans don\u2019t include the hip - like a DXA would.\n\nA DXA can cost a couple hundred dollars, while a CT scan can cost about $500. Both involve radiation.\n\nDr. Beatrice Hull, from the Center for Osteoporosis and Bone Health at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, told Reuters Health that she\u2019d want her patients to have a DXA scan even with a diagnosis from a CT scan.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think at this point this one test is going to prevent further testing.

(Jan. 3, 2016) - Deregulation and inhibition of the immune system contributes to cancer development. Many therapeutic strategies aim to re-stimulate the immune system to recognize cancer cells and target them for destruction. Researchers from Moffitt Cancer Center report that a dendritic cell vaccine that targets the HER2 protein on breast cancer cells is safe and effectively stimulates the immune system leading to regression of early-stage breast cancer.\n\nThe HER2 protein is overexpressed in 20-25% of all breast cancer tumors and is associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis. Researchers have previously shown that immune cells are less able to recognize and target cancer cells that express HER2 as breast cancer progresses into a more advanced and invasive stage. This suggests that strategies that can restimulate the immune system to recognize and target HER2 early during cancer development may be effective treatment options.\n\nThe researchers previously developed a vaccine that helps the immune system recognize the HER2 protein on breast cancer cells. Their approach involves creating the vaccine from immune cells called dendritic cells that are harvested from each individual patient to create a personalized vaccine.\n\nIn order to determine if the HER2-dendritic cell vaccine is safe and effective, the researchers performed a clinical trial in 54 women who have HER2-expressing early-stage breast cancer. The dendritic cell vaccines were prepared by isolating dendritic cells from each patients' blood and exposing them to fragments of the HER2 protein. Patients were injected with a dose of their personal dendritic cell vaccine once a week for 6 weeks into either a lymph node, the breast tumor, or into both sites.\n\nThe researchers report that the dendritic cell vaccines were well-tolerated and patients only experienced low-grade toxicities. The most common adverse events were fatigue, injection site reactions, and chills. They also show that the vaccine was able to stimulate an immune response in the majority of the patients. Approximately 80% of evaluable patients had a detectable immune response in their peripheral blood and/or in their sentinel lymph node wherein their cancer is most likely to spread to first. Importantly, the immune responses among the patients were similar, regardless of the route of vaccine administration.\n\nThe Moffitt researchers assessed the effectiveness of the vaccine by determining the percentage of patients who had detectable disease within surgical specimens after resection. The absence of disease is termed a pathological complete response (pCR). They report that 13 patients achieved a pCR and patients who had early non-invasive disease called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) achieved a higher rate of pCR than patients who had early-stage invasive disease. Interestingly, patients who achieved a pCR had a higher immune response within their local sentinel lymph nodes.\n\n\"These results suggest that vaccines are more effective in DCIS, thereby warranting further evaluation in DCIS or other minimal disease settings, and the local regional sentinel lymph node may serve as a more meaningful immunologic endpoint,\" said Brian J. Czerniecki, MD, PhD, Chair of the Department of Breast Oncology at Moffitt Cancer Center.\n\nThe study was published in the December 13th online issue of Clinical Cancer Research and was supported by funds received from R01-CA096997, P30-CA016520, Pennies-in-Action\u00ae, and the Henle Foundation.\n\nMoffitt is dedicated to one lifesaving mission: to contribute to the prevention and cure of cancer.

Standard stroke treatment relies on powerful blood-thinning medications that break up the clot and restore blood flow to the brain.\n\nBut when those drugs don't work, doctors now can turn to a new catheter-based device that will physically remove the blood clot, said Dr. William Powers, lead author of the updated AHA guidelines and chair of neurology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nThe tool, called an endovascular stent retrieval device, is made up of wire mesh that resembles a tiny ring of chicken wire, Powers said.\n\nSkilled surgeons run the device up through a person's arteries via a catheter, and then open it smack in the middle of a stroke-causing blood clot.\n\n\"If you actually deploy or open one in the middle of a clot, it smooshes out and the clot gets caught in the chicken wire, and then you pull the whole thing out back through the artery,\" Powers said.\n\nThe new guidelines were published June 29 in the journal Stroke.\n\nThe AHA issued its updated guidelines based primarily on the results of six new clinical trials released within the past eight months, Powers said. All of these studies showed that the device can safely and effectively stop a stroke by removing blood clots, he added.\n\nA number of other medical societies have endorsed the AHA's new guidelines, including the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and the Society of Vascular and Interventional Neurology.\n\nAs with other stroke treatments, time is of the essence. The procedure must start within six hours of the onset of a stroke, which means that emergency teams and hospitals will have to move fast, Powers said.\n\nThe guidelines provide added incentive to quickly transfer stroke victims from a local hospital to a major stroke center capable of advanced treatment, said Powers and Dr. David Kandzari, director of interventional cardiology and chief scientific officer for the Piedmont Heart Institute in Atlanta.\n\nLocal hospitals currently are urged to \"drip and ship\" people experiencing a major stroke -- essentially, start an IV drip of the powerful clot-busting drug called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and then ship them by ambulance or helicopter to the nearest comprehensive stroke center for further treatment, Kandzari said.\n\nStent retrieval devices make that quick hospital transfer even more important, since the gadgets provide a crucial backup for tPA but are more tricky to use.\n\n\"These are procedures performed by very specialized individuals,\" Kandzari said. \"They are not regularly performed by cardiologists or radiologists or neurologists. Hospitals must make plans to get people to other centers that are capable of this catheter-based therapy,\" he explained.\n\nPowers said, \"I think what's going to happen is that we will develop systems of rapid triage and rapid transport. A lot of this at this point depends on logistics and manpower. The people who do this are specially trained. You need a lot of special training to get those catheters up into the brain and pull things out.\"\n\nThe guidelines specifically recommend using a stent retrieval device for people who:\n\u2022 Didn't have any significant disability prior to their current stroke.\n\u2022 Received tPA within 4.5 hours of their stroke onset, and can start the procedure within six hours after stroke symptoms started.\n\u2022 Are at least 18 years old, as clinical trials have not been conducted with children.\n\u2022 Have imaging scans that show more than half of the brain on the side of the stroke is not permanently damaged.\n\u2022 Have a clot blocking a large artery supplying blood to the brain.\n\nThat last point is especially important, because the stent retrieval device will not fit into the smaller blood vessels that branch out further into the brain, Powers said.\n\nThe major risk of using the device is that it could tear an artery and cause bleeding in the brain, particularly since it will be used on people who have already received very potent blood thinners, Kandzari said.\n\nBut clinical trials have shown that the risk of brain bleeding for people who received tPA and then went through mechanical clot removal is no greater than for people who just receive the blood thinner, Powers said.\n\n\"The outcomes were uniformly positive in all of the trials,\" he said. \"It's really, really good evidence.\"\n\nFor more about stroke, visit the National Stroke Association.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story quotes two experts, one of whom chaired the committee that wrote the guidelines (Powers) and the other (Kandazari) who was apparently independent of the guideline-writing process.

In many cases such big reductions were achieved even though the patients were already taking statins.\n\nBoth drugs could win approval from the Food and Drug Administration by this summer.

Murray holds a doctorate degree but is not a physician. Diane never smoked marijuana, and she disapproved of her mother's past drug experiments. But cancer made the 33-year-old teacher ready to try anything that might help: she hoped she would find a cure in herbs from a Tibetan doctor or in the hands of a faith healer deep in the Brazilian rain forest. Then, as the pain and fatigue of advanced colon cancer left Diane increasingly bedridden, she just wanted the strength to get out of bed. That's when she found ecstasy, the illegal drug people often take at all-night dance parties. Though ecstasy is addictive and can damage hearts and brain cells, some researchers say the hallucinogen can also inspire deep feelings of well-being and intimacy with others. For a few hours at a time as the ecstasy took hold, Diane would leave her disease behind and walk in the park, sing with her parents, or talk about death without fear, her mother said. Ecstasy ''was the only thing that controlled the pain and her breathing,\" said Diane's mother, a Boston-area resident who asked not to be identified because last year she helped provide the illegal drugs for her daughter, whose middle name was Diane. ''She was emotionally and spiritually uplifted\" when she was on ecstasy. ''She was her funny, witty self.\" Forty years after widespread abuse led to a virtual ban on medical research involving psychedelic drugs, experiences like Diane's are leading scientists to take a second look. Though ecstasy, LSD, and ''magic mushrooms\" are now known by their partying reputation, psychedelic drugs were once seen as a promising treatment for schizophrenia and other mental conditions. Already, researchers in Miami are giving heroin addicts a hallucinogen called ibogaine in an attempt to reduce withdrawal symptoms. Rape victims in South Carolina take ecstasy in a study designed to help them talk about their ordeals. And soon, Dr. John Halpern at McLean Hospital in Belmont will begin giving ecstasy to people with advanced cancer to help them cope with the pain and anxiety of dying. For advocates of psychedelic drug research, the study at McLean, an affiliate of Harvard University, represents a chance to reduce the stigma hanging over the field. Back in the 1960s, Harvard professor Timothy Leary helped spur the backlash against psychedelic drugs with ethically questionable experiments and by advocating recreational LSD use to ''turn on, tune in, drop out.\" Halpern, by contrast, is a respected researcher whose past studies have found no evidence of brain damage among Navajos who regularly ingested peyote, a psychedelic drug derived from cactus. ''This is not Leary saying to young people . . . ''Take LSD. Drop out, and we're going to change society,' \" said Rick Doblin, president of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, an advocacy group that has pushed for resumption of psychedelic studies for years. ''This is something that can be helpful to people who have never done drugs before, and after they are done, they are not going to go out and undermine the foundations of our society.\" But the research is politically loaded, coming at a time when the Bush administration is fighting efforts to offer marijuana as an anti-nausea medicine for cancer patients. Federal officials fear that research showing medical value for illegal drugs will only encourage drug abuse. Dr. David Murray, special assistant in the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, said that some psychedelic studies are fueled by an agenda to promote the use of these drugs. ''This might not be a dispassionate quest for truth,\" he said, noting that Doblin's group has sued the federal government in support of a University of Massachusetts professor who wants to grow marijuana for research. Initially Doblin's group also planned to pay $250,000 for the ecstasy study at McLean, though Doblin withdrew support in favor of a donation from Peter Lewis, chairman of the Progressive Group of Insurance Cos. in Ohio. Partly because of such skepticism, Halpern's research was held up for more than a year while he struggled to get federal permits. That was more time than Diane had when her mother first read an article last June in which Doblin suggested that ecstasy might help in ''facing directly life's great challenge, to die gracefully and in peace.\" So, after being turned away by Halpern, Diane's mother found her own ''psychedelic therapist\" who was willing to lead Diane on trips with ecstasy, also known by its chemical name, MDMA. ''Before her first session, Diane could only get out of bed for a few minutes at a time. Sitting or standing caused her pain to spike to unbearable levels,\" her mother wrote in an essay after Diane died last fall. ''During the first session with MDMA, Diane's pain receded, her spirits soared, and she was able to walk to a park near my house and hang out with a friend.\" The psychedelic therapist, who asked that he not be named because of fear of prosecution, admitted in an interview with the Globe that he was only guessing at what might help Diane -- and he was initially afraid that he might kill her. After all, she was on a dozen medications, including methadone, which had caused an irregular heart rhythm -- and ecstasy can make heart problems worse. After experimenting with various psychedelic drugs, he found a dose of ecstasy -- about twice the level to be used in the McLean study -- that seemed to bring Diane peace, allowing them to talk directly about her illness. Diane's mother recalled that ''on one occasion, the therapist asked Diane how she felt about her pain. She said it was like an unruly child in need of attention. She would send it love.\" On her final day, Diane slept peacefully for hours after taking ecstasy, her mother said, without moans and gasps. That night, ''she opened her eyes with an expression of absolute wonder, reached out to touch her dad, and died,\" according to Diane's mother. ''We are honored to have witnessed and shared a holy experience, my daughter's good death.\" But outside observers caution that psychedelic drug treatment is ethically risky: What begins as treatment for anxiety could become experiments in altering a dying person's consciousness. That, one analyst said, could take away from someone's ability to be fully engaged at the end of life. ''If we're altering their mental experience and their sense of . . . the dying process, then we're crossing some boundaries that need to be very highly considered,\" said Keith Meador, director of the theology and medicine program at Duke University Divinity School. For now, Halpern said, he just wants to do the research to better understand how the drugs affect people with cancer, 40 percent of whom say in surveys that they don't get enough treatment for pain. Working with an oncologist from the Lahey Clinic in Burlington, he is beginning to look for 12 advanced cancer patients to undergo ecstasy therapy as well as counseling. ''It's always been about doing good science,\" said Halpern. ''Is this helpful for people with cancer and their families? That is the only question we are trying to answer.\" Scott Allen can be reached at allen@globe.com.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Several individuals with different perspectives on the use of ecstasy with this patient population were quoted.

This may be especially true for people with serious mental illness, a study finds. When people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder were asked who or what helped them manage the condition, many said it was pets that helped the most.\n\n\"When I'm feeling really low they are wonderful because they won't leave my side for two days,\" one study participant with two dogs and two cats, \"They just stay with me until I am ready to come out of it.\"\n\nAnother person said of their pet birds: \"If I didn't have my pets I think I would be on my own. You know what I mean, so it's \u2014 it's nice to come home and, you know, listen to the birds singing and that, you know.\"\n\nMany people with serious mental illness live at home and have limited contact with the health care system, says Helen Brooks, a mental health researcher at University of Manchester in the United Kingdom and the lead author on the study, which was published Friday in the journal BMC Psychiatry. So they're doing a lot of the work of managing their conditions.\n\nBrooks says, \"Many felt deep emotional connections with their pet that weren't available from friends and family.\"\n\nBrooks and her colleagues interviewed 54 people with serious long-term mental illnesses. Twenty-five of them considered their pets to be a part of their social network. The scientists asked who they went to when they needed help or advice, where they gained emotional support and encouragement and how they spent their days.\n\nThe participants were then given a diagram with three consecutive circles radiating out from a square representing the participant. They were asked to write the people, places and things that gave them support into the circles, with the circles closest to the center being the most important.\n\nSixty percent of the people who considered pets to be a part of their social networks placed them in the central, most important circle \u2014 the same place many people put close family and social workers. 20 percent placed pets in the second circle.\n\nThe interviews with participants are poignant, and reveal the struggle and isolation that can come with mental illness.\n\n\"I think it's really hard when you haven't had a mental illness to know what the actual experience is [like],\" said one participant. \"There's like a chasm, deep chasm between us ... [Other people are] on one side of it, and we're on the other side of it. We're sending smoke signals to each other to try and understand each other but we don't always \u2014 we don't always understand.\"\n\nPeople with mental illnesses often see their social groups shrink and find themselves alienated from their friends. For many of these people, says Brooks, animals can break through the isolation. They give affection without needing to understand the disorder.\n\n\"[Pets] don't look at the scars on your arms,\" one participant said. \"They don't question where you've been.\"\n\nThe pets provided more than just emotional support and companionship, participants said. The animals also could distract them from their illness, even from severe psychosis.\n\nOne study participant placed birds in his closest social circle. When he was hearing voices, he said that they \"help me in the sense, you know, I'm not thinking about the voices, I'm just thinking of when I hear the birds singing.\"\n\nAnother participant said that merely seeing a hamster climbing the bars on the cage and acting cute helped with some difficult situations.\n\nAnd having to take care of pets keeps people from withdrawing from the world. \"They force me, the cats force me to sort of still be involved,\" said one participant.\n\nAnother said that walking the dog helped them get out of the house and with people. \"That surprised me, you know, the amount of people that stop and talk to him, and that, yeah, it cheers me up with him. I haven't got much in my life, but he's quite good, yeah.\"\n\n\"The routine these pets provide is really important for people,\" says Brooks. \"Getting up in the morning to feed them and groom them and walk them, giving them structure and a sense of purpose that they won't otherwise have.\"\n\nMany of the study participants are unemployed because of their illness, she notes. Having a pet that was well taken care of was a source of pride for them.\n\nMark Longsjo, the program director of adult services at McLean Southeast, an inpatient mental facility in Middleborough, Mass., says that the interviews in the study reflect his professional experiences. \"We have so many patients come through, and we always ask them about their support system. Sometimes its family members, sometimes its friends, but it's very common to hear about pets.\"\n\nWhen he does patient intake surveys, Longsjo says that he includes pets in their risk assessments. Patients with pets often say the animals help keep them from following through on suicidal thinking, because they know their pets depend on them.\n\nThe social workers at McLean also incorporate pets into their aftercare planning, encouraging patients to make walking and grooming their pets a part of their routine. \"I think there's significant value in considering the common everyday pet to be as important as the relationships one has with one's family in the course of their treatment,\" says Longsjo. He feels this study is important because, although there's a lot of work looking at the benefits of trained therapy animals, they can be expensive and out of the reach of many patients.\n\nBrooks hopes that more health workers will consider incorporating pets into care plans for people with mental illness. Many of her participants said that sometimes it felt like their pets could sense when they needed help the most, and were able to provide it \u2014 just like the owners took care of them.\n\nAs one person in the study said, \"When he comes up and sits beside you on a night, it's different, you know.

The study is available online in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology \u25cf Biology \u25cf Physics, the flagship journal of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO).\n\nWith brachytherapy, also known as internal radiation therapy (RT), implants are surgically inserted in or near cancerous tissue to deliver a curative radiation dose directly to the tumor while limiting exposure for surrounding healthy tissue. Reducing this exposure is of particular concern for treating tumors in the prostate, which is surrounded by multiple critical structures. In contrast to low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy, where radioactive seed implants are placed permanently in the body and gradually deposit low levels of radiation over a period of months, HDR treatments deposit the dose in one treatment, after which the radioactive implant is removed from the patient.\n\nTypically, HDR brachytherapy is administered in four to as many as nine treatment sessions, which generally requires multiple invasive procedures to insert the implants. While the number of sessions can be streamlined by increasing the dose given in each session, data on the safety and tolerability of highly escalated brachytherapy doses are still relatively new and therefore limited. In this study, researchers found that patients who received a single fraction of 19 Gy HDR brachytherapy experienced similar clinical outcomes as with LDR brachytherapy, but with the convenience of a single visit.\n\n\u201cIt is becoming apparent that patients may be treated definitively for their prostate cancer in as little as a single day with a minimally invasive outpatient procedure,\u201d said lead study author Daniel J. Krauss, MD, a radiation oncologist at Oakland University\u2019s William Beaumont School of Medicine in Royal Oak, Michigan. \u201cWe found that patients generally can resume normal activities the following day with typical side effects.\u201d\n\nThe study, which appeared in the Red Journal\u2019s January 2017 issue, presented the results of a nonrandomized, prospective clinical trial of 58 patients with low- or intermediate-risk (non-metastatic) prostate cancer, with a median follow-up period of 2.9 years. All patients received a single, 19 Gy fraction of HDR brachytherapy. The median patient age was 63 years (range 43-73), and 91 percent of the patients presented with stage T1 disease.\n\nAt an average of nearly three years following treatment, cancer control rates were favorable and the toxicity profile was highly favorable. Three patients experienced recurrence or progression, yielding an estimated three-year cumulative biochemical control rate of 93 percent. Within the six months following HDR therapy, seven patients (12.1%) experienced grade 2 urinary side effects, most commonly frequency/urgency (6.9%). No patients experienced short-term grade 3+ urinary toxicity or grade 2+ gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Rates were similarly modest for long-term side effects. Six patients (10.3%) experienced chronic grade 2 urinary toxicity and one patient (1.7%) experienced grade 3 chronic GI toxicity that subsequently resolved. No patients experienced long-term grade 3+ urinary toxicity or grade 4 GI toxicity.\n\n\u201cThis study illustrates that a potentially curative dose of radiation may be delivered safely to the prostate entirely in a single administration,\u201d said Dr. Krauss. \u201cGiving the entire dose in a single treatment theoretically could have had a greater negative impact on the normal tissues in close proximity to the prostate\u2014meaning the bladder, urethra and rectum\u2014but this was not found to be the case. Toxicity rates were extremely low, with essentially no major complications encountered in this initial group of 58 patients.\u201d\n\nWhile findings highlight the potential tolerability of a single fraction of HDR brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer, the article also emphasizes the need for additional follow-up to compare long-term cancer control rates with conventional treatment approaches, which generally administer larger cumulative doses than the 19 Gy dose used in this trial.\n\n\u201cAs the follow-up interval lengthens, 19 Gy dosing in a single fraction may or may not be sufficient to result in cure rates comparable to historical standards. One thing that this study has made clear, however, is that the extremely low toxicity and complication rates leave room to escalate the single fraction dose in subsequent trials,\u201d said Dr. Krauss. \u201cWhile additional study and longer follow-up are necessary to confirm the optimal dose for single-fraction HDR brachytherapy, we are optimistic that the single-treatment approach can eventually become a standard practice for prostate cancer treatment.\u201d\n\nFor more information or a copy of the full study, contact ASTRO\u2019s media relations team at press@astro.org.

Older women, on the other hand, may take too much, putting themselves at risk for . And there is evidence that excess calcium can increase the risk of heart disease, the group wrote.\n\nAs for vitamin D, some prominent doctors have said that most people need supplements or they will be at increased risk for a wide variety of illnesses, including heart disease, and autoimmune diseases.\n\nAnd these days more and more people know their vitamin D levels because they are being tested for it as part of routine physical exams.\n\n\u201cThe number of vitamin D tests has exploded,\u201d said Dennis Black, a reviewer of the report who is a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the .\n\nAt the same time, vitamin D sales have soared, growing faster than those of any supplement, according to The Nutrition Business Journal. Sales rose 82 percent from 2008 to 2009, reaching $430 million. \u201cEveryone was hoping vitamin D would be kind of a panacea,\u201d Dr. Black said. The report, he added, might quell the craze.\n\n\u201cI think this will have an impact on a lot of primary care providers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 14-member expert committee was convened by the Institute of Medicine, an independent nonprofit scientific body, at the request of the and Canadian governments. It was asked to examine the available data \u2014 nearly 1,000 publications \u2014 to determine how much vitamin D and calcium people were getting, how much was needed for optimal health and how much was too much.\n\nThe two nutrients work together for bone health.\n\nBone health, though, is only one of the benefits that have been attributed to vitamin D, and there is not enough good evidence to support most other claims, the committee said.\n\nSome labs have started reporting levels of less than 30 nanograms of vitamin D per milliliter of blood as a deficiency. With that as a standard, 80 percent of the population would be deemed deficient of vitamin D, Dr. Rosen said. Most people need to take supplements to reach levels above 30 nanograms per milliliter, he added.\n\nBut, the committee concluded, a level of 20 to 30 nanograms is all that is needed for bone health, and nearly everyone is in that range.\n\nVitamin D is being added to more and more foods, said Paul R. Thomas of the Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health. Not only is it in orange juice and milk, but more is being added to breakfast cereals, and it now can be found in very high doses in supplement pills. Most vitamin D pills, he said, used to contain no more than 1,000 international units of it. Now it is easy to find pills, even in places like , with 5,000 international units. The committee, though, said people need only 600 international units a day.\n\nTo assess the amounts of vitamin D and calcium people are getting, the panel looked at national data on diets. Most people, they concluded, get enough calcium from the foods they eat, about 1,000 milligrams a day for most adults (1,200 for women ages 51 to 70).\n\nVitamin D is more complicated, the group said. In general, most people are not getting enough vitamin D from their diets, but they have enough of the vitamin in their blood, probably because they are also making it naturally after being out in the sun and storing it in their bodies.\n\nThe American Society for Bone and Mineral Research and other groups applauded the report. It is \u201ca very balanced set of recommendations,\u201d said Dr. Sundeep Khosla, a endocrinologist and the society\u2019s president.\n\nBut Andrew Shao, an executive vice president at the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade group, said the panel was being overly cautious, especially in its recommendations about vitamin D. He said there was no convincing evidence that people were being harmed by taking supplements, and he said higher levels of vitamin D, in particular, could be beneficial.\n\nSuch claims \u201care not supported by the available evidence,\u201d the committee wrote. They were based on studies that observed populations and concluded that people with lower levels of the vitamin had more of various diseases. Such studies have been misleading and most scientists agree that they cannot determine cause and effect.\n\nIt is not clear how or why the claims for high vitamin D levels started, medical experts say. First there were two studies, which turned out to be incorrect, that said people needed 30 nanograms of vitamin D per milliliter of blood, the upper end of what the committee says is a normal range. They were followed by articles and claims and books saying much higher levels \u2014 40 to 50 nanograms or even higher \u2014 were needed.\n\nAfter reviewing the data, the committee concluded that the evidence for the benefits of high levels of vitamin D was \u201cinconsistent and/or conflicting and did not demonstrate causality.\u201d\n\nEvidence also suggests that high levels of vitamin D can increase the risks for fractures and the overall death rate and can raise the risk for other diseases. While those studies are not conclusive, any risk looms large when there is no demonstrable benefit. Those hints of risk are \u201cchallenging the concept that \u2018more is better,\u2019 \u201d the committee wrote.\n\nThat is what surprised Dr. Black. \u201cWe thought that probably higher is better,\u201d he said.\n\nHe has changed his mind, and expects others will too: \u201cI think this report will make people more cautious.\u201d", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The diversity of independent voices included in this story is a real strength.

Most women are diagnosed after the age of 50. Having certain mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes also predispose women to the disease. And there are some lifestyle-related risk factors that can be controlled, such as hormone therapy after menopause, obesity, alcohol intake and physical inactivity, Evers said.\n\n\"Having one risk factor or even several doesn't mean a woman will definitely develop breast cancer,\" she said in a Fox Chase news release. \"Women need to become educated about the risk factors, especially those they can control, and then adjust their lifestyle accordingly.\"\n\nNot all women with breast cancer experience the same warning signs of the disease. Symptoms of breast cancer may include:\n\u2022 A lump in the breast or armpit.\n\u2022 Swelling or thickening in part of the breast.\n\u2022 Dimpling or irritation of the skin on the breast.\n\u2022 Pain in the breast that doesn't go away.\n\u2022 Redness or flaky skin on the breast or nipple.\n\u2022 A change in the size or shape of the breast.\n\nIn some cases, women never develop any of these symptoms, Evers noted.\n\n\"All women should know how their breasts look and feel so they can recognize any changes in them. This is an important part of breast health,\" she said. \"But just being familiar with your breasts should never take the place of regular screenings and mammograms. These tests can help find breast cancer in its early stages, even before symptoms appear.\"\n\nThere are three tests often used to look for breast cancer, Evers said.\n\u2022 Mammogram: An X-ray of the breast used to examine breast changes.

Preventing the cancer can prevent treatments that can be debilitating, even if the cancers were never lethal to start with.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the bind we\u2019re in right now,\u201d said Dr. Christopher Logothetis, professor and chairman of genitourinary medical oncology at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. \u201cMost of the time, treatment wouldn\u2019t help and may not be necessary. But the reality is that people are being operated on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are trying to avoid a diagnosis to avoid a prevention whose value is disputed,\u201d he said. With finasteride, Dr. Logothetis added, \u201cwe\u2019re trying to overcome our other sins.\u201d\n\nOther experts say, Not so fast. Finasteride might not make much of a difference in the death rate because so few men die from prostate cancer. What the drug\u2019s proponents are advocating is taking a drug to somehow compensate for what many believe is the nation\u2019s overzealous diagnosis and treatment of the disease.\n\nDr. Peter Albertsen, a prostate cancer specialist at the University of Connecticut, explains: While 10 percent of men 55 and older find out they have prostate cancer, the cancer is lethal in no more than 25 percent of them. So if finasteride reduced the prostate cancer\u2019s incidence by 30 percent, about 7 percent of men would get a cancer diagnosis and approximately 1.8 percent instead of 2.5 percent would have a lethal cancer.\n\n\u201cFinasteride might make a difference but only in a very small subset of men,\u201d Dr. Albertsen said.\n\nAnd, he adds, the study did not look for a decline in death rates, and it is unlikely that any study ever will \u2014 it would take too long and be too expensive. Yet the ultimate goal of prevention is to save lives. It remains an assumption that finasteride would have much impact on the minority of prostate cancers that, despite early detection and treatment, still kill.\n\nFinasteride blocks the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, a hormone active mostly in the prostate and the scalp, and that all prostate cancers need to grow.\n\nThe drug is available from Merck & Company, as Proscar, and from six companies as a generic to shrink the prostate in older men whose prostates can enlarge, making urination difficult.\n\nResearchers say it turns out that shrinking the prostate also may be good for cancer detection by making it easier to find all tumors, including the most aggressive.\n\n\u201cThe data are compelling,\u201d said Dr. Peter Scardino, chairman of the department of surgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, a convert who originally thought the drug was dangerous. \u201cFinasteride has to be recognized as the first clearly demonstrated way to prevent prostate cancer with any medication or any oral agent at all.\u201d\n\nFinasteride has had its ups and downs. Its chronicle began in 1993, with the start of a study sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and involving 19,000 men. Half took finasteride pills; the rest a placebo. In March 2003, 15 months before the study\u2019s scheduled end, its directors halted it abruptly. The reason was that the results were overwhelmingly compelling \u2014 men taking the drug were not getting prostate cancer.\n\nYet despite that note of triumph, a troubling finding emerged. The study was designed to look for a reduction in the overall prostate cancer rate. And that is what it found. But, as Dr. Scardino pointed out in an editorial five years ago in The New England Journal of Medicine that accompanied the study, it appeared that 6.4 percent of the men who took the drug got fast growing, ominous-looking tumors. In contrast, such tumors were found in 5.1 percent, of men who took the placebo.\n\nThe concern was that the drug might be preventing cancers that never spread. At the same time, finasteride might actually be causing aggressive cancers that can kill.\n\nIt would, of course, be the worse possible outcome. Dr. Scardino\u2019s editorial warned healthy men not to take finasteride.\n\nThat seemed to leave the drug dead. The study researchers, though, wondered if that conclusion was correct. Maybe, they thought, by shrinking the prostate, the drug was just making it easier to find aggressive tumors.\n\nWhen doctors do a biopsy for prostate cancer, they probe the gland with a needle, hoping to find cancer cells. But prostate cancer grows as little nests and an aggressive cancer will appear as dangerous-looking cells in some clusters and less dangerous in others. A smaller prostate means a doctor is more likely to hit upon cancer nests and more likely to find aggressive-looking cells.\n\nThe researchers had a way to learn if they were correct. Most of the men in the study who had cancer \u2014 aggressive or not \u2014 chose to be treated and many had their prostates removed. A pathologist could carefully examine every one of those 500 prostates and compare the kinds of cancers found at surgery to those initially diagnosed at biopsy.\n\nIt took years, but the analysis showed the hypothesis was right. Now, two groups of independent researchers conclude, in papers in the current issue of Cancer Prevention Research, that finasteride decreases the risk of having any tumor at all \u2014 large or small, fast growing or slow growing, by the same amount \u2014 nearly 30 percent.\n\nWith this new analysis, many prostate cancer specialists, including Dr. Scardino, say their view of the drug has completely changed. The study actually found that finasteride protects against both lethal and less dangerous tumors and could cut prostate cancer risk by nearly a third.\n\nEven the effect on smaller tumors has important implications, said Dr. Ian M. Thompson, Jr., the study\u2019s principal researcher and a urologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio.\n\n\u201cThe cancers that were prevented were the ones men are having surgery and radiation for today,\u201d Dr. Thompson said.\n\nNow, though, prostate cancer specialists have a new problem: How can they change the drug\u2019s image?\n\nDrug companies are unlikely to be instrumental, Dr. Thompson and others say, because finasteride\u2019s patent has expired, giving companies little incentive to apply to the Food and Drug Administration to market it as a cancer preventative. Without F.D.A. approval, finasteride cannot be advertised as preventing cancer and insurers may not pay for it.\n\nBut doctors can prescribe drugs for other purposes at their discretion and Dr. Parnes said that men and their doctors may be persuaded to try it.\n\nIn the meantime, GlaxoSmithKline, which has a patented drug, Avodart, to reduce the size of men\u2019s prostates, has a study asking whether its drug can prevent prostate cancer. If it can, and the drug agency approves Avodart for cancer prevention, doctors and patients may have to decide between a generic drug used off-label or a more expensive brand-name drug that does much the same thing.\n\nSome leading prostate specialists, like Dr. Scardino, say they are recommending that men who worry about prostate cancer take finasteride.\n\nHe also ponders taking it himself. \u201cI regularly think, Why don\u2019t I take it? Why wouldn\u2019t every man take it?\u201d Dr. Scardino said. He hasn\u2019t done so yet, partly because those years of concern about the drug took a toll.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the difficulty of adjusting to something that originally had a bad reputation,\u201d Dr. Scardino explained.\n\nDr. Thompson has no such fears.\n\nHe is at no particular risk for prostate cancer, but, he reasons, taking finasteride is not that different than taking a statin for a slightly elevated cholesterol level.\n\n\u201cImagine the marathoner with no family history of heart disease, who\u2019s skinny, doesn\u2019t smoke and has normal blood pressure,\u201d Dr. Thompson says. \u201cShould he take a statin? The amount of benefit he\u2019ll get is not much, but his risk reduction still is 25 or 30 percent.\u201d\n\nDr. Thompson knows what he will do about finasteride.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 54,\u201d he said. \u201cThe men in the study were 55 and older. So I\u2019ll start taking it next year.\u201d", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story cited several highly-credentialed prostate cancer clinician-researchers.\u00a0 However, the only one expressing a somewhat more negative tone got the least space.\u00a0 ", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Dec. 15, 2009 (San Antonio) -- A new targeted cancer drug has been shown to shrink tumors in women with metastatic breast cancer after an average of seven other drugs, including Herceptin, failed.\n\nThe new drug, called T-DM1, combines Herceptin with a potent chemotherapy drug.

He is an associate professor at the department of investigational cancer therapeutics at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston.\n\n\"Patients only had one week of exposure to the bacteria, but even with that limited exposure we saw quite interesting and, in some patients, clinically meaningful activity,\" Janku said.\n\nClostridium novyi has been linked to human illness. In 2000, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a handful of drug users in the United Kingdom fell ill or died after their injection sites became infected with the bacteria.\n\nThe strain used in this clinical trial, Clostridium novyi-NT, had been weakened to prevent it from producing its toxin, which can be lethal in humans, Janku said. The NT stands for \"non-toxic.\"\n\nClostridium novyi flourishes in low-oxygen environments. Researchers thought this might make the bacteria a prime candidate for cancer fighting, by keeping the infection focused on the tumor site.\n\n\"Normal tissues, even if they are low on oxygen, they always have enough oxygen to not allow this bacteria to germinate and proliferate,\" Janku explained. \"Cancerous tissue is low in oxygen, most often in the center of the cancers.\"\n\nTo test whether the bacteria could help fight cancer, researchers injected the tumors of 24 patients with a single dose of Clostridium novyi-NT, ranging from 10,000 to 3 million spores.\n\nFifteen of the patients had sarcoma, two patients had melanoma, and seven had a variety of cancers, the researchers said.\n\nThe scientists expected Clostridium novyi-NT to help fight the tumor in two ways.\n\nFirst, the bacterial infection itself could cause direct destruction of the tumor cells, Janku said.\n\n\"If that happens, it actually helps to increase the presence of tumor-specific antigens, which are proteins that make a tumor more obvious to the immune system,\" Janku said. \"It can prime the immune system to attack the cancer.\"\n\nThe bacteria also could activate the immune system to fight the cancer even if the infection didn't kill off tumor cells, Janku added.\n\nPatients in this clinical trial were left with the bacterial infection for one week, and then everyone was given antibiotics to kill off the Clostridium novyi-NT, Janku said.\n\n\"Clostridium is actually quite susceptible to antibiotics,\" Janku noted.\n\nThe bacteria germinated in the cancers of 11 out of the 24 patients, with tumor cells dying off as a result.\n\nTumor shrinkage of greater than 10 percent was observed in 23 percent of patients. However, Janku said this could be an underestimate since the infection causes surrounding tissue to become inflamed, making the lesion appear larger than it actually is.\n\nFollowing bacterial therapy, cancer stabilized in 21 patients. When both injected and uninjected lesions were included, the stable disease rate was 86 percent, the researchers reported.\n\nThe potential for Clostridium novyi-NT to prompt an immune response against cancer is intriguing, said Sacha Gnjatic, who is associate director of the Human Immune Monitoring Center at Mount Sinai in New York City.\n\n\"That's where the promise of this type of therapy lies. You would expect that the injected lesion would have some type of response because you're disrupting the tumor cells,\" Gnjatic said. \"What would be interesting is if this could prime an immune response that would eventually also take care of the non-injected tumors. That's the holy grail of immunotherapy.\"\n\nJanku said he's particularly excited by the ability of the bacteria to battle sarcomas, which are cancers that occur in bone, muscle and soft tissues.\n\n\"Classic immunotherapy which is now approved or being heavily investigated doesn't seem to be working for a majority of sarcomas,\" Janku explained.\n\nResearchers have moved on to the next phase, in which patients taking the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab (Keytruda) will also be treated with a single injection of Clostridium novyi-NT, Janku said. The researchers suspect the two therapies used in combination will create a strong immune response against cancers.\n\nHowever, they will have to keep an eye on potential side effects from Clostridium novyi-NT, Janku added.\n\nTwo patients treated with the heaviest dose of 3 million spores of Clostridium novyi-NT fell ill with sepsis and/or gas gangrene, leading researchers to set the maximum tolerated dose at 1 million spores.\n\nResearchers also found the bacteria in the bloodstream of a couple of patients, meaning that the infection will need to be carefully tracked, Janku said.\n\n\"That didn't result in clostridium seeding anywhere else outside the injected region, but it's a theoretical possibility since we were able to detect it in the blood culture of one or two patients,\" Janku said.\n\nPatients also could be susceptible to immune response side effects, such as low blood pressure or fever, he added.\n\nThe trial results were to be presented Sunday at the International Cancer Immunotherapy Conference, in New York City.

The sensitivity may also trigger or exacerbate headaches.\n\nWhile sunglasses can provide some relief from photophobia, wearing them all the time is not always a practical solution, nor is it pleasant for patients to live in a dark room for days at a time. A new study from the University of Cincinnati (UC), published online this week in the Journal of Athletic Training, assessed the use of colored lenses in post-concussion patients and found wearing certain color-tinted sunglasses may be a good alternative to dark sunglasses.\n\n\"While sunglasses can provide some relief, they are not very practical indoors or in low light environments,\" says Joe Clark, PhD, professor in the Department of Neurology and Rehabilitation Medicine at the UC College of Medicine and lead author of the study. \"What is needed is a light mitigation strategy that can be readily employed indoors, which can optimize relief in those who suffer from photophobia, or light sensitivity.\"\n\nClark and researchers at the College of Medicine assessed visual symptoms of 51 concussion patients and used frames with varying colored lenses to find out if certain hues provided relief from photophobia.\n\n\"We found that 85 percent of patients reporting photophobia had relief of the symptoms with one or more colors-- blue, green, red and purple--with no reported adverse events,\" Clark says.\n\n\"Sensitivity to light can be common and impact activities of daily life suggesting that light mitigation might improve quality of life in many of these patients. Photophobia is a common symptom for patients following traumatic brain injury. Our goal in this study was to provide medical staff like athletic trainers with a method and means to assess and subsequently provide relief to an athlete who may be experiencing symptoms of photophobia,\" Clark adds.\n\nThe goal is to help the concussion patient feel better as the brain heals. \"We compare the colored glasses to being like a brace or cast but for the brain,\" he says. \"It is temporary but prevents further injury or pain.\"\n\nAt least 3.8 million people in the United States sustain a concussion or traumatic brain injury every year, many not for the first time. As with many other health conditions, the presentation of concussion symptoms can vary greatly--while some individuals exhibit very little to no change in functionality and may report no symptoms at all, others may report confusion, headache, decreased balance and vision disturbances including blurry vision, trouble focusing and sensitivity to light.\n\nPhotophobia is so common that many neurosurgical intensive care units consider it standard operating procedure to keep lights dimmed in rooms containing TBI patients says Clark.\n\nIn addition to trying colored-lens sunglasses, the article suggests other ways to mitigate photophobia including wearing a wide-brimmed hat when outdoors, adjusting digital screen and device settings to an appropriate hue and brightness or purchasing filters for screens. However, the researchers noted, they do not recommend wearing colored glasses while driving. Certain colors make seeing stop lights or emergency vehicle lights difficult.\n\n\"We believe that an athletic trainer, in consultation with team physicians, may find it useful to apply this photophobia assessment and recommend colored glasses to his or her athlete,\" Clark says. \"The use of the colored glasses in the high school, college or other setting can allow a person to engage in some medically approved activities, while minimizing the risk of symptom exacerbation. We believe the use of the colored glasses that provide photophobia mitigation has added benefits superior to dark sunglasses, especially for indoor lighting.\"\n\nAdditional researchers on the study include Jon Divine, MD, a professor in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at the UC College of Medicine and head team physician for University of Cincinnati Athletics.\n\nThere was no funding used for this study.", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The release states, \u201cThere was no funding used for this study.\u201d", "answer": 1}, {"article": "WEDNESDAY, Aug. 15, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- For women with advanced breast cancer who carry the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations, an experimental drug could improve survival, a new study suggests.\n\nThe BRCA mutations are linked with a greater risk for aggressive breast and ovarian cancer. The drug, talazoparib, works by blocking an enzyme called poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), thus preventing cancer cells from killing healthy ones.\n\nIn a phase 3 trial of 431 women, funded by the drug's maker, those who received talazoparib lived longer without their cancer progressing than women treated with standard chemotherapy by an average of three months, researchers found.\n\n\"For women with metastatic breast cancer and a BRCA mutation, PARP inhibitors may be considered for their treatment,\" said lead researcher Dr. Jennifer Litton, an associate professor of breast medical oncology at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.\n\nWhen it's functioning properly, BRCA actually helps repair damaged DNA and prevents tumors, but when BRCA1 and BRCA2 go awry, they encourage breast cancers.\n\nPARP inhibitors such as talazoparib appear to interfere with the function of mutated BRCA in breast cells, causing them to die rather replicate.\n\nIn addition, several ongoing studies are looking at combinations with PARP inhibitors \"to try to expand who may benefit or lengthen how long they may work,\" Litton said.\n\nThe trial results are preliminary, as talazoparib has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nIn January, the FDA approved the first PARP inhibitor, Lynparza, to treat BRCA-mutated breast cancer.\n\nSimilar drugs have already been used to treat advanced, BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer, according to the agency.\n\nIn the current trial, the women who were randomly selected to receive talazoparib had a higher response rate to treatment than women who received standard chemotherapy: 63 percent versus 27 percent, the researchers found.\n\nThe drug does have side effects.

It's also been approved for that use in the 27 European Union countries and several others.\n\nTykerb had sales of $189 million last year.

About two-thirds of breast cancers are hormone sensitive.\n\nIf approved, Tykerb \u2013 known as Tyverb in Europe \u2013 will be used along with another drug that prevents hormones from making cancer cells multiply.\n\nNormally women with advanced, hormone-sensitive breast cancer get a hormonal drug \u2013 one that blocks estrogen from attaching to cell receptors and making cancer cells multiply \u2013 along with chemotherapy.\n\nBut chemotherapy medicines, which often are given intravenously, attack healthy cells as well as cancerous ones, causing nasty side effects such as vomiting and hair loss that limit how much of those medicines can be given.\n\nIn addition, \"at a certain point in time, the cells don't respond anymore to the hormonal therapy,\" said Dr. Debasish Roychowdhury, head of oncology medicines development at GlaxoSmithKline.\n\nTykerb works by attaching to two other cell receptors and ultimately making the cells die or stop multiplying.

Then, moments after birth, that cord is severed.\n\nNow, research suggests there may be benefits to keeping mom and baby attached a few minutes longer.\n\nThose benefits, researchers say, likely have to do with iron.\n\nWaiting a few minutes before clamping the umbilical cord allows more iron-rich blood from the placenta to reach the newborn.\n\nIron deficiency occurs in about one in six American babies, and it's more common among those clamped quickly, said Ola Andersson, a neonatologist and pediatrician at Uppsala University in Sweden, who led a study published today in JAMA Pediatrics. Babies who are anemic often appear tired and pale.\n\nHis previous research has shown that babies whose cords were clamped a few minutes later than usual were 90% less likely than others to have iron-deficiency anemia when they were 4 months old.\n\nThe benefits of those extra few minutes may last a long time.\n\nIn the new study, Andersson found that healthy, full-term newborns whose umbilical cords were left attached for three extra minutes had better fine motor control when they reached preschool than those clamped immediately. Some 4-year-old boys who were clamped later even appeared to have better social skills.\n\nIron is essential to the developing brain, he said, and deficiencies during early months \u2014 perhaps linked to early clamping \u2014 could affect nerve and muscle control, making it harder for the child to later control a pen or interact comfortably with peers.\n\nAndersson's study marks the first time researchers have followed children to see whether the clamping makes a difference later in life. In 2011, he published a study of 400 healthy, full-term babies showing that those clamped later fared better; the new study of 263 of those children extends those findings by nearly four years.\n\nBoys showed more benefit than girls, probably because they are more likely to be iron-deficient, Andersson said.\n\nImmediate clamping started about 70 years ago out of concern that leaving the delivered infant attached to the placenta could rob the mother of too much blood.\n\nBut those doctors overestimated the benefit to the mother and didn't look at the impact their change had on the babies, said Heike Rabe, a researcher at Brighton and Sussex Medical School and University Hospitals, in the United Kingdom, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.\n\nFor babies born at full-term, \"we should trust nature more than we do now,\" she said.\n\nRabe has published reviews showing that delaying clamping for 30 seconds, or squeezing the umbilical cord to get the blood out faster, is also better for premature babies.\n\nMany countries and professional organizations, including the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have called on obstetricians to delay cord clamping in premature babies when feasible. There was not enough evidence before to extend that recommendation to full-term babies, but Rabe thinks this study should tip the balance in favor of delay.\n\nKjersti Aagaard, vice chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital, is more skeptical.

When it comes to the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease, the oral drug levodopa has long been considered the gold standard, improving quality of life and longevity. But as the disease progresses, the effects of the medication can partially wear off more quickly after each dose, leaving people to experience \u201coff\u201d time, which are periods of immobility related to temporary unresponsiveness to medication. Parkinson\u2019s symptoms, such as slowness and muscle rigidity, often make movement difficult. \u201cIf a person with Parkinson\u2019s disease can reduce their \u2018off\u2019 times, that can have a great impact on their everyday life,\u201d said study author Regina Katzenschlager, MD, of Danube Hospital, affiliated with the Medical University of Vienna, Austria. \u201cIn some patients in the trial, the insecurity of unpredictable periods of incapacity was completely alleviated.\u201d The drug apomorphine, first produced in 1865, was first used to treat advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease in the United States in 1950. Its use grew in the 1990s when European doctors starting using subcutaneous infusions of the drug to treat fluctuations in mobility that could not be controlled by the pills. Despite its use in many countries of the world, high-level evidence from randomized, blinded studies of its effectiveness and safety has up until now been lacking. In this phase III study, researchers recruited 107 people with advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease from 23 centers in seven countries. Participants were randomly selected to receive either apomorphine subcutaneous infusion or a placebo saline infusion. The infusion was administered over a period of 14 to 18 hours each day via a small portable pump similar to the sort used in the treatment of type 1 diabetes. The study found that those who were given apomorphine had a significantly greater reduction of \u201coff\u201d time than those who were given the placebo infusion, with, on average, 2.5 hours less \u201coff\u201d time per day, while those who received the placebo infusion had an average 30 minutes per day reduction in \u201coff\u201d time. This improvement was apparent within the first week of treatment. At the same time, for those who received apomorphine, there was an increase of \u201con\u201d time without the abnormal involuntary movements known as dyskinesias that are often observed with levodopa. Participants were also asked to evaluate how well they thought the treatment worked. Those who received apomorphine gave their treatment higher scores at week 12 than those who received the placebo infusion. In the apomorphine group, 71 percent of patients felt improved, compared to 18 percent on placebo, whereas 19 percent worsened on apomorphine compared to 45 percent on placebo. Apomorphine was generally well tolerated and there were no serious side effects. \u201cIt is our hope that these findings confirming the efficacy of apomorphine infusion will encourage doctors in the United States to offer this treatment to their patients and assess its efficacy in their own clinical practice,\u201d said Katzenschlager.

Risk reduction [was] probably in the range of 80 to 95 percent,\" said researcher Timothy Rebbeck, an epidemiologist at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nAnd women who had ovaries removed reduced their risk of ovarian cancer by as much as 80 percent.\n\nThe study findings are extremely reassuring to Rebbeck -- no breast cancer diagnoses among women who had double mastectomies after three years of follow-up. Among the women who did not have the surgery, 7 percent were later diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nRebbeck says these decreases are big but are cautions that cancer risk will never be brought down to zero. That's because all the tissue is never completely taken out.\n\n\"Breast tissue is found throughout the torso and can't be completely removed through surgical means. And, with ovarian cancer, the ovary leaves behind cells that could go on to become cancerous. So, it's just not possible to remove all the tissue that might be at risk,\" he says.\n\nOne of the women who decided to take that chance is 61-year-old Toby of New Jersey. (Because she's worried about her health coverage, she doesn't want her last name used.)\n\nToby's mother died of ovarian cancer when Toby was in her 20s. Researchers now know that disease is linked, along with breast cancer, to genetic mutations.\n\nToby had first her ovaries and then both breasts removed after she tested positive for the BRCA genes about five years ago.\n\nBut at first, she had hoped to avoid the surgery.\n\n\"After my genetic testing, they would alternate mammogram with MRI every six months. I thought I was getting very, very good surveillance, and I thought that would probably be enough and they would be able to diagnose something very, very early and be able to cure me if I were to get breast cancer,\" she says.\n\nBut her doctors thought otherwise. Breast cancer caused by BRCA mutations is particularly aggressive. And they told Toby her lifetime risk of that type of cancer was as high as 90 percent.\n\nToby was one of the women researchers from around the country tracked in the study to see how they fared after having this surgery.\n\nWomen like Toby who chose both ovary and breast removal had dramatically lower risks of getting both cancers after the surgery. Only 3 percent of those who had surgery died, compared with 10 percent of those who did not, during the follow-up period.\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the study, Virginia Kaklamani, an oncologist at Northwestern University, says lives can be saved if women have genetic testing.\n\n\"A lot of times I see these women having had a very preventable type of breast cancer. Preventable because I can identify the fact that they had a higher risk of getting breast cancer,\" she says.\n\n\"Had they been genetically tested a few years prior to my seeing them, they would have had the option of having bilateral mastectomy. So, we could have prevented these breast cancers and we didn't,\" says Kaklamani.\n\nFor Toby, it's been about a year since her double mastectomy. She's had reconstruction. And, today, she says she feels physically strong again. But she now feels an emotional empowerment, and that comforts her.\n\n\"My mother left me when I was 26, and it was extremely painful and traumatic for my entire life,\" she says. \"I just didn't want to do that for my children. I had a chance to control that and to fight what my mother never had a chance for.\"\n\nOncologist Kaklamani says women with the BRCA mutation should be counseled about genetic testing, and strongly consider it.\n\nWhile surgical decisions are up to patients, the findings of this study should help them decide what to do, she says.\n\nToby has a daughter who decided to take the test, based on her mother's experience.

However, the procedure doesn't work for everyone and there are risks of complications, researchers report.\n\nAtrial fibrillation increases the risk of early death by two times in women and 1.5 times in men. It causes 20 to 30 percent of all strokes and can decrease quality of life due to palpitations, shortness of breath, tiredness, weakness and psychological distress, the study authors explained.\n\nAbout 2.7 million Americans suffer from atrial fibrillation, according to the American Heart Association.\n\nFor those whose atrial fibrillation can't be controlled with medications, catheter ablation may be recommended.\n\n\"Catheter ablation is a valid alternative for the management of atrial fibrillation with a satisfactory success rate,\" said study lead researcher Dr. Elena Arbelo.\n\nBut the procedure can have complications, which should be considered carefully by doctors and patients, said Arbelo, a senior specialist in the Cardiovascular Institute at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona in Spain.\n\nComplications can include fluid buildup around the heart, called cardiac tamponade, which makes it difficult for the heart to pump blood. Other complications include stroke or mini-stroke, Arbelo said.\n\nIn addition, many patients need to continue blood thinners and medications that control irregular heartbeats after the procedure, she explained.\n\nDuring the procedure, a wire is threaded through the blood vessels into the heart and used to burn or freeze small areas of the upper chamber, called the atrium.\n\nThe burning or freezing creates a scar and stops abnormal electrical signals that cause the irregular heart rhythm, Arbelo said.\n\nAccording to Dr. Hugh Calkins, \"Atrial fibrillation ablation is a well-established procedure that has imperfect results.\" Calkins is a professor of medicine and director of the cardiac arrhythmia service at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.\n\nThe complication rate is higher than hoped, and the success rate is lower than hoped, he said.\n\n\"Patients don't get a lifetime certificate saying you're cured,\" Calkins said. \"For one in four patients, atrial fibrillation comes back five years after the procedure. Patients should not be going into this thinking they will have a 99 percent cure rate with no risk,\" he added.\n\nThe new study included information from more than 3,600 patients in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. Their average age was 59, and all had undergone catheter ablation.\n\nAblation was successful in 74 percent of patients, Arbelo said. These patients had no atrial arrhythmias -- irregular heart beats -- for three to 12 months after the procedure.\n\nAccording to Arbelo, 91 percent of patients choose to have ablation to relieve symptoms, while 66 percent do so to improve their quality of life.\n\nAtrial arrhythmias in the first three months after ablation were classified as early recurrences and not considered as failures, Arbelo said. In addition, 45 percent of patients who had a successful procedure were still taking antiarrhythmia drugs 12 months later.\n\nAbout 11 percent suffered complications during the year after the ablation, she said.\n\nAfter the procedure, patients with two or more risk factors for stroke should be prescribed oral blood thinners, while those with no risk factors don't need them, Arbelo suggested.\n\nThe study investigators found that 27 percent of patients with two or more risk factors for stroke were not on blood thinners, but one-third of low-risk patients were taking them.\n\nDr. Gregg Fonarow is a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. He said, \"Relief of symptoms in patients with atrial fibrillation can be challenging.\"\n\nIn certain patients, catheter ablation may reduce symptoms, improve quality of life and increase exercise capacity, though the impact on death and hospitalization risk is still being evaluated, he noted.\n\n\"Of concern is that complication rates are still higher than desirable for this procedure, and there was suboptimal use of stroke-preventing anticoagulation [anti-clotting] therapy after the procedure,\" added Fonarow, who was not involved with the study.\n\n\"Further trials are needed to evaluate the benefits and risks of catheter ablation and its potential role as first-line therapy,\" he suggested.\n\nCatheter ablation is covered by most insurance, including Medicare, the researchers said.\n\nThe report was published online recently in the European Heart Journal.\n\nFor more about atrial fibrillation, visit the American Heart Association.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story does quote two cardiologists unconnected to the study, but fails to disclose possible conflicts of interest among the researchers.

Naloxone is a prescription drug that can reverse the effects of prescription opioid and heroin overdose, and can be life-saving if administered in time.\n\nAccording to the study findings, advanced EMS staff were more likely than basic EMS staff to administer naloxone. A majority of states have adopted national guidelines that prohibit basic EMS staff from administering the drug as an injection. As of 2014, only 12 states allowed basic EMS staff to administer naloxone for a suspected opioid overdose; all 50 states allow advanced EMS staff to administer the overdose reversal treatment.\n\n\u201cOpioid overdose deaths are devastating families and communities, especially in rural areas,\u201d said CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H. \u201cMany of these deaths can be prevented by improving prescribing practices to prevent opioid addiction, expanding the use of medication-assisted treatment, and increasing use of naloxone for suspected overdoses. Having trained EMS staff to administer naloxone in rural areas will save lives.\u201d\n\nTo reduce opioid overdose deaths, particularly in rural areas, CDC recommends expanding training on the administration of naloxone to all emergency service staff, and helping basic EMS personnel meet the advanced certification requirements.\n\n\u201cNaloxone can be given nasally to a person suspected of overdose, allowing basic EMS staff to administer the drug without injection,\u201d said CDC Senior Health Scientist Mark Faul, Ph.D., M.A. \u201cNaloxone is non-addictive, and expanding training on how to administer the drug can help basic emergency medical service staff reverse an opioid overdose and save more lives.\u201d\n\nNational Emergency Medicine Service Information System data for 2012 were reviewed to better understand factors associated with naloxone administration, including demographic data, 911 call information, and details about the scene of an injury or illness as reported by EMS staff.\n\nThe findings indicate naloxone was most likely to be administered to women, people between the ages of 20 and 29, and people living in suburban areas.\n\nIn general, the rate of opioid overdose death was 45 percent higher in rural areas compared with urban areas. The use of naloxone by rural EMS staff, however, was only 22.5 percent higher when compared with urban EMS naloxone use.\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M.

In most cases, the lump or lesion is benign or noncancerous and does not require further treatment.\n\nBiopsies may be performed via open surgery on the breast or with a less invasive core-needle biopsy in which a small sample of breast tissue from the affected area is removed through a special needle inserted through the skin.\n\nResearchers say needle biopsy has fewer complications and a shorter recovery time than open surgical biopsy, but some women and doctors may have concerns about the accuracy of the procedure compared with traditional open surgery methods of breast cancer diagnosis.\n\nIn the study, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers reviewed 83 studies on the two methods.\n\nThe results showed that core needle biopsies were about as accurate as open surgery at detecting cancerous vs. noncancerous breast lesions.\n\nNeedle biopsies also had a much lower rate of complications (less than 1% compared with 2%-10% with open surgery).\n\nIn addition, the study showed women initially diagnosed with breast cancer with needle biopsy were more likely to be treated with a single breast cancer surgery than those initially diagnosed by open surgical biopsy.\n\n\"Based on currently available evidence, it appears reasonable to substitute core needle biopsy procedures for open surgical biopsy given the comparable sensitivity and lower complication rates,\" write researcher Wendy Bruening, PhD, of the ECRI Institute Evidence-Based Practices Center in Plymouth Meeting, Pa., and colleagues.

Less obvious symptoms include depression, insomnia, anxiety, fatigue and constipation.\n\nNeurological disorders that mimic the symptoms of Parkinson's disease are called atypical parkinsonism disorders.\n\nMany doctors cannot tell whether a patient has Parkinson's disease or atypical parkinsonism.\n\n\"This can be very challenging, especially during the early stages of the diseases and if the responsible doctor is not a neurologist specialized in movement disorders,\" said Dr. Oskar Hansson, lead author of the new study, a neurologist and an associate professor at Lund University in Sweden.\n\nNon-specialists \"do not really know exactly what questions to ask the patient and the special signs to look for,\" Hansson wrote in an email. Yet patients with atypical disorders \"usually have a much worse prognosis, with faster disease progression, (with) more disabling symptoms\" than Parkinson's patients, so early identification is crucial.\n\nThe correct diagnosis is also key to treatment since \"most patients with atypical parkinsonism disorders do not respond well to dopamine-targeting medications\" that are usually prescribed for Parkinson's patients, Hansson said.\n\nHansson and his colleagues developed a blood test that is, essentially, a variation on an existing test capable of detecting neurofilament light chain protein in spinal fluid. This protein is a component of nerve cells, and when these cells die, it can be detected in both spinal fluid and blood.\n\nBecause spinal fluid is not easily obtained by a primary care doctor, this diagnostic test is not very useful, so Hansson developed a blood test and investigated its accuracy in the new study.\n\nWhen validating a new biomarker for disease, \"one should always analyze at least two different (groups of patients and controls) to make sure that the results are reproducible,\" said Hansson, who added that participants should also include both early- and late-stage patients established at different clinics.\n\nAll told, a total of 244 people with Parkinson's and 79 healthy volunteers serving as a comparison group participated in Hansson's study, along with 181 patients with atypical parkinsonism disorders.\n\nOf these, 88 patients had multiple system atrophy, which impairs the body's involuntary functions such as heart rate, blood pressure and digestion.\n\nSeventy patients had progressive supranuclear palsy, which affects movement, walking, balance, speech, swallowing, vision, mood and thinking.\n\nAnd 23 patients had corticobasal degeneration, which causes decreased movement on one side of the body, muscle rigidity, tremor and a disconnection between thought and action.\n\nTesting these participants, the researchers found that nerve protein levels ranged higher in people with atypical parkinsonism and lower in patients with Parkinson's disease as well as the healthy volunteers. However, the test cannot distinguish between the different atypical disorders, which doctors must rely on symptoms to diagnose.\n\nBlood test accuracy is defined based on sensitivity, the percentage of positives that are correctly identified, and specificity, the percentage of negatives that are correctly identified. In Sweden, the blood test had a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 91%, while in the United Kingdom, sensitivity was 80% and specificity 90%. For early-stage study participants, generally, sensitivity was 70% and specificity was 80%.\n\nOverall, the blood test showed equal accuracy as the spinal fluid test when diagnosing Parkinson's or an atypical parkinsonism disorder, in both early and later stages of disease.\n\nHansson imagines that blood-based tests will be used in the future \"in the diagnostic work-up of patients with parkinsonism by most doctors who are not very specialized with these movement disorders.\" He also believes the test will be used by specialists for Parkinson's patients who \"do not exhibit a very typical symptomatology\" or do not respond as expected to treatment.\n\nThough atypical parkinsonism conditions look very similar to Parkinson's at first, they \"have a different underlying molecular cause,\" according to Bronstein, and so it is important to recognize them early in order to treat them properly. \"Disease-specific therapies are now in trials, so accurate diagnosis is essential in determining if these new treatments work,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Dr. Paul Wright, chairman of neurology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, New York, and Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York, the importance of this study is that it brings to light that there are new biomarker tests that can delineate between these neurological diseases.\n\n\"A lot of time, people come in and say they or a family member has a tremor, and they believe it's Parkinson's disease,\" said Wright, who also was not involved in the study. This early assumption may impede diagnosis of a less recognized atypical parkinsonism condition.\n\nOr a patient has \"horrible blood pressure fluctuations,\" Wright said, and no obvious tremor or rigidity symptoms, so a doctor suspects a heart condition. Instead, the cause is multiple system atrophy, a neurodegenerative disease. Though other symptoms will show up eventually and help in diagnosing the patient, in the meantime, the patient will be receiving the wrong medicines.\n\nAn accurate blood test, then, would be good news in these situations.\n\n\"It's a lot more reassuring to a patient to say 'we're just going to take a blood test to check for a few things,' \" Wright said. \"It's much easier and less anxiety-provoking for patients than taking a spinal tap.\"\n\nUp until now, many diseases have been diagnosed based on symptoms, with patients asking, \"How do you know I have this?\" Meanwhile, doctors are not always correct, Wright said. This is true even of Parkinson's, which is diagnosed based on symptoms, a patient's history, neurological exams, a patient's response to medicine and, in some cases, brain imaging tests.\n\nStill, Wright is hopeful and believes a biomarker test for Parkinson's \"will be down the line. ... In general, researchers are looking for biomarkers of disease.\"\n\nSpecialists and sub-specialists are available only in big cities, Wright said, and access to a simple blood test would enable a correct diagnosis in a primary care office.\n\n\"We always assume there's luxury,\" Wright said. \"But that's not really what's real in most of the country.\"", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story included two independent sources not connected with the research.\nHowever, several of the authors in the study had connections to companies that work on this kind of test, and that wasn\u2019t disclosed in the story.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "The Food and Drug Administration approved a second version of a groundbreaking treatment Wednesday that genetically alters patients' cells to attack cancer \u2014 this time, to fight aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nThe treatment is for adults with certain types of large B-cell lymphoma who have not responded to or who have relapsed after at least two other kinds of treatment, such as chemotherapy and bone-marrow transplants. The group numbers about 7,500 patients a year in the United States.\n\nThe one-time infusion, known as CAR T-cell therapy, is made by Kite Pharma, which is based in Santa Monica, Calif., and recently was bought by Gilead Sciences for $11.9 billion. Kite announced Wednesday that the treatment's brand name will be Yescarta and its price will be $373,000.\n\nIn late August, the FDA cleared the first CAR T-cell therapy, which is designed for children and young adults whose leukemia doesn't respond to standard treatments. About 600 patients in the United States fall into that category every year. Kymriah, which costs $475,000, is manufactured by Novartis.\n\nBiotech analysts had expected the Kite price to be lower than Kymriah's, in part because the number of eligible patients is larger and the response rates are lower. Even so, Yescarta's cost is likely to stoke the ongoing debate about high drug prices.\n\nThe FDA approval is the latest step forward for the fast-moving field of immunotherapy, which aims to bolster the immune system to attack malignancies. CAR T-cell therapies are among several approaches, along with treatments called checkpoint inhibitors and cancer vaccines, but they have recently grabbed much of the attention. Dozens of other companies also are working on them.\n\n\u201cToday, marks another milestone in the development of a whole new scientific paradigm for the treatment of serious diseases,\u201d FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement, adding that the approval demonstrates \u201cthe continued momentum of this promising new area of medicine.\u201d\n\nA CAR T-cell therapy involves a complicated and customized procedure in which T cells \u2014 sometimes called the foot soldiers of the immune system \u2014 are removed from the patient. They are sent to a special lab and genetically modified to target a protein on the surface of the patient's cancer cells.

An independent review committee found that 72 percent of patients treated with a single infusion responded to therapy, including 51 percent who then showed no evidence of remaining cancer. Kite has said that at six months, 44 percent of patients were still responding, with 39 percent having no sign of cancer.\n\n\u201cThis is not just an incremental benefit,\u201d said David Chang, Kite's chief medical officer. \u201cIt raises the potential that a cure can be possible.\u201d Some of the first patients who underwent treatment now have been in remission for three to five years, he said, although he cautioned that it's still too early to know whether those patients are cured.\n\nLocke said about 13 percent of patients in the trial had a severe side effect known as cytokine release syndrome, which produces high fevers, low blood pressure and other flulike symptoms. Twenty-eight percent had neurological \u201cevents,\u201d such as severe confusion; three patients died of complications caused by the treatment.\n\n\u201cThese are patients who knew they were out of options,\u201d he said, noting that lymphoma patients who relapse or don't respond to treatment have just a 50 percent chance of surviving for six months.\n\nBecause of the side effects, the treatment will carry a boxed warning, the FDA's most serious. In addition, the agency is requiring hospitals and clinics that dispense Yescarta to be certified after undergoing special training.\n\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults. This type of cancer begins in the immune system and can be fast- or slow-growing, the FDA noted.\n\nKite's CAR T-cell product was developed years ago at the National Cancer Institute by pioneering scientist Steven Rosenberg and licensed to the company for commercialization.\n\nArmin Ghobadi, an oncologist at Siteman who was an investigator in the Kite trial, said the new treatment is \u201cjust the first step\u201d and that researchers are working to make it safer and more effective.

That was the conclusion of a new study published today in the journal Molecular Therapy Oncolytics by scientists from The Gene Editing Institute of the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute at Christiana Care Health System.\n\nThe study reports that in both tissue culture and in a mouse, tumor growth stopped and there was a dramatic decrease in the volume of existing tumors when chemotherapy was combined with CRIPSP-Cas9, which was used to disable a tumor gene known as NRF2. Previous studies have shown that the NRF2 gene controls cell functions in lung cancer tumors that helps them thwart the effect of chemotherapies that might otherwise reduce or eliminate them entirely.\n\n\"Our goal is to see if CRISPR can be used with chemotherapy to provide a safe, affordable way to give patients who are not responding to treatment at least a fighting chance against this very challenging cancer,\" said Eric Kmiec, Ph.D., the principal author of the study and the director of the Gene Editing Institute. \"We believe that finding ways to use CRISPR to improve existing treatments will lead to some of the first benefits for patients while we tackle the vital ethical issues around the use of CRISPR for edits that can be passed on through DNA. This is an exciting step in the journey of exploring the health benefits of gene editing.\"\n\nThe study was led by Pawel Bialk, research scientist at the Gene Editing Institute, the nation's only CRISPR-focused research initiative situated in a community health care system.\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Dr. Kmiec said there are chemotherapies that have helped patients achieve remission or at least live longer and enjoy a better quality of life by significantly slowing the progress of the disease. But he said some patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, the most common form of lung cancer, are resistant to chemotherapy agents used to treat the disease or develop resistance after being exposed to the drugs.\n\nDr. Kmiec said the lung cancer work reflects an approach adopted by the Gene Editing Institute to move cautiously in developing medical applications of gene editing. Based inside the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute at Christiana Care, his research team gains unique insight into the lives and needs of cancer patients and the health care professionals who care for them, which helps them to maintain a strong focus on doing what's right for patients.\n\nDr. Kmiec noted that while his team is working to move into human trials, the CRISPR application being developed for lung cancer does not involve directly editing a patient's genome --only the genes in the tumor.\n\nCRISPR stands for \"clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats.\" It was originally a defense mechanism found in bacteria that allows the bacteria to recognize and slice up the DNA of invading viruses. Scientists have learned how to manipulate this mechanism so that it essentially can be programmed to find and remove a specific sequence of DNA code--which acts like software for controlling biological activity in a cell. Cas9 is a reference to an enzyme, sometimes described as a form of \"molecular scissors,\" that is used by CRISPR to cut out a section of DNA code.\n\nDr. Kmiec said there are many efforts under way to modify CRISPR so that it can be used to not only remove or \"knock out\" a section DNA, but also to replace or \"knock in\" a new strand of code. But he said there continues to be significant safety concerns around this type of CRISPR application. He said for now, his team is focused on \"using CRISPR in its native form, which is to just cut out a section of DNA,\" and to start with applications that do not directly impact the patient's DNA. He said using CRISPR to do things like improving drug response represents the \"low-hanging fruit\" of CRISPR patient applications.\n\n\"We think it's best to start with CRISPR therapies that involve relatively conservative uses of this powerful tool,\" Dr. Kmiec said. \"This approach can also hopefully help contain costs and provide a level of safety and reliability that is reassuring for patients and increases the chance that insurance companies will provide coverage.\"\n\nDr. Kmiec said that as a CRISPR research program that treats patients from across the economic spectrum, his scientists are keenly aware of the challenges of making cutting edge medical treatments accessible and beneficial for all patients.\n\n\"This work is another significant step on the pathway to FDA approval,\" said Nicholas J. Petrelli, M.D., FACS, Bank of America endowed medical director of the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute. \"The Gene Editing Institute is taking a careful and methodical approach to developing innovative therapies. Dr. Kmiec and his team interact with our oncologists who deal with lung cancer every day on how gene editing could have a realistic impact and improve treatment.

But while the research clearly shows that the interval between diagnosis and death was longer in screened patients, it does not definitively show they lived longer -- a subtle difference with significant public health consequences.\n\nLung cancer kills about 162,000 Americans a year and is the leading cause of cancer death in men and women.

Nearly 3 million people in the United States have the condition. It is often marked by elevated internal eye pressure, called intraocular pressure. Medicated eye drops taken daily or twice daily can lower internal eye pressure to help prevent damage to the optic nerve. But studies show that many patients do not take glaucoma eye drops as directed due to factors such as forgetfulness or physical limitations like arthritis. 1 Some studies show that half of patients stop taking their prescription glaucoma eye drops after a year, leaving them vulnerable to vision loss. 2\n\nResearchers are tackling this challenge of medication adherence with new drug delivery methods. One technology involves a thin silicone ring suffused with medication that slowly releases over time. An ophthalmologist fits the patient with the ring. No surgery is required. The ring is designed to be replaced by an ophthalmologist every six months. This eliminates the need for glaucoma patients to regularly put in medicated eye drops themselves.\n\nOphthalmologists at 10 sites nationwide tested the ring in a phase 2 clinical trial on patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. In the study, 64 patients received the topical ocular insert containing the glaucoma drug bimatoprost. They were also supplied artificial tears. The control group of 66 patients wore an insert treated with no drug but twice a day used 0.5 percent timolol drops, the regulatory benchmark for glaucoma drugs. Eye pressure in the bimatoprost group fell 3.2 to 6.4 mmHg over six months, in comparison to 4.2 to 6.4 mmHG for the timolol group. Overall, eye pressure decreased in the group wearing the bimatoprost ring by about 20 percent from the initial measurements over six months.\n\nAuthors said the device was well-tolerated and safe, with a high retention rate of 89 percent for both groups at six months. The ring became dislodged in 15 patients but was replaced each time, allowing therapy to continue.

But a team from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City said the technology could help identify cases where prostate cancer has spread to the bone.\n\nRadiotracers work by injecting a small amount of a compound tagged with a radionuclide into patients. Using positron emission tomography -- also known as a PET scan -- doctors are then able to better visualize tumors and tumor spread.\n\nIn studies involving mice with prostate cancer, the researchers had the radiotracer hone in on prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the same prostate cancer marker used in the PSA test. They found that the PSA gravitated to tissues containing prostate cancer that had already grown resistant to standard hormone-based therapies.\n\nThe study also revealed the radiotracer could help identify cases where prostate cancer had spread to the bone. The researchers pointed out traditional bone scans are unable to differentiate between malignant and nonmalignant lesions.\n\nThe findings were to be presented Saturday at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting in Chicago, and are also being published in Cancer Discovery.\n\nIf used on people, the researchers claimed that the radiotracer might someday help doctors \"personalize\" treatment strategies for prostate cancer and better manage the disease.\n\n\"The ultimate goal is to be able to predict the response of patients to new and existing therapies at an early stage, thereby personalizing their treatment and improving outcomes,\" Michael J. Evans, research fellow in the Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, explained in meeting news release.\n\nEncouraged by their findings, the study's authors said they hope to begin a human trial next year.\n\nTwo prostate cancer experts said the tool, if borne out in patients, could prove very useful.\n\nDr. Michael Schwartz is director of laparoscopy and minimally invasive surgery at North Shore-LIJ Health System in Lake Success, N.Y. He noted that, as of now, doctors typically rely on results of the PSA blood test and/or standard diagnostic scans to help guide treatment decisions.\n\nBoth methods have their limits and, \"while this study is very preliminary, if this radiotracer technology can prove to detect very early recurrence or metastasis in human patients, it could become extremely useful in either the pre- or post-treatment setting in selecting a treatment algorithm,\" Schwartz said. \"It also may help reduce the need for biopsy of possible metastatic lesions.\"\n\nDr. Erik Goluboff, an attending urologist at Beth Israel Medical Center, New York City, agreed that, \"this is an exciting study using a novel radiotracer to detect PSA-expressing tissues throughout the body.\"\n\nHe believes that the new tool's \"greatest strength would be in monitoring changes in PSA expression in tissues as a result of various treatments. If a treatment showed a marked change, it could continue to be used in that patient, hence \"personalized\" medicine. If a specific change did not occur, that treatment could be abandoned and another tried instead. Since these changes could not be detected based on a PSA blood test alone, this new test would be very helpful in determining early on which therapy to choose in a given patient.\"\n\nHowever, Goluboff also noted that research from animal-based studies does not always pan out in humans and \"further, larger studies are of course required to confirm these findings.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute provides more information on prostate cancer.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Perhaps the only thing that salvaged the story was the story-ending caveat from an independent expert:\n\u2026research from animal-based studies does not always pan out in humans and \u201cfurther, larger studies are of course required to confirm these findings.\u201d", "answer": 1}, {"article": "FRIDAY, May 19, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- A leukemia drug might also effectively treat severe asthma, a small-scale clinical trial suggests.\n\nGleevec (imatinib) reduced the \"twitchiness\" of airways, making them less likely to reflexively constrict when exposed to an allergen or asthma trigger, said senior researcher Dr. Elliot Israel.\n\n\"We showed we could decrease the amount of airway twitchiness by a third,\" Israel said. \"That's a substantial change, and that was significant compared with the placebo group.\"\n\nIsrael is director of the respiratory therapy department at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.\n\nThe drug also improved overall airway function, an effect researchers hadn't expected, Israel said.\n\nPeople whose severe asthma isn't controlled despite use of high-dose steroid medications are at risk of declining lung function and poor quality of life, the researchers said in background notes.\n\nBut, this powerful cancer drug can't be recommended for them on the basis of this small study, Israel and other specialists noted.\n\nGleevec fights leukemia by blocking a specific receptor on cancerous white blood cells, inhibiting their ability to multiply and spread, Israel said.\n\nThat same action also affects mast cells, a type of white blood cell distributed throughout the body that promotes inflammation and causes allergic reactions, Israel said.\n\nFor example, mast cells in the skin are responsible for hives, while mast cells in the lungs have been associated with severe asthma, he said.\n\n\"By blocking the signal that helps keep mast cells alive, we were hoping to reduce the number of these cells,\" Israel said. \"By doing that, we hoped to produce improvements beyond the maximal therapy that these patients with severe asthma are on.\"\n\nIsrael and his colleagues recruited 62 severe asthma sufferers for the study. All received top-notch asthma treatment, and were randomly assigned to take either Gleevec or a placebo pill once daily during the 6-month trial.\n\nBlood tests showed that Gleevec did reduce mast cell activity in patients, Israel said.\n\nFurther, allergy challenge tests showed a decrease in airway reactivity among patients taking Gleevec, the researchers reported. Airways became less likely to close off after exposure to an allergen.\n\nPhysical examinations showed that people taking Gleevec actually experienced a slight overall widening of their airways, Israel added.\n\n\"There was a small but significant improvement in the airway narrowing in these patients, which we didn't expect because we didn't think the mast cells were necessarily promoting that airway narrowing all the time,\" Israel said.\n\nSide-effects were not as severe as expected, he added.

This new research analyzed data from multiple trials to determine the relative effectiveness of various nonsurgical treatments for knee OA. The treatments that were compared and ranked included acetaminophen; ibuprofen; intra-articular (IA) or joint injections of cortisone; platelet-rich plasma (PRP); hyaluronic acid (HA); several NSAIDs, such as naproxen, celecoxib, and diclofenac; and both oral and IA placebo.\n\n\"This is the first comprehensive mixed-comparison analysis comparing best-evidence scientific research and excluding lower quality studies that can bias the outcomes,\" said lead author and orthopaedic surgeon David Jevsevar, MD, MBA. \"Using a statistical ranking technique, we worked to provide evidence regarding which of the most common NSAIDs are most likely to decrease pain and improve function, and we attempted to fill in the gaps in evidence for more inconclusive treatments such as HA, PRP, and corticosteroids.\"\n\nAuthors analyzed 53 randomized controlled trials that examined knee OA treatments for at least 28 days and included a minimum of 30 participants per study group. Knee OA treatments were ranked on a scale of one to five, with one being the most effective.

An analysis of 12 articles also found that results with HA are not significantly different from those with IA placebo for treatment of knee OA.\n\n\"Because knee OA has both a high disease burden and high treatment costs, additional prospective studies using similar outcomes, timelines, and measures of clinically important changes are needed,\" explained Dr. Jevsevar. \"While the information in this analysis is helpful to physicians, patients also can benefit from these findings and use it with their doctors to weigh all possible treatment options.\"\n\nAlthough the use of NSAIDs for arthritic conditions such as knee OA has potential risks, including heart attack and stroke, existing evidence indicates that naproxen has less potential for adverse cardiovascular events.\n\nMore information about the AAOS and JAAOS\n\nFollow the AAOS on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram \n\nFollow the conversation about JAAOS on Twitter\n\nFrom the Department of Orthopaedics, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH (Dr. Jevsevar), American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, Rosemont, IL (Mr. Shores, Mr. Mullen, Ms. Schulte, and Dr. Cummins), and Franciscan Orthopedic Associates, Tacoma, WA (Dr. Brown).

The standard of care for detecting such blood-borne infections is blood culture, but this takes days to complete, only identifies pathogens in less than 30% of patients with fulminant infections, and it is not able to detect toxic fragments of dead pathogens that also drive the exaggerated inflammatory reactions leading to sepsis.\n\nBiomarkers that report elevated inflammation are used clinically in the treatment of patients with sepsis; however, they fail to distinguish inflammation triggered by infectious pathogens from that induced by non-infectious causes, such as burns, traumas and surgeries.\n\nNow, a Wyss Institute team led by Donald Ingber reports in eBioMedicine that it has filled this void with a rapid and specific diagnostic assay that could help physicians decide within an hour whether a patient has a systemic infection and should be hospitalized for aggressive intervention therapy. The potential of this assay to detect pathogen materials was demonstrated in both animal studies and a prospective human clinical study, whose results also suggest that it also could serve as a companion diagnostic to monitor the success of antibiotic and dialysis-like sepsis therapies.\n\n\"Our pathogen detection technology solves both dilemmas: it quickly reports whether infectious pathogens are present in the body, even at early stages of infection before sepsis develops. And it can more specifically identify patients who have excessive inflammation due to systemic infection, rather than other causes,\" said Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., the Wyss Institute's Founding Director, the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and the Vascular Biology Program at Boston Children's Hospital, and Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. \"This assay could become a real game changer in this clinical area, and it also should lead to more judicious use of antibiotics, helping to decrease the worrisome rise we are seeing in antibiotic-resistant organisms.\"\n\n\"In a cohort of emergency room patients with suspected sepsis, we saw that the assay picked up infection within an hour in 85% of patients who exhibited clinical symptoms of sepsis, and equally importantly, it did not falsely predict infection in healthy subjects or patients with inflammation triggered by other causes, such as trauma. On the other hand, blood cultures that we performed in parallel using the same samples only detected pathogens in 18% of the cases,\" said Nathan Shapiro, M.D., Ph.D., Director of Translational Research in the Center for Vascular Biology Research at BIDMC, who worked with Ingber's team to conduct the clinical study. \"This highlights the advance this technology represents.\"\n\nThe diagnostic assay is built on FcMBL, a genetically engineered pathogen-binding protein previously developed by Ingber and Michael Super, a Wyss Senior Staff Scientist who co-leads the Institute's pathogen-detecting effort. FcMBL binds to pathogens and pathogen-released fragments, known as Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) by recognizing carbohydrate molecules on their surface.\n\nPrevious efforts in Ingber's team at the Wyss Institute have established FcMBL as a key component of an advanced dialysis-like, pathogen-extracting therapeutic device, and of a method for the fast retrieval of infectious pathogens from complex clinical samples to enable their identification and antibody susceptibilities.\n\n\"In our latest work, we show that the FcMBL-based pathogen-detecting assay is considerably faster and more accurate than any other available assay for systemic infection. We are currently working to ready it for high-throughput use in clinical and point of care situations and to accelerate it even further,\" said Mark Cartwright, Ph.D., a Staff Scientist at the Wyss Institute and a lead-author on the study.\n\nAs a prerequisite to their clinical study, the Wyss Institute's team had successfully tested the assay in rat and pig models of infection with pathogenic E. coli bacteria.\n\n\"The animal models clearly told us that the assay can sensitively trace spikes of PAMPs released during antibiotic therapy, or residual infectious PAMP materials, even when no living bacteria circulate anymore in blood but they remain hidden inside internal organs. Thus, this assay could be an excellent tool for monitoring ongoing infection and responses to antibiotics and dialysis-like therapies for severe infections and sepsis,\" said Mike Super, Ph.D.\n\nTogether, the findings suggest that the FcMBL-based pathogen detection technology with its rapid handling time, high sensitivity and broad specificity towards infection-causing pathogens could provide a real-world advance to diagnose life-threatening infections in both clinical microbiology laboratories and point-of-care settings.\n\nThe work was funded by the Wyss Institute and the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA).\n\nThe Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University uses Nature's design principles to develop bioinspired materials and devices that will transform medicine and create a more sustainable world.

The study discovered the specific triggers activating the development of fibrosis which accelerates heart failure. Blocking the triggers through the use of a specific kind of bile acid prevented cardiac fibrosis from occurring.\n\n\"This is something that nobody has ever seen before,\" says Marek Michalak, co-principal investigator and a distinguished professor in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Alberta's Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry. \"Cardiac fibrosis is considered a permanent remodeling of the heart. Inevitably it leads to heart failure and eventually death. The bottom line is that this shows for the first time that cardiac fibrosis is preventable.\"\n\n\"It offers hope to those who are living with heart failure,\" adds Luis Agellon, co-principal investigator and a professor at McGill University's School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition. \"Prevention of fibrosis will extend the ability of the heart to function, even if at a reduced capacity. Currently patients with heart failure have poor quality of life and a dismal prognosis. Improving their quality of life will do wonders for these individuals.\"\n\nFibrosis is an early step on the path to heart failure. According to the Heart and Stroke Foundation there are currently 1.3 million Canadians living with heart disease or heart failure--a condition that severely limits physical activity because the heart cannot pump enough oxygenated blood that the body needs. About 30 per cent of patients diagnosed with heart failure will die within the first year.\n\nCardiac fibrosis itself is caused by a variety of factors including high blood pressure, overwork of cardiac muscle and long-term consumption of a diet that is high in both saturated fat and sugar--all cause increased stress to heart cells. Individuals with diabetes, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and heart transplant recipients are also known to be at high risk.\n\n\"It's almost like building a scar,\" says Michalak. \"It's exactly the same type of biological activity but it's happening in the heart tissue. It destroys the ability of the heart to function normally.\"\n\nThe team is now pushing forward with additional studies to see if the same therapeutic effect can be achieved in humans. They also aim to gain a better understanding of exactly how bile acids can prevent cardiac fibrosis from occurring.\n\n\"We don't yet have a full understanding--nobody does--of how the bile acid actually does what it does in heart cells,\" explains Michalak. \"So, another phase of the work is to find out what actually happens within heart cells at the molecular level. How can this bile acid affect the heart in such a dramatic way?\"\n\nOnce that occurs, the team hopes to work with cardiologists to quickly move the research into clinical trials, involving chemotherapy and heart transplant patients.\n\n\"If cardiac fibrosis can be stopped, then that could substantially improve the outcome for people at risk,\" says Agellon. \"This would be a significant advance in the fight against heart disease.\"\n\nThis research was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.\n\n\"Inhibition of the Unfolded Protein Response Mechanism Prevents Cardiac Fibrosis,\" PLOS ONE, published online July 21, 2016.", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The release clearly notes the funding source, the Canadian Institute for Health Research.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Heart scan law could lead to 1,000s more cancer cases\n\nWidespread use of a controversial heart disease test that Texas insurers will be required by law to cover by law could lead to thousands more cases of cancer in the United States, according to a new study.\n\nThe study offers the most definitive estimate yet of the cancer risk from the radiation exposure that comes with increasingly popular CT scans, which provide pictures of the heart's arteries and quantify the risk of heart attack in people without symptoms.\n\n\u201cThis is an important reminder that there are always trade-offs when we talk about screening,\u201d said Dr. Amit Khera, a cardiologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. \u201cDoctors and patients need to think about the cancer risk when ordering this test.\u201d\n\nThe study, published in the new edition of Archives of Internal Medicine, found a small but real risk from the average radiation \u2014 for every 100,000 men between 45 and 75 undergoing the test every five years, there would be 42 cancers; for every 100,000 women ages 55 to 75, there would be 62.\n\nThat translates into \u201cabout 5,600 individuals developing a radiation-induced cancer in the future,\u201d the study said.\n\nThe study comes a month after Gov. Rick Perry signed legislation that will require Texas insurance companies to cover the test for men 45 to 75 years old, and for women between 55 and 75, at intermediate or greater risk of heart attack. The law, the first in any state, takes effect Jan. 1.\n\nThe legislation was introduced in 2007 and passed quietly this year. It eventually attracted attention in cardiology circles, where the scans' costs and benefits are the subject of much debate. The scans are sometimes criticized as an example of expensive new technologies being adopted before proof is established that they're better than cheaper existing methods \u2014 an issue at the heart of the health care reform debate.\n\nThe test, a CAT scan of the heart that measures plaque buildup in the arteries, is popular because heart disease, the nation's No. 1 killer, strikes many people without the sort of very high cholesterol that usually predicts it. Doctors say they get many patients who want to know more about their risk because their father suffered a heart attack and died young.\n\nCritics note that no study has linked the use of CT scans with better patient outcomes. They say the test's value is limited because it doesn't identify which plaque are stable and which could rupture and cause a heart attack.\n\nCT scanning, which costs from $100 to $500, has grown exponentially in recent years. One Houston doctor said that there was just one scanner in Houston in the mid-'90s, and now the $1 million machines are all over the city. The Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography estimates more than 200,000 Americans had the test in 2008 at a cost of about $50 million.\n\nThe American Heart Association did not endorse the legislation, which Khera estimates could result in millions of Texans being screened.\n\nThe Texas legislation was pushed by Screening for Heart Attack Prevention and Eradication, a private organization that has called for CT scans on all asymptomatic men 45 to 75 and all asymptomatic women 55 to 75 \u2014 or some 50 million Americans.\n\nTexas Rep. Rene Oliveira, D-Brownsville, the bill's sponsor, stressed the state law won't result in such widespread testing.\n\n\u201cThe bill was written to target those people most likely to benefit from it, not everyone,\u201d said Oliveira, who credits the test for saving his life when it revealed blockages that led to double-bypass surgery two years ago.\n\nBut Khera, an advocate of the test in select cases, said the Texas law puts the cart before the horse. He questioned unsupported cutoffs of those covered under the law and said it would have been better to wait until more data is available on who really benefits from it.\n\nDr. William Zoghbi, director of Methodist Hospital's Cardiovascular Imaging Institute, said the cancer risk numbers reported in the study are actually fairly low compared to other tests that take X-rays of the chest area, such as a regular CAT scan or coronary angiography.\n\nThe Texas law will require insurance companies pay $200 of the bill for patients to get the test every five years.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "\n\n\nThe story includes experts and advocates that represent the key perspectives in debate about CT screening for calcium deposits in coronary arteries.

But ketamine has not been tested in a large clinical trial, and all evidence of its antidepressant effects has come from anecdotes and small studies of fewer than 100 patients. Now, in the largest study of its kind, researchers at Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at University of California San Diego mined the FDA Adverse Effect Reporting System (FAERS) database for depression symptoms in patients taking ketamine for pain. They found that depression was reported half as often among the more than 41,000 patients who took ketamine, as compared to patients who took any other drug or drug combination for pain.\n\nThe study, published May 3 in Scientific Reports, also uncovered antidepressant effects for three other drugs typically used for other purposes -- Botox, the pain reliever diclofenac and the antibiotic minocycline.\n\n\"Current FDA-approved treatments for depression fail for millions of people because they don't work or don't work fast enough,\" said senior author Ruben Abagyan, PhD, professor of pharmacy. \"This study extends small-scale clinical evidence that ketamine can be used to alleviate depression, and provides needed solid statistical support for wider clinical applications and possibly larger scale clinical trials.\"\n\nAbagyan led the study with pharmacy students Isaac Cohen and Tigran Makunts, and Rabia Atayee, PharmD, associate professor of clinical pharmacy, all at Skaggs School of Pharmacy.\n\nThe FAERS database contains more than 8 million patient records. The research team focused on patients in the database who received ketamine, narrowing their study population down to approximately 41,000. They applied a mathematical algorithm to look for statistically significant differences in reported depression symptoms for each patient.\n\n\"While most researchers and regulators monitor the FAERS database for increased incidences of symptoms in order to spot potentially harmful drug side effects, we were looking for the opposite -- lack of a symptom,\" Cohen said.\n\nThe team found that the incidence of depression symptoms in patients who took ketamine in addition to other pain therapeutics dropped by 50 percent (with an error margin less than 2 percent) compared to the patients who took any other drug or drug combination for pain. Patients who took ketamine also less frequently reported pain and opioid-associated side effects, such as constipation, as compared to patients who received other pain medications.\n\nAccording to Abagyan, it is possible that another factor common to patients taking ketamine was driving the antidepressant effect, such as the fact that ketamine also relieves pain. That's why they compared ketamine patients with patients taking other pain medications. That control group eliminated the possibility that people who take ketamine have less depression because they have less pain. Abagyan says it's still possible, though unlikely, the effect could be due to a still unidentified confounding factor.\n\nThree other drugs with previously under-appreciated antidepressant effects also emerged from this analysis: Botox, used cosmetically to treat wrinkles and medically to treat migraines and other disorders; diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID); and minocycline, an antibiotic.\n\nAfter the diclofenac finding, Abagyan and team went back and looked at ketamine patients who did not also take NSAIDs and compared them to patients who took any other combination of drugs for pain except NSAIDs. Depression rates in patients taking ketamine remained low.\n\nThe researchers hypothesize that the antidepressant effects of diclofenac and minocycline may be due, at least in part, to their abilities to reduce inflammation. For Botox, the potential mechanism for reducing depression is less clear. The team is now working to separate Botox's beauty effects (which could indirectly make a person feel better emotionally) and its antidepressant effects. To do this, they are first using FAERS data to determine if collagen fillers and other cosmetic treatments similarly affect depression rates.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, more than 300 million people experience depression worldwide. If not effectively treated, depression can become a chronic disease that increases a person's risk of mortality from suicide, heart disease or other factors. Depression is currently treated with five classes of antidepressants, most commonly serotonin reuptake inhibitors.\n\nFor financial and ethical reasons, ketamine has never been tested for its safety and effectiveness in treating depression in a large-scale clinical trial, but it reportedly works much more rapidly than standard antidepressants. Ketamine is relatively inexpensive and is covered by most health insurance plans if three other antidepressants fail.\n\n\"The approach we used here could be applied to any number of other conditions, and may reveal new and important uses for thousands of already approved drugs, without large investments in additional clinical trials,\" Makunts said.", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The release names the funder, not in the release text itself but on the EurekaAlert! website which hosts the news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "ANN ARBOR, Michigan -- Even as treatment options for laryngeal cancer seemed to improve, survival rates did not. For the most advanced patients, 50 percent survival was the norm, whether patients had surgery to totally remove the voice box or alternative treatment with chemotherapy and radiation to try to avoid surgery.\n\nBut the head and neck oncology team at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center came up with a different approach: Give patients a single dose of chemotherapy and see who responds to it. The responders can continue with combination chemotherapy and radiation. The non-responders can be referred immediately for surgery.\n\nAfter a decade of using this approach, researchers are reporting \"exceptional\" survival rates nearing 80 percent, even for the most advanced patients. The team published their outcomes in JAMA Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery.\n\n\"In trying to match the biology of the tumor to the treatment, all of the patients get better outcomes,\" says study author Gregory T. Wolf, M.D., professor and chair emeritus of otolaryngology - head and neck surgery at Michigan Medicine.\n\n\"This approach allows us to enhance quality of life for all of our patients. Many patients can spare their voice box by having chemotherapy and radiation. But that's only good if the treatment works. For patients who must go on to receive surgery, by selecting them up front, we can spare them the complications that may occur when the voice box is removed following multiple cycles of chemotherapy with radiation,\" adds study author Francis Worden, M.D., professor of hematology/oncology.\n\nThe Michigan Medicine team first tested the idea in 1995. They found that patients whose tumor shrunk by more than half after one round of chemotherapy were more likely to do well with chemotherapy and radiation and have an excellent chance of saving their voice box. If the tumor did not respond after that first dose, patients would likely fail on the chemotherapy and would do better going straight to surgery.\n\nIn a clinical trial, they saw disease-specific survival rates of 80 percent in patients with advanced disease. This was unheard of. And it wasn't just those who responded to the chemotherapy. The non-responders who were immediately referred for surgery had better outcomes too.\n\n\"We adopted the treatment approach and started offering it to all our laryngeal cancer patients,\" Wolf says. As part of a Specialized Program of Research Excellence, or SPORE, grant, the team was already maintaining long-term follow-up data on patients. Wolf suggested they look back and see if they were still maintaining such strong outcomes with this approach. The results surprised even him.\n\nOver 10 years, 153 stage 3 and 4 laryngeal cancer patients were treated at Michigan Medicine, with about half receiving the induction chemotherapy. The remainder elected to proceed straight to surgery or chemo-radiation without the induction dose.\n\nAverage disease specific survival at five years for the induction chemotherapy patients was 79 percent - equivalent to the results in patients with early stage disease, and significantly better than the 66 percent survival for patients who had chemo-radiation without the induction strategy.\n\n\"This adds ammunition to the idea that we need to pick individual therapies more carefully. Both chemo-radiation and surgery are difficult treatments with their share of challenging long-term effects. But if we tailor treatments to the individual biology of the tumor and characteristics of the patient, we'll get the best results,\" Wolf says.\n\nThe study did find lower functional preservation of the larynx in the induction chemotherapy group compared to those who elected chemoradiation. Two-thirds of the induction group achieved organ preservation, while more than three-quarters of the chemo-radiation patients did.\n\nWolf notes, however, that chemoradiation often severely damages the larynx, which may cause problems with eating or swallowing years later.\n\nThe induction approach can be done anywhere, but requires intense collaboration among surgeons, medical oncologists and radiation oncologists. All three must be involved to assess the patient and refer to the appropriate therapy.\n\nEven that single dose of chemotherapy can be debilitating and toxic for some patients. Wolf hopes future research will reveal a way to tailor treatment without the need for the induction chemotherapy.\n\nFunding: National Cancer Institute grants P50 CA097248 and P30 CA046592, and the Sinabaldo and Diane Tozzi Research Fund", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Funding sources are clearly noted in the release and there do not appear to be relevant conflicts of interest.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A new study finds that current guidelines for cholesterol screening in children may miss nearly 10% of those who have high levels of LDL, or bad cholesterol.\n\nThe question of how soon children should be screened for high cholesterol is becoming increasingly important in the U.S., with its rate of child obesity topping 20%. Along with obesity, high levels of blood fats can lead to heart disease and other health problems, including diabetes.\n\nThe U.S. government currently recommends screening for high cholesterol in children with a family history of heart disease or high cholesterol (with at least one parent or grandparent who has suffered a premature heart event such as heart attack or stroke, or at least one parent with total cholesterol levels above 240 mg/dL). The guidelines also recommend that youngsters whose parents are not aware of their family history of heart disease be screened.\n\nIn the new study, led by Dr. William Neal of West Virginia University, scientists observed a group of more than 20,000 fifth-graders in West Virginia and found that 71% were eligible for cholesterol screening based on national criteria. Experts believe using family history is a good way to identify children who may be at greatest risk of high cholesterol \u0097 and therefore of future heart disease. Based on the results of the screen, doctors may then advise families to change their children's diet or exercise routines or prescribe medication to lower their cholesterol.\n\nBut because West Virginia has one of the nation's highest rates of death from heart disease, since 2000, the state has offered free, universal cholesterol screening to all fifth-graders enrolled in public schools. That allowed Neal and his team to determine how many children who actually had high cholesterol would have been missed if they had been screened based on federal guidelines.\n\nAmong the 5,798 children who would not have been screened, nearly 10% had elevated LDL cholesterol levels (above 130 mg/dL), according to the study, published in the August issue of Pediatrics. And 1.7% had levels high enough (above 160 mg/dL) to warrant cholesterol-lowering medications. Indeed, of all the children in the study whose LDL levels were above 160, one-third were in the group who would not have been screened.\n\nThe current guidelines were put in place in the 1990s, and at the time, experts predicted that high cholesterol would be missed in as many as 25% of children, says Neal. But doctors assumed that in most cases, these children would have only slightly elevated cholesterol levels that would eventually be detected when they became adults and would be lowered with diet and exercise.\n\nNeal's data show that may not be the case. Further, Neal says, the findings apply not only to heart-disease risk but also to the risk of diabetes, since high cholesterol at a young age is a strong predictor of prediabetes and diabetes. \"We worry about that because if these children don't change their ways, then they are going to have Type 2 diabetes,\" he says. \"It's something we would become more aware of if more children were screened.\"\n\nNot everyone agrees that universal screening is the answer. Rather than calling for all youngsters to have their cholesterol tested, which would entail considerable expense on the national level, Dr. Ralph Sacco, president of the American Heart Association (AHA), suggests looking more critically at current screening guidelines. \"Maybe the way we are doing family screening, with a very simplistic questionnaire about any parent having early heart disease or having high blood cholesterol, is not effective,\" he says. \"I think we need more effective screening tools. We need to assess these options before jumping to possible universal screening.\"\n\nSacco notes that both the AHA and the American Academy of Pediatrics now recommend cholesterol screening in children with risk factors for heart disease other than family history, such as obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes. \"The weight of the child, his waist circumference and whether he has siblings who are overweight would help to select a group that is at greater risk of having high cholesterol,\" he says. \"Now that we have this data, it does call into question these original guidelines from the government.\" The next update of the recommendations is expected in spring 2011.\n\nSee TIME's Pictures of the Week.\n\nSee the Cartoons of the Week.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "1clip_filelist.xml\" rel=\"File-List\"/>\n\n\n\n1clip_filelist.xml\" rel=\"File-List\"/>\n\n\n\nThe journal Pediatrics stated that the study authors did not have any relevant financial interests.

The researchers believe the DTI technique may expand the options for older women, who are less likely to undergo breast reconstruction.\n\nGood Results with DTI Breast Reconstruction in Women over 65\n\nDirect-to-implant breast reconstruction has emerged as a single-stage approach to immediate breast reconstruction after mastectomy. So far, however, most studies of DTI have focused on younger women.\n\n\"Half of all breast cancers occur in women over 65, yet only four to 14 percent of these women undergo reconstruction,\" Dr. Moreira and coauthors write. Most studies of breast reconstruction in older women have focused on multiple-step techniques such as tissue expander implant (TEI) reconstruction.\n\nThe researchers identified women over age 65 who underwent DTI reconstruction at the Cleveland Clinic between 2012 and 2015. They identified a total of 24 breasts reconstructed by DTI in 19 patients, all with at least 30 days' follow-up and most with one year of follow-up\n\nPatient characteristics and outcomes were compared to those of 109 breasts with TEI reconstruction in 98 patients. The women undergoing DTI reconstruction were older (73.5 versus 69.2 years) and had a higher body mass index, compared to the TEI group.\n\nBoth DTI and TEI were safe and effective options for breast reconstruction. Complication rates were similar between groups, including blood and fluid collections (hematoma and seroma), infection, unplanned surgery, and failed reconstruction.\n\nHowever, DTI had some important advantages. Women in the DTI group were less likely to be readmitted to the hospital and spent fewer total days in the hospital. In the year after surgery was completed, women in the DTI group made an average of 6.5 office visits, compared to about 12 visits in the TEI group.\n\nThe DTI group also spent fewer days with a surgical drain in place: average about 13 days, compared to 23 days in the and had fewer total days in the hospital. That's an important consideration, as drains require antibiotic treatment to prevent infection, in addition to causing discomfort for the patient.\n\nThe authors note some important limitations of their study--particularly the fact that it was a review study of one hospital's experience with a relatively new procedure. Dr. Moreira and colleagues write, \"These reported cases include our learning curve patients as we familiarized ourselves with appropriate patient selection and surgical technique.\"\n\nThe researchers emphasize that DTI isn't an option for every patient, depending on breast shape and other factors. Despite these limitations, their experience suggests that complications of the DTI approach in older women are similar to those of the more commonly used TEI technique.

Intake was estimated from questions about coffee, tea, and cola beverage intake, including frequency and serving size.\n\nIn 10 years or less of follow-up with annual assessments of cognitive function, 388 of these women received a diagnosis of probable dementia or some form of global cognitive impairment. Those who consumed above the median amount of caffeine for this group (with an average intake of 261 mg per day) were diagnosed at a lower rate than those who fell below the median (with an average intake of 64 mg per day). The researchers adjusted for risk factors such as hormone therapy, age, race, education, body mass index, sleep quality, depression, hypertension, prior cardiovascular disease, diabetes, smoking, and alcohol consumption.\n\nThe paper \"Relationships Between Caffeine Intake and Risk for Probable Dementia or Global Cognitive Impairment: The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study\" is available at: http://biomedgerontology.", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The release notes that the study was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Not everyone was convinced. Some, like Dr. Dean Ornish, a longtime promoter of low-fat diets and president of the Preventive Medicine Research Institute in Sausalito, Calif., said that the women did not reduce their fat to low enough levels or eat enough fruits and vegetables, and that the study, even at eight years, did not give the diets enough time.\n\nOthers said that diet could still make a difference, at least with heart disease, if people were to eat the so-called Mediterranean diet, low in saturated fats like butter and high in oils like olive oil. The women in the study reduced all kinds of fat.\n\nThe diets studied \"had an antique patina,\" said Dr. Peter Libby, a cardiologist and professor at Harvard Medical School. These days, Dr. Libby said, most people have moved on from the idea of controlling total fat to the idea that people should eat different kinds of fat.\n\nBut the Mediterranean diet has not been subjected to a study of this scope, researchers said.\n\nAnd Barbara V. Howard, an epidemiologist at MedStar Research Institute, a nonprofit hospital group, and a principle investigator in the study, said people should realize that diet alone was not enough to stay healthy.\n\n\"We are not going to reverse any of the chronic diseases in this country by changing the composition of the diet,\" Dr. Howard said. \"People are always thinking it's what they ate. They are not looking at how much they ate or that they smoke or that they are sedentary.\"\n\nExcept for not smoking, the advice for a healthy lifestyle is based largely on indirect evidence, Dr. Howard said, but most medical researchers agree that it makes sense to eat well, control weight and get regular exercise.\n\nThat is also what the cancer society recommends. Dr. Thun, who described the study's results as \"completely null over the eight-year follow-up for both cancers and heart disease,\" said his group had no plans to suggest that low-fat diets were going to protect against cancer.\n\nOthers cautioned against being too certain that a particular diet would markedly improve health, and said that whether someone developed a chronic disease might not be entirely under their control -- genetics also plays a role.\n\nDavid A. Freedman, a statistician at the University of California, Berkeley, who is not connected with the study but has written books on the design and analysis of clinical trials, said the results should be taken seriously.\n\n\"The studies were well designed,\" Dr. Freedman said, \"and the investigators tried to confirm popular hypotheses about the protective effect of diet against three major diseases in women.\"\n\n\"But,\" he added, \"the diet studied here turned out not to be protective after all.\"\n\nThe study was part of the Women's Health Initiative of the National Institutes of Health, the same program that showed that hormone therapy after menopause might have more risks than benefits.\n\nIn this case, the study addressed a tricky problem. For decades, many scientists have said, and many members of the public have believed, that what people eat -- the composition of the diet -- determines how likely they are to get a chronic disease. But that has been hard to prove. Studies of dietary fiber and colon cancer failed to find that fiber was protective, and studies of vitamins thought to protect against cancer failed to show an effect.\n\nMany cancer researchers have questioned large parts of the diet-cancer hypothesis, but it has kept a hold on the public imagination. \"Nothing fascinates the American public so much as the notion that what you eat rather than how much you eat affects your health,\" said Dr. Libby, the Harvard professor.\n\nThe study found that women who were randomly assigned to follow a low-fat diet ate significantly less fat over the next eight years. But they had just as much breast and colon cancer and just as much heart disease. The women were not trying to lose weight, and their weights remained fairly steady. But their experiences with the diets allowed researchers to question some popular notions about diet and obesity.\n\nThere is a common belief that Americans get fat because they eat too many carbohydrates. The idea is that a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet leads to weight gain, higher insulin and blood glucose levels, and more diabetes, even if the calories are the same as in a higher-fat diet. That did not happen here.\n\nOthers have said the opposite: that low-fat diets enable people to lose weight naturally. But that belief was not supported by this study.\n\nAs for heart disease risk factors, the only one affected was LDL cholesterol, which increases heart disease risk. The levels were slightly higher in women eating the higher-fat diet, but not high enough to make a noticeable difference in their risk of heart disease.\n\nAlthough all the study participants were women, the colon cancer and heart disease results should also apply to men, said Dr. Jacques Rossouw, the project officer for the Women's Health Initiative.\n\nDr. Rossouw said the observational studies that led to the hypothesis about colon cancer and dietary fat included men and women. With heart disease, he said, researchers have found that women and men respond in the same way to dietary fat.\n\nThe most recent study follows a smaller one, reported last year, on low-fat diets for women who had breast cancer. That study hinted that eating less fat might help prevent a recurrence. But the current study, asking if a low-fat diet could protect women from breast cancer in the first place, had findings that fell short of statistical significance, meaning they could have occurred by chance.\n\nDr. Rossouw said he was still intrigued by the breast cancer data, even though it was not statistically significant. The women on low-fat diets had a 9 percent lower rate of breast cancer; the incidence was 42 per thousand per year in women in the low-fat diet group, compared with 45 per thousand per year in women consuming their regular diet.\n\nThat could mean that fat in the diet may have a small effect, Dr. Rossouw said, perhaps in some subgroups of women or over a longer period of time. He added that the study investigators would continue to follow the women to see if the effect became more pronounced.\n\nWhile cancer researchers said they were disappointed by the results, heart disease researchers said they were not surprised that simply reducing total fat had no effect, because they had moved on from that hypothesis.\n\nOf course, Dr. Libby acknowledged, the latest advice, to follow a Mediterranean diet and get regular exercise, has never been tested in a large randomized clinical trial. \"If they did a study like that and it was negative,\" he said, \"then I'd have to give up my cherished hypotheses for data.\"\n\nThe low-fat diet was not easy to follow, said Dr. Rowan T. Chlebowski, a medical oncologist at Harbor-U.C.L.A. Medical Center and one of the study's principal investigators. Women were told to aim for a diet that had just 20 percent of its calories as fat, and most fell short.\n\nThe diet they were told to follow \"is different than the way most people eat,\" Dr. Chlebowski said. It meant, for example, no butter on bread, no cream cheese on bagels, no oil in salad dressings.\n\n\"If a physician told a patient to eat less fat, that will do nothing,\" he said. \"If you send someone to a dietitian one time, that will do next to nothing.\" The women in the study had 18 sessions in small groups with a trained nutritionist in the first year and four sessions a year after that.\n\nIn the first year, the women on the low-fat diets reduced the percentage of fat in their diet to 24 percent of daily calories, and by the end of the study their diets had 29 percent of their calories as fat. In the first year, the women in the control group were eating 35 percent of their calories as fat, and by the end of the study their dietary fat content was 37 percent. The two groups consumed about the same number of calories.\n\nSome medical specialists emphasized that the study did not mean people should abandon low-fat diets.\n\n\"What we are saying is that a modest reduction of fat and a substitution with fruits and vegetables did not do anything for heart disease and stroke or breast cancer or colorectal cancer,\" said Dr. Nanette K. Wenger, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta. \"It doesn't say that this diet is not beneficial.\"\n\nBut Dr. Freedman, the Berkeley statistician, said the overall lesson was clear.\n\n\"We, in the scientific community, often give strong advice based on flimsy evidence,\" he said. \"That's why we have to do experiments.\"\n\nCorrection: February 16, 2006, Thursday A front-page article on Feb. 8 about a new study finding that low-fat diets have no effect on the risk of cancer or heart disease misstated the incidence of breast cancer among women in the study. It was 42 per 10,000 per year in women in the low-fat-diet group, compared with 45 per 10,000 in women consuming their regular diet -- not per 1,000.

But that might be changing, at least when it comes to risk of death.\n\nThe body mass index, or BMI, associated with the lowest risk of death has increased since the 1970s, a study finds, from 23.7, in the \"normal\" weight category, to 27, which is deemed \"overweight.\"\n\nThat means a person who is 5-foot-8 could weigh 180 pounds and be in that epidemiological sweet spot, according to the NIH's online BMI calculator. The results were published Tuesday in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nThe researchers came to that conclusion by looking at data from three studies of people in Copenhagen, one from the 1970s, one from the 1990s and one from 2003-2013. More than 100,000 people were involved. Because Denmark has an excellent national health registry, they were able to pinpoint the cause of death for every single one of those people.\n\nThe risk of death for people who are obese, with a BMI of 30 or greater, also declined, to the point that it was on a par with some people of so-called \"normal\" weight.\n\nSo being fatter, at least a bit, may be healthier.\n\n\"I was surprised as a scientist to see how clear the result was,\" Borge Nordestgaard, a clinical professor and chief physician at Copenhagen University Hospital and senior author of the study, told Shots.\n\nSo he and his colleagues sliced and diced the data to see what could account for the shift. They looked at age, sex, smoking, cancer and heart disease. The most relevant was the decline in smoking since the 1970s. But when they looked at the mortality rates in nonsmokers who had never had cancer or heart disease, it also became associated with a higher BMI over time.\n\nSo what's going on?\n\n\"Now we get into the speculation part, right? I know you journalists always want that,\" Nordestgaard says. \"One option certainly is over these three decades we have become much better at treating the cardiovascular risk factors that come with overweight and obesity.\"\n\nThat includes treating high cholesterol with statins; treating high blood pressure with diet, exercise and an array of medications; and making concerted efforts to help people to control blood sugar.\n\nPeople in Denmark got heavier on average over the course of the study, as they have in the United States and most other countries. By 2013, 56 percent of the Danes had a BMI of 25 or higher. So you could think, OK, the new average is a heavier average.\n\nOr you could wonder if being a bit heavier somehow helps confer health benefits that affect longevity.\n\nResearchers have long known that people who are very thin tend to have a shorter life expectancy, often because they're dealing with cancer or other serious illnesses. The sweet spot on the BMI/longevity axis is typically somewhere near the middle. But there's not much data to back the notion that a bit more pudge is protective. \"This is total speculation,\" Nordestgaard says.\n\nThe BMI has been vilified as a poor measure of an individual's health. Someone who is big, fit and well-muscled, like a pro football player, can peg an obese BMI. And all of the people in this study are white, so that's a limitation. But the BMI, which is a general measure of body fat, has proven useful for thinking about the health of large groups of people, as in this study.\n\nNordestgaard and his colleagues are going to dig into this more in an effort to figure out what's going on, but he cautions that these kinds of data dives can take many months.\n\nBut this does raise the prospect of whether it may soon be time to tweak the official definition of normal, healthy weight.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "There were no apparent conflicts of interest.

Is an app-based self-care program particularly attractive to young women? These questions addressed in a new study by researchers from Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, the results of which have been published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology*.\n\nApproximately 50 to 90 percent of young women experience pain during their periods. While this pain primarily manifests itself as lower abdominal cramping, other symptoms include headache, backache, nausea and diarrhea. Acupressure is a technique derived from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). In contrast to acupuncture, this technique can be used as a form of self-care and is suitable for use at home. Rather than using needles, this technique involves massage or pressure being applied to specific points on the body.\n\nThe researchers wanted to evaluate whether in a group of women suffering from severe menstrual pain, aged between 18 and 34, self-acupressure would be more effective at achieving a sustained reduction in menstrual pain than usual care alone (e.g. pain medication and hormonal contraceptives). A total of 221 participants were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups, both of which received a study app and short introduction. Acupressure-based features - with instructions on how to administer self-acupressure shortly before and during menstruation - were only made available to the intervention group. One advantage of an app-based intervention is its ability to provide visual descriptions of the pressure points users need to target in order to achieve the desired effect. It can also send regular reminders. Additionally, the app was used to collect all study-related data.\n\n\"Initially, we simply wanted to conduct a study on the use of self-care techniques for menstrual pain. However, the women who were involved during the planning stages, all of whom were affected by menstrual pain, wanted an app,\" reports the study's principal investigator, Prof. Dr. Claudia Witt of the Institute of Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics. The app helped participants to apply simple self-acupressure techniques to three different acupressure points.\n\nAfter three months, 37 percent of participants in the acupressure group reported a 50 percent reduction in pain intensity. After six months, this proportion had increased to more than half of the women in this group (58 percent). Only 25 percent of women in the control group reported a similar reduction in pain intensity at both the 3-month and 6-month marks. Women in the acupressure group also used less pain medication than women in the control group and reported lower levels of pain overall.\n\n\"We were surprised to see that, after six months, two thirds of participants continued to use self-acupressure. So far, research into the clinical effectiveness of apps has been limited, and only a few have been tested using randomized controlled trials,\" says Dr. Daniel Pach of the Institute of Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics. He adds: \"We were able to show that apps can be evaluated in a clinical trial setting. However, despite our experience with conventional clinical trials, there was a lot for us to learn - something we found both exciting and eye-opening.\" The app Luna has recently been updated and optimized for use with iOS.\n\n*Susanne Bl\u00f6dt, Daniel Pach, Sanna von Eisenhart-Rothe, Fabian Lotz, Stephanie Roll, Katja Icke, Claudia M.

Plaque in these arteries is a red flag for a potential heart attack. (Agatston does not make any money from the coronary calcium scan.)\n\nThe other imaging test Agatston recommends is an ultrasound of the carotid artery, looking at plaque in the main blood vessel leading to the brain. Plaque in the carotid artery is a sign of increased risk for a heart attack and stroke.\n\nBoth tests are non-invasive and outpatient, although the calcium scan does expose the patient to the equivalent of several months of normal background radiation.\n\nOne large federally funded study found the coronary calcium score a better predictor of coronary events like a heart attack than the traditional Framingham Risk Score, which considers age, cigarette smoking, blood pressure, total cholesterol and HDL, the \"good\" cholesterol.\n\nAgatston thinks the coronary calcium scan should be routinely scheduled at age 50, like a colonoscopy, or earlier for people with family histories of heart disease.\n\nMost hospitals now offer the imaging tests, some at less than $100 for both, and they are often covered by insurance.\n\nCardiologists now generally use the calcium scan only for patients considered at intermediate risk for heart disease, determined by traditional measures such as cholesterol, blood pressure, lifestyle and family history.\n\nHigh-risk patients already receive such aggressive treatment as cholesterol-lowering statin medication, but many doctors don't think low-risk patients need to incur the expense or small dose of radiation that comes with a coronary calcium scan.\n\n\"There is a large group in the middle called intermediate risk, which may be as much as 50% of the population,\" said Dr. Erin Michos, a cardiologist at the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at Johns Hopkins University\n\nA good candidate for a coronary calcium scan, she says, would be a 50-year-old man with slightly elevated cholesterol and a father who had a heart attack.\n\n\"Do you put this 50-year-old who has this family history on a statin medication with potential expense (and) side effects for the next four decades of his life, or do you further refine how far at risk he is?\" she asked.\n\nA calcium score would answer that question, she says.\n\nThere's a third test Agatston likes: a $65 blood test that looks at a patient's LDL, or bad cholesterol. LDL particles come in different sizes, and patients with a lot of small-particle LDL are more likely to build up plaque in their blood vessels, Agatston says. Alternately, patients with large LDL particles do not tend to accumulate plaque.\n\n\"There are a lot of little old ladies in their 80s with very high cholesterol who have squeaky clean vessels. They have very large particles, and they don't get into the vessel wall,\" Agatston says.\n\nThese new tests give patients a chance to make major changes in their diet and lifestyle, and give doctors an opportunity to treat them with medication.\n\n\"One of the best-kept secrets in the country in medicine is the doctors who are practicing aggressive prevention are really seeing heart attacks and strokes disappear from their practices.

One group was given 225mg of the drug twice a day for 12 weeks and the other participants were assigned to a placebo group. Fevipiprant and the placebo were added to the medications the participants were already taking.\n\nThe study was designed primarily to examine the effects on inflammation in the airway by measuring the sputum eosinophil count.\n\nThe sputum eosinophil is an inflammation measurement of a white blood cell that increases in asthma and is used to assess the severity of this condition.\n\nPeople who do not have asthma have a percentage of less than one and those with moderate-to-severe asthma typically have a reading of about five per cent.\n\nThe rate in people with moderate-to-severe asthma taking the medication was reduced from an average of 5.4 percent to 1.1 percent over 12 weeks, according to the study published today in the prestigious The Lancet Respiratory Medicine journal.\n\nProfessor Christopher Brightling, who is a NIHR Senior Research Fellow and Clinical Professor in Respiratory Medicine at the University of Leicester, led the study at the NIHR Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit, which is based at the Glenfield Hospital in Leicester.\n\nProfessor Brightling said: \"A unique feature of this study was how it included measurements of symptoms, lung function using breathing tests, sampling of the airway wall and CT scans of the chest to give a complete picture of how the new drug works.\n\n\"Most treatments might improve some of these features of disease, but with Fevipiprant improvements were seen with all of the types of tests.\n\n\"We already know that using treatments to target eosinophilic airway inflammation can substantially reduce asthma attacks.\n\n\"This new treatment, Fevipiprant, could likewise help to stop preventable asthma attacks, reduce hospital admissions and improve day-to-day symptoms- making it a 'game changer' for future treatment.\"\n\nGaye Stokes from Grantham in Lincolnshire has had severe asthma for 16 years.

Foods with fiber, such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains, can reduce cholesterol levels, while carbohydrates that are low in fiber tend to raise triglyceride levels and lower \"good\" HDL cholesterol levels.\n\nIn the current study, the researchers wanted to assess the long-term effect that apple consumption might have on cardiovascular health.\n\nThey recruited 160 women between the ages of 45 and 65. The women were randomly assigned to one of two dietary intervention groups. One group was given 75 grams of dried apples every day for a year, while the other group was given dried prunes daily for a year.\n\nThe daily serving of dried apples contained about 240 calories, according to the study. An apple contains about 5 grams of fiber, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nThe researchers found that women eating dried apples lowered their total cholesterol by 14 percent. LDL cholesterol dropped by 23 percent. Daily apple consumption also significantly lowered levels of C-reactive protein and lipid hydroperoxide, two substances that may indicate an increased risk of heart disease. What effects, if any, the prunes had on cholesterol levels were not mentioned in the study abstract.\n\nThe researchers theorized that the nutrients in apples may reduce inflammation in the body.\n\nDespite the addition of several hundred calories a day to their diet, the apple-eating women didn't gain weight over the course of the study. In fact, they lost an average of 3.3 pounds.\n\nRegistered dietician Jessica Shapiro said she wasn't surprised that the women didn't gain weight. The addition of apples to the diet probably kept the women feeling fuller because of the fiber content in the apples, she explained.\n\n\"Apples really are an amazing fruit for many reasons,\" said Shapiro, who is a clinical nutritionist who counsels cardiac patients at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City. \"A large reason apples are so good is the fiber. Apples have both soluble and insoluble fiber. Insoluble is found more in the skin, and the pulp is more soluble fiber.\"\n\n\"The pulp of an apple gets to be a very viscous gel-like substance that grabs cholesterol and pulls it out of the body. It's kind of like nature's toothbrush, and it's brushing the bad stuff out,\" she explained.\n\n\"Another good thing in apples is pectin. It's a substance that's used to make jellies or jams, and pectin contributes to the viscosity of what's going through the body, and bulks it up to help remove it. Apples also have tons of antioxidants and other natural components,\" she said.\n\nShapiro said she would recommend fresh apples over dried apples, because some nutrients are probably lost in the drying process.\n\nBut Shapiro stressed that making healthy changes to what you eat can only do so much.\n\n\"Changing your diet can make a big difference, but eating a healthy diet is only part of it. Once your cholesterol is high, diet may not be enough,\" she said. \"Some people are predisposed because of their genes to having high cholesterol, and a healthy diet may not be enough.\"\n\nShapiro also advised against making any changes to your medications, including cholesterol-lowering drugs, without talking to your doctor first.\n\nAlso, she cautioned, when increasing the fiber in your diet, do it slowly. This will help prevent bloating and gas that may occur if you increase your fiber intake too quickly. She said that 25 to 30 grams of fiber daily is the recommended intake, and she suggested increasing your current intake by about 5 grams daily each week to give your body a chance to get used to the increased fiber.\n\nLearn more about the importance of fruits and vegetables from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "We\u2019ll give the story credit for seeking the input from an independent clinical nutritionist, although she apparently only had a news release and/or an abstract to comment on \u2013 which is incomplete basis for comment much less a story.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "EWING, N.J., March 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Celator Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: CPXX) today announced positive results from the Phase 3 trial of VYXEOS\u2122 (cytarabine: daunorubicin) Liposome for Injection (also known as CPX-351) in patients with high-risk (secondary) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) compared to the standard of care regimen of cytarabine and daunorubicin known as 7+3. The trial met its primary endpoint demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in overall survival. Data will be submitted for presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology 2016 Annual Meeting.\n\nThe median overall survival for patients treated with VYXEOS in the study was 9.56 months compared to 5.95 months for patients receiving 7+3, representing a 3.61 month improvement in favor of VYXEOS. The hazard ratio (HR) was 0.69 (p=0.005) which represents a 31 percent reduction in the risk of death versus 7+3. The percentage of patients alive 12 months after randomization was 41.5% on the VYXEOS arm compared to 27.6% on the 7+3 arm. The percentage of patients alive 24 months after randomization was 31.1% on the VYXEOS arm compared to 12.3% on the 7+3 arm.\n\n\"The overall survival advantage seen with CPX-351 compared to 7+3, along with a superior response rate and no increase in serious toxicity indicates that we'll likely have a new standard of care for treating older patients with secondary AML,\" said Jeffrey E. Lancet, M.D., senior member and chief of the Leukemia/Myelodysplasia Program at Moffitt Cancer Center and the principal investigator for the study. \"This represents a major step forward for a very difficult-to-treat patient population.\"\n\nVYXEOS also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in induction response rate (CR+CRi of 47.7% versus 33.3%; p=0.016) and this significance was maintained for the analysis of CR alone (CR of 37.3% versus 25.6%, p=0.040).\n\nSixty-day all-cause mortality was 13.7% versus 21.2%, in favor of patients treated with VYXEOS.\n\nNo substantial difference in Grade 3 or higher adverse events was observed between VYXEOS and 7+3. In the intent-to-treat population, Grade 3 or higher, hematologic adverse events were similar for overall infections, febrile neutropenia, and bleeding events. In the intent-to-treat population, Grade 3 or higher, non-hematologic adverse events were similar across all organ systems, including cardiac, gastrointestinal, general systems, metabolic disorders, musculoskeletal, nervous system, respiratory, skin and renal.\n\n\"These findings confirm that VYXEOS provides the first opportunity we've had in decades to extend survival for patients with high-risk AML,\" added Gail Roboz, M.D., Professor of Medicine and Director of the Leukemia Program at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University and the New York-Presbyterian Hospital in New York. \"Also, more patients in remission means more who are eligible for potentially curative therapy.\"\n\nBased on these results the company expects to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) for VYXEOS with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) later this year and submit a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the first quarter of 2017.\n\n\"The successful outcome of this Phase 3 trial represents an important advance for AML patients, their families and clinicians,\" said Scott Jackson, Chief Executive Officer of Celator Pharmaceuticals. \"It also marks a major milestone for Celator, for VYXEOS, and for our CombiPlex\u00ae platform. We offer our sincere thanks to the patients and investigators who participated in this study and we will work closely with regulatory authorities to make this new treatment available to the AML community as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe clinical trial was conducted in partnership with The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society\u00ae (LLS) through its Therapy Acceleration Program (TAP), which has supported the clinical development of VYXEOS beginning in Phase 2.\n\nCelator will host a conference call and live audio webcast on Tuesday, March 15, 2016 at 8:00am EDT to discuss the results of the Phase 3 trial.

VYXEOS represents a novel approach to developing combinations of drugs in which molar ratios of two drugs with synergistic anti-tumor activity are encapsulated in a nano-scale liposome in order to maintain the desired ratio following administration. VYXEOS was granted orphan drug status by the FDA and the European Commission for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). VYXEOS was also granted Fast Track designation for the treatment of elderly patients with secondary AML. In addition to the Phase 3 trial, Celator published results from two randomized, controlled, Phase 2 trials with VYXEOS. The first trial was conducted in newly diagnosed elderly AML patients and the second trial was conducted in patients with AML in first relapse.\n\nThe randomized, controlled, Phase 3 trial (Protocol NCT01696084), enrolled 309 patients at 39 sites in the United States and Canada, and compared VYXEOS to the conventional cytarabine and daunorubicin treatment regimen (commonly referred to as 7+3) as first-line therapy in older (60-75 years of age) patients with high-risk (secondary) AML. Patients were stratified for age (60 to 69 and 70 to 75 years of age) and AML type; treatment-related AML, AML with documented history of MDS with prior treatment with hypomethylating agent therapy, AML with documented history of MDS without prior hypomethlyating agent therapy, AML with a documented history of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL), and de novo AML with a karyotype characteristic of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).\n\nPatients were randomized 1:1 to receive either VYXEOS or 7+3. Patients could receive one or two inductions, and responding patients could receive one or two consolidations. First induction for VYXEOS was 100u/m2; days 1, 3, and 5 by 90-minute infusion and for the control arm was cytarabine 100mg/m2/day by continuous infusion for 7 days and daunorubicin 60mg/m2 on days 1, 2, and 3 (7+3). Second induction for VYXEOS-treated patients was 100u/m2 on days 1 and 3 and the control arm was cytarabine 100mg/m2/day by continuous infusion for 5 days and daunorubicin 60mg/m2 on days 1 and 2 (5+2).\n\nOnly patients with documented CR or CRi were eligible to receive chemotherapy consolidation. Consolidation for VYXEOS-treated patients was 65u/m2 on days 1 and 3 and the control arm was cytarabine 100mg/m2/day by continuous infusion for 5 days and daunorubicin 60mg/m2 on days 1 and 2 (5+2).\n\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rapidly progressing cancer of the blood characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of immature blast cells in the bone marrow. AML is generally a disease of older adults, and the median age of a patient diagnosed with AML is about 67 years. The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be 19,950 new cases of AML and 10,430 deaths from AML in the U.S. in 2016. In Europe the number of new cases is estimated to be 18,000 and in Japan the number is 5,500. The Company estimates that nearly 70 percent of AML patients are over the age of 60, and approximately 75 percent are intermediate or high risk. Furthermore, approximately half of those patients are considered suitable for intensive treatment.\n\nEven with current treatment, overall survival for AML is poor. In patients over 60 years of age, the 5 year survival rate is less than 10%. In high-risk (secondary) AML, overall survival is lower, resulting in an acute need for new treatment options for these patients.\n\nCelator Pharmaceuticals, Inc., with locations in Ewing, N.J., and Vancouver, B.C., is an oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company that is transforming the science of combination therapy, and developing products to improve patient outcomes in cancer. Celator's proprietary technology platform, CombiPlex\u00ae, enables the rational design and rapid evaluation of optimized combinations of anti-cancer drugs, incorporating traditional chemotherapies as well as molecularly targeted agents to deliver enhanced anti-cancer activity. CombiPlex addresses several fundamental shortcomings of conventional combination regimens, as well as the challenges inherent in combination drug development, by identifying the most effective synergistic molar ratio of the drugs being combined in vitro, and fixing this ratio in a nano-scale drug delivery complex to maintain the optimized combination after administration and ensuring exposure of this ratio to the tumor. Celator's pipeline includes the lead product, VYXEOS\u2122 (also known as CPX-351), a nano-scale liposomal formulation of cytarabine:daunorubicin being studied for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia; CPX-1, a nano-scale liposomal formulation of irinotecan:floxuridine studied in colorectal cancer; and a preclinical stage product candidate, CPX-8, a hydrophobic docetaxel prodrug nanoparticle formulation.

This finding could lead to the first advance in the treatment of calcium oxalate stones in 30 years.\n\nJeffrey Rimer, associate professor of chemical engineering at the University of Houston, was lead author of the study, published Aug. 8 in the online edition of Nature. The work offers the first evidence that the compound hydroxycitrate (HCA) is an effective inhibitor of calcium oxalate crystal growth that, under certain conditions, is actually able to dissolve these crystals. Researchers also explain how it works.\n\nThe findings are the result of a combination of experimental studies, computational studies and human studies, Rimer said.\n\nKidney stones are small, hard mineral deposits that form inside the kidneys, affecting up to 12 percent of men and seven percent of women. High blood pressure, diabetes and obesity can increase the risk, and the reported incidence is on the rise.\n\nPreventive treatment has not changed much over the last three decades. Doctors tell patients who are at risk of developing stones to drink lots of water and avoid foods rich in oxalate, such as rhubarb, okra, spinach and almonds. They often recommend taking citrate (CA), in the form of potassium citrate, a supplement that can slow crystal growth, but some people are unable to tolerate the side effects.\n\nThe project grew out of preliminary work done by collaborator John Asplin, a nephrologist at Litholink Corporation, who suggested HCA as a possible treatment. HCA is chemically similar to CA and is also available as a dietary supplement.\n\n\"HCA shows promise as a potential therapy to prevent kidney stones,\" the researchers wrote. \"HCA may be preferred as a therapy over CA (potassium citrate).\"\n\nIn addition to Rimer and Asplin, authors on the paper include Giannis Mpourmpakis and his graduate student, Michael G. Taylor, of the University of Pittsburgh; Ignacio Granja of Litholink Corporation, and Jihae Chung, a UH graduate student working in Rimer's lab.\n\nThe head-to-head studies of CA and HCA determined that while both compounds inhibit the growth of calcium oxalate crystals, HCA was more potent and displayed unique qualities that are advantageous for the development of new therapies.\n\nThe team of researchers then used atomic force microscopy, or AFM, to study interactions between the crystals, CA and HCA under realistic growth conditions. According to Rimer, the technique allowed them to record crystal growth in real time with near-molecular resolution.\n\nChung noted that the AFM images recorded the crystal actually shrinking when exposed to specific concentrations of HCA. Rimer suspected the initial finding was an abnormality, as it is rare to see a crystal actually dissolve in highly supersaturated growth solutions. The most effective inhibitors reported in the literature simply stop the crystal from growing.\n\nIt turned out that Chung's initial finding was correct. Once they confirmed it is possible to dissolve crystals in supersaturated solutions, researchers then looked at reasons to explain why that happened.\n\nMpourmpakis and Taylor applied density functional theory (DFT) - a highly accurate computational method used to study the structure and properties of materials - to address how HCA and CA bind to calcium and to calcium oxalate crystals. They discovered HCA formed a stronger bond with crystal surfaces, inducing a strain that is seemingly relieved by the release of calcium and oxalate, leading to crystal dissolution.\n\nHCA was also tested in human subjects, as seven people took the supplement for three days, allowing researchers to determine that HCA is excreted through urine, a requirement for the supplement to work as a treatment.\n\nWhile Rimer said the research established the groundwork to design an effective drug, questions remain. Long-term safety, dosage and additional human trials are needed, he said.\n\n\"But our initial findings are very promising,\" he said. \"If it works in vivo, similar to our trials in the laboratory, HCA has the potential to reduce the incidence rate of people with chronic kidney stone disease.\"", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The release fails to disclose that the study\u2019s lead author has patented the use of a molecule for kidney stone treatment, nor does it identify the study\u2019s funding source.

It\u2019s not the first study to show a potential anticancer effect of aspirin and other similar painkillers \u2014 a class of medications known and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. Previous studies have found that aspirin users enjoyed a lower risk of colon cancer; a trial published earlier this year concluded that people who take a daily aspirin have as much as a 46% lower risk of colon, lung and prostate cancers, compared with non-users.\n\nIn the current trial, researchers looked at all cancer cases in the Danish Cancer Registry from 1991 to 2009 and compared this data against that of a prescription-drug database that recorded patients\u2019 histories of using aspirin, NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors, drugs that all work in similar ways to reduce inflammation and dull pain.\n\nOverall, 18,532 cases of skin cancer were included in the study. Each case was compared to 10 matched controls who did not develop the disease. Over the study period, people who filled more than two prescriptions for aspirin, NSAIDS or COX-2 inhibitors had a 13% lower risk of melanoma and a 15% lower risk of squamous cell carcinoma than those who filled fewer prescriptions, the researchers found.\n\nThe longer people took the drugs, and the higher the dose, the greater the anticancer benefit. Longer, higher-intensity use, for example, led to a 46% lower risk of melanoma, a 35% lower risk of squamous cell carcinoma and a 17% lower risk of basal cell carcinoma, the most common form of skin cancer in the U.S. The relationship held even after the researchers adjusted for potential confounders that could affect the risk of skin cancer, such as use of other medications. However, the researchers didn\u2019t have information on other key skin cancer risk factors like exposure to UV radiation.\n\nThe drugs are thought to counter cancer growth by suppressing inflammatory pathways and stimulating tumors\u2019 ability to expand and develop blood supplies.\n\n\u201cGiven the high skin cancer incidence and the widespread and frequent use of NSAIDs, a preventive effect of these agents may have important public health implications,\u201d the authors, led by Sigrun Alba Johannesdottir from Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark, wrote.\n\nIn the U.S., skin cancer is the most common form of cancer diagnosed, affecting more than 2 million people each year. But taking aspirin and aspirin-like drugs isn\u2019t without consequences: they may have harmful side effects on the stomach and digestive tract, causing bleeding and dangerous ulcers. (One COX-2 inhibitor, Vioxx, was voluntarily pulled from the market by its maker in 2004 after it was linked to an increased risk of heart disease.)\n\nBut given the growing body of data linking aspirin use to lower cancer risk, the researchers say it may be worth factoring in the drugs\u2019 anticancer effects when patients and doctors discuss options for pain relievers. \u201cWe hope that the potential cancer-protective effect of NSAIDs will inspire more research on skin cancer prevention,\u201d Johannesdottir said in a statement. \u201cAlso, this potential cancer-protective effect should be taken into account when discussing benefits and harms of NSAID use.\u201d\n\nAlice Park is a writer at TIME.

Everyone from pro athletes to stroke survivors are benefitting from aquatic exercise that combines walking or running against the natural resistance of the water to help build strength and endurance.\n\nRunning and walking in water is an excellent form of physical therapy for people rehabilitating from hip, knee and back injuries and surgeries. It\u2019s also an easy-on-the joints form of exercise for seniors and others who suffer from arthritis, and a recent study shows it can speed recovery from stroke faster than using a traditional treadmill.\n\nIt\u2019s just an all-around good aerobic conditioner for athletes, too, sports medicine expert Dr. Naresh Rao, told CBS News. Rao is the Olympic Team USA Water Polo Physician for the 2016 Summer Games.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been using hydrotherapy to help decrease any sort of gravity that can affect joint function,\u201d said Rao, who is also with the department of family medicine at Plainview Hospital in Plainview, New York. \u201cI personally prescribe it for knee issues and low back issues.\u201d\n\nHydrotherapy uses a water-friendly treadmill that can be placed in a pool. Another method involves a specially designed treadmill tank.\n\nMatt Johnson, a physical therapist at St. Luke\u2019s Hospital in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, told CBS News that the tank is basically a freestanding tub, about six feet long by three feet wide, with a motorized belt. The water height can be adjusted to the patient\u2019s abilities. The buoyancy of the water helps someone who\u2019s been injured to walk and run a little sooner than they\u2019d be able to do on dry ground, he explained.\n\n\u201cIn water, we can teach them sooner. They can really work on their gait, walk without pain, do exercises in water that you wouldn\u2019t be able to do on land,\u201d said Johnson.\n\nHe uses a HydroTrack Underwater Treadmill System \u2013 professional sports teams including the New York Yankees and the Miami Dolphins, have used it, too. The nice thing about it, said Johnson, is that people can step right into the tank at ground level and then the water fills up around them. It works like a lock on a canal, he said. So, even older patients with limited mobility and balance don\u2019t have to negotiate getting down into a pool.\n\nJohnson starts off recuperating athletes and patients in water somewhere between waist and chest height. The treadmill speed can be set anywhere from 0.3 to 7.1 miles per hour depending on how much resistance a person can handle.\n\n\u201cAt waist height, it\u2019s at about 50 percent of body weight. At chest height, it\u2019s about 30 percent of body weight,\u201d Johnson said, noting, for example, that a person with an injured knee who weighs 100 pounds who is running in waist-high water would only feel like 50 pounds on the bad knee.\n\n\u201cTaking some of that pressure off the knee helps them tolerate that knee injury longer,\u201d said Johnson.\n\nA recent study in the American Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation showed that water workouts might benefit stroke survivors. Researchers asked 21 patients who\u2019d had a stroke within the past two months to undergo two treadmill exercise tests \u2013 one submerged in water and one on a regular treadmill. They gradually increased walking speed and slope over time until the patients couldn\u2019t go any further. Walking on the underwater treadmill produced better measures when it came to maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), a reflection of heart and lung function during exercise, and metabolic equivalents, a measure of energy use.\n\n\u201cThe study proposes a different, very innovative approach\u201d to rehabilitation after stroke, said Dr. Gisele Wolf-Klein, director of geriatric education at Northwell Health in Great Neck, New York.\n\nWolfe-Klein told CBS News she has tried water workouts and said you don\u2019t even feel like you break a sweat even if your heart rate is up. \u201cIt\u2019s a very pleasant way of achieving exactly what you\u2019re trying to do \u2013 allowing a cardio-respiratory response,\u201d Wolfe-Klein told CBS News.\n\nShe noted that medicine\u2019s veterinary counterparts have been using water therapy for years with injured racehorses.\n\nBudd Coates, training director at Runner\u2019s World magazine, said runners don\u2019t just plunge into water\u200b therapy when they\u2019re injured; it\u2019s a great conditioning method for healthy athletes, too. Some recreational swimming pools and homeowners with backyard pools have manual treadmills that are water-safe and can be plunked right in the water.\n\nAn alternative to a water treadmill: Some pool companies will install a water flow system you can work out against.\n\n\u201cIt creates a water force and helps keep you jogging in place,\u201d said Coates.\n\nFor those without access to a water treadmill, you can purchase a foam vest specifically designed for water jogging or use foam barbells to help keep you afloat. Some pools may loan them out, too.\n\nOr, Coates suggested, just try it freeform with waist- or chest-high water to start. If you have trouble getting in out of a recreational pool, look for one that has a slanting beach-style entry into the water, or one with a robotic chair lift. Ask a pool lifeguard or certified swim instructor to help you.\n\nIf running\u2019s not your thing, but the water looks inviting, Coates said there are also spin bikes that can be used underwater.\n\nCoates said the beauty of water running (or even walking) is that it\u2019s great for any age and any level of ability, from elderly stroke survivors to Olympic athletes.\n\nGalen Rupp, the 2016 Rio Olympics\u200b men\u2019s marathon bronze medalist, relies on it as part of his training.\n\n\u201cHe and some of the other guys on the Nike team, it\u2019s well known they take advantage of the anti-gravity treadmill and the aqua track,\u201d Coates said.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story quotes four experts, making this a strong point.

About 70 percent of smokers give up the daunting effort during the first week of trying.\n\nThe researchers, led by Caryn Lerman, a professort of psychiatry, divided 1,246 subjects into slow metabolizers of nicotine and normal metabolizers of the addictive chemical, based on the length of time it took for them to rid their bodies of the drug. The ratio of two metabolites, or byproducts, of the body's processing of nicotine allows easy identification of the two groups. The metabolite is found in blood and saliva.\n\nThe results of the comparison showed that slow metabolizers did just as well on a nicotine patch or the drug varenicline (marketed as Chantix), a drug that works on the nicotine receptors in the brain. But the patch costs less and has fewer side-effects than varenicline (including nausea, difficulty sleeping and abnormal dreams), so the researchers concluded that slow metabolizers should be put on the patch.\n\nNormal metabolizers of nicotine, meanwhile, had more success with varenicline because they tend to rid their systems of nicotine faster, limiting the effectiveness of the patch. Varenicline contains no nicotine.\n\n\"The slower metabolizers, they do very well with the patch. And they get no incremental benefit from varenicline,\" Lerman said in an interview. \"Why spend the money? Why have the side-effects?\"\n\nThis may seem like common sense, but no one had ever tested it before, she said. And given how difficult it is to kick the habit, smokers need all the help they can get to succeed the first time they try, Lerman said.\n\n\"Each time somebody fails, it affects their self confidence,\" Lerman said. \"The trial and error approach is not optimal.\"\n\nResearchers did not test nicotine gum because it delivers a less consistent flow of nicotine to the user, she said. The patch, worn on the skin, delivers a steady flow of the drug, she said.\n\nIn some of the test groups, overall success rates were fairly low, Lerman noted, but the study was conducted during the Great Recession, a time when financial stress may have depressed the chances of succeeding for everyone, regardless of which approach was used.\n\nThis post has been updated.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "We appreciate that this story took the time to interview one of the study authors, who provided useful context.

It may be psychologically harmful for some women and play a significant role in the development of postpartum depression,\u201d said Grace Lim, M.D., director of obstetric anesthesiology at Magee Women\u2019s Hospital of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and lead investigator on the study. \u201cWe found that certain women who experience good pain relief from epidural analgesia are less likely to exhibit depressive symptoms in the postpartum period.\u201d\n\nThe researchers controlled for factors already known to increase the risk for postpartum depression, including pre-existing depression and anxiety, as well as post-delivery pain caused by tissue trauma during childbirth. After accounting for these factors, the study found that in some women, labor pain was still a significant risk factor for postpartum depression symptoms. And, therefore, alleviating this pain might help reduce the risk for postpartum depression. In the study, researchers reviewed the medical records of 201 women who used epidural analgesia and had their pain assessed using a 0-10 scale during labor. They calculated the percent improvement in pain (PIP) throughout labor after the implementation of epidural analgesia. Depression risk was assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) six weeks after childbirth. Researchers found the higher the PIP scores, the lower the EPDS scores.\n\n\u201cAlthough we found an association between women who experience less pain during labor and lower risk for postpartum depression, we do not know if effective pain control with epidural analgesia will assure avoidance of the condition,\u201d said Dr. Lim. \u201cPostpartum depression can develop from a number of things including hormonal changes, psychological adjustment to motherhood, social support, and a history of psychiatric disorders.\u201d\n\nLabor pain may be more problematic for some women than others, the authors note. Additional research is needed to identify which women are more likely to experience severe labor pain and who would benefit the most from effective labor pain-control strategies to help reduce the risk and affect of pain on postpartum recovery.\n\nTHE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ANESTHESIOLOGISTSFounded in 1905, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) is an educational, research and scientific society with more than 52,000 members organized to raise and maintain the standards of the medical practice of anesthesiology.

Topical treatments are available for superficial basal cell carcinoma (BCC) but there has a lack of long-term follow-up data to guide treatment decisions. A three-year randomized controlled clinical trial has found that two topical creams are effective in most primary, low-risk superficial BCC, comparing favorably with photodynamic therapy (PDT), as reported by investigators in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology.\n\nMore than 80% of all skin cancers are BCC, arising from the basal cells (i.e., small, round cells found in the lower layer of the epidermis). There are over two million cases a year in the U.S. and the lifetime risk of developing a BCC before the age of 85 years is one in five people. The prognosis is excellent, but it can cause significant disfigurement by invading surrounding tissues.\n\nWhile most types of BCC require surgery, superficial BCC can be treated topically with noninvasive treatments such as PDT, imiquimod cream, fluorouracil cream, cryosurgery or electrodessication and curettage.\n\nInvestigators in the Netherlands report the results of a three-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial that compared three noninvasive treatments that included imiquimod and fluorouracil cream. \"The main advantages of noninvasive treatments are good cosmetic outcome, preservation of surrounding tissue, and potential for home application of either creams,\" explained lead investigator Marieke Roozeboom of the Department of Dermatology, Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands. \"Throughout the last two decades there has been a growing interest in these non-surgical therapies, which offer the possibility of avoiding surgery and reducing demands on busy medical practices.\"\n\nHowever, prior to this study there has been a lack of randomized controlled trials with a long-term follow-up that compare the effectiveness of noninvasive treatments. Consequently, there is no consensus in international BCC guidelines on the first choice of noninvasive therapy for superficial BCC.\n\nA total of 601 patients with a superficial BCC participated in this study: 202 patients were treated with methylaminolevulinate photodynamic therapy (MAL-PDT), 198 with imiquimod cream, and 201 with fluorouracil cream. The three study groups had a similar distribution of baseline characteristics, with the exception of tumor size.\n\nAround 80% of patients with superficial BCC were tumor free after imiquimod treatment after three years. The clearance rate was 68% for patients treated with fluorouracil and 58% for individuals receiving PDT.\n\n\"Based on our findings, both imiquimod and fluorouracil are effective noninvasive treatments in most primary, low-risk superficial BCC, but the data provide no definite evidence for superiority of imiquimod to fluorouracil,\" commented Dr. Roozeboom. \"Both creams have an equal cosmetic outcome and risk of local adverse events. Fluorouracil has the advantage of being less expensive than imiquimod. However, between one- and three-year follow-up, more recurrences were diagnosed in the fluorouracil group compared with the imiquimod group.\"\n\n\"When choosing a treatment for an individual patient with a superficial BCC, other factors like age, compliance, and patient preferences should always be taken into account. For example, we have found that in superficial BCC on the lower extremities in older patients, PDT should be prescribed rather than imiquimod. Our evidence indicates that a personalized treatment approach is necessary,\" added Dr. Roozeboom.\n\n\"Three year follow-up results of photodynamic therapy versus imiquimod versus fluorouracil for treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma: a single blind, noninferiority, randomized controlled trial,\" by Marieke H.

This independent, multicenter, blinded study is one of the first studies to validate that a liquid biopsy test can predict therapeutic response and demonstrate a survival benefit. The blood test called, Oncotype DX\u00ae AR-V7 Nucleus Detect\u2122 is commercially available in the U.S. through Epic Science's partnership with Genomic Health, Inc. (NASDAQ: GHDX). The research was published online today in JAMA Oncology.\n\n\"This liquid biopsy test addresses a critical unmet need at a decision point in management to predict and select the therapy that is most likely to extend a patient's life,\" said Howard Scher, M.D., who led the study and is the co-chair, Center for Mechanism Based Therapy and Head of the Biomarker Development Initiative at MSK. \"During the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer, physicians will now be able to use AR-V7 status to determine when a patient's cancer has become resistant to androgen receptor directed therapy and will respond better to chemotherapy, enabling the patient to live longer.\"\n\nThis blinded four-year study followed 142 mCRPC patients who were treated at MSK, The Royal Marsden, or the London Health Sciences Centre. Blood samples were obtained prior to treatment with ARSi therapy or chemotherapy and tested with a validated assay for the nuclear-localized androgen receptor splice variant (AR-V7) protein in circulating tumor cells. The results were that patients positive for AR-V7 who were treated with taxane-based chemotherapy had superior overall survival (OS) relative to those treated with ARSI therapy (median OS, 14.3 vs. 7.3 months). Importantly, patients negative for AR-V7 who were treated with ARSi therapy had superior OS relative to those treated with taxanes (media OS, 19.8 vs. 12.8 months). Additionally, the authors validated the test within a prognostic risk group, to ensure that the biomarker effect was due to the biomarker rather than other clinical variables.\n\n\"We developed this test specifically to address a significant clinical question in metastatic prostate cancer that previously had no clear answer: which treatment should be pursued next? This question weighs heavily on doctors and patients, but now, with the Oncotype DX AR-V7 test, we can provide them the confidence to know whether continuing with hormonal therapy or switching to chemotherapy will result in better survival outcomes,\" said Ryan Dittamore, chief of medical innovation at Epic Sciences and a co-author on the study. \"In addition, the survival benefit gained through the utilization of our AR-V7 test could make the test as valuable to a patient's outcome as a blockbuster cancer drug.\"\n\nThis is the second blinded, multi-center clinical utility validation study utilizing the nuclear-localized AR-V7 test. Earlier this month, Dr. Andrew Armstrong of Duke Cancer Institute presented data validating the test in the PROPHECY clinical trial at the ASCO 2018 Annual Meeting. The PROPHECY study investigated the AR-V7 test in patients receiving ARSi therapy and demonstrated that patients who tested positive had worse survival by all measures and had no clinical benefit from ARSi therapy.\n\nIn March of this year, based upon earlier studies utilizing the test, Palmetto GBA, a Medicare Administrative Contractor that assesses molecular diagnostic technologies, issued a draft local coverage determination (LCD) for the Oncotype DX\u00ae AR-V7 Nucleus Detect\u2122 test. A full LCD for the test is expected in the upcoming months and would support Medicare reimbursement for applicable patients considering ARSI or taxane therapies. It is estimated that 50,000 patients a year may be eligible for and benefit from the Oncotype DX\u00ae AR-V7 Nucleus Detect\u2122 test.\n\nThe paper is entitled, \"Assessment of the Validity of Nuclear-Localized Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 in Circulating Tumor Cells as a Predictive Biomarker for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.\"\n\nAbout the Oncotype DX\u00ae AR-V7 Nucleus Detect\u2122 Test\n\nDesigned by Epic Sciences and based on results from multiple studies led by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the Oncotype DX\u00ae AR-V7 Nucleus Detect\u2122 test is the first and only liquid biopsy test of its kind that can potentially prolong the lives of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) by helping their physician identify the most effective treatment. Through a blood draw, the test detects AR-V7 protein in the nucleus of circulating tumor cells utilizing Epic Sciences' No Cell Left Behind\u00ae platform to accurately identify patients who are resistant to androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapies and who should instead switch to chemotherapy.

But the therapy worked vastly better than University of Pennsylvania researchers David L. Porter, MD, Carl H. June, MD, and colleagues had dared to hope.\n\n\"Our results were absolutely dramatic. It is tremendously exciting,\" Porter tells WebMD. \"These kinds of outcomes don't come around very often. We are really hopeful that we can now translate this into treatment for much larger numbers of patients and apply this technique to other diseases and to many more patients.\"\n\nExcitement is spreading as oncologists learn about the findings. \"I think it is a big deal,\" says Jacque Galipeau, MD, professor of hematology and medical oncology at Emory University Winship Cancer Center. Galipeau was not involved in the Porter study.\n\n\"Here's this guy, the handwriting is on the wall, any hematologist will tell you he is a goner -- this guy was essentially cured,\" Galipeau tells WebMD. \"These genetically engineered cells did what everyone in the field has tried to do for 20 years. The man probably had kilograms of disease in his body, and the cells mopped it up completely.\"\n\nThe treatment uses a form of white blood cells called T cells harvested from each patient. A manmade virus-like vector is used to transfer special molecules to the T cells. One of the molecules, CD19, makes the T cells attack B lymphocytes -- the cells that become cancerous in CLL.\n\nAll this has been done before. These genetically engineered cells are called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. They kill cancer in the test tube. But in humans, they die away before they do much damage to tumors.\n\nWhat's new about the current treatment is the addition of a special signaling molecule called 4-1BB. This signal does several things: it gives CAR T cells more potent anti-tumor activity, and it somehow allows the cells to persist and multiply in patients' bodies. Moreover, the signal does not call down the deadly all-out immune attack -- the feared \"cytokine storm\" -- that can do more harm than good.\n\nThis may be why relatively small infusions of the CAR T cells had such a profound effect. Each of the cells killed thousands of cancer cells and destroyed more than 2 pounds of tumor in each patient.\n\n\"Within three weeks, the tumors had been blown away, in a way that was much more violent than we ever expected,\"June says in a news release.

This collaboration, which includes a 10-year maintenance service, marks the first multi-room PBT application in the nation\u2019s capital. This will be Hitachi\u2019s fifth PBT system in North America.\n\nThe next-generation system \u201cPROBEAT\u201d, which comes with IMPT (Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy) and cone-beam CT, will have improved spot scanning capability in all 3 gantry-type treatment rooms, along with a fixed irradiation room dedicated to cancer research.\n\nToshiaki Higashihara, President & COO of Hitachi, Ltd. stated that, \u201cWe are greatly honored that Johns Hopkins selected Hitachi as their proton partner. As one of the leaders in cancer research and treatment, the Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center\u2019s philosophy of being at the leading edge of cancer treatment through research and development is very similar to our Social Innovation concept which supports a healthy and secure society through innovative technologies, systems, solutions and services. The proton center at Sibley Memorial Hospital will be an impressive demonstration of industry and academic medicine collaborating to bring a new technology and new cancer treatment modality to Washington, D.C. and the surrounding communities. Thus, we foresee an exciting, long term relationship that will benefit cancer patients and cancer research.\u201d\n\nIn December 2007, Hitachi was the first company in the U.S. to clear FDA Premarket Notification Special 510(k) for the \u201cPROBEAT\u201d system with its spot scanning irradiation technology. Hitachi has delivered the first hospital based spot scanning system in May 2008 and has treated over 1,500 patients to date. The same spot scanning system has already been installed at Nagoya Proton Therapy Center and Hokkaido University in Japan. In fiscal year 2015 (ending March 2016), one of Hitachi's new PBT site is planning to start treatment of patients. Hitachi has shown great stability in the proton market through continued investment in research and development, track record for high clinical availability of over 98%, along with a commitment to a long term partnership with all of its clients.\n\nGiven the growing demand for technical and clinical advancements in the treatment of cancer, interest in proton therapy is on the rise, with more and more hospitals and cancer treatment facilities venturing into this area. Hitachi will continue to globally expand the healthcare business where proton therapy is its flagship solution, and contribute to cancer treatment around the world.\n\nProton Beam Therapy (PBT) is an advanced type of cancer radiotherapy. Protons from a hydrogen atom are extracted and accelerated up to 70% the speed of light. Its energy is concentrated directly on the tumor while avoiding radiation dose to the surrounding healthy tissues. PBT improves the quality of life for cancer patients since the patient experiences no pain during treatment and the procedure has very few side effects compared with that of traditional radiotherapy. In most cases, patients can continue with their normal daily activities while undergoing treatment. Because there are fewer side effects, PBT is expected to expand, especially for pediatric treatment.\n\nUnlike conventional scattering technology, spot scanning technology delivers narrow beams to the tumor and the complex tumor shape can be irradiated through repetitive beam delivery with quick position change. Spot scanning technology has been achieved by advancing the uniform quality beam extraction technology from the accelerator and beam control technology with high accuracy. Three primary benefits are: (1) more accurate irradiation which reduces the side effects to healthy tissues surrounding the tumor compared with irradiation from conventional double scattering irradiation; (2) patient-specific collimators and boluses become obsolete, shortening set up times for patients; and (3) high proton beam usage factor reducing unnecessary secondary radiation.\n\nHitachi, Ltd.

At that time, the group, which represents about 60,000 pediatricians nationwide, concluded that there was no clear evidence for or against circumcising newborns. The group affirmed that position in 2005.\n\nSince then, the popularity of circumcision in the United States has declined. Only about 56 percent of newborn males are circumcised.\n\nThe academy's task force spent seven years combing through the latest research, analyzing more than a thousand studies. Their conclusion?\n\nFor starters, Blank says, circumcision helps baby boys pretty much immediately.\n\n\"The health benefits of male circumcision include a drop in the risk of urinary tract infection in the first year of life by up to 90 percent,\" she says.\n\nBut there's a much bigger reason to do it, Blank said. Circumcised males are far less likely to get infected with a long list of sexually transmitted diseases.\n\n\"It drops the risk of heterosexual HIV acquisition by about 60 percent. It drops the risk of human papillomavirus [HPV], herpes virus and other infectious genital ulcers,\" she says.\n\nIt also reduces the chances that men will spread HPV to their wives and girlfriends, protecting them from getting cervical cancer.\n\n\"We've reviewed the data and, you know, we have gone through them with a fine-tooth comb, and the data are pretty convincing,\" she says.\n\nCritics, however, were not convinced. They liken the procedure to female genital mutilation.\n\n\"We have no right as parents or as physicians or adults to strap them down and chop off a normal part of their body. To do that is a human rights violation and an ethical travesty,\" says Georgeanne Chapin of the anti-circumcision group Intact America.\n\nChapin and other critics argue that the scientific evidence is questionable. For one thing, the studies about HIV have only been done in Africa, where AIDS is much more common among heterosexuals.\n\n\"They're cherry-picking their evidence,\" she says. \"They act as though there's this huge body of literature. It's all the same couple of studies that have been regurgitated and reprogrammed. Over the past 150 years, all kinds of medical benefits have been proposed as resulting from cutting off the foreskin, and they have all been disproven.\"\n\nCritics also question the safety of the procedure, saying too many boys are damaged for life by botched circumcisions.\n\nBut many experts say the academy is making the right call. They dismiss any comparison to female genital mutilation as grossly misleading and say male circumcision is about as safe as any procedure could be.\n\nSome think the academy's position is long overdue, and that the group should have gone even further and more forcefully recommended circumcision.\n\n\"I think that all healthy newborn babies should be circumcised,\" says Edgar Schoen, a professor emeritus at the University of California, San Francisco. \"I feel about newborn circumcision the way I do about immunization: It's a potent preventive health procedure that gives you a health advantage.\"\n\nFor its part, the pediatricians group hopes the new recommendations will encourage more parents to circumcise their sons \u2014 and more insurance plans to pay for it. As Shots reported last week, a lot of state Medicaid programs have stopped covering circumcision.\n\n\"Those families who choose circumcision should have access to circumcision. Cost should not be a barrier,\" Blank says.\n\nThe federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been promising for years now to issue the government's first guidelines about circumcision.

It is found throughout the human body, with high concentrations in the liver, adrenal glands and brain.\n\nThe latest research, conducted by investigators at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, is important not only because it suggests another treatment option for patients with depression, but because it also offers news clues into the physical pathways of depression that could ultimately lead to more effective treatments.\n\n\u201cThere are many directions in research that this opens up,\u201d said Dr. George I. Papakostas, director of treatment resistant depression studies at Mass General and the study\u2019s lead author. \u201cIt provides clues to new treatments, and it provides clues to understanding what causes depression as well as what goes on biochemically when people get better from depression.\u201d\n\nThe researchers studied the use of SAMe or a placebo in 73 adults with depression who were not responding to prescription antidepressant treatment. All of the study subjects continued to take the prescription antidepressant, but 39 of them were randomly assigned to receive SAMe for six weeks. The remaining 34 patients received a placebo in addition to their regular prescription treatment.\n\nAfter six weeks of treatment, 36 percent of the patients taking a combination of SAMe and an antidepressant showed improvement, compared to just 18 percent of those taking the antidepressant and placebo. And about 26 percent of patients in the SAMe group experienced a complete remission of symptoms, compared to just 12 percent in the placebo group, according to a report published in The American Journal of Psychiatry.\n\nThe research offers hope to patients who haven\u2019t been helped by traditional antidepressant treatment. Studies suggest that for more than half of depressed patients, antidepressants alone don\u2019t eliminate symptoms. As a result, doctors are looking for additional treatments to help these patients, referred to as \u201cnonresponders.\u201d\n\nModern antidepressants essentially work by building up concentrations of neurotransmitters, which amplifies their effect on the brain. It\u2019s not clear exactly how SAMe works to curb depression, but researchers have several theories. SAMe may influence the expression of genes involved in depression or alter the function of different receptors and structures that transport neurotransmitters in the brain. The molecule also may be directly involved in the creation of neurotransmitters.\n\n\u201cMost antidepressants we use are acting on neurotransmitters in the brain,\u201d said Dr. J. Craig Nelson, professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, and author of an editorial accompanying the study. \u201cIt may be that SAMe is facilitating the synthesis of the neurotransmitters that the drugs then act on. That\u2019s probably the best hypothesis.\u201d\n\nOther studies have suggested that SAMe can relieve symptoms of depression. A 2002 analysis of depression trials conducted by the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality found that SAMe use resulted in clinically meaningful benefits to depressed patients compared to placebo, and that the supplement worked as well as tricyclic antidepressants, a category of prescription drugs.\n\nIn his editorial, Dr. Nelson notes that SAMe is typically not covered by insurance companies, and that although the cost is relatively low, it is still more than the drug co-payments required by most health plans. A monthly supply of the same brand of supplement studied would be about $143, the editorial notes.\n\nDr. Nelson, who was not involved in the Harvard study, said the results need to be replicated in a larger study, and that more information is needed on dosing, side effects and long-term treatment with SAMe, among other things. Dr. Papakostas agrees the study \u201cneeds replication\u201d but said he is hopeful about the potential for future research.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge advancement in terms of expanding the types of medications we have to treat depression,\u201d Dr. Papakostas said. \u201cIn the last 60 years of depression research, all the treatments have focused on similar mechanisms of action. This is one of the first few studies that suggests a different mechanism.

(Table sugar, or sucrose, extracted from sugar cane or sugar beets, is a compound of glucose and fructose.) Researchers also took blood samples to measure levels of glucose, fructose and insulin, and of leptin and ghrelin, enzymes involved in controlling hunger and feelings of fullness.\n\nBefore having their drinks, the participants rated their desire to eat on a one-to-10 scale from \u201cnot at all\u201d to \u201cvery much.\u201d Then they drank the liquids and had functional magnetic resonance imaging brain scans while looking at images of food and of neutral objects like buildings or baskets. As they did so, they rated their hunger using the scale. The volunteers were then presented with images of high-calorie foods and asked whether they would like to have the food now, or a monetary award a month later instead.\n\nThe study, published in the journal PNAS, found that compared with glucose, consuming fructose produced greater responses to food cues in the orbital frontal cortex of the brain, a region that plays an important role in reward processing. The fructose drink also produced greater activity in the visual cortex when volunteers looked at images of food, a finding that suggests increased craving compared with glucose.\n\nWhen choosing between tasty high-calorie food or a delayed monetary reward, fructose drinkers were more likely than glucose drinkers to choose the food.\n\nThere was no difference in leptin or ghrelin levels between fructose and glucose drinkers. But plasma insulin response was sharply lower in fructose drinkers, which may affect what we eat, according to the senior author, Dr. Kathleen A. Page, an assistant professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California.\n\n\u201cInsulin is released when we consume glucose,\u201d she said. \u201cThe pancreas secretes insulin, and insulin drives glucose into cells so that it can be used for energy.

Boosting this synchronous brain activity appeared to act as a cue for the brain\u2019s immune cells, prompting them to absorb the sticky amyloid proteins that are the most visible hallmarks of the disease in the brain\u2019s of people with Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThe authors caution that a \u201cbig if\u201d remains over whether the findings would be replicated in humans \u2013 and whether cognitive deficits as well as visible symptoms of the disease would be improved.\n\n\u201cIf humans behave similarly to mice in response to this treatment, I would say the potential is just enormous, because it\u2019s so non-invasive, and it\u2019s so accessible,\u201d said Li-Huei Tsai, director of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at MIT, and the paper\u2019s senior author.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s research has faced a number of major setbacks \u2013 most recently the failure of Eli Lily\u2019s drug trial \u2013 after promising results in rodents did not translate into clinical improvements for patients.\n\nThe latest intervention, scientists predict, should be quicker and cheaper to confirm in humans than pharmaceuticals, which typically take more than a decade to develop and assess for safety before the clinical efficacy is even examined.\n\nThe study, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature, hinges on the observation that Alzheimer\u2019s patients show a loss of synchronised brain activity, known as gamma oscillations, which is linked to attention and memory.\n\n\n\nTo restore the activity, the scientists first used mice that had been genetically engineered such that the neurons that generate gamma activity in the brain were sensitive to light. The technique, known as optogenetics, allowed the scientists to artificially cause groups of neurons to fire in unison by pulsing light into the brains of the mice.\n\n\n\nAfter an hour of stimulation, the researchers found a roughly 50% reduction in the levels of beta amyloid proteins in the hippocampus, the brain\u2019s memory centre. Closer inspection showed that the amyloid had been taken up by microglia, the brain\u2019s immune cells.\n\nIn a healthy brain, microglia act as chemical rubbish collectors, surveying the local environment, clearing up unwanted compounds, but in Alzheimer\u2019s these cells can lose this function and switch into an inflammatory state in which they secrete toxic compounds instead. Strengthening gamma oscillations appeared to switch the microglia back into a productive state.\n\nNext, the scientist showed that gamma oscillations could also be stimulated non-invasively in the visual brain region simply by exposing the mice to a flickering light. At 40Hz the flicker of the light is barely discernible and would be \u201cnot offensive at all\u201d for a person to have in the background.\n\nAfter being given one hour of flickering light each day for a week, the scientists saw a 60% reduction of harmful amyloid plaques in the brains of the mice.\n\nEd Mann, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Oxford, said: \u201cI was surprised, and it\u2019s exciting, that such a simple stimulus can target a molecular pathway and have such an effect in an hour.\u201d\n\nQuestions remain, however, about whether boosting gamma oscillations and sweeping amyloid plaques out of the visual brain region would help with memory, which is centred in the hippocampus, or broader cognitive abilities.\n\nDavid Reynolds, chief scientific officer at Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, said: \u201cIt is conceivable that changing brain cell rhythms could be a future target for therapies, but researchers will need to explore how light flickering approaches could not only reduce amyloid in the visual area of the brain but in those areas more commonly affected in Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThe authors suggest that it may be possible to take a multi-sensory approach, using a combination of flashing lights and vibrating chairs.

But there's good news about the experimental treatment that he pioneered.\n\nIn study results to be presented next week at an annual meeting of cancer doctors, Hassenbusch's treatment \u2014 chemotherapy and a new vaccine \u2014 significantly prolonged survival of patients with glioblastoma, the most common and aggressive brain cancer.\n\nSen.

Because chemotherapy kills patients' white blood cells, it is usually considered incompatible with vaccines or, as they're also known, immunotherapy.\n\nGlioblastoma kills nearly 10,000 Americans annually, a majority within the first 15 months after diagnosis, largely because of tentacle-like cells that creep into the brain from the main mass.\n\nHassenbusch, an M.D. Anderson professor of neurosurgery and a pain control expert who treated more than 500 brain cancer patients, was diagnosed with the disease in 2005. After surgery and follow-up radiation, he and his doctors decided to combine Temodar, the now-standard chemotherapy, and the vaccine, until then only used alone.\n\nHassenbusch became the first patient in the M.D. Anderson-Duke trial.\n\nIn all, the study enrolled 23 patients between 2005 and 2007. It was only open to those with a particular protein \u2014 present in one-third to two-thirds of glioblastomas \u2014 and those who were tumor free after surgery and radiation.\n\nKennedy's tumor is thought to be inoperable.\n\nThe study found the average time for recurrence of the tumor was 16.6 months, up from the previous six months. The time of survival was also up significantly from the previous average of 14 months, said Sampson, who declined to reveal the exact number until he presents the data June 2 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago.\n\nUnder the trial protocol, some patients received Temodar for the first five days of the month, and some received it for the first 21 days. On the 21st, all received the vaccine, which signals the immune system to destroy the cancer. Without the vaccine, the immune system doesn't recognize glioblastoma.\n\nAlmost all the patients mounted an immune response. The response was better with the highest dose of Temodar.\n\n\"I think Sam would be pretty excited about these results,\" said Dr. Mark Gilbert, an M.D. Anderson professor of neuro-oncology whose study of Temodar enrolled some 1,150 patients, the most ever in a brain cancer trial.\n\nGilbert cautioned that the study results are preliminary. He noted the impressive results could be the result of cherry-picking patients, accepting only those whose tumors had been excised by surgery and radiation.\n\nTo resolve that possibility, a new trial is under way at 20 cancer centers, including M.D. Anderson, dividing such patients into a group that gets just Temodor and a group that gets the combination therapy.\n\nAlso on tap is a trial adding a third drug \u2014 Avastin, a targeted therapy that starves tumors by stopping them from building blood vessels that supply them with nutrients \u2014 to the regimen.\n\nFor one patient in the study, the Temodar-vaccine combination by itself has worked fine.\n\n\"Doctors originally gave me six to eight months to live when I was diagnosed with glioblastoma,\" said Barbara Derenowski, 69, of Surprise, Ariz., a retirement community northwest of Phoenix. \"But two years later, I'm in good shape, living a normal life and still returning cancer-free scans every month, thanks to this trial.

In the eight-week trial, researchers found significant reductions in signs of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein and other blood markers.\n\n\u201cCurcumin is the active ingredient of the famous spice turmeric and has a long history of culinary and medicinal use in the Asian countries,\u201d said the study\u2019s senior author Amirhossein Sahebkar.\n\n\u201cTwo key effects of curcumin that account for most of the therapeutic effects of this compound are its strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties,\u201d said Sahebkar researcher at the Mashhad University of Medical Sciences in Iran, in an email.\n\nThese properties of curcumin have been shown in several animal studies, he noted, but there have been relatively few studies in people. So his team designed a randomized controlled clinical trial to see if short-term use of a curcumin supplement could reduce inflammation in people with metabolic syndrome, a cluster of risk factors for heart disease.\n\nHaving a large waistline, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, low levels of HDL (good) cholesterol and high levels of triglycerides, are among the factors that make up metabolic syndrome. People with three or more of these classic traits are at higher than average risk of developing heart disease or diabetes or both.\n\nInflammation is also emerging as a feature of metabolic syndrome, Sahebkar\u2019s team writes in the journal Clinical Nutrition. They set out to see if curcumin supplements could at least roll back that risk factor by enrolling 117 participants who had been diagnosed with metabolic syndrome for their study.\n\nHalf were given pills containing one gram of curcumin powder, and the other half were given similar looking pills with no curcumin inside. All the participants took the supplements every day for eight weeks.\n\nAt the beginning of the study and again at the end, the researchers measured levels of three blood markers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein (CRP), which even on its own has been linked with heart disease risk.\n\nThey found that the people who took curcumin had improved blood levels of all three biomarkers as well as reduced fasting blood sugar and hemoglobin A1c, a measure of long-term blood sugar levels. The comparison group had higher glucose and levels of one of the inflammation markers, and no changes in the other markers.\n\nThe study team also analyzed data from eight previous studies and confirmed that curcumin had shown a significant reduction of CRP concentrations in a total of 281 patients.\n\n\u201cThe findings of our studies, along with clinical findings reported by other groups, indicate the usefulness of daily use of curcumin supplement for the prevention and treatment of several diseases,\u201d Sahebkar said.\n\nThe researchers didn\u2019t examine the effect of curcumin on any diseases, and it was a fairly brief study, so it\u2019s not clear what the long-term implications may be they caution in their report.\n\nThe study was funded by the Clinical Trial Research Center in Tehran and the Iran National Science Foundation.

But there were nine instances of very low blood sugar among children who had the standard treatment, according to the study, conducted by researchers in Britain at the University of Cambridge.\n\n\u201cThis is an important step in diabetes control because it shows that, with this system, people can sleep safely with minimized risk of hypoglycemia,\u201d said Dr. Eric Renard, a professor of diabetology at Montpellier University Hospital in Montpellier, France.\n\nDr. Renard, whose commentary accompanied the study in The Lancet, has been a consultant and speaker for several makers of diabetic products, he said.\n\nIndustry analysts have estimated that 10 to 15 percent of Americans with Type 1 diabetes \u2014 perhaps 400,000 of them \u2014 use either a continuous glucose monitor or an insulin pump, or in some cases both.\n\nOver the last decade, the makers of medical devices have developed techniques that have widened diabetes management options beyond pricking the finger several times a day to test blood glucose levels. Companies like DexCom in San Diego now make small continuous glucose monitors whose sensors can be embedded in the skin. And Animas, a division of Johnson & Johnson, makes programmable pumps the size of a cellphone that administer insulin doses through a tiny implantable catheter.\n\nThese new-generation devices represent a significant advance over older products, said Aaron J. Kowalski, the assistant senior vice president of glucose control research at the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation in Manhattan, one of the largest nonprofit patient advocacy and research groups for diabetes.\n\nEven so, Dr. Kowalski said, using separate devices that are not designed to work in concert poses limits to treatment, particularly overnight. If a diabetic person\u2019s blood sugar drops during the night and the glucose monitor alarm goes off, for example, that person may not wake up and the preprogrammed pump, operating separately, could continue to deliver insulin, making the problem worse, Dr. Kowalski said. (His group was one of the sponsors of the Lancet study.)\n\nResearchers in Europe and the United States have been racing to develop a fully automated system for Type 1 diabetes that would wirelessly connect an external glucose monitor with an insulin delivery device. Based on algorithms like the ones used in the Lancet study, the devices would continually monitor glucose levels, calibrate insulin dosages and then dispense insulin in real time \u2014 automating a delivery task performed by a nurse in the study.\n\nResearchers call such a hypothetical integrated system an \u201cartificial pancreas\u201d because it would mimic the way a healthy pancreas works, sensing glucose and dispensing insulin in the right dose at the right time. The goal is a portable system that could be worn on a belt and would be no larger than a cellphone.\n\nLast month, as part of an effort called the Artificial Pancreas Project, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation announced an $8 million partnership with Animas to develop a first-generation combined system. Meanwhile the European Union has just started its own project, called Artificial Pancreas at Home, which involves a grant of 10.5 million euros to research teams across Europe to create a prototype combined device over the next four years, Dr. Renard said.\n\nThe new study in The Lancet, proponents say, represents a proof-of-concept milestone in the quest to develop such a system.\n\n\u201cThe significance is in showing that the existing devices, which are available commercially, can be combined to create the first version of an artificial pancreas,\u201d said Dr. Roman Hovorka, the lead author of the study.\n\nDr. Hovorka, a principal research associate in pediatrics at Cambridge, said he had been a consultant or speaker for several makers of diabetes products.\n\nAlthough the Lancet study was small \u2014 only 17 children completed the entire protocol \u2014 it is significant because it demonstrated that a computer algorithm could safely interpret glucose data and calculate appropriate insulin doses for a pump, he said.\n\nThe study not only indicated that the algorithm system prevented very low glucose overnight, Dr. Hovorka said, but it also indicated that the experimental system was better able to keep blood glucose in an acceptable range.\n\nAfter midnight, about 80 percent of the measured glucose levels fell in a target range in children treated with the computer-adjusted system \u2014 compared to only 35 percent in the target range for those treated with a standard preprogrammed pump system, according to the study.\n\nStill, while the overall results were statistically significant, the study was not large enough to attain statistical significance in each of its separate arms. Those branches of the study examined how children fared after eating meals or after exercising \u2014 factors which can affect glucose levels.\n\nAnd the experimental combined system itself was not fully automated. To ensure that the experimental algorithm did not recommend unsafe doses, a nurse read the computer-generated dosing suggestions and then adjusted the patients\u2019 insulin pumps.\n\nIndeed, even if device makers are able to develop fully automated prototypes of combination systems, they are likely to face regulatory hurdles, analysts said, and would have to factor in product liability concerns.\n\n\u201cThis is something that companies have been striving to do for years, and as computer chip technology evolves, it gets closer,\u201d said Rick Wise, an analyst at Leerink Swann, a health care investment bank. \u201cBut you have to appreciate how exquisitely reliable an artificial pancreas would have to be to read glucose correctly and dispense insulin correctly.\u201d", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story includes quotes\u00a0from interviews with one of the study investigators and another researcher, and identifies both as having ties to diabetes products manufacturers.

Park-Wyllie, of St. Michael\u2019s Hospital in Toronto, who worked on the new study.\n\n\u201cWomen with osteoporosis who are at high risk of fractures should not stop taking their treatment,\u201d she told Reuters Health.\n\nSome 10 million Americans currently suffer from bone thinning, according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation. The majority are postmenopausal women.\n\nPark-Wyllie and colleagues tapped into data on more than 205,000 Ontario women at least 68 years old who had taken the bone drugs. Their findings appear in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nOverall, 716 women suffered the unusual type of thighbone fracture after starting the bone drugs, and nearly 10,000 had typical hip fractures.\n\nThe risk of a thighbone fracture differed depending on how long the women had been taking the medicine. After taking bone drugs for five years, about one in 1,000 women went on to suffer a thigh fracture over the next year.\n\nThat works out to nearly three times the risk of those who\u2019d taken the drugs for roughly three months or less, after accounting for other risk factors.\n\nOn the other hand, longer treatment was tied to a 24-percent decrease in hip fractures, which along with wrist and spine fractures affect about half of all people with osteoporosis.\n\nThere are several alternative ways to treat osteoporosis, including hormone treatment for women. And one preliminary study, published along with the Canadian findings in JAMA, hints that the common heart medication nitroglycerin might also boost bone health.\n\nSo far, however, the cheap and effective bisphosphonate bone drugs remain the most popular treatment option. But some experts worry that negative media coverage might have led to more fractures and possibly deaths by dissuading patients from taking the drugs.\n\n\u201cThe bad news is that overstating the levels of risk of side effects with these drugs \u2014 which the media have been doing for some time now \u2014 has led people to stop the drugs when they should be taking them,\u201d said Dr. Ethel S.

But that\u2019s a very rare problem, experts say, which only affects about one in 100,000 people on bisphosphonates.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re taking the drugs and you\u2019ve been on them for a while, but aren\u2019t sure if you\u2019re at high risk, you should ask your doctor about it,\u201d Park-Wyllie advised.\n\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federal expert panel, recommends screening all women over 65 for osteoporosis.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Reuters gives us two voices in this piece, including a study author and a treating physician.

This week, specialty insurance administrator Magellan Behavioral Health Inc. issued medical necessity guidelines for TMS treatment and will provide coverage effective Jan. 1.\n\nDoctors who use the NeuroStar TMS Therapy system say treatments are more effective than medications with far fewer side effects. It's an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy \u2014 shock treatments \u2014 for patients who have not responded to drugs or psychotherapy. But TMS is expensive. It can cost as much as $400 for a 37-minute session and require multiple treatments. The total bill can range between $8,000 and $12,000.\n\nThe cost, however, is less than an extended hospital stay.\n\n\"We had several patients who were headed toward the hospital, who had this treatment and were able to avoid that,\" said Dr. Scott West, a psychiatrist who pioneered the treatment in Nashville 2 and one-half years ago.\n\nThe NeuroStar system resembles a dentist's chair. A patient sits in the chair while a magnetic pulse emitter transmits energy from a levered arm \u2014 a process similar to undergoing dental X-rays. The device makes a clicking noise while delivering the magnetic pulses.\n\n\"When this large magnet pulses repetitively, it causes an electromagnetic field which then passes through the skull and stimulates the brain tissue itself,\" said West, explaining a cascading effect that results in the interior nerve fibers connecting better.\n\nDr. Michelle Cochran, purchased her TMS system about 18 months ago. The devices cost around $100,000, Cochran said, who has treated 45 patients with the therapy.\n\n\"Most people are not scared of it,\" she said. \"It sounds sort of creepy and weird when you think about it, but for the most part, it is safer in general than taking a medicine. You've got less seizure risk than taking a medicine. You've got less side effects than taking a medicine.\"\n\nBoth Cochran and West cite high patient response rates. A clinical trial funded by the National Institutes of Health revealed a \"significant effect of treatment\" when patients received TMS treatment. It compared outcomes of patients who actually received the magnetic pulses against patients in a \"sham\" group, who sat down in the treatment chair for fake sessions.\n\nDepressed patients who received the real TMS treatment had remission rates four times higher than those in the sham group.\n\nHowever, insurers, including UnitedHealthcare and BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, remain reluctant to embrace the treatment. UnitedHealthcare's medical policy for TMS says it is unproven for treating depression.\n\n\"Generally speaking, just because a device, procedure or medication has been approved or is deemed to be safe by some entities does not mean that it is automatically covered,\" BlueCross BlueShield spokeswoman Kelly Allen said. \"Quality and safety are our first priority in setting our medical policy, but those have to be balanced with affordability.\"\n\nCochran does not accept Medicare and has chosen to be an out-of-network provider.

The findings may reduce the number of unnecessary treatments prescribed to otherwise healthy girls.\n\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder affecting up to 12% of women. Women with PCOS are more likely to suffer from irregular periods, have excessive levels of male hormones and may have difficulty in conceiving due to irregularities in the ovaries. Doctors are cautious when diagnosing PCOS in teenagers because the symptoms can be confused with normal pubertal changes. Having tools that make diagnoses more accurate can reduce unnecessary treatment for otherwise healthy teenagers at a critical stage in their lives.\n\nThe cause of PCOS is unknown and there is currently no cure for the condition. Previous studies have associated high levels of irisin, a newly discovered hormone which is released from muscles and regulates energy metabolism, with PCOS in adults.\n\nIn this study, Greek researchers from Aghia Sophia Children's Hospital in Athens compared the hormones of 23 teenagers with PCOS with 17 healthy teenagers of the same age and BMI. They found that teenagers with PCOS had significantly higher irisin levels compared to the control group, and that this was associated with higher levels of the male sex hormone testosterone, a key marker of PCOS.\n\nThe findings suggest that irisin could be a marker for PCOS allowing the condition to be diagnosed more easily. \"Teenagers who get an early diagnosis of PCOS can sooner start to deal with the physical and psychological symptoms caused by this lifelong condition,\" said lead researcher Dr Flora Bacopoulou. \"Whether it's through counselling or medication, girls can manage their symptoms and decrease the risk of further complications such as fertility problems, hirsutism (excessive hair growth) and type-2 diabetes\".\n\nThe group will next focus on confirming their results and investigate the biological role of irisin in PCOS. \"If high irisin levels in teenagers with PCOS is established, this could lead to the development of treatments for PCOS.

The trial will be completed in 2012 and the test, if approved, should be available shortly thereafter.\n\n\u201cIf widely used, and regularly, this test really does have the opportunity to eliminate colon cancer,\u201d said Dr. David A. Ahlquist, a colon cancer expert at the Mayo Clinic and an adviser to Exact Sciences.\n\nThe practical value of the tests depends critically on details like their sensitivity, meaning the proportion of tumors that are detected, and their specificity, meaning how many of the positive results are in fact false alarms.\n\nExact Sciences reported in July that its test was highly sensitive and specific when applied directly to cells taken from tumors. But in the real world, the tumor DNA must be detected in stool samples, even though almost all the DNA comes from the bacteria of the gut. Just 0.01 percent of the DNA is human, and most of this is normal DNA, not the altered DNA of tumors.\n\nThe company reported Thursday at a meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research that in a trial of 1,100 patients, the test had detected 64 percent of adenomas, or polyps, larger than one centimeter in diameter, and 85 percent of cancers, as judged by the colonoscopies also given to the patients.\n\nDr. Ahlquist said he was very pleased with the new results, especially the 64 percent detection rate for precancerous polyps, since these are best targets for intervention.\n\nAlthough such a detection rate sounds far from perfect, it can be effective if the test is given on a regular schedule. \u201cThe Pap smear detects only 50 percent of cervical cancers, but applied over time it virtually eliminates the disease,\u201d Dr. Ahlquist said.\n\nThe specificity of the Exact Sciences test is 88 percent, meaning that 12 percent of the time the patient will be given a false alarm. This may be acceptable, given that the worst that will happen is that the patient will get an unnecessary colonoscopy.\n\n\u201cWith stool tests, you need a 90 percent specificity,\u201d said Dr. Bert Vogelstein, a cancer expert at Johns Hopkins University who is also an adviser to the company. \u201cExact Sciences has gotten close to that.

Results were published November 2 in the Obesity Journal.\n\nWhile the Weight Management Center has a high success rate at helping patients lose weight to fight diabetes, many people with the condition don't live near a specialized program and need help that's readily available. O'Neil said because Weight Watchers has centers all over the country, including sites in small towns with limited or no medical facilities, its program could help meet this need if combined with diabetes-specific counseling.\n\nThat's why he said it was important for MUSC to be involved in the study, which was funded by a grant from the commercial weight loss program, Weight Watchers.

They still had diabetes, but many were able to reduce the amount of medication they were taking.\n\nThe study's 563 participants were all overweight or obese and under a doctor's care for uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes. Half got standard care: a session of nutrition counseling with a registered dietitian and written materials. The other half went to Weight Watchers meetings, had access to Weight Watchers' online materials and had two phone consultations and follow-up email contact with certified diabetes educators who told them how to modify the Weight Watchers plan to help with their diabetes.\n\nParticipants had four follow-up visits related to the study and continued to see their regular doctors for medical management of their diabetes.\n\nAfter a year, people in the Weight Watchers group had an average weight loss of about 4 percent of their starting weight, compared to 2 percent for the standard care group. The Weight Watchers group also had a bigger improvement in a measure of long-term control of their blood sugar, which can reduce the risk for serious problems related to Type 2 diabetes. Left uncontrolled, the condition can damage blood vessels and nerves, putting people at risk of having a heart attack or stroke. It can also cause eye problems, kidney damage and even lead to amputations.\n\u2022 Not getting enough exercise\n\nCertain racial and ethnic groups are more at risk, including African-Americans and Hispanics.

It's by far the more common form of diabetes and can lead to about $85,000 in medical costs.\n\nDiabetes is a growing problem. O'Neil said the rate jumped from about 9 percent to 12 percent between 2002 and 2012.

And they can pick from a number of tests that have all been found to cut the risk of dying from colon cancer.\n\nAlong with stool tests \u2014 done once a year at home \u2014 the choices include two invasive procedures: colonoscopy done every 10 years and flexible sigmoidoscopy done every five years.\n\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federally supported expert panel, recommends that people at average risk of colon cancer choose any of the three methods.\n\nFOBT detects hidden blood in the stool, which can be a sign of colon cancer or pre-cancerous growths called polyps. Positive results on the screen prompt a follow-up colonoscopy to investigate the source of the blood.\n\nAdvances in the stool tests in recent years have made them more effective. A newer version called immunochemical FOBT (iFOBT) is supposed to zero in on colon growths better than an older version known as guaiac FOBT \u2014 which often picked up bleeding originating in the upper digestive tract, such as from a stomach ulcer.\n\nImmunochemical FOBT is now largely replacing the older test. But there\u2019s been surprisingly little evidence that it really is highly \u201cspecific\u201d to colon cancer, according to Dr. Yi-Chia Lee of National Taiwan University Hospital, one of the researchers on the new study.\n\nSo for their study, the researchers followed nearly 2,800 adults who all volunteered to have iFOBT, a colonoscopy and an upper endoscopy to check for problems in the upper digestive tract.\n\nThey found that of 28 people confirmed to have colon tumors after a colonoscopy, all but one had also a positive iFOBT result.\n\n\u201cIt means that almost every case with colon cancer can be identified by iFOBT,\u201d Lee told Reuters Health in an email. \u201cIt is a strong support to iFOBT as an effective screening tool.\u201d\n\nThe researchers also found that iFOBT had \u201cspecificity\u201d for colon cancer of close to 90 percent, meaning the test would accurately give a negative result to almost 90 percent of people who did not have colon cancer.\n\nOf three study participants who were found to have cancers of the stomach or esophagus, for instance, none had a positive result on the iFOBT test.\n\nLike any screening test, iFOBT does have a risk of false-positive results, which leads to unnecessary invasive testing in some people. In this study, about 10 percent of all participants had a false-positive finding on the stool test.\n\nAmong the risk factors for false-positives the authors identified were the use of anticlotting drugs and low levels of the iron-rich molecule hemoglobin in the blood.\n\nIn practice, a positive iFOBT result would be followed by colonoscopy, in which a scope is used to investigate the interior of the colon.\n\nWhether used for first-line screening or as a follow-up, colonoscopy has the advantage of allowing doctors to spot and remove pre-cancerous growths called polyps \u2014 which means the test can prevent cases of colon cancer.\n\nBut as far as cutting the risk of death from colon cancer, stool testing is similarly effective, according to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.\n\nAnd it\u2019s much cheaper: iFOBT is more expensive than the older stool tests, but it is still roughly $30. A screening colonoscopy averages around $3,000.\n\nThe downside of iFOBT being specific to colon tumors is that it is not useful for catching cancers of the stomach or throat.\n\nThat\u2019s particularly important in Asia, where those cancers are common.\n\nLee said researchers there are looking into whether combining iFOBT with the older guaiac test is useful for catching cancers in the lower and upper digestive tract \u2014 and whether adding a third stool test, which looks for the ulcer-causing bacteria H. pylori, can help as well. Infection with H. pylori is associated with increased risks of stomach and throat cancers.\n\nIn the U.S., cancers of the upper digestive tract are relatively uncommon. The average American has a one in 200 chance of developing esophageal cancer, while the risk of stomach cancer is one in 114.\n\nIn contrast, Americans\u2019 lifetime risk of colon cancer is about one in 19, according to the American Cancer Society.

Her message to new parents: Educate yourselves on safe sleep habits.\n\n\u2018\u2018Open your mouth and say I\u2019m concerned about this so you can get the assistance,\u2019\u2019 Williams said.\n\nSudden unexpected infant death is a broad category that includes sudden infant death syndrome and accidental suffocation and strangulation that could come from overcrowded bassinets or cribs. The boxes aren\u2019t the only option for safe sleeping, of course, but health officials say they\u2019re a useful part of a broader safe-sleep education program.\n\nOhio on Wednesday joined New Jersey in offering the cardboard boxes, which double as bassinets, for free. Each box comes filled with a mattress, fitted sheet, onesie and diapers.\n\nThe Baby Box Co. is also handing out the boxes in Minneapolis, Phoenix and San Francisco, with the goal of expanding to all 50 states. The for-profit company also operates in Canada, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Baby Box University, Baby Box Co.\u2019s educational platform, maintains a website that coordinates the educational component of the program.\n\nThe idea for baby boxes started in Finland in the 1930s, and is tied to a sharp drop in sudden infant deaths, according to Dr. Kathryn McCans, a pediatrician who chairs New Jersey\u2019s Child Fatality and Near Fatality Review Board. The boxes provide a clutter-free sleep space that has been shown to reduce accidental and unexpected deaths, she said.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the U.S. rate of sudden unexpected infant deaths has been declining since the 1990s when public health officials began recommending parents put infants to sleep on their backs. About 3,700 sudden unexpected infant deaths were reported in the country in 2015.\n\nThe boxes are a new idea for many Americans.\n\n\u2018\u2018The thought of putting the baby in a box, I was like \u2018wow that\u2019s weird,\u2019\u2019\u2019 said Dolores Peterson, of Camden, New Jersey, who became a first-time mom recently and was among the first to bring home a box.\n\nPeterson\u2019s daughter, Ariabella, just turned 3 months old. She said the program was eye-opening for how much information she learned about how to prevent sudden unexpected infant death.\n\nMcCans says the complimentary items like diapers and onesies are nice, but the more important objective behind the boxes is bringing down infant deaths and grounding parents on safe sleep practices: Place babies on their backs to sleep; Don\u2019t use bumpers in cribs; Keep stuffed animals and blankets out of infants\u2019 sleep spaces; Avoid sleeping in the same bed as infants.\n\n\u2018\u2018No one brings their baby into bed with them because they want their baby to die,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018They do it because they want to be nurturing and they are, but it\u2019s not safe.\u2019\u2019\n\nTo get the boxes, prospective moms can register through babyboxuniversity.com, watch a handful of videos on sleep safety and pass a quiz. Parents can then take their digital or printed-out certificates to a participating hospital for their boxes.

They hope the technology can be commercialized and marketed to prevent the spread of seasonal flu in public places, such as schools, hospitals, and airports.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known for a century that UV light is extremely efficient at killing microbes, bacteria, and viruses,\u201d says study leader David Brenner, director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. For that reason, UV devices are often used for sterilization \u2014 for medical equipment in hospitals, for example, or drinking water for backcountry campers.\n\nBut conventional germicidal lamps aren\u2019t safe for humans to be around. With prolonged exposure, they can cause skin cancer and cataracts in the eyes. \u201cSo up until now, they\u2019re only really practical when people aren\u2019t around,\u201d say Brenner. \u201cYou can sterilize a hospital room, but not when anyone\u2019s inside.\u201d\n\nAbout five years ago, Brenner says, the Columbia team came up with a potential solution. Light on the far end of the UV-C spectrum, known as far-UVC, has very short wavelengths. The researchers suspected that it can penetrate and destroy microscopic bacteria and viruses, but can\u2019t travel through the protective outer layers of human skin or eyes.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to get all the benefits of UV light in terms of killing microbes, but none of the health hazards,\u201d says Brenner. Earlier studies, on animals and humans, have shown that exposure to far-UVC light does indeed appear to be safe. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any biological damage to skin cells or eye cells, whereas with conventional UV light we\u2019ve always seen lots of biological damage,\u201d he says. Previous research has also shown that far-UVC light can kill MRSA bacteria, a common cause of infections after surgery.\n\nNow, Brenner and his colleagues have show that UVC light can effectively kill airborne influenza. In their new study, aerosolized particles of the H1N1 seasonal flu virus were released into a test chamber and exposed to very low doses of far-UVC light. The light inactivated the viruses with about the same efficiency as conventional germicidal UV light, while a control group of bacteria not exposed to light remained active.\n\n\u201cWe think that this type of overhead light could be efficacious for basically any public setting,\u201d says Brenner. \u201cThink about doctor\u2019s waiting rooms, schools, airports and airplanes\u2014any place where there\u2019s a likelihood for airborne viruses.\u201d And unlike the flu vaccine, he says, far-UVC light is likely to be effective against all airborne microbes, including newly emerging virus strains.\n\nBrenner says his team is working with a company to develop a commercially available version of the lamp, which could become a cost-effective way to battle flu epidemics on a population level. \u201cThe lamp we\u2019re using at the moment costs less than $1,000, and you can imagine that if it were put into general circulation, the price would drop dramatically,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t see cost as being a limiting factor here.\u201d\n\nUVC lamps could also have potential implications in clinical settings, as well \u2014 in the operating room during surgeries, for example. \u201cNo matter how well you sterilize a room beforehand, the medical staff can still bring in dangerous bacteria like MRSA,\u201d says Brenner. \u201cIf you have a lamp over the surgical site that can sterilize the air, you can prevent the bacteria from floating down and contaminating the wound.\u201d\n\nBrenner can\u2019t predict how long it might take for these lamps to be commercially available, but he says he\u2019s \u201cextremely optimistic\u201d about the technology. \u201cThere has been no way of killing viruses in the air in public spaces, and this is an approach that may solve that problem.\u201d", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The lead author of the story is the only source cited, and we\u2019re not told if he has any conflicts of interest.

However, one drug, aflibercept, provided greater improvement for people with more severe vision loss when treatment was initiated. The trial was conducted by the National Eye Institute Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net) including researchers from Joslin Diabetes Center. The results appeared in the February online edition of the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nDiabetes is a significant risk factor for developing eye diseases. The most common diabetic eye disease and a leading cause of blindness is diabetic retinopathy, which is caused by elevated blood sugar levels damaging the blood vessels of the retina and affects approximately 7.7 million Americans. About 750,000 Americans with diabetic retinopathy have diabetic macular edema (DME) in which fluid leaks into the macula, the area of the retina used when looking straight ahead. The fluid causes the macula to swell, blurring vision. \u201cDME is the leading cause of moderate vision loss in working-age adults with diabetes. With the rate of diabetes increasing dramatically worldwide, many individuals will be at risk for vision loss from diabetic eye complications and DME is a major global health concern,\u201d says Jennifer K. Sun, M.D., M.P.H., a member of the study research team and writing committee, and an Investigator in the Section on Vascular Biology, an ophthalmologist in Beetham Eye Institute at Joslin and an Assistant Professor at Harvard Medical School.\n\nIn an earlier study, Joslin researchers reported that VEGF, a major growth factor for blood vessels, is elevated in the eye fluids of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and DME, causing leakage and the growth of abnormal blood vessels. Over the past few years, drugs that target VEGF have become a standard treatment for DME, providing a preferred alternative or adjunct to laser treatment. The standard Medicare per-injection costs of the three anti-VEGF drugs evaluated in the study are about $1960 for aflibercept (Eylea), $1200 for ranibizumab (Lucentis) and $70 for bevacizumab (Avastin).\n\nAt the start of the trial, 660 adults with DME were enrolled: their average age was 61 years and 90 percent had type 2 diabetes. About half of the participants had 20/32 or 20/40 vision and the other half had vision of 20/50 or worse. They were randomized into three treatment groups and received the assigned study drug by injection into the eye until the DME resolved or stabilized. Participants on bevacizumab and ranibizumab received, on average, 10 injections, versus nine for those on aflibercept.\n\nOne year after starting treatment, all participants had improved vision. Those with mild vision loss (20/32 to 20/40) at baseline in all three treatment groups gained on average almost two lines on an eye chart. For participants with more severe vision loss (20/50 or worse), aflibercept improved vision on average nearly four lines, bevacizumab about 2.5 lines, and ranibizumab almost three lines.\n\n\u201cThe results clearly remove any doubts about anti-VEGF drugs\u2019 efficacy in treating DME. All three drugs improved vision substantially, with aflibercept showing more visual gains in patients with worse vision at the start of the trial. Physicians now have robust data to help them counsel patients and make informed decisions regarding treatment options,\u201d says study co-author Lloyd P. Aiello, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School, Director of Joslin\u2019s Beetham Eye Institute, co-head of Joslin's Section of Vascular Cell Biology, and founding chair of the DRCR Network.\n\nIn light of these positive results, \u201cit is more important than ever for patients with diabetes to be evaluated on a regular basis for eye disease and receive treatment promptly once indicated as we now have excellent success in treating patients with DME,\u201d says Dr. Aiello.\n\nThe trial was supported through a cooperative agreement from the National Eye Institute and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

The key is to identify specific cancer-fighting cells already circulating in the blood of patients and make thousands of copies of them in the lab.\n\nImmunotherapy is one of medicine's most promising \u2014 and most problematic \u2014 approaches to cancer treatment. It aims to charge up the patient's immune system to attack cancer cells and halt their out-of-control growth.\n\nThe study, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science, contributes to hopes that a tumor-fighting strategy called immunotherapy can slow, halt or even reverse the growth of a range of cancers \u2014 and do so with fewer dangerous side effects.\n\nIn a bid to make cancer immunotherapy more effective, researchers report they have succeeded in halting the progress of aggressive melanoma in its tracks \u2014 at least briefly \u2014 in seven patients treated with an army of cloned cancer-fighting immune cells. In one of those patients, the treatment resulted in complete remission of his metastatic melanoma and evidence that his immune system stands ready to fight any return of the cancer after three years.\n\nThis type of \"adoptive immunotherapy\" could be effective against a wide range of cancers, Yee said. His research group is making plans to try the technique on patients with advanced ovarian cancer and sarcomas \u2014 rare tumors that arise from connective tissue in bones and muscle.\n\nSeveral independent researchers said the study results were promising. But they also noted that the trial involved only 11 patients and said the therapy was less effective than in other published trials.\n\n\"Someday, cell-based therapy will be mainstream in cancer therapy,\" said Dr. Jeff Miller of the University of Minnesota's cell therapy core laboratory. \"Each article that shows clinical activity is giving us a piece of the puzzle\" that will make it safer and more effective, he said.\n\nImmunotherapy usually starts with clinicians harvesting immune system cells called T cells that have attached themselves to a tumor in an effort to attack. They then coax the cells to multiply, either in the lab or in the body, and let them loose in the bloodstream so they can attack cancer wherever they find it.\n\nYee's team tried to do this more precisely. The researchers hoped that by choosing T cells more selectively and cloning only those judged most likely to vanquish their foe, the treatment would be more effective. Sorting through the body's vast and diverse population of T cells to select just the right ones is a painstaking process. But Yee bet that the extra effort would pay off with better results and fewer side effects.\n\nResearchers drew blood from patients and scoured it to find the rare type of immune cell \u2014 a melanoma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte cell \u2014 that specifically homes in on proteins expressed by the cancer. Then they put their harvest \u2014 as few as a few hundred cells \u2014 into a test tube and cloned them, creating millions. The last step was to infuse the resulting army of cancer-fighting clones back into the patient.\n\nIn six of the 11 patients in the trial, the melanoma stopped progressing for 12 to 19 weeks. Another patient was declared in remission because his cancer ceased to spread and, after several months, disappeared altogether. Three years later, researchers continue to detect the presence of the cloned cells they infused into the patient, 61-year-old high school history teacher Gardiner Vinnedge of North Bend, Wash.\n\nFor six years, Vinnedge endured painful rounds of chemotherapy, only to have his melanoma return. The immunotherapy allowed him to return to work three weeks after treatments began. The only side effect, he said, was a raging rash that lasted for three days.\n\n\"My back, my legs were just covered with a hot red rash,\" Vinnedge said. \"It meant the treatment was working \u2014 the war was on between my T cells and the melanin in my skin.\" Now he says he is optimistic he may live to see retirement age, though he's not sure he'll ever stop teaching.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Several independent sources were quoted.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "For people with toenail fungus, there is no good time to wear sandals. Not even at the beach in July.\n\nToenail fungus causes nails to become thick, yellow and brittle in a way that looks pretty ugly and can be painful. Sufferers can spend years and hundreds of dollars trying to clear the infection with drugs, topical treatments and home remedies, sometimes to no avail. It tends to be a cosmetic issue for the younger set and a pain issue for older folks.\n\n\u201cThe problem is huge. It is bigger than you can imagine,\u201d says Washington podiatrist Stephen J. Kominsky. \u201cI would say 70 percent of the patients who come into my office have fungal infections on their toenails.\u201d\n\nThere may be hope. Podiatrists have begun using a laser treatment that combats the infection \u2014 or wastes their patients\u2019 money because it doesn\u2019t work, depending on whom you ask.\n\nThe treatment, in which the podiatrist aims a laser beam at the patient\u2019s toenails to kill the organisms that cause the fungus, costs about $1,000 and is not covered by insurance because it is considered an aesthetic procedure. The nails aren\u2019t immediately clear after the treatment, which takes up to an hour; the patient must wait for the fungus-free nails to grow out.\n\nLast year, the Food and Drug Administration cleared the first laser, PinPointe, for \u201ctemporary increase of clear nail\u201d in patients with onychomycosis, the medical term for a fungal infection of the nail. The FDA cleared a second one, GenesisPlus, in April. Practitioners have been using other lasers on toenail fungus since about 2009.\n\nKominsky has treated 400 to 500 patients with the PinPointe laser. Compared with oral medication, he says, \u201cthe odds of success are better with the laser; plus, there\u2019s no side effects.\u201d\n\nThe most common oral treatment, Lamisil, works for about two out of three patients, according to Lamisil\u2019s FDA-approved prescribing information, but it has been associated with rare cases of serious liver problems. Other potential side effects include diarrhea, headache, rashes and changes in taste. According to Lamisil\u2019s manufacturer, Novartis, the relapse rate is 15 percent one year after completing treatment.\n\nIn one small study about laser treatment for toenail fungus, which appeared last year in the Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association, \u201c26 eligible toes (ten mild, seven moderate, and nine severe)\u201d were treated with a laser produced by Nomir Medical Technologies, which is still seeking FDA approval. After six months, 85 percent of the toenails had improved.\n\n\u201cI never use the term \u2018cured\u2019 with toenail fungus,\u201d Kominsky says. \u201cWith a cure, people think there\u2019s no chance for a recurrence. In this case, there is a chance.\u201d\n\nEven John Strisower, the founder of PinPointe USA, says patients should expect at least a minimal reinfection within five years after laser treatment.\n\nResearch done by PinPointe, which is based in Chico, Calif., identified more than 100 organisms, including fungi, yeast, mold and bacteria, that work together to cause toenail fungus.\n\nThere\u2019s no one route of infection, but sources include pedicures and locker room showers. Fungi love moist, dark environments such as wet shoes, Kominsky says, so people such as lifeguards, landscapers and fishermen are particularly susceptible. Shoes are the reason why toenail fungus is much more common than fingernail fungus, which can also occur.\n\nThe elderly are more likely to have toenail fungus than younger people because they have had more years to be exposed to the infection and their immune systems can\u2019t always fight it off, according to Washington podiatrist Lee Firestone. He estimates that about half of people over 70 have toenail fungus.\n\nLast year, Americans spent $354 million on prescription and over-the-counter treatments for toenail fungus, according to IMS Health, a health-care information company.\n\n\u201cI think the laser can improve the appearance of the nail, but it\u2019s only temporary and it needs to be used again and again to maintain that improvement,\u201d says Firestone, who doesn\u2019t use the lasers in his practice. \u201cI\u2019ve had patients come in who have had laser procedures and not seen long-term success.\u201d\n\nFirestone also says that over-the-counter antifungal nail creams and ointments rarely work because they can\u2019t penetrate the nail root. Home remedies such as tea tree oil, bleach and vinegar also don\u2019t work, he says.\n\nYet even a superficial improvement would be an improvement for many.\n\nRichard, a retiree in Fairfax who did not want his full name associated with toenail fungus, got a laser treatment on all 10 toes in April 2010, and he says his nails were fully cleared of the yellowed, thickened look after a year. To prevent reinfection, he has purchased all new socks and a SteriShoe, a $130 device that uses ultraviolet light to sanitize shoes, at his podiatrist\u2019s recommendation. He has also turned to what he calls \u201can old wives\u2019 tale\u201d that he read about in a newspaper column: slathering Vicks VapoRub on his toes.\n\n\u201cMy doctor said, \u2018Listen, it\u2019s not a prescribed treatment, but if it works for you, for heaven\u2019s sake, do it.\u2019 \u201d", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "There are multiple sources quoted and some are critical of laser treatment, but, on balance we thought too much weight was given to a conflicted physician and a conflicted study.

The hope is that the devices, now being tested in clinical trials, will save lives, reduce medical expenses and nudge heart patients toward managing their symptoms much the way people with diabetes manage theirs. Patients, who often are frail or live far from their doctors, can be spared frequent office visits. Doctors can learn immediately if devices are malfunctioning or if patients\u2019 hearts are starting to fail.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like having an office visit every day and a complete physical every week,\u201d said Dr. Leslie Saxon, a cardiologist at the University of Southern California.\n\nThe big leap forward came a few years ago when device companies figured out how to make transmitters that send data over a broader range, 20 or 30 feet. That meant that, with her device, Mrs. Elzo did not have to wait till her doctor could put a receiver directly on her chest. Instead, she simply went near a small box, which is attached to a phone jack near her bed. Once a week, she also measures her weight and blood pressure \u2014 key indicators of heart failure \u2014 and that information is automatically transmitted to her doctor. If there are problems, the machine alerts her doctor.\n\n\u201cNow, every single day the device is being queried,\u201d said her doctor, James Coman of the Heart Rhythm Institute in Tulsa. \u201cIt\u2019s just a phenomenal tool.\u201d\n\nThere is a downside, though: \u201cInformation overload is a very serious problem\u201d for the doctors, said Dr. Lynne Warner Stevenson, director of the Heart Failure Program at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston and a professor at Harvard Medical School, who counts herself as a proponent of smart devices. More information, she warned, is not always beneficial.\n\nThe devices transmit useful data along with data whose significance is not clear, like variations in heart rate. Large swings in heart rate can indicate risk, but it is not clear what to do about them.\n\nEven more confusing are changes in thoracic impedance, a measurement of resistance to electric current through the lung. Impedance changes can predict future heart crises, but more often have no clinical explanation. Yet when doctors get data on impedance changes, they often feel uneasy and call patients to see how they are, making patients uneasy in turn, Dr. Stevenson said.\n\nDr. Stevenson likened such information to the game of \u201cJeopardy!\u201d \u2014 doctors are given answers in search of a question. It\u2019s a challenge even for the nation\u2019s 1,000 heart failure specialists. But it can be even harder for primary care doctors, who have less expertise in heart failure yet care for most of the six million patients in the country with the condition.\n\nDr. Richard Page, president of the Heart Rhythm Society, said doctors wonder if they can be held liable if they do not look at all the data. Still, he said, the new technology \u201cis potentially transformative.\u201d\n\nFor researchers the information deluge leads to a different problem: how to analyze the data. A large clinical trial of a cardiac device used to involve 1,000, maybe 2,000 patients. Now, Boston Scientific, a maker of one of the smart heart devices, is following 400,000 patients.\n\n\u201cNo one has ever done research like this before,\u201d said Dr. Saxon, who leads an independent team of academic scientists overseeing Boston Scientific research. The company has no editorial control over the papers the scientists write, Dr. Saxon said.\n\nBoston Scientific gets data from patients\u2019 defibrillators. It also gets information on deaths from Medicare.\n\nThe data are stripped of patient identifiers and analyzed, a task requiring the company to become more like a Google or a Microsoft, handling enormous amounts of information. There are, for example, more than four million recordings of weights and blood pressures and over 60,000 instances when the defibrillators went off, shocking a patient\u2019s heart.\n\nSo far, Dr. Saxon\u2019s group has reported on the first 90,000 patients. Half of them had not been enrolled for remote monitoring and served as a control group.\n\nPatients whose doctors looked at the data survived 5 to 15 percent longer than patients in earlier clinical trials of the devices, Dr. Saxon reported. And, in a paper under review, the group reports that their three-year survival was significantly greater than that of patients in the study whose doctors did not see the data.\n\nOther researchers will be analyzing economic data. The devices can cost as much as $30,000. Do patients with defibrillators make up for some of that expense with fewer hospitalizations or doctor visits?\n\nA study using a similar device, made by Medtronic, suggests that is the case. The Medtronic study, directed by Dr. George Crossley, president of St Thomas Heart at Baptist Hospital in Nashville, involved 2,000 patients randomly assigned to receive a defibrillator that transmitted data or a device that did not transmit. Those with the nontransmitting device were seen in their doctor\u2019s offices every few months, the standard of care.\n\nPatients whose devices transmitted spent less time, on average, in the hospital when they were admitted \u2014 3.3 days compared with 4 days \u2014 and their hospital costs were $1,600 less per admission.\n\n\u201cThe plausible reason, we think, is that we got to these people much sooner in the course of their illness,\u201d Dr. Crossley said. \u201cWe think we did not let the people in the remote sensing group get into heart failure.\u201d\n\nStill, the information overload problem looms. One solution, being tested by St. Jude Medical, a medical device company in St. Paul, is to let patients deal with important data.\n\nThe idea, said Dr. Neal Eigler, a senior vice president at St. Jude, is to get heart patients to adjust their medications regularly based on readings of their heart\u2019s functioning, just as patients with diabetes adjust their insulin based on blood glucose readings.\n\nPatients hold a small device over their chest twice a day, and if they experience symptoms like shortness of breath. It transmits readings of blood pressure in the left atrium \u2014 the upper left chamber of the heart. If pressure in that chamber gets too high, the lungs can fill with fluid.\n\nDoctors preprogram the hand-held device to provide instructions to patients in response to their left atrial pressure measurements, telling them, for example, to take a different dose of a medication, restrict fluid intake, increase their activity level or call the clinic.\n\nIf successful, the smart device could have a big effect. One million patients a year are hospitalized for heart failure. Ninety percent of the time it is because fluid has accumulated in their lungs.\n\nDr. Stevenson, who has no connection with St. Jude, is intrigued. Patients can see what is happening to their own bodies and act accordingly. They have to strictly limit salt in their diet, for example, and seeing their left atrial pressure might be motivating.\n\n\u201cA patient might say, \u2018Maybe my pressure is higher because that pizza I had for dinner last night had a lot of salt,\u2019 \u201d Dr. Stevenson said.\n\nAs a more positive incentive, the device can also instruct patients to decrease their medications if they are doing well.\n\nSt. Jude recently completed a small study of 40 patients and is starting a large clinical trial. In the pilot study, the device reduced the frequency of high atrial pressure readings by two-thirds and the number of hospitalizations by 80 percent over five months.\n\nMeanwhile, patients whose doctors can deal with the data stream from smart devices say they are getting peace of mind.\n\nThey include people like Danielle Denlein, who, to her total shock, developed a serious heart problem.On October 20, 2008, at 1:50 p.m., Ms. Denlein was driving to a drug store to buy formula for her 5-day-old baby girl.

In a study of women age 65 and older, just 30 minutes a day of light exercise\u2014like running errands and cleaning the house\u2014was linked to a lower risk of death.\n\nModerate-intensity exercise, like leisurely bike riding or brisk walking, was associated with an even greater reduction in risk. The authors say that improving doing more light and moderate physical activity could be almost as effective as rigorous exercise at preventing disease and prolonging life. \u201cThe paradigm needs to shift when we think about being active,\u201d says senior author Andrea LaCroix, professor of family medicine and public health at the University of California San Diego.\n\nFor the study, LaCroix and her colleagues asked 6,000 women, ages 65 to 99, to wear activity-tracking accelerometers for seven days as they went about their daily activities. The women were then followed for an average of three years.\n\nBased on the data from the women\u2019s activity trackers, the researchers found that those who got at least 30 minutes of light physical activity a day were 12% less likely to die, compared to those who got less. Those who got an additional 30 minutes of moderate activity were 39% less likely to die.\n\nLight physical activity includes just about any type of behavior that isn\u2019t sitting down: walking to the mailbox, strolling around the neighborhood and doing laundry. Activities like these account for more than 55% of older adults\u2019 daily activity, says LaCroix, so the fact that they were protective in this study is very good news.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been told that this type of activity isn\u2019t enough to do you good,\u201d says LaCroix. \u201cBut what we have here is solid evidence that light physical activity reduces a woman\u2019s risk of dying over the next three to four years\u2014and we see the benefits are substantial and independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.\u201d\n\nThe study could not show a cause-and-effect relationship between activity level and risk of death, only an association. But the link was present in all types of women in the study, including those of all races and ethnicities, women who were obese and those who were not, women with high and low functional abilities and women older and younger than 80.\n\nAs adults get older, they expend more energy doing the same activities they did when they were younger, LaCroix says\u2014so they don\u2019t need to exercise as much, or as intensely, to burn the same amount of calories or get their heart rate up. \u201cWe know that people of different ages need different amounts and intensities of exercise to get the same result,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not one size fits all.\u201d\n\nBut national guidelines still recommend that adults over age 65 follow the same guidelines as younger people: to get at least 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week. And recent analyses, compiled from studies in which adults self-reported their levels of physical activity, have suggested that older adults have to log moderate-to-vigorous exercise in order to reduce their risk of early death.\n\nLaCroix says her new study refutes that research and shows that older adults can still benefit at levels below the moderate-to-vigorous guidelines. Questionnaires used in self-reported studies don\u2019t do a good job of encompassing all the ways people get physical activity throughout the day, she says, which may have skewed previous study results. \u201cWhat makes our study stronger than those others is that we used a device that was able to measure all of the movements we do in our daily lives,\u201d she says.\n\nThe researchers hope their work sparks more discussion about how people\u2014especially older ones\u2014think about exercise and their goals for being active. \u201cI think the current guidelines are discouraging to older people who don\u2019t believe they can do 150 minutes of hard exercise,\u201d LaCroix says. \u201cThey throw up their hands and think, \u2018that\u2019s not for me.\u2019 But everyone does light physical activity, and the idea that doing more of it can have substantial health benefits should be welcome news.\u201d", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "No outside sources are cited in the story, nor does the story make clear who funded the research (addressing potential conflicts of interest).", "answer": 0}, {"article": "A new pill may help in the fight with cystic fibrosis.\n\nA study, funded in part by Vertex Pharmaceuticals, found the drug ivacaftor (pronounced eye va kaf tor) caused patients with a specific type of cystic fibrosis to improve lung function, gain weight, and fight other aspects of the disease.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time that we have a therapy that is directed at the cause of cystic fibrosis,\u201d says Dr. Michael Konstan, the chair of the Department of Pediatrics at Rainbow Babies and Children\u2019s Hospital in Cleveland and one of the authors of the study.

The boy is currently on chemotherapy, the study authors noted.\n\n\"This is a very good first step, but it's a little scary and we need to move to safer vectors,\" said Dr. Mary Ellen Conley, director of the Program in Genetic Immunodeficiencies at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn.\n\n\"The study shows proof-of-principle that gene therapy with stem cells in a genetic disorder like this has strong potential,\" added Paul Sanberg, a stem cell specialist who is director of the University of South Florida Center of Excellence for Aging and Brain Repair in Tampa.\n\nNeither Conley nor Sanberg were involved in the study, which is scheduled to be presented Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology in Orlando, Fla.\n\nAccording to Conley, children (mostly boys) with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) are born with an inherited genetic defect on the X chromosome that affects the number and size of platelets and makes the children remarkably susceptible to easy bleeding and infections, including different types of cancer.\n\nBone marrow transplants are the main treatment for the disorder which, if they succeed, basically cure the patient.\n\n\"They grow up, go to college and they cause problems,\" said Conley. \"But they're not an easy group of patients to transplant.\"\n\nEven if a good match is found, transplant recipients can go on to have more problems with infections, such as graft-versus-host disease, in which the body basically rejects the foreign elements.\n\n\"One of the long-lasting complications is the kids couldn't do this, they couldn't do that, they see themselves as different,\" Conley said. \"Transplants are getting better but we need better therapy, there's no question.\"\n\nIn this study, the researchers inserted a healthy gene capable of producing WAS protein into hematopoietic stem cells (the \"granddaddy\" cells that give rise to different blood cells), then transferred these stem cells back into the patient using a viral vector. A viral vector is a virus that has been modified to deliver foreign genetic material into a cell.\n\nIn fact, the experiment was largely successful, with cells now able to produce WAS protein, resulting in increased platelet counts and improvement of some immune-system cells.\n\n\"This is a first step that says you can correct the disease but I think most people would look at it and say the risk of leukemia is something, and that, let's see if we can avoid that,\" said Conley, whose team at St. Jude is working on a therapy involving a different type of vector. \"It's a good start, but I think we have better things coming down the road.\"\n\nIn other news from the conference, another group of German researchers have determined that people who donate peripheral blood stem cells or bone marrow to help save a life don't face any heightened risk of cancer.\n\nPreviously there had been some concern that drugs needed to get the stem cells out of the bone marrow and into the bloodstream where they could be accessed might pose a risk of leukemia.\n\nThe study was based on questionnaires returned from more than 12,500 donors, which also showed the donors tended to be in good health and were willing to donate again.\n\nAnother study found that the drug rituximab (Rituxan), used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and forms of leukemia and lymphoma, could greatly reduce graft-versus-host disease in stem cell transplant recipients.\n\nThe National Marrow Donor Program has more on Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story included interviews with two independent experts who weren\u2019t involved with the study.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Dec. 14, 2011 -- It can be an all too common scenario for certain stroke survivors.

For most people, they start to grow in between ages 17 and 25. They're thought to crowd out other teeth or cause tooth decay, which is why many dentists and oral surgeons think it's better to just nip those problems in the bud and take them out as a preventative measure.\n\nBut there's a serious debate between dentists and oral surgeons: should they preemptively remove someone's wisdom teeth if the patient doesn't have any symptoms?\n\nSimply put, there's no right answer. It comes down to what you, as a patient, want. Here's what you need to know to figure that out.\n\nDentists and oral surgeons are fighting over wisdom teeth\n\nDentists and oral surgeons agree across the board that there's cause to remove wisdom teeth if a patient is in pain or if there are signs of disease popping up, like tooth decay or infection. That's an obvious choice. But taking out wisdom teeth when there aren't any symptoms is where the professionals get into it.\n\nMany dental professionals stick with a watch and wait approach with wisdom teeth to avoid surgery if possible. \"Many people don\u2019t have adequate space in their jaw for the teeth to come into full position, but that alone isn\u2019t justification of having them all removed,\" says Dr. Scott Tomar of University of North Carolina's School of Dentistry. Tomar says that as a dentist he feels the risks of complication, including infection and hitting nerves during surgery, outweigh any benefits of preventative removal.\n\nIn 2007, oral surgeon Dr. Jay Friedman called the preventative removals a public health hazard in the American Journal of Public Health. The American Public Health Association has sided with this argument since 2008, when it formally opposed the preventative removal of wisdom teeth. (The same thing happened with tonsils, which doctors no longer remove just to get rid of the chance of infection later on.)\n\nAmericans spend an estimated $3 billion a year having their wisdom teeth removed\n\nSome doctors, though, still see preventative oral surgery as being two steps ahead of the problem. If you're going to need your wisdom teeth out eventually, why not have them removed when you're younger and are more likely to recover more easily? Some think of removing the wisdom teeth early on as a way to lessen the crowding of other teeth\n\n\"You might not have symptoms now, but you can't assume it's gonna be that way for the rest of your life,\" says Dr. Ray White, an oral surgeon working at University of North Carolina. Rather than let the teeth cause problems later on, many oral surgeons remove them.\n\nBut a 2012 Cochrane review of randomized clinical trials found there's no evidence that removing wisdom teeth will prevent or reduce crowding of other teeth down the line. And a different Cochrane review found that watching and waiting can \"may reduce the number of surgical procedures by 60 percent or more.\n\nThe question comes down to which side of the fence medical professionals fall on\n\nIt's worth noting that oral surgeons make a good chunk of their paychecks by removing wisdom teeth, so there is a financial incentive involved.\n\n\"Are there people gaming the system? Sure. You don't get paid much for not doing anything,\" White says. \"But I'd hope we can get past that.\"\n\nThe American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial surgeons says, \"There is no pat answer, cookbook recipe, or flow chart that is universally accepted regarding the decision making process\" in these cases. So the question comes down to which side of the fence medical professionals fall on, and what works best for their patients.\n\nThe risks and benefits of removing your wisdom teeth\n\nThere's a chance that if you opt not to have your wisdom teeth taken out, they might be fine for the rest of your life.\n\nThere's also a chance that they'll need to come out later. If that's the case, you can't always plan for it. Opting to have them removed gives patients time to plan around the procedure, which leaves people out of commission for about three days.\n\nBut inconvenience isn't the only risk. \"The risk for complications increases as people get older, and the duration of disability after the operation gets longer as people get older,\" says oral surgeon Dr. Thomas Dodson.\n\nIn some cases, the extraction can be more painful if you wait, Dodson says. That's because the tooth is easier to remove if its roots aren't fully developed.\n\nThe common risks related to the surgery include poor wound healing, infection, pain, and uncontrolled bleeding. Nerve injury, in rare cases of wisdom teeth removal, can leave people with permanent numbness around the face and mouth, according to the APHA.\n\nAmericans spend an estimated $3 billion a year having 10 million wisdom teeth removed, according to the American Public Health Association. That's a hefty bill for something we may or may not need. How much it costs depends on how the molars are situated. A simple surgical extraction for a wisdom tooth that's showing through the gums should run about $230, according to Healthcare Bluebook. If it's impacted (pushed against another tooth and unable to fully come through the gum), the cost jumps to about $400 per tooth.\n\nUpdate: Added information about the number of teeth removed.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Sources include a dentist and two oral surgeons as well as numerous published reports and professional association position reports.

A larger part is at this point, we just don't fully understand what the genetic mechanism that leads to autism is.\"\n\nStandard practice is to offer children with autism two tests as a first-line genetic work-up: karyotype and fragile X testing, the researchers said.\n\nIn karyotyping, forms of which have been around since the 1960s, geneticists use a microscope to look for chromosomal abnormalities that are associated with autism, explained Dr. David Miller, a clinical geneticist and assistant director of the Genetics Diagnostic Laboratory at Children's Hospital Boston, which conducted the new research along with Boston's Autism Consortium.\n\nLike karyotyping, CMA also looks for chromosomal abnormalities, but does so at 100 times the resolution of the earlier test, Miller said. CMA, a genome-wide test, can identify sub-microscopic deletions of duplications of DNA sequences, called copy-number variants, known to be associated with autism, he said.\n\n\"Think of chromosomes as a library full of books and each book as a gene,\" Miller said. \"What we look for are shelves of books that have gone missing, which represent a missing fragment of a chromosome, or extra fragments of chromosome, that could contain genes related to autism.\"\n\nWhile both Children's Hospital Boston and Montefiore have offered CMA testing for several years, not all hospitals do, nor does all insurance pay for it, the researchers noted.\n\nThe main purpose of genetic testing of children with autism is to help parents determine if they're at a higher risk of having another child with autism, Marion said.\n\nIf tests pinpoint an autism-related chromosomal abnormality in the child, the parents are then offered testing. If a parent is also found to have the abnormality, geneticists conclude that the couple is at higher risk of having a child with autism. (The precise risk depends on what the variant is.)\n\nBut if the parents don't have the abnormality, geneticists conclude that the deletion or duplication happened by chance, and the parents are probably not at any greater risk of having another child with autism than the general population, Marion said.\n\nStill, there is much geneticists can't tell parents. Between 10 percent and 15 percent of autism cases can be traced to a known genetic cause, the researchers noted.

A final decision is expected by the end of June, according to the documents.\n\nXarelto (rivaroxaban) is one of a new class of blood thinners that have been developed to overcome some of the problems that exist with the standard treatment, warfarin (Coumadin), which requires constant dose monitoring. Warfarin's effectiveness also can be altered by certain foods and other medications. Xarelto already is approved for use by those with atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) and by people who are having hip- or knee-replacement surgery.\n\nIn the FDA briefing documents, an agency reviewer recommended approving the drug for treatment of acute coronary syndrome, mostly because trial data showed there was a reduction in cardiovascular death, even though there was also an increased risk of potentially fatal bleeding.\n\n\"However, what is not reflected in the sponsor's analysis are minor bleeding events,\" FDA reviewer Dr. Karen Hicks wrote in the briefing documents. \"While it is true that these bleeding events typically do not lead to death or irreversible harm, these events may represent the biggest problem for both patients and health care providers if rivaroxaban is approved.\"\n\n\"While reductions in [cardiovascular] death still trump these bleeding events, if rivaroxaban is approved, we should expect a number of bleeding events that will require medical attention,\" Hicks wrote. \"Carefully selecting patients for rivaroxaban therapy will be necessary to mitigate these bleeding risks.\"\n\nIn research presented at the American Stroke Association's International Stroke Conference in New Orleans last February, Australian doctors followed more than 14,000 people who took either Xarelto or warfarin for a median of two years. Of those patients, 136 had bleeding in the brain.\n\nPeople who took Xarelto -- and suffered from the most common type of atrial fibrillation and didn't have heart valve damage -- were about one-third less likely to experience bleeding in the brain than those who took warfarin, the investigators found.\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more about stroke.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "No independent source was quoted.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Yoga enthusiasts link the practice to a long list of health benefits, including greater flexibility and range of motion, stronger muscles, better posture and balance, reduced emotional and physical stress, and increased self-awareness and self-esteem.\n\nBut definitively proving these benefits is challenging, requiring years of costly research. A pharmaceutical company is unlikely to fund a study that doesn\u2019t involve a drug, and in any event, the research requires a large group of volunteers tracked over a very long time.\n\nThe subjects must provide health measurements at the outset, learn the proper poses, continue to do them regularly for years and be regularly evaluated.\n\nNo one knows these challenges better than Dr. Loren M. Fishman, a physiatrist at Columbia University who specializes in rehabilitative medicine. For years, he has been gathering evidence on yoga and bone health, hoping to determine whether yoga might be an effective therapy for osteoporosis.\n\nThe idea is not widely accepted in the medical community, but then, researchers know comparatively little about complementary medicine in general. So in 2005, Dr. Fishman began a small pilot study of yoga moves that turned up some encouraging results. Eleven practitioners had increased bone density in their spine and hips, he reported in 2009, compared with seven controls who did not practice yoga.\n\nKnowing that more than 700,000 spinal fractures and more than 300,000 hip fractures occur annually in the United States, Dr. Fishman hoped that similar findings from a much larger study might convince doctors that this low-cost and less dangerous alternative to bone-loss drugs is worth pursuing.\n\nThose medications can produce adverse side effects like gastrointestinal distress and fractures of the femur. Indeed, a recent study published in Clinical Interventions in Aging found that among 126,188 women found to have osteoporosis, all of whom had Medicare Part D drug coverage, only 28 percent started bone drug therapy within a year of diagnosis.\n\nMany of those who avoided drugs were trying to avoid gastrointestinal problems.\n\nOn the other hand, yoga\u2019s \u201cside effects,\u201d Dr. Fishman and colleagues wrote recently, \u201cinclude better posture, improved balance, enhanced coordination, greater range of motion, higher strength, reduced levels of anxiety and better gait.\u201d\n\nWeight-bearing activity is often recommended to patients with bone loss, and Dr. Fishman argues that certain yoga positions fit the bill.\n\n\u201cYoga puts more pressure on bone than gravity does,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cBy opposing one group of muscles against another, it stimulates osteocytes, the bone-making cells.\u201d\n\nMost experts argue that it\u2019s difficult, perhaps impossible, for adults to gain significant bone mass. Undeterred, Dr. Fishman invested a chunk of his own money and with three collaborators \u2014 Yi-Hsueh Lu of The Rockefeller University, Bernard Rosner of Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, and Dr. Gregory Chang of New York University \u2014 solicited volunteers worldwide via the Internet for a follow-up to his small pilot study.\n\nOf the 741 people who joined his experiment from 2005 to 2015, 227 (202 of them women) followed through with doing the 12 assigned yoga poses daily or at least every other day. The average age of the 227 participants upon joining the study was 68, and 83 percent had osteoporosis or its precursor, osteopenia.\n\nThe 12 poses, by their English names, were tree, triangle, warrior II, side-angle, twisted triangle, locust, bridge, supine hand-to-foot I, supine hand-to-foot II, straight-legged twist, bent-knee twist and corpse pose. Each pose was held for 30 seconds. The daily regimen, once learned, took 12 minutes to complete.\n\nThe researchers collected data at the start of the study on the participants\u2019 bone density measurements, blood and urine chemistry and X-rays of their spines and hips. They were each given a DVD of the 12 yoga poses used in the pilot study and an online program in which to record what they did and how often.\n\nA decade after the start of the study, bone density measurements were again taken and emailed to the researchers; many participants also had repeat X-rays done. The findings, as reported last month in Topics of Geriatric Rehabilitation, showed improved bone density in the spine and femur of the 227 participants who were moderately or fully compliant with the assigned yoga exercises.\n\nImprovements were seen in bone density in the hip as well, but they were not statistically significant.\n\nBefore the study, the participants had had 109 fractures, reported by them or found on X-rays.\n\nAt the time the study was submitted for publication, \u201cwith more than 90,000 hours of yoga practiced largely by people with osteoporosis or osteopenia, there have been no reported or X-ray detected fractures or serious injuries of any kind related to the practice of yoga in any of the 741 participants,\u201d Dr. Fishman and his colleagues wrote.\n\n\u201cYoga looks like it\u2019s safe, even for people who have suffered significant bone loss,\u201d Dr. Fishman said in an interview.\n\nFurthermore, a special study of bone quality done on 18 of the participants showed that they had \u201cbetter internal support of their bones, which is not measured by a bone density scan but is important to resisting fractures,\u201d Dr. Fishman said.\n\nThe study has many limitations, including the use of self-selected volunteers and the lack of a control group. But all told, the team concluded, the results may lend support to Dr. Fishman\u2019s long-held belief that yoga can help reverse bone loss.\n\nEven if bone density did not increase, improvements in posture and balance that can accrue from the practice of yoga can be protective, Dr. Fishman said.\n\n\u201cSpinal fractures can result from poor posture, and there\u2019s no medication for that, but yoga is helpful,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition, \u201cYoga is good for range of motion, strength, coordination and reduced anxiety,\u201d he said, \u201call of which contribute to the ability to stay upright and not fall.

The participants, who were generally healthy when the study began, either took 120 milligrams of ginkgo or placebo twice a day and were routinely tested for cognitive abilities.\n\nOver more than six years of follow-up, the researchers found no evidence that ginkgo delayed or prevented normal declines in memory, language, attention, visuospatial abilities or executive functions, such as anticipating outcomes and adapting to changing situations and thinking abstractly.\n\nThese results remained the same regardless of sex, age, race or education, the researchers noted.\n\nHowever, ginkgo was safe and no serious side effects were noted, DeKosky added. \"The good news is it appeared that it was fairly safe; the bad news was it didn't seem to do anything at least as far as trying to slow down the cognitive changes of aging.\"\n\nEarlier results from the same study found that ginkgo did not prevent or slow the development of Alzheimer's or other dementias, DeKosky said.\n\nThe American Botanical council took issue with the findings, however.\n\n\"There are many significant limitations of this study,\" Mark Blumenthal, council founder and executive director said in a statement.\n\n\"First, the data being published this week are drawn from a previous clinical trial which was not designed to determine the decline in cognition.

Also, the age of the subjects is quite advanced, at an average of 79 years at the beginning of the trial. This age group is not typical of the age of both healthy people and those with mild cognitive impairment who use ginkgo for improving mental performance.\"\n\nAnother group, the Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN), which represents the dietary supplement industry, also had reservations about the study.\n\nIn a statement, Douglas MacKay, CRN's vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs, said that \"there is a large body of previously published evidence, as well as ongoing trials, which suggest that ginkgo biloba is effective for helping to improve cognitive impairment in older adults.\" He added that, \"as a former practicing naturopathic doctor, I have had the benefit of working with patients and have seen firsthand how ginkgo biloba can be effective in improving cognitive function.\"\n\nGinkgo biloba is believed to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that protect cell membranes and help govern the workings of the brain's chemical messengers, or neurotransmitters.\n\nDr. Lon S.

During math tests she would freeze up, and she found her mind wandering constantly. Officials at St. Andrew's Episcopal School in Potomac gently suggested that the high school sophomore get a mental health screening.\n\nThe idea of a psychiatric evaluation sent chills down the spine of Caroline's mother, Mathy Milling Downing, who believed that her younger daughter, Candace, had committed suicide because of an adverse reaction linked to a psychiatric drug -- the antidepressant Zoloft. Shortly after Candace's death, the Food and Drug Administration placed black-box warnings on several antidepressants to say they elevated suicidal thinking among some children. If Caroline were going to get the same kind of mental health care as Candace, Downing wanted no part of it.\n\nDowning's family offers a powerful case study into the pros and cons of new guidelines recommending widespread screening of adolescents for mental disorders: Last month, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federal group that makes public health recommendations, said that all adolescents between ages 12 and 18 should be screened for major depression. In March, the Institute of Medicine, which advises Congress on scientific matters, told policymakers that early screening was key to reducing the financial and medical burden of mental disorders in the United States.\n\nDowning said she agreed to have her older daughter screened because the child was obviously in distress, but she told school officials that if an evaluation led to a prescription for medications, she would refuse to go along.\n\nThe screening, unsurprisingly, found that Caroline's emotional problems were linked to her sister's death. After several intensive evaluations that delved into the girl's mental and emotional history, and that obtained a family history and detailed information about Candace's death, Caroline was placed in \"art therapy,\" painting or making sculptures with a therapist who simultaneously used the sessions to draw out the teenager's emotional problems.\n\nThe therapy had an immediate and beneficial impact and turned Mathy Milling Downing, a skeptic about some kinds of mental health treatment, into a fan of mental health treatment done right.\n\n\"My grades went from almost failing algebra to honor roll,\" Caroline Downing, now 20, said in an interview. The treatment worked, she said, because \"getting all the stuff out of your head that you don't need there gives you more room for all the stuff you need to have in your head.\"\n\nThe very different experiences of the two sisters illustrate the paradox at the heart of screening recommendations: What matters is not whether screening is done but how it is done and how screening information gets used.\n\nIn the case of her younger daughter, Downing said, a child psychiatrist put Candace on Zoloft after a very brief evaluation because the child was experiencing anxieties during tests. When Candace turned 12, the psychiatrist upped the dose on the grounds that it would help her academically. When Downing expressed concerns about the drug, she said the doctor blew her off: \"He said, 'What are you worried about? It is safe and effective.' \"\n\nOne day in January 2004, Candace had just finished watching a show on Animal Planet with her father and sister. She had been laughing during the show. A short while later, Downing said, Candace hanged herself in her bedroom, using a belt from a bathrobe and a rod on her four-poster bed.\n\nCandace's treatment, Downing said, involved a one-size-fits-all approach to mental health that sees medications as a magic pill. By contrast, she said, the multiple screenings that Caroline received carefully evaluated the child as an individual and homed in on the kind of therapy that was best for her.\n\n\"Screening a child to find out what the root of the problem is can be useful,\" Downing said. \"In the case of my daughter [Caroline], it helped [that] they found a connection between her focusing problems and the death of her sister.\"", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "A number of mental health experts, several of whom served on major organization review panels on this topic.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Spring has barely sprung, but in most of the country, spring allergy season \u2014 triggered by the first stirrings of tree pollen \u2014 is well under way.\n\nYou can tell by the sniffles and sneezes of the afflicted. But you can also tell by the ads: TV spots selling remedies for drippy, congested noses, itchy eyes and other symptoms are in heavy rotation.\n\nNew this year: ads for Flonase, a nasal steroid spray from GlaxoSmithKline that just became available over the counter. It joins Sanofi's Nasacort, a spray in the same class that went from prescription to over-the-counter status a year ago. And they both sit on store shelves next to antihistamines such as Claritin, Allegra and Zyrtec that were prescription drugs just a few years ago. Older over-the-counter antihistamines, such as Benadryl, and decongestants, such as Sudafed and Afrin, remain available as well.\n\nDon't expect the ads to help you sort out what might work best for you. Here's what some top allergists say you need to know about these non-prescription options.\n\nBelieve (some of) the hype about the newly-accessible steroid nasal sprays.\n\nThese drugs work by fighting inflammation and they are in the \"single most effective drug class\" for treating nasal allergies, according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Other expert groups have made similar statements. \"These are first-line treatments\" that can prevent allergy symptoms, not just treat them, says Jackie Eghrari-Sabet, an allergist in Gaithersburg, Md.\n\nBut that does not mean they work for everyone, says James Sublett, a Louisville allergist and president of the allergy group. People with mild to moderate symptoms have the best chance of full relief, he says.\n\nPossible side effects include nasal irritation and nose bleeds. Labels caution that some children using the sprays may experience slower growth, so a doctor should be consulted if a child needs them for more than two months.\n\nWhen prescription drugs are first available over the counter, most consumers end up paying more, because their insurers no longer cover the cost. The non-prescription steroid nasal sprays are selling for about $17 to $23 for a one-month supply (at the typical two-squirts per nostril adult starting dose). Worth knowing: so far, insurers have continued to pay for similar prescription sprays, Eghrari-Sabet says. The various sprays have never been studied head to head, so it's impossible to say whether they vary in effectiveness, she says.\n\nThere's a right way to use these sprays.\n\nThey should be used daily during your vulnerable season or seasons, ideally starting before symptoms do, Eghrari-Sabet says. The idea is \"to turn an army of inflammatory cells around before they recruit more soldiers,\" she says.\n\nIt's also important to administer the sprays correctly, so that they end up inside your nasal passages, not just your nose, where they might cause irritation, Sublett says. Packages contain instructions, and Sublett has an added tip: bend over and look at your toes while holding the bottle up and squirting.\n\nThese drugs target histamine. That's a chemical your body releases, causing sneezing, a runny nose and itchy eyes, when you come in contact with allergy-triggering substances. Antihistamines work faster than the steroid sprays, which can take a week or so to reach full effectiveness. They also can be cheaper, because they are available in store-brand versions. For example, Walmart sells Equate loratadine tablets (the same active ingredient as Claritin) for about $7 for 60 24-hour doses\n\nAntihistamines make perfect sense for someone who suffers a few sneezy days each season and doesn't want to use a spray for weeks or months, Eghrari-Sabet says. Look for one that does not make you sleepy, Sublett says. It's a myth, he adds, that older, sedating antihistamines, such as Benadryl, are extra effective against nasal allergies.\n\nDecongestants such as Sudafed work by shrinking swollen blood vessels in the nose. They can raise blood pressure and cause jitters, and some people are more susceptible than others. Some decongestant sprays such as Afrin \u2014 unlike the steroid nasal sprays \u2014 can be used for just few days at a time, because they otherwise cause rebound symptoms.\n\nSo use these medications sparingly, Sublett says.\n\nKeep your medical providers in the loop.\n\nOver-the-counter treatments should not take the place of professional care \u2014 especially if you have never been formally diagnosed with allergies, if you have additional medical problems or if your symptoms persist or worsen, Eghrari-Sabet and Sublett say. An allergist can test you to find out what's causing your symptoms and offer additional treatments. Those include allergy shots and, for a few patients who qualify, newer immunotherapy pills that desensitize people to grass and ragweed pollens.\n\nAlso important to remember: While medications can be helpful, the first rule of allergy control is to avoid the substances that make you sniffle and sneeze. If you are allergic to mold spores or to pollen from trees, grasses or ragweed, that means knowing when levels are high (by checking pollen.com or the National Allergy Bureau) and then taking steps such as these recommended by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and & Immunology:\n\u2022 Keep windows closed at home and in your car.\n\u2022 Use air conditioning if possible.\n\u2022 Try to stay indoors, and avoid mowing lawns or raking leaves.\n\u2022 If you need to be outside for a long period, wear a pollen mask.\n\u2022 After time outside, take a shower, shampoo your hair and change clothes.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "There were some obvious conflicts of interest with one of the expert sources quoted in this story.\nDr. James Sublett is not only a Louisville allergist and president of the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, but he is also a \u201cspeaker for numerous pharmaceutical and medical device companies,\u201d says his profile on the digital media company Everyday Health.

The results are published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nWhile most breast cancer is diagnosed at later ages, about 6% of women learn that they're ill before age 40 - when they are still of childbearing age. Breast cancer treatments that have shown the best results for for disease free survival include chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or both. For younger women still hoping for children, these treatments can cause devastating short-term or long-term loss of menstrual periods, and loss of fertility. While many women choose to preserve the option of having children by storing eggs before cancer treatment, the process can be costly and difficult.\n\nItalian researchers conducted a phase three study that included 281 women with breast cancer, aged 18 to 45 years and who had not experienced menopause. Patients were randomly selected to be treated with chemotherapy alone or with chemotherapy and triptorelin, a drug, called a GnRH analogue, that prevents the ovaries from releasing eggs. The researchers followed the women for one year after they had finished chemotherapy.\n\nAmong the women who had not received triptorelin, the rate of early menopause was 25.9%. Among the women who had received triptorelin, the rate of early menoapuse was 8.9%, which is 17% lower.\n\nAn accompanying editorial by Dr. Hope S. Rugo and Dr. Mitchell P. Rosen of the University of California-San Francisco says that trptorelin therapy should not be recommended as a standard treatment and should be approached with caution in women with hormone-sensitive disease. They also stress that women resuming their menstrual cycles does not mean the same thing as women preserving their fertility.

Teixobactin is a recently discovered natural antibiotic which many in the international scientific community believe could lead to creation of the first commercially viable new antibiotic drug in 30 years.\n\nThe Lincoln team has successfully synthesized new simplified versions of teixobactin which harness the same powerful antibiotic effects in a way that could be produced on a commercial scale. Their findings are published in the Royal Society of Chemistry's journal, Chemical Science.\n\nUntil now, scientists attempting to synthesise teixobactin believed they needed to use cationic (or positively charged) amino acids which bind to the bacterial target using a 'side chain'. This meant they had to use either the very rare amino acid found naturally in teixobactin, called enduracididine, or alternative ones which had lower potency against superbugs.\n\nEach amino acid sits at a specific place in teixobactin's structure, and the Lincoln team has now successfully replaced enduracididine - which holds position ten - with two alternative amino acids which are not positively charged. These amino acids lack the 'binding' part, over-turning the prior understanding that enduracididine is essential for to so-called 'target binding' to be highly potent against superbugs.\n\nWith this new knowledge, synthesised versions of teixobactin can be more easily developed, taking the process from up to 30 hours to just ten minutes for a single coupling step - a significant step towards turning teixobactin into a viable new drug. Importantly, the two new simplified forms of teixobactin have also proven to have identical potency against superbugs as the natural form of teixobactin.\n\nDr Ishwar Singh, a specialist in novel drug design and development from the University of Lincoln's School of Pharmacy, is leading the research team. He explained: \"When teixobactin was discovered it was ground breaking in itself as a new antibiotic which kills bacteria without detectable resistance including superbugs such as MRSA. We have been investigating a way to simplify the design while retaining the high potency against resistant bacteria such as MRSA.\n\n\"This simplified design and more efficient synthesise will enable work to be carried out at a commercial level. Enduracididine was severely limiting our ability to do this because of its scarcity, a complex multistep synthesis, and long and repetitive steps of between 16 and 30 hours with high failure rate and very low yields.\n\n\"We needed to make a change to the structure so that we could make the molecule more viable for drug development. We had tried replacing it with other amino acids with a similar make up, but they all were less potent in comparison to the natural form of teixobactin. Now, we have discovered that we can in fact use amino acids which are structurally different, and are commercially-available. They are also 16 times more potent than a clinically-used antibiotic in killing the superbug MRSA, and they were also highly potent against other antibiotic-resistant infections, such as vancomycin resistant enterococci, and tuberculosis.\"\n\nThe work builds on the success of the team's pioneering research to tackle antimicrobial resistance over the past 18 months. Dr Singh is working with colleagues from the School of Life Sciences and the School of Chemistry at the University of Lincoln to develop teixobactins into a viable drug.\n\nIt has been predicted that by 2050 an additional 10 million people will succumb to drug resistant infections each year.

Noctiva is the first FDA-approved treatment for this condition.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s approval provides adults who overproduce urine at night with the first FDA-approved therapeutic option to help reduce the number of times a night they wake up to urinate,\u201d said Hylton V. Joffe, M.D., M.M.Sc., director of the Division of Bone, Reproductive, and Urologic Products in the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \u201cIt is important to know that Noctiva is not approved for all causes of night-time urination, so patients should discuss their symptoms with their health care provider who can determine the underlying cause of the night-time urination and whether Noctiva is right for them.\u201d\n\nNocturia (wakening at night to urinate) is a symptom that can be caused by a wide variety of conditions, such as congestive heart failure, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, medications, or diseases of the bladder or prostate. Before considering Noctiva, health care providers should evaluate each patient for possible causes for the nocturia, and optimize the treatment of underlying conditions that may be contributing to the night-time urination. Because Noctiva is approved only for adults with nocturia caused by nocturnal polyuria, health care providers should confirm overproduction of urine at night with a 24-hour urine collection, if one has not been obtained previously. Health care providers should also be mindful of underlying conditions that can cause nocturia, but that make treatment with Noctiva unsafe, such as excessive drinking of fluids or symptomatic congestive heart failure.\n\nNoctiva is taken daily, approximately 30 minutes before going to bed. It works by increasing the absorption of water through the kidneys, which leads to less urine production.\n\nNoctiva\u2019s efficacy was established in two 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in 1,045 patients 50 years of age and older with nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria. Although these trials showed a small reduction in the average number of night-time urinations with Noctiva compared to placebo, more patients treated with Noctiva were able to at least halve their number of night-time urinations, and patients treated with Noctiva had more nights with one or fewer night-time urinations.\n\nNoctiva is being approved with a boxed warning and a Medication Guide because it can cause low sodium levels in the blood (hyponatremia). Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest or death. Health care providers should make sure the patient\u2019s sodium level is normal before starting Noctiva, and should check sodium levels within one week and approximately one month after starting treatment and periodically thereafter. The lower Noctiva dose is recommended as the starting dose for those who may be at risk for hyponatremia, such as the elderly. Noctiva should not be used in patients at increased risk of severe hyponatremia, such as those with excessive fluid intake, those who have illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances, certain patients with kidney damage, and in those using certain medicines, known as loop diuretics or glucocorticoids.\n\nNoctiva should also not be used in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension because fluid retention can worsen these underlying conditions. Use of Noctiva should be discontinued temporarily in patients with certain nasal conditions such as colds or allergies until those conditions have resolved.\n\nNoctiva is also not recommended for the treatment of nocturia in pregnant women. Nocturia is usually related to normal changes in pregnancy that do not require treatment with Noctiva. Noctiva should not be used in children.\n\nThe most common side effects of Noctiva in clinical trials included nasal discomfort, cold symptoms (nasopharyngitis), nasal congestion, sneezing, high or increased blood pressure, back pain, nose bleeds, bronchitis and dizziness.\n\nAlthough there are other FDA-approved medications that also contain desmopressin, none of those medications are approved to treat nocturia.\n\nNoctiva is manufactured by Renaissance Lakewood, LLC for Milford, Pennsylvania-based Serenity Pharmaceuticals, LLC.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

But there's a catch often not understood by those who undergo the procedure: Once they lose the weight the surgery helps them lose, there may be more surgery to come -- surgery that is costlier and riskier and that requires a longer recovery time than the original operation.\n\nThe reason: excess skin. An obese person who loses weight quickly will lose the fat but not the skin that once enveloped the fat. The arms, thighs, abdomen, breasts, all lose texture and sag.\n\n\"It's as if a very, very large person all of a sudden had all the air let out, as if [he] were a doll,\" says Richard A. D'Amico, chief of the Department of Plastic Surgery at Englewood Hospital and Medical Center in Englewood, N.J.\n\nThe solution: plastic surgery to remove the extra skin, a set of procedures known as body contouring.\n\nAs bariatric surgery has grown more common (some 144,000 such procedures were performed in the United States in 2004, more than double the number in 2002), D'Amico says, patients seeking body contouring have \"started to show up in plastic surgeons' offices in large numbers.\" Last year more than 68,000 patients underwent body contouring after bariatric surgery, 77 percent more than five years ago, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.\n\nBarbara Baez of Fort Worth was part of that increase. Within a year of having weight loss surgery in 2003, she lost about 150 pounds; her blood pressure dropped to normal levels and the swelling in her legs decreased. She felt healthier and began exercising more. Friends told her she looked great. But, she says, \"nobody saw what was underneath.\"\n\nHer abdomen drooped so much that it got the way of her workouts. \"Exercise was a problem because you have this bouncing skin, and it's uncomfortable.\"\n\nIntense discomfort that interferes with activity is a common problem after bariatric surgery, says plastic surgeon Sarah Holland, an instructor at Columbia University Medical Center in New York -- and it can be almost constant. The skin, she says, \"has been irreparably damaged by the stretch [and it] doesn't shrink down like the rest of the body does. So it just hangs.\" In addition, she says, \"Their clothes don't fit very well because there's no place to put the extra skin.\"\n\nMany patients get chronic infections from skin rubbing against skin, and develop open wounds in the folds of flesh.\n\nFrom the skin rubbing together against her thighs, she developed bacterial and fungal infections. \"I would have bandages on me all the time. It was very painful. Just walking was painful. I had hygiene problems.\" Eventually, Baez says, \"I realized that I would need to have the skin removed.\"\n\nHer doctors never warned her this might be necessary, she says. That's not uncommon, says D'Amico. There are no guidelines requiring bariatric surgeons to warn their patients, although recently professional societies of plastic surgeons and bariatric surgeons have begun holding seminars to discuss the idea.\n\nBaez waited about a year before she started searching for a plastic surgeon. That should be the norm, says Holland. Patients should be at a stable weight for at least a month, she adds, to make sure that they've \"lost all the weight they're going to lose.\"\n\nWhile the surgical techniques used in contouring operations have been around for decades, bariatric patients present \"a unique challenge\" to plastic surgeons, says D'Amico. \"Contouring the low abdomen in somebody who has lost 250 pounds is a bigger technical effort than doing a tummy tuck on a 130-pound woman who's just had a couple of pregnancies.\"\n\nBody contouring operations are often longer and more complex than bariatric surgery, involving potentially more blood loss and shifts of fluids, and a painful healing period that can extend over weeks or months. Like all major surgery, it also carries risks of infection and problems with anesthesia.\n\n\"It's a radical procedure,\" warns Baez, who had her contouring work done last August. \"It was much more invasive than my initial surgery.\"\n\nThe American Society of Plastic Surgery (ASPS) has formed a task force -- D'Amico is a co-chair -- to alert doctors to the higher risks involved and teach them new techniques. \"It's been a hot topic at all the national conferences over the last couple of years,\" says Holland.\n\nSome body contouring patients may require several procedures -- one for the thighs, one for the arms and so on. To manage pain and prevent long periods under anesthesia, most patients have the procedures done in stages over a series of weeks or months.\n\nBecause the surgery is still relatively new, there are few studies of complication rates. A small study published in January in the Annals of Plastic Surgery showed 27 percent of patients in one practice had complications including wound infections, fluid collections called seromas, collections of blood under the skin called hematomas and death of fat cells. To help prevent seromas, special tubes are left inside the body, connected to small plastic drains on the outside. The tubes may have to remain in place for as long as three weeks.\n\nSome contouring doesn't work so well the first time around. Gavin Dry, a Seattle plastic surgeon wrote last month in a Plastic Surgery newsletter, \"I have seen a dramatic increase in the number of [surgical] revisions required by massive-weight-loss patients.\" He blamed the rise in do-over surgeries on increased demand for body contouring procedures and surgeons who \"lack adequate experience.\"\n\nBody contouring also leaves long, visible scars: hip to hip, knee to groin, elbow to armpit. \"There's no way to cut out skin without leaving a scar,\" Holland says. \"We can work on improving the scars, improving healing, but we can't eliminate the scars.\"\n\nAfter a long and painful recovery, Baez was left with what she describes as \"huge scars\" on her thighs, extending from \"three inches above the knee all the way to the groin, underneath the buttocks, and the front as well.\" It's a trade-off, she says. \"You trade the scars for the better quality of life.\"\n\nBaez says she couldn't appreciate how much skin was removed from her thighs because, even weeks after the surgery, the scars were \"so red, so puffy -- it was not a pretty outcome.\"\n\nThe cost of contouring can run into the tens of thousands of dollars, depending on how many procedures are needed. Most insurers pay for bariatric surgery, but they often consider contouring to be cosmetic, rather than medically necessary, and thus not covered under their policies.\n\n\"We spend ridiculous amounts of time trying to get this surgery approved by insurance companies,\" says Holland. Only about 25 percent of the cases her department submits get approved.\n\nBaez was initially turned down by her insurer, despite her recurrent infections and open wounds. Baez appealed. \"I knew I had a medical problem,\" she says, along with plenty of pictures to prove it and a thick medical file. Ultimately, she won her case. \"Be prepared for a battle,\" she advises, and \"document, document, document.\"\n\nSeven weeks after surgery, Baez concluded the pain and effort had been worth the result: an end to the recurrent skin infections in her thighs and abdominal folds. Six months out, she remains pleased with her flatter stomach and her better quality of life.

It\u2019s roughly the 50th coronary artery bypass Liao has performed using the robotic system at the University of Minnesota Medical Center, Fairview, and the surgeon said he\u2019s seen enough cases to believe it\u2019s making a difference.\n\n\u201cThe difference is, the length of stay is cut in half,\u201d he said.\n\nThe da Vinci is criticized by health policy experts as the poster child for the medical arms race \u2014 the competitive fever among hospitals to buy new technology whether or not it improves care. The robotic systems come with million-dollar price tags and are used for a limited number of surgeries \u2014 mostly the removal of cancerous prostates in men or uteruses in women.\n\nStudies have disagreed on whether the outcomes of these surgeries are better when using the robotic system versus other minimally invasive techniques.\n\nThose limitations haven\u2019t deterred hospital executives, though, who see the robotic systems as crucial for attracting and retaining surgeons and patients. The number of da Vinci robots has doubled in Minnesota in less than two years, with two at the university and four at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester.\n\nSurgeons believe the growth in robotic heart procedures will help justify those investments and may ultimately reduce costs if they shorten patient stays. There\u2019s a competitive interest for heart surgeons as well. With more patients using stents to prop open clogged arteries, surgeons are seeing their own number of procedures decline.\n\nWhen California-based Intuitive Surgical first unveiled the da Vinci eight years ago, it was marketed as a heart surgery device. The learning curve for cardiac surgeons was too steep, though, and the system\u2019s tools weren\u2019t as useful for heart surgeries as they were for other procedures, said Dr. Goya Raikar, a cardiothoracic surgeon at Regions Hospital in St. Paul.\n\n\u201cThe system and instruments have kind of caught up to the point where heart surgeons are taking a close look at this now,\u201d he said.\n\nRegions and Mercy Hospital in Coon Rapids started using da Vincis for heart procedures in the past year, and Methodist Hospital in St. Louis Park is preparing to do so. Raikar mostly uses the surgical robot to repair or replace damaged mitral valves, which separate the two chambers on the left side of the heart.\n\nThe robotic system puts a surgeon at the controls of a large viewing console. The doctor peers inside at magnified three-dimensional images coming from cameras inside the patient. Hand-held controls allow the surgeon to maneuver tools that are threaded into the patient through small incisions.\n\nRaikar said the magnified vision allows him to do more valve repairs, which present lower risks of complications than replacements. Unlike other surgeries, there are no minimally invasive alternatives for valve repairs, he said. The only other option is open-heart surgery, which carries a higher risk of infections and longer recoveries.\n\nLiao said the robotic surgery was the right choice for Holmes, the bypass patient.\n\nHolmes was a competitive decathlete with no hint of heart problems until he collapsed earlier this year at the University of Minnesota Field House and his heart stopped beating. Workers there used an external defibrillator to restart his heart, and doctors cooled him into hypothermia to reduce damage to the brain caused by the disruption of blood flow.\n\nLater, Holmes learned a key artery to his heart was completely clogged. Liao feared that cutting open Holmes\u2019 chest and sternum for an open bypass surgery would disrupt his rehabilitation from the cardiac arrest and delay his plans to return to athletics.\n\nUsing the da Vinci, Liao disconnected the mammary artery \u2014 which usually directs blood to the left breast \u2014 and connected it to the heart so normal blood flow could resume. A stabilizer held a section of the beating heart in place so he could secure the new coronary artery.\n\nIf all goes as expected, Holmes could go home today.\n\nJeremy Olson can be reached at 651-228-5583.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The article quotes two physicians, both of whom use the machine\u2013and work at hospitals that have invested in the machines. \nThe reporter should have talked to at least one surgeon who has declined to use the device, and one independent researcher with no conflict of interest who could summarize the findings of safety and efficacy.\nFinally, there is some federal data about negative outcomes with the device\u2013including at least one unnecessary death early in the device\u2019s development\u2013that should have been drawn on.\u00a0", "answer": 0}, {"article": "In 2012, a federally funded panel of experts on preventive care concluded there are more risks than benefits to screening American men for prostate cancer with the PSA test.

University of Pennsylvania researchers Rebecca Ashare and Heath Schmidt saw potential for a permanent cessation solution in a class of FDA-approved medications used to improve cognitive impairments from Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn a study consisting of a rat trial and a human trial, Ashare and Schmidt studied the effects of two acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, or AChEIs, called galantamine and donepezil on overall nicotine intake. The rat component showed that pretreating the rodents with an AChEI decreased their nicotine consumption. Consistent with these effects, clinical trial participants taking the AChEI, not the placebo, smoked 2.3 fewer cigarettes daily, a 12 percent decrease, and noted feeling less satisfied with the cigarettes they did smoke.\n\n\"We're very interested in screening potential efficacy of anti-addiction medications in our models,\" said Schmidt, a professor in Penn's School of Nursing and Perelman School of Medicine. \"For this study, we looked at potential smoking-cessation medications.\"\n\nThe research itself took a translational approach, what Ashare, a professor in Penn Medicine's psychiatry department, calls bi-directional. In other words, the preclinical data informed the clinical study and vice versa.\n\nAt Penn's Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Nicotine Addiction, work on smoking cessation has been ongoing since 2001. Specifically, research from Caryn Lerman, CIRNA's director and the Mary W. Calkins Professor in Psychiatry, concluded that people who quit smoking often report a decrease in what's commonly called their executive functions.\n\n\"They feel fuzzy. They're forgetful,\" Ashare said. \"Those deficits are related to their ability to quit smoking. It was this clinical aspect of smoking cessation we thought would be useful to take further.\"\n\nThat's when they turned to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.\n\nIn the brain, the neurotransmitter called acetylcholine is important to cognitive functions like learning and short-term memory. When nicotine enters the body, it binds to the same receptors in the brain that acetylcholine binds to, resulting in smoking's rewarding and reinforcement effects. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors increase acetylcholine levels in the brain and, in effect, substitute nicotine's effects.\n\nSchmidt had successfully employed such a model with other addictive substances like cocaine. He divided a group of rats into galantamine and donepezil cohorts. To mirror voluntary drug taking in humans, the rats self-administered nicotine using a lever pushed at will. Once nicotine-taking stabilized, the rats were pretreated with one of the two AChEIs.\n\nFor both drugs, \"we were able to show a reduction in total nicotine self-administered,\" Schmidt said; however, there was a caveat.\n\n\"We know from the literature that upward of 30 percent of patients will report nausea and vomiting [when taking these drugs], and this will limit their compliance,\" he said. \"We had seen that these drugs reduced nicotine self-administration, but we wanted to make sure it wasn't because the rats were sick.\"\n\nUnlike humans who can verbally report when they don't feel well and whose bodies react to nausea, rats lack the reflex to vomit. In previous research, Matthew Hayes, who has appointments in Penn Medicine and Penn Nursing, had shown that in rats kaolin clay consumption coats the stomach like an antacid and quells any ill effects. Collaborating with Hayes, Schmidt offered the animals kaolin clay, then compared how much they ate normally and with the addition of the AChEIs.\n\n\"At the doses shown to reduce nicotine self-administration, the AChEIs did not make our animals sick,\" Schmidt said. The findings sparked the CIRNA clinical trial, which has to date studied 33 smokers ages 18 to 60.\n\nPeople who were interested in quitting smoking signed on for 23 days. For the first two weeks, they continued to smoke but also took either galantamine or a placebo. Before the trial began, researchers assessed the smokers' cognitive function to get a baseline. Participants followed the regimen for two weeks and then were asked to not smoke for one full day. Two more assessments took place: after the two weeks on the cigarette-drug combination and again after that initial smoke-free day. Finally, the researchers asked the study subjects to do their best to not smoke for seven straight days, a time during which the participants still took either galantamine or a placebo.\n\n\"That week-long period is a proxy for longer-term cessation. The ability to quit smoking the first week after you make a quit attempt is highly predictive of long-term success,\" Ashare said.\n\nShe's still actively recruiting for the trial, with an aim of 80 people total. Once the trial reaches that number, she'll dig into overall quit data. What she's learned so far -- that smokers who used the FDA-approved galantamine smoked fewer cigarettes per day and enjoyed them less -- is promising, particularly given that those who don't smoke during that first crucial week are 32 times more likely to quit smoking permanently.\n\n\"Our goal in investigating these different repurposed medications is not to replace the medications that are already available,\" she said. \"We know that they're effective. Our goal is to target different populations of smokers who may be more likely to experience these cognitive deficits.\"\n\nThere's no data to suggest that a clinician treating a smoker should prescribe one of these AChEIs now. But Ashare and Schmidt are forging a path, and, if it leads where they think it might, it could provide smokers yet another option to help them quit.\n\nAshare and Schmidt published their work in the Nature journal Translational Psychiatry.", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The release doesn\u2019t explicitly state who funded the study or if there were any conflicts of interest.

He's a professor of anesthesiology at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.\n\nThe dorsal root ganglions are nerve cells, on both sides of each of the spine's vertebra, and are the gateway to pain between nerves in different parts of the body, spinal cord and brain. Stimulating this area interrupts pain signals between the painful area and the brain, the researchers explained.\n\nA pacemaker-like device implanted under the skin in the lower back sends small electronic pulses through a wire placed near the specific dorsal root ganglion associated with the pain, McCarthy said.\n\nThe pulses replace pain with tingling or numbness. The strength of stimulation, programmed by a doctor, is based on the patient's level of pain, he said.\n\nThe treatment has two advantages over spinal cord stimulation, McCarthy said. In spinal cord stimulation, a wire runs along the spinal cord sending pulses along the entire spine, but the pulses don't target the specific pain source.\n\nIn addition, dorsal root ganglion stimulation requires significantly lower levels of electric current to quell pain, McCarthy said.\n\nThe goal of this study, he said, was to judge the effectiveness of the therapy over a long period. McCarthy and his colleagues implanted the device in 67 people suffering with chronic back pain and followed them for three to 18 months. Among the participants, 17 had the device for over a year.\n\nBefore receiving the device, most patients rated their pain as an 8 on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being the worst. For most patients, the device reduced pain by 33 percent, which was significant, the researchers reported.\n\nIn addition, patients said they experienced a 27 percent reduction in disability or limitations on daily activities caused by pain. In all, 94 percent of the participants said the treatment was beneficial.\n\nThe procedure was not without complications. Five patients needed to have the wires implanted again, two patients had them removed because they were infected, and one had the device removed because of a complication.\n\nMcCarthy said the therapy is not widely available, even though it was approved by the FDA in 2016. At the moment, its use is confined to more advanced medical centers where doctors have been trained in how to implant and regulate the device.\n\nAlso, the procedure isn't covered by all insurance companies, so out-of-pocket costs to patients can be very high. It is, however, covered by Medicare, he said.\n\nFor uninsured patients, the cost of having spine stimulation devices can range from $15,000 to $50,000 or more, according to a 2008 report funded by the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries.\n\nSpine stimulation is usually approved only after patients have not responded to other treatment, according to Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other insurance companies may have varying policies.\n\nMcCarthy hopes that more doctors will be trained in the procedure and that it will become more available, especially because it has the potential to allow patients to stop taking opioids to control their pain.\n\nOne pain specialist not involved with the study saw the benefits of this procedure.\n\n\"The results of this study are very significant,\" said Dr. Kiran Patel, director of neurosurgical pain at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\nIt shows long-term data that patients experienced significant pain relief and functional improvements, she said.\n\n\"In my pain practice and career, dorsal root ganglion stimulation therapy has been one of the most effective technologies available to combat chronic pain,\" Patel said.\n\n\"I encourage chronic pain patients to seek out physicians who are trained and experienced in the application of dorsal root ganglion stimulation therapy to determine if they are a candidate,\" she said.\n\nThe findings were presented Sunday at the American Society of Anesthesiologists annual meeting, in San Francisco.

Abnormal findings indicate that the fetus may be under stress.\n\nDoppler ultrasound, done in the third trimester, is an established way to monitor high-risk pregnancies \u2014 those complicated by problems like poor fetal growth or health conditions in the mother, such as high blood pressure and heart and kidney diseases.\n\nStill, the benefits of such monitoring had not been entirely clear. There have been concerns that abnormal findings on Doppler ultrasound may prompt doctors to sometimes unnecessarily intervene \u2014 by, for instance, performing a cesarean section.\n\nBut in the new review, researchers found that across 16 studies of more than 10,000 high-risk pregnancies, Doppler ultrasound testing was linked to a 29 percent reduction in fetal and newborn deaths.\n\nAmong women who did not receive ultrasound monitoring, 1.7 percent suffered a fetal or newborn death, versus 1.2 percent of women who underwent ultrasound.\n\nThe benefit seemed to stem from better decisions on C-sections and inductions of labor, according to the researchers, led by Dr. Zarko Alfirevic of the University of Liverpool in the UK.\n\nHe and his colleagues report their review findings in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, which is published by the Cochrane Collaboration, an international research organization that evaluates medical studies.\n\nIn an interview, Alfirevic said that the evidence supports using Doppler in high-risk pregnancies where the mother has high blood pressure or the fetus is abnormally small. In these cases, the fetus may not be getting enough nutrients and oxygen through the placenta.\n\n\u201cThese women really should have a Doppler investigation of the umbilical artery,\u201d Alfirevic said. Typically, high-risk women would receive other types prenatal testing as well, such as electronic fetal-heart monitoring.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just saying this (Doppler ultrasound) should be part of it,\u201d Alfirevic said.\n\nIn practice, Doppler ultrasound may also be recommended for women who have diabetes or are having a prolonged pregnancy (beyond 42 weeks). But there is not yet strong evidence that these women benefit, Alfirevic said.\n\nIn general, he and his colleagues found, the trials included in the review, which were mainly done in the 1990s, had their shortcomings. Some had flaws in their design, while in other cases the researchers failed to provide details on key elements of the study design.\n\nHowever, with Doppler an established technique for monitoring high-risk pregnancies, Alfirevic said it is very unlikely that any future studies will test Doppler against no Doppler \u2014 as most studies in this review did.\n\nResearch, according to Alfirevic, has moved on to other questions, including how to best manage abnormal findings from a Doppler scan.\n\nIn some cases, early delivery may be the best course, but it is unclear whether other options \u2014 such as bed rest or tighter blood pressure control in a woman with high blood pressure \u2014 are effective.\n\nAnother question, Alfirevic said, is whether ultrasounds of blood vessels other than the umbilical artery might improve pregnancy outcomes.\n\nOne thing that is clear, the researcher stressed, is that Doppler ultrasound is not necessary for women with average, healthy pregnancies.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence to suggest that it should be done in low-risk women,\u201d Alfirevic said.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "1clip_filelist.xml\" rel=\"File-List\"/>\n\n\n\n\n \nThere is no information in the story that appears to come from an independent source.

She wanted to be screened, and she knew just what kind of screening she wanted \u2014 a test that's so new, some women and doctors don't quite realize what they've signed up for.\n\nThis kind of test , called cell free fetal DNA testing, uses a simple blood sample from an expectant mother to analyze bits of fetal DNA that have leaked into her bloodstream. It's only been on the market since October 2011 and is not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration \u2014 the FDA does not regulate this type of genetic testing service. Several companies now offer the test, including Sequenom and Illumina. Insurance coverage varies, and doctors often only offer this testing to women at higher risk because of things like advanced maternal age.\n\n\"I think that I initially heard about it through family and friends,\" says Seitz. \"They had had the option of it given to them by their doctors.\"\n\nTo her, it sounded great. She didn't want an invasive procedure like amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling.Those are considered the gold standard for prenatal genetic testing, but doctors must put a needle into the womb to collect cells that contain fetal DNA, which means a small risk of miscarriage.\n\n\"I wasn't interested in going as far as getting an amniocentesis because of the risk associated with that,\" she explains, \"and so when I heard about this test, that was part of the reason that I was most interested in it.\"\n\nThis new way of testing fetal DNA seemed to have already become fairly common where Seitz used to live, in Washington, D.C. But she had recently moved to Alabama, and the clinic she went to there wasn't as familiar with it \u2014 although when she talked to her doctor, she learned the clinic had just had a visit from a company's sales representative.\n\n\"I think it was a fairly new test for them at that point, but she was interested in pursuing it further to see what needed to be done,\" Seitz says.\n\nSeitz got her blood drawn last July, becoming one of hundreds of thousands of pregnant women who've opted for this new kind of test instead of the more traditional, invasive ones. Doctors say the impact has been huge.\n\n\"Those of us in the field who do diagnostic procedures like CVS and amnio have seen a drastic decrease in the number of those procedures that are being performed,\" says Dr. Mary Norton, an expert on maternal-fetal medicine and genetics at the University of California, San Francisco. \"Places are reporting doing fewer than half the number of procedures that were being done previously.\"\n\nBut, she says, things have changed so quickly that it may be hard for doctors and patients to know what they're dealing with.\n\n\"It's still new and it's quite different than previous genetic testing that's been available,\" says Norton. \"It's quite a different paradigm, if you will.\"\n\nAn invasive test like amniocentesis or CVS lets doctors get a complete picture of the chromosomes and a solid diagnosis.\n\nUntil the new testing technology came along, the only less invasive option was for an expectant mother to get an ultrasound, plus have her blood tested for specific proteins. This can reveal if there's an increased risk of certain disorders, but it's not very accurate and produces a lot of false alarms.\n\nStudies have shown that the new fetal DNA tests do a better job, says Norton. They're less likely to flag a normal pregnancy as high risk.\n\n\"They're much more accurate than current screening tests, but they are not diagnostic tests in the sense that amniocentesis is,\" says Norton, \"and so I think that has led to some confusion.\"\n\nEven though the newer blood tests do look at fetal DNA, they can't give a definitive answer like an amniocentesis can because they're analyzing scraps of fetal DNA in the mother's blood that are all mixed up with her own DNA.\n\nNorton says when women get worrisome results from one of these new tests and are referred to her center, they sometimes don't understand why doctors are offering a follow-up amnio \"because they were under the impression that this was as good as an amnio.\"\n\nShe is concerned that some people might end a pregnancy without getting confirmatory testing and points to one study last year that found a small number of women did that.\n\n\"There's at least some evidence that it's happening to a greater degree than I think many of us are comfortable with,\" she says.\n\nThe tests are being used more and more widely. Some worry that the companies' websites and marketing materials don't make the limitations clear enough.\n\nBut Dr. Lee Shulman doesn't see it that way. He's an obstetrician and geneticist at Northwestern University in Chicago who has consulted for a couple of the testing firms.\n\n\"Patients need to understand that while this is better, it is not a diagnostic test, and I think the companies have done a great job in putting this material out,\" he says. \"Whether or not clinicians use this material and take it to heart and use it for patient counseling is a different story.\"\n\nHe says the technology is so new that a lot of doctors have no experience with it, and consumers need to understand that.\n\n\"If the patient, if the couple, are not getting the answers, not getting the information they feel comfortable with, they need to seek out prenatal diagnostic centers, maternal fetal specialists, clinical geneticists, who may have more experience,\" says Shulman.\n\nFor example, here's one thing that might turn out to be a little more complicated than would-be parents might expect. Along with screening for the common chromosomal disorders, companies offer parents the chance to learn their baby's sex \u2014 weeks before it's clear on a sonogram.\n\n\"Many women are very excited by the idea that as part of their blood testing, they could find out pretty definitively if the baby is a boy or a girl,\" says Dr. Diana Bianchi, an expert on prenatal diagnostics at Tufts University School of Medicine.\n\nWhat they may not realize, she says, is that the test will also determine whether there's something abnormal about the sex chromosomes.\n\n\"Approximately 1 in 700 pregnancies there's an extra X or extra Y,\" she says, noting that these are mild conditions that would normally go undetected, unless a woman had an invasive test like an amnio. Some babies with these conditions grow up into adulthood and never know they have them, unless they face a symptom like infertility.\n\nSeitz, in Alabama, thought it was a bonus that getting this new blood test would tell her if she was having a boy or a girl. But it actually didn't do that, because of a paperwork glitch.\n\n\"The box for sex got unchecked somewhere along the way, so we weren't able to find it out from the test,\" says Seitz, who learned from an ultrasound that she was having a girl. The results she did get from the fetal DNA test were reassuring.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story sought out several expert sources for their opinions about the testing, and it appropriately noted that one of these sources (Dr. Lee Shulman) is a consultant to firms selling the new screening tests.

It consists mainly of cells that line the walls of capillaries in the brain and are so tightly packed that many molecules in the bloodstream cannot slip out between cells to reach the brain tissue itself. But certain drugs, like mannitol, will temporarily open the barrier and were first used more than 20 years ago to help other medicines reach the brain.\n\nThe new technique refines the art of opening the barrier: it uses microcatheters \u2014 fine, highly flexible tubes that are inserted into an artery in the groin and then threaded up into tiny blood vessels nearly anywhere in the brain \u2014 to spray chemotherapy directly onto tumors or areas from which they have been removed. The catheters are normally used to deliver clot-dissolving drugs to the brain to treat strokes.\n\n\u201cThis will substantially alter the way that chemotherapy is given in the future,\u201d said Dr. John Boockvar, the brain surgeon who devised the trial. \u201cBut we have to prove that at certain doses, nobody gets hurt.\u201d\n\nReferring to glioblastoma patients, Dr. Riina said, \u201cEveryone is looking for something to do for these people.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if you buy someone just a year, that could be a wedding or a graduation,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou never know what might happen in the year they hold onto.\u201d\n\nThe study, which began in August, is still in its earliest phase, meaning its main goal is to measure safety, not efficacy \u2014 to find out if it is safe to spray Avastin directly into brain arteries and at what dose. Nonetheless, the doctors were pleased when M.R.I. scans of the first few patients showed that the treatment seemed to erase any sign of recurring glioblastomas. But how long the effect will last remains to be seen.\n\nDespite a beautiful scan, the first patient who was treated died in October, from pneumonia and the spread of glioblastoma to his brainstem.\n\nInnovations are desperately needed to make headway against glioblastoma, which is \u201cone of the most deadly tumors that exist in humans,\u201d said Dr. Russell Lonser, chairman of surgical neurology at the National Institutes of Health.\n\n\u201cThis is a very good start,\u201d Dr. Lonser said. \u201cThe early data is very interesting and exciting.\u201d\n\nThe complexity of a study like this goes beyond the science. Clinical trials are also a complicated pact, emotionally and ethically, between desperate patients and doctors who must balance their ambition as researchers against their duty as clinicians, and must walk a fine line between offering too much hope and not enough.\n\n\u201cI tell patients, \u2018I\u2019m going to try to cure your disease, but so far glioblastoma is an incurable disease,\u2019 \u201d Dr. Boockvar said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic,\u201d Mr. Sugrue said one morning in September, after scheduling a second brain operation. But he had tears in his eyes.\n\nThere are about 10,000 new cases of glioblastoma a year in the United States, mostly in people over 45. The tumors are notorious for growing back like weeds even after being cut out and blasted with chemotherapy and radiation, and they are nearly always fatal. With the best treatment, the median survival time is about 15 months.\n\nBut in the last five years, the number of patients who survive 2 years has increased to 25 percent, from 8 percent, largely because doctors began using a chemotherapy pill called temozolomide, or Temodar, along with radiation (Temodar is believed to seep through the blood-brain barrier).\n\nDr. Boockvar said he thought that if he could just keep patients alive for two years, more advances might come along and give them time.\n\n\u201cThe glioblastoma population is very studyable, unfortunately, because the prognosis is so grim,\u201d he said.\n\nPatients often wind up on the front lines of research, figuring they have little to lose and hoping they will be lucky enough to test the big breakthrough. More than 500 studies for people with glioblastoma are listed on the government Web site www.clinicaltrials.gov.\n\nMr. Sugrue, who lives in Stamford, Conn., with his wife, Donna, and their children Molly and Tim, began having headaches in April. He thought he had a sinus problem. But a scan found a brain tumor nearly the size of a golf ball. A local doctor referred him to Dr. Boockvar. He had the standard treatment: surgery, temozolomide pills and six weeks of radiation, which ended on June 25.\n\nBy July, an ominous bright spot on his M.R.I. scan suggested that the tumor might already be growing back. He continued chemotherapy, but the spot kept enlarging.\n\nBy mid-September, the Sugrues were back in Dr. Boockvar\u2019s office to plan their next step. Stubbly hair was growing in on Mr. Sugrue\u2019s scalp, except for a bare patch, around an arcing scar above his right ear. His eyes, bright blue with thick, dark lashes that gave him a boyish look, searched the doctor\u2019s face.\n\nThe headaches had returned. New scans, displayed on a computer screen, showed signs of brain swelling and bright spots that should not have been there. Dr. Boockvar recommended more surgery and then chemotherapy with Avastin, which had recently been approved for recurring glioblastoma.\n\nIt was approved for intravenous use \u2014 to be dripped into a vein, usually in the arm \u2014 but he said Mr. Sugrue would be an ideal candidate for his study, in which the drug would be infused directly into an artery in the brain, producing levels at least 50 times what the intravenous route could achieve. One other patient had been treated that way, and M.R.I. scans showed that recurring tumors seemed to have melted away.\n\nMr. Sugrue said he was all for it, even though Dr. Boockvar warned him that the drug was no magic bullet. Then Dr. Boockvar ticked off the risks from a second brain operation.\n\n\u201cI have to quote you a 5 percent risk you\u2019ll be visibly weak,\u201d he said. \u201cA 1 percent chance of paralysis on the left side.\u201d\n\nMr. Sugrue wiped his eyes and began to apologize for losing his composure, but the surgeon cut him off and said, \u201cIn neurosurgery they say that if you don\u2019t make your patient cry, you haven\u2019t gotten informed consent.\u201d\n\nThe trial grew out of a conversation about a year ago between Dr. Boockvar and Dr. Riina, an expert in using microcatheters to treat strokes.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Why can\u2019t you infuse chemotherapy for my brain tumor patients?\u2019 \u201d Dr. Boockvar recalled. \u201cAnd he said: \u2018I can. Just show me what you want to do.\u2019 \u201d\n\nDr. Riina said, \u201cTechnically, I can go anywhere in your brain.\u201d\n\nHe said microcatheter technology had advanced \u201clight-years\u201d in the last decade and was just waiting for a new drug to come along for glioblastoma.\n\nThey wrote up a plan to test what they called \u201csuperselective intra-arterial cerebral infusion\u201d of Avastin in 30 patients with glioblastomas that had recurred after standard treatment. Each patient would receive just one treatment directed into the brain, followed weeks later by a series of intravenous treatments with Avastin.\n\nTheir study involves a technique first developed about 30 years ago, which uses mannitol to open the blood-brain barrier temporarily to get chemotherapy into the brain. Mannitol pulls water out of the tightly packed cells lining the capillaries so that they shrink and pull away from one another, opening up gaps through which drug molecules can pass into the brain.\n\nThe technique was developed by Dr. Edward A. Neuwelt, a neurosurgeon at Oregon Health Sciences University and the Veterans Affairs Hospital in Portland. Its best results have been in people with a rare type of brain tumor called a primary central nervous system lymphoma. But it has not been helpful with glioblastoma, because until recently there was no chemotherapy to infuse that would have much effect on those tumors.\n\nDr. Neuwelt said that Avastin had helped to renew interest in opening the blood-brain barrier but that researchers disagreed about whether the drug would lend itself to that use.\n\nAvastin starves tumors by blocking the growth of new blood vessels, which they need to survive. Dr. Boockvar said microcatheters should increase the odds of success by delivering a high dose of the drug directly to where it was needed most. Earlier research with other drugs used larger catheters inserted into the carotid arteries, which feed the entire brain \u2014 meaning that the tumor did not receive the most concentrated dose and that healthy brain tissue was exposed to the toxic drugs.\n\nBy mid-November, the researchers had treated five patients, including Mr. Sugrue; they first infused mannitol, waited five minutes and then sprayed in the Avastin. In all the patients\u2019 M.R.I. scans, the telltale bright spots that marked tumor growth faded away after the treatment.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you what it means,\u201d Dr. Boockvar said. \u201cNobody knows.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the death of the first patient was a reminder that glioblastoma can invade other parts of the brain and the spinal fluid and that the highly localized spray of Avastin might miss deadly seeds of cancer.\n\nBut Dr. Boockvar remained hopeful for the remaining patients, describing the scans as \u201castronomically far better than I had anticipated.\u201d\n\nMr. Sugrue was still in the hospital in late September when Dr. Boockvar burst into his room and got him out of bed to look at his own before-and-after scans.\n\n\u201cHe took me to this room with all these computers and said, \u2018I\u2019ve got to show you this,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Sugrue recalled. \u201cThis M.R.I. was a thing of beauty. I\u2019m excited that he\u2019s excited. That means a lot to me.\u201d\n\nDr. Boockvar said: \u201cAvastin may not be the best drug for this delivery technique. What\u2019s exciting about our results is that we\u2019ve proven there is a local effect.\n\n\u201cSuppose someone said, \u2018I have much better drug.\u2019 Now I can say I at least have a delivery system.\u201d\n\nWith patients, Dr. Boockvar tries to walk a fine line, trying to level with them and yet not rob them of all hope. He knows the emotional toll that a cancer diagnosis can take: his own father had leukemia for about eight years and died in September. Mrs. Sugrue said the doctor urged her and her husband to resist doing an Internet search for glioblastoma because they would just read that it was a death sentence.\n\nThey said they tried to follow his advice, but when the subject of prognosis came up in an interview, both had tears in their eyes.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t ask the question if you don\u2019t want the answer,\u201d Mrs. Sugrue said. \u201cWhat will be, will be.

It focused on postmenopausal women who had been diagnosed with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer that was either at stage II or stage III -- that is, tumors that were around an inch or greater in size and might have spread to the lymph nodes under the arm.\n\nThe most common form of breast cancer, ER+ accounts for about three-quarters of all breast cancer cases in the United States, the authors noted.\n\nThe 352 women who participated were monitored for tumor growth before and after being placed on a 16-week regimen of aromatase inhibitors -- estrogen-lowering agents -- before any surgery. Estrogen stimulates the growth of ER+ tumors.\n\nThe women were classified into three groups as the study began: \"marginal\", meaning that the women were eligible for a lumpectomy to conserve the breast, but that it would be disfiguring or require several operations; \"mastectomy-only\", meaning a lumpectomy was not considered possible; and \"inoperable\", meaning that doctors believed that even a mastectomy would not completely remove the cancer.\n\nAfter the four months of estrogen-lowering therapy, the research team found that 82 percent of those women in the marginal group were, in fact, able to undergo successful breast-conservation surgery.\n\nMore than half of those women who had been categorized as mastectomy-only patients were also able to go the lumpectomy route and experience a good outcome.

This rare genetic defect causes severe visual impairment beginning in infancy and can eventually lead to blindness. The company believes the total \"population in the US, Europe and select additional markets in the Americas and Asia/Pacific is up to approximately 6,000 individuals\" who have the mutation targeted by Luxturna, explained Monique da Silva, a spokeswoman for Spark Therapeutics.\n\nThe drug will be available in the United States in early spring, with an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 people in the US standing to benefit from this treatment, according to Spark.\n\nLuxturna is only the third gene therapy approved for use in the United States; two others were also approved in 2017. This is the first to correct an inherited genetic mutation.\n\nLuxturna is a liquid that is injected directly into the eye with a microscopic needle during a surgical procedure. The drug supplies a third gene -- a normal RPE65 gene -- to cells in the retina, a layer of tissue lining the back of the eye. This third version of the gene does not remove or replace the two mutated genes causing the disease, which remain inside the cells. However, the normal gene delivered by the treatment is able to function within the retinal cells and correct vision problems.\n\nIn the phase 3 clinical trial, 27 out of 29 participants -- 93% -- who received the gene therapy demonstrated a gain in functional vision as assessed by a mobility test performed in a maze, according to the company. Risks of the treatment include cataracts, elevated eye pressure, retinal tears and holes and inflammation.\n\nThe company's offer of unusual payer models, including rebates and installment payments, will \"help ensure patients' individual financial situation does not hinder access to treatment,\" da Silva said.\n\n\"New technologies such as gene and cell therapies hold out the potential to transform medicine,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a statement announcing the August approval of Kymriah, considered to be the first gene therapy to be approved for the US market.\n\nKymriah is a leukemia treatment made by pharmaceutical giant Novartis.

Merck is expected to announce late-stage trial results of a similar drug, boceprevir, this year. And numerous other companies, from pharmaceutical giants to small start-ups, are in hot pursuit.\n\nBoth Vertex\u2019s telaprevir and Merck\u2019s boceprevir block an enzyme known as protease that is made by the virus. Most of the other new drugs also work by blocking viral enzymes. This direct antiviral approach has been used with great success in treating H.I.V. and AIDS.\n\nVertex itself says it expects results from two additional Phase 3 trials of telaprevir in the third quarter and will then apply to the Food and Drug Administration for approval of the drug.\n\nSome 2.7 million to 3.9 million Americans are estimated to have hepatitis C, and 12,000 die from it each year, according to a recent report by the Institute of Medicine.\n\nThe disease can cause cirrhosis, which is a scarring of the liver, as well as liver cancer. The virus is transmitted by blood, so most people who have hepatitis C either have injected illegal drugs or received blood transfusions or blood products before the early 1990s.\n\nThe existing treatment is a combination of alpha interferon, which is injected, and ribavirin, an oral drug. It is not quite clear how those drugs work.\n\nFor patients with the type of hepatitis most prevalent in the United States, which is called Genotype 1, the treatment lasts nearly a year and can cause side effects that include flulike symptoms, anemia and depression. It is so arduous that many patients opt not to get treated or drop out before completing the course.\n\nBut in Vertex\u2019s trial, about 70 percent of those who achieved an effective cure were able to do so in 24 weeks, or about six months. That shorter time line, plus a higher chance of success, could entice more people to be treated, experts say.\n\n\u201cIf you can promise them six months with a reasonable chance of a cure, that\u2019s a meaningful advance,\u201d said Dr. Scott L. Friedman, chief of the division of liver diseases at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.\n\nIf approved, telaprevir would have to be used initially with the existing drugs to prevent the virus from evolving resistance. But experts hope that eventually several of the pills now in development could be used together, much as AIDS is treated, doing away with the need for interferon.\n\nVertex\u2019s clinical trial enrolled 1,095 patients in the United States and abroad who had Genotype 1 hepatitis C and had not been treated previously. Patients got either 12 weeks or eight weeks of telaprevir or a placebo. The standard therapy of interferon and ribavirin was given for either 24 weeks or 48 weeks, depending on how the patients were faring after four weeks and 12 weeks.\n\nOf those who got 12 weeks of telaprevir, 75 percent had a sustained viral response, meaning the virus was not detectable in their blood 24 weeks after completing treatment. That is seen as essentially a cure. The rate was 69 percent for those who got eight weeks of telaprevir.\n\nThe drug can cause a nasty rash and increases the rate of anemia. About 7 percent of the patients getting telaprevir dropped out of the trial, about double the figure for the control group.\n\nLorren Sandt, chairwoman of the National Viral Hepatitis Roundtable, an advocacy group, called the trial results impressive. But she added, \u201cThe community hopes that if telaprevir is approved by the F.D.A. that it will be accessible and affordable to everyone.\u201d\n\nVertex, which is based in Cambridge, Mass., has not said what it would charge.

Their study was published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Heart Association.\n\nOne was a low-fat diet that included lots of fruits, low-fat dairy, poultry, whole grains and small amounts of red meat.\n\nThe other two diets were moderately high in fat, with about 34 percent of total calories consumed per day coming from fat. The types of foods and meals were similar to the low-fat diet, but included more nuts and oils.\n\nOne of the moderately high-fat diets included a daily serving of one avocado.\n\nIn one sample meal plan, lunch was chicken salad with half an avocado, and dinner included turkey tacos with another half an avocado.\n\nThe diets were similar in terms of macronutrients (like protein and fats) and calories. The only difference between the two was the avocado \u2014 the other diet had the same amount of fat from other sources.\n\nAt the end of the study, the researchers found that the avocado diet led to significant reductions in LDL cholesterol, compared with the other two diets.\n\nTo put the difference in perspective, the avocado diet decreased LDL cholesterol about 14 milligrams per deciliter of blood.

Since then, clinicians and dermatologists have seen a rise in demand for minimally invasive laser-based treatments, including tattoo removal. However, it is difficult for the laser light, which is held at a distance from the skin, to be perfectly and selectively absorbed by only the targeted birthmark or tattoo. Now, researchers from the University of Missouri have developed instruments that transmit laser light into the tissue through direct contact. The techniques developed by the interdisciplinary team can be used by dermatologists and will reduce safety concerns in laser dermatology by improving laser transmission through surface layers of the skin.\n\nLaser techniques come with risks, including eye damage. Open-air transmission, in which the clinician holds the laser at a distance from the patient, is typical during normal dermatological procedures and presents a hazard to both the patients\u2019 and doctors\u2019 eyes. Paul J.D. Whiteside, a doctoral candidate in the MU Division of Food Systems and Bioengineering, devised a system that will not only improve the process, but will be safer for both clinicians and patients.\n\n\u201cThe system we developed uses ultrasonic pulsation in conjunction with a clinical laser to alter the properties of skin tissues during the procedure,\u201d Whiteside said. \u201cWe\u2019ve named the technique \u2018sonoillumination,\u2019 and we\u2019re hopeful that the procedure will be available widely in the near future.\u201d\n\nWhiteside and his team, including adviser, Heather K. Hunt, an assistant professor of bioengineering in the MU College of Engineering, tested the sonoillumination system on porcine skin tissue samples. Using various amplitudes and pulses, the instruments they developed were tested on the samples and showed great promise for the clinical setting. Whiteside presented his technique to clinicians on April 9, 2017, at the annual conference of American Society for Laser Medicine and Surgery (ASLMS).\n\n\u201cPork skin samples are very close to human skin samples, so the initial results we saw are promising for human applications,\u201d Hunt said. \u201c\u2018Sonoillumination\u2019 will be extremely beneficial for clinicians and the ASLMS presentation allowed us to demonstrate the system to the people who actually will be using the technology once it\u2019s commercialized.\u201d\n\nNicholas Golda, associate professor of dermatology and director of dermatology surgery at the MU School of Medicine, echoed the merits of the sonoillumination system and the effect it will have on dermatology.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to provide patients with safer, more effective treatment options that potentially lower the number of treatments needed,\u201d Golda said. \u201cThis new technology may also provide physicians with a safer, more controllable option for treating patients.\u201d\n\nThe team co-authored the paper, \u201cUltrasonic modulation of tissue optical properties in ex vivo porcine skin to improve transmitted transdermal laser intensity,\u201d which recently was accepted for publication by the society\u2019s journal, Lasers in Surgery and Medicine. The sonoillumination research was funded in part by a 2015 Fast Track grant from the University of Missouri System.\n\nThe team is in the planning stages of developing a start-up company to commercialize the technique.

So, the researchers theorized that the poor performance of the supplements may simply reflect the overwhelming power of the medications.\n\nStudy author Daan Kromhout, from the division of human nutrition at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, is to present the findings Sunday at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Stockholm; the study will appear online in the New England Journal of Medicine simultaneously.\n\nIn the study, researchers focused on a group of more than 4,800 Dutch heart attack patients between the ages of 60 and 80, slightly more than three-quarters of whom were men.\n\nAll had experienced a heart attack at some point in the decade leading up to the study, and all were taking blood pressure medications, anti-clotting drugs and statins.\n\nAt the study's start, the patients were instructed to consume (over a period lasting a little over three years) one of four different types of margarines: one supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids; one supplemented with the plant-derived ALA; one supplemented with both omega-3 fatty acids and ALA; and one with no supplements.\n\nThe amount of supplementation added to the various margarines was deemed to be \"low-dose.\" During the study, the patients consumed an average of 18.8 grams of margarine per day, which meant ingestion of an average of 226 milligrams of EPA combined with 150 milligrams of DHA omega-3 fatty acids and/or 1.9 grams of ALA.\n\nBy the study's end, almost 14 percent of the heart attack patients had experienced another \"major cardiovascular event,\" with some cases ending in death.\n\nNone of the low-dose supplements seemed to stave off such events in most of the patients. One exception appeared to be among women ingesting ALA; researchers saw a 27 percent reduction in the risk for further cardiac complications, although that reduction did not quite reach statistical significance.\n\n\"The bottom-line finding of the Alpha Omega Trial is that [omega]-3 fatty acids did not reduce the primary endpoint major cardiovascular events,\" Kromhout said, noting that the ALA finding needs further confirmation.\n\nDr. Murray A.

It is during this acute post-attack period, he explained, when patients are most vulnerable to a subsequent event.\n\n\"But here, in some cases the patients they looked at are years following their first heart attack when they start taking these supplements,\" he stressed. \"So, that's a big difference in what kind of patient they're examining. And they're also not just looking at preventable fatalities but all heart-related events that follow. And on top of that, the supplement doses they use here are very low, much lower than those used in prior studies.\"\n\n\"So it might be big differences in study design that account for this new finding,\" Mittleman cautioned. \"In any case, I would say this is absolutely worth further investigation.\"\n\nDr. Gregg C. Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, agreed.\n\n\"It is possible that improvements in other treatments for heart attack patients have made fish oil supplementation less important for reducing cardiovascular risk,\" he acknowledged. \"But it's also possible that the different dosing used in this study relative to previous work made a difference in the outcome. The dosing here may have been just too low, whereas higher doses given immediately following an initial heart attack might have been protective.\"\n\n\"So I would say,\" Fonarow added, \"that this is by no means the final word regarding omega-3s and cardiovascular health.\"\n\nFor more on omega-3 fatty acids, visit the National Institutes of Health.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "\u00a0The story included comments from several individuals without direct ties to the study reported on but with active research programs examining the potential of benefit from omega-3 fatty acids.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Jason Dragoo\u2019s Stanford University research team gets 100 to 200 inquiries every day from people interested in joining its clinical trial studying the use of stem cells to treat knee injuries.\n\nThe interest highlights a growing demand for the use of stem cells derived from a person\u2019s own bone marrow or fat to treat orthopedic injuries.

It's really exciting and could enhance the way we support people with cancer in the future.\"\n\nThe study also found that those with the lowest levels of mental wellbeing and highest levels of depression experienced greatest mood improvement, associated with lower levels of inflammation in the body. There is a link between high levels of inflammation and serious illness.\n\nChoir members gave samples of their saliva before an hour of singing, and then again just after. The samples were analysed to see what changes occurred in a number of hormones, immune proteins, neuropeptides and receptors.\n\nDr Daisy Fancourt, Research Associate at the Centre for Performance Science, a partnership between the Royal College of Music and Imperial College London and co-author of the research, said: \"Many people affected by cancer can experience psychological difficulties such as stress, anxiety and depression. Research has demonstrated that these can suppress immune activity, at a time when patients need as much support as they can get from their immune system. This research is exciting as it suggests that an activity as simple as singing could reduce some of this stress-induced suppression, helping to improve wellbeing and quality of life amongst patients and put them in the best position to receive treatment.\"\n\nDiane Raybould, 64, took part in the study and has been singing with the Bridgend Sing with Us choir since 2010. Diane was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was aged 50. Her daughter was diagnosed with breast cancer at the same time and sadly, passed away from the disease at just 28. Diane said: \"Singing in the choir is about more than just enjoyment, it genuinely makes you feel better. The choir leaders play a huge part of course, but so does the support of the other choir members, the inspirational programme and uplifting songs. The choir is a family, simple as that. Having cancer and losing someone to cancer can be very isolating. With the choir, you can share experiences openly and that is hugely important.\"\n\nRosie Dow, Head of Sing with Us at Tenovus Cancer Care and co-author of the research, added: \"This research is so exciting, as it echoes everything all our choir members tell us about how singing has helped them. I've seen peoples' lives transformed through singing in our choirs so knowing that singing also makes a biological difference will hopefully help us to reach more people with the message that singing is great for you - mind, body and soul.\"\n\nFollowing on from this research, Tenovus Cancer Care is launching a two year study looking in more depth at the longitudinal effect of choir singing over several months. It will look at mental health, wellbeing, social support and ability to cope with cancer, alongside measuring stress hormones and immune function amongst patients, carers, staff and people who have lost somebody to cancer.\n\nThe full research paper can be found at http://ecancer.\n\nIf you or someone you love has been affected by cancer, Tenovus Cancer Care can offer help and support.

Statins include widely used medications such as Crestor, Lipitor and Zocor.\n\n\"For high-risk people, those with heart disease or [who] have had a stroke who are taking a standard dose of a statin, further reduction in LDL cholesterol will give them extra benefit,\" said Dr. Colin Baigent of the Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit at University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, who was involved in both studies. This applied even if the patients already had low levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or \"bad\") cholesterol, he noted.\n\nThe reports are published in the Nov. 9 online edition of The Lancet.\n\nIn the first study, researchers at Oxford and the University of Sydney in Australia collected data from studies on 170,000 patients who took part in 26 trials. This type of review, called a meta-analysis, gathers data from various studies to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nAmong these trials, five compared high doses of statins with regular doses and the other 21 studies compared people taking statins with people not taking the drugs.\n\nThe researchers found that in trials comparing statin doses, taking high-dose statins reduced the odds of having a stroke by an additional 15 percent, compared to the usual doses of statins.\n\nSpecifically, there was a 13 percent reduction in heart-related death or heart attack, a 19 percent reduction in the need for a new heart operation and a 16 percent reduction in stroke, the researchers found.\n\nWhen they did an updated analysis of the 21 trials, first major cardiovascular events (such as heart attack and stroke) were lowered by a \"highly significant\" 22 percent for a 1.07 millimole per liter (mmol/L) reduction of LDL cholesterol.\n\nTaking all 26 trials together, deaths were reduced by 10 percent for 1 mmol/L in reduction of LDL cholesterol, with no significant effect on deaths from stroke or other vascular causes.\n\nIn addition, there were no significant effects of statins on deaths due to cancer or other non-vascular causes, and no excess risk of cancer, even at low LDL cholesterol concentrations.\n\nThe second study is a randomized trial called the Study of the Effectiveness of Additional Reductions in Cholesterol and Homocysteine (SEARCH), led by professor Jane Armitage, also a scientist at the CTSU in Oxford.\n\nThis trial looked at the benefits of statin therapy with 80 milligrams (mg) versus 20 mg simvastatin (Zocor) among 12,000 heart attack survivors.\n\nThe study was supported by a grant from Merck (manufacturer of the simvastatin).\n\nOver almost seven years of follow-up, those taking the higher dose statin had greater reductions in LDL cholesterol compared with those taking the lower dose.\n\nThe reduction in LDL cholesterol from the higher dose ended up decreasing the risk of a major cardiac event by 6 percent, the researchers found, although the statistic in itself was not clinically significant.\n\nThe researchers noted that the higher dose of Zocor (simvastatin) did result in a risk of a muscle disease 10 times higher than that associated with the lower dose. The muscle disease, known as myopathy, can cause pain, weakness, and in its rare but most severe form, destruction of the muscle tissue leading to kidney failure. Researchers found that two cases of myopathy occurred with the low dose and 53 cases with the higher dose.\n\nResearchers also found that rhabdomyolysis -- the most severe form of the muscle disease associated with statins -- was diagnosed in seven participants given 80 mg of Zocor (simvastatin), compared to none who were given 20 mg of simvastatin. Two died within a few weeks of developing the disorder, with one cause of death mentioning the muscle disorder as a contributing factor.\n\nResearchers also found that seven participants had creatine kinase levels higher than 40 times the upper limit of normal -- a possible indicator of kidney damage. For this reason, they noted that the incidence of severe muscle disease on 80 mg of Zocor might be an \"underestimate.\"\n\nBaigent noted this side effect is one associated with Zocor, but taking lower doses of other, more powerful statins may alleviate the problem. \"There are newer ways of increasing LDL cholesterol reduction by using the newer, more potent statins such a Lipitor or Crestor,\" he said. (All statins carry the risk of myopathy, but lower dosages are associated with a reduced risk.)\n\nBernard M.Y. Cheung, from the University of Hong Kong and coauthor of an accompanying journal editorial, said that \"people who are at risk from heart attacks and strokes should have their LDL-cholesterol lowered intensively.\"\n\nTheir doctors should consider prescribing a statin, either at a high dose or using a more powerful statin, he said.\n\n\"If you are at risk from a heart attack or stroke, either because you have had these conditions before or because you have the risk factors for them, you should be considered for intensive treatment to lower the LDL cholesterol,\" Cheung said.\n\n\"If your blood cholesterol is raised but you do not have other risk factors for heart disease and stroke, then your doctor may well decide that you do not need to take any drugs to lower cholesterol,\" he said. \"But if you are at risk from those diseases, you would need intensive treatment to lower LDL cholesterol, even if your LDL cholesterol level is not very high,\" he added.\n\nCommenting on the studies, Dr. Gregg Fonarow, American Heart Association spokesman and professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that \"despite the proven benefits of LDL cholesterol-lowering with statin therapy, many physicians have been reluctant to prescribe and patients reluctant to take higher doses of more potent statin medications due to concerns about side effects or safety.\"\n\nLowering LDL cholesterol by 50 to 60 percent with potent statins such as atorvastatin at 80 mg or rosuvastatin at 20 to 40 mg lowers the risk of major cardiovascular events by 50 to 60 percent, he said.\n\n\"Most patients tolerate higher doses of more potent statins equally well as lower doses of less potent statins,\" Fonarow said. \"Millions of patients with or at high risk of cardiovascular disease, who would derive additional cardiovascular protection from higher doses of more potent statins, are not currently treated with these agents. But [they] should be.\"\n\nFor more information on statins, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story included comments from one source beyond those involved in the study and accompanying editorial.

The print edition is scheduled to be published in August.\n\nWhile preliminary studies have suggested a link between meditation, a sense of spirituality or faith and the risk of Alzheimer's disease, the article's author, Dharma Singh Khalsa, M.D., states that a cultivation of higher levels of psycho-social well-being, such as independence, resilience and life purpose represents \"an important new frontier that deserves further research as it is freely available to anyone, anytime, anywhere.\"\n\nThe article reviews decades of research into the impact that various meditation techniques have had on the prevention of Alzheimer's disease, focusing on one evidence-based practice that Khalsa says can be a powerful part of any Alzheimer's prevention and spiritual fitness program, Kirtan Kriya (KK), a meditation technique which has been successfully used to improve memory in studies of people with subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment.\n\nKhalsa's article highlights the principles and practices of this 12-minute meditation, with corresponding SPECT scans showing how it successfully activates the posterior cingulate gyrus, an important region of the brain that helps regulate memory and emotional function.

Survival was shown to be greatest among those prescribed first-generation nonselective beta-blockers. According to The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center investigators, the drugs block the effects of stress pathways involved in tumor growth and spread. With further research, they may also prove beneficial in conjunction with other treatment regimens and across other cancer types.\n\nPublished today in the journal CANCER, the findings are the result of a multi-institutional retrospective analysis of the medical records of 1,425 women with ovarian cancer treated between 2000 and 2010. Researchers compared overall survival among patients with documented beta-blocker use during chemotherapy and those without. Among the 269 patients who received beta-blockers, 193 (71.7 percent) received beta-1-adrenergic receptor selective agents (SBBs) and the remaining patients received nonselective beta antagonists (NSBBs). The research team found:\n\u2022 For patients receiving any beta-blocker, the median overall survival was 47.8 months versus 42 months for nonusers.\n\u2022 Median overall survival based on beta-blocker receptor selectivity was 94.9 months for those receiving NSBBs versus 38 months for those receiving SBBs.\n\u2022 Even among patients with hypertension, a longer median overall survival was observed among users of NSBBs compared with nonusers (90 months versus 38.2 months).\n\nThis study builds on a large body of research by principal investigator Anil Sood, M.D., professor in Gynecologic Medical Oncology and Cancer Biology at MD Anderson. It showed that stress hormones fuel progression of ovarian and other cancers, and that beta-blockers - among the most proven drugs in cardiovascular medicine - might be a new way to stifle that effect.\n\n\"Beta-blockers treat a variety of conditions, such as heart disease, high-blood pressure, glaucoma and migraines. They target a receptor protein in heart muscle that causes the heart to beat harder and faster when activated by stress hormones,\" Sood said. \"Our research has shown that the same stress mechanisms impact ovarian cancer progression, so these drugs could play a new role in cancer treatment.\"\n\nAccording to Sood, the usefulness of beta-blockers was unclear until now. \"The ability to show improved survival using nonselective agents - which inhibit a specific stress pathway - is the culmination of years of research into ovarian cancer biology and pathogenesis.\"\n\nHe added that beta-blocker users in the study presented at a higher stage of disease, had an increased average BMI and were more likely to be hypertensive. All these factors were associated with decreased survival, yet those who received beta-blockers had either equivalent or improved overall survival. Further examination revealed that NSBB users had improved overall survival regardless of the presence of such prognostic factors or comorbidities. This was not true for patients who took SBBs.\n\nAlthough further study is needed, these results highlight the importance of adrenergic receptor-\u03b22 (ADRB2), a signaling pathway important to ovarian carcinogenesis and targeted by NSBBs (versus the ADRB1 pathway targeted by SBBs).\n\nOvarian cancer is the 5th most deadly cancer among women, accounting for more deaths than any other female reproductive system cancer. An estimated 21,290 new cases are diagnosed, and some 14,180 women die from the disease each year in the U.S., according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nFuture trials will seek to identify patients who would benefit most from beta-blocker use and the best beta-blocker for a specific tumor type based on adrenergic receptor expression. Then they potentially could be used as an adjuvant therapy during surgical recovery and chemotherapy to decrease tumor growth, delays in wound healing and metastasis. Beta-blockers may also reduce cancer-related psychological distress in newly diagnosed patients, according to the study authors.\n\nThere are currently two clinical trials, one led by MD Anderson, evaluating the combination of chemotherapy and propranolol (a type of NSBB) on cancer biology and on stress modulators in patients with newly diagnosed EOC. According to Sood, the preliminary data from these feasibility trials will be used to design prospective, randomized clinical trials examining NSBBs on patient outcomes.\n\n\"The stratification of patients by beta-blocker use and selectivity in this study makes it unique among all other studies examining the impact of these drugs on cancer. It also builds on the mounting evidence that beta-blockers may become a key treatment component for many patients in the future,\" said Sood.\n\nPortions of this study were supported by National Institutes of Health grants (CA140933, CA104825, CA109298, P50CA083639, U54CA151688, U54CA96300, U54CA96297, and CA016672), an Ovarian Cancer Research Fund program Project Development Grant, the Department of Defense (grants OC073399, W81XWJ-10-0158, and OC100237), the Betty Ann Asche Murray Distinguished Professorship, the RGK Foundation, the Gilder Foundation, the Blanton-Davis Ovarian Cancer Research Program, and a Gynecologic Cancer Foundation-St. Louis Ovarian Cancer Awareness grant.

Most of those trials were funded and run by the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture Prozac and Effexor \u2014 Eli Lilly and Wyeth, respectively.\n\nThey included 12 studies of Prozac in adults and four each in elderly patients and youth, as well as 21 trials of immediate- or extended-release Effexor in adults. About 9,000 participants were included.\n\nMore adults and kids taking Prozac, known generically as fluoxetine, had at least a 50 percent improvement in scores on depression tests after six weeks compared to those assigned to take a placebo pill.\n\nFifty-five percent of adults on Prozac responded to treatment, compared to 34 percent in the placebo group. In youth, 30 percent on Prozac had significant symptom improvement, compared to just six percent of the comparisons.\n\nThe benefits were seen regardless of how severe patients\u2019 symptoms were before starting treatment.\n\nHowever, in the elderly the differences between the treatment and placebo groups were much smaller, and the researchers calculated that 17 older patients would have to be treated with Prozac for one to gain from it.\n\n\u201cClearly the efficacy of antidepressants is age-dependent, (and) largest, most interestingly, in youth, which I don\u2019t think would be the mainstream view in psychiatry,\u201d Gibbons told Reuters Health.\n\nThe findings, he added, \u201craise other questions that need to be followed up (including), what\u2019s going on in the elderly?\u201d\n\nBoth types of Effexor, or venlafaxine, also seemed to help adults with mild to severe depression, with slightly more patients responding to the immediate-release dose.\n\nSome of the study\u2019s authors have testified for or received funding from drug companies, though the report itself was funded by national health agencies.\n\nThe researchers said they couldn\u2019t be sure there would be similar improvements with other types of antidepressants \u2014 especially given the more limited data in kids and the elderly \u2014 or that the longer-term benefits would be as clear.\n\nOne recent study suggested that up to a fifth of patients on the antidepressant Cymbalta (duloxetine) might actually benefit more from placebo pills (see Reuters Health story of December 9, 2011.)\n\nIrving Kirsch, who studies antidepressants and placebos at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said the new report didn\u2019t make him more optimistic about the drugs.\n\nIf five or more patients need to be treated with an antidepressant for one to substantially improve, most don\u2019t get much out of it, he pointed out.\n\n\u201cMore than 80 percent of the patients are not getting a significant benefit from the drug \u2014 either they\u2019re not getting better or they would get the same benefit with placebo,\u201d he told Reuters Health.\n\n\u201cThere are alternative treatments for depression that also produce about the same symptom reduction as the drugs do, but without the risk of side effects,\u201d Kirsch added, including psychotherapy and exercise.\n\nStill, Gibbons said that the improvement in symptoms for the average patient wasn\u2019t insignificant.\n\n\u201cDefinitely it doesn\u2019t look like antidepressants are placebos,\u201d he concluded.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story interviewed Irving Kirsch, frequently cited/quoted on antidepressant research issues.\nIt also did a good job of noting potential conflicts of interest.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "\"For the first time in my life I felt like a normal person,\" says Josh Thayer, who dropped from 367 pounds to 230 within a year of undergoing gastric bypass surgery in 1998. No longer did he always have to buy the aisle seat at the theater because \"you feel guilty hanging over the person sitting next to you.\" No longer did he have to endure humiliations such as breaking a chair at his brother's wedding.\n\nThe best part, says Thayer, a Boston area professor, was not having to \"think about food for the first time in my life. It was fantastic. I ate when I was hungry, stopped when I was full. I didn't feel like I was fighting an uphill battle.\"\n\nUntil five years later, when the weight started creeping back on.\n\nWhen the 6-foot Thayer edged up to 310 earlier this year at age 45, he decided to go for a second operation: adjustable banding, more commonly known as lap-band surgery, which allows for repeated stomach-tightening and thereby offers a new opportunity for reining in appetite. Reactions to his decision vary, he says. While some people close to him worry about his going under the knife again, others have asked, \"What the hell did you do wrong?\"\n\nSecond surgeries to combat obesity are on the rise. The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery doesn't keep statistics on repeat customers, but obesity surgeons are reporting upticks. Dennis Halmi, a member of the Bluepoint Surgical Group in Woodbridge, says that in 2002 \"we did a handful\" of second operations on obesity patients, \"maybe five, six. This year we are doing probably 30.\" Scott Shikora of Tufts Medical Center in Boston says that until recently he hadn't performed a second obesity operation on anybody but is already up to about a half-dozen patients. Thayer was one of them.\n\nGeorge Fielding, whose obesity surgery practice at the NYU Medical Center in New York has gone from two or three second operations in 2004 to \"probably 20 or 25 this year,\" isn't surprised at the trend. \"There was a huge surge in gastric bypass from 1998 to 2001,\" he says. \"Going into the early 2000s, everyone thought the gastric bypass was the best thing since Eric Clapton picked up a guitar. Then they went and hid, then they came in for help.\"\n\nThe second time around, many, like Thayer, are opting for the adjustable band, which works differently from the bypass. With a bypass, 95 percent of the stomach is closed off with a stapling device. What could once stretch to the size of a football is reduced to the size of an egg that can't hold more than a tablespoon or two of food. In addition, the small intestine, where food goes when it leaves the stomach, is cut into two pieces. The lower piece, two to three feet down from the upper piece, is connected to the new, tiny stomach pouch. Thus, when food empties from the stomach, it bypasses a few feet of upper intestine, which means that fewer nutrients (including fewer calories) are absorbed by the body.\n\nObesity surgeons, Fielding included, report a high success rate for the bypass. Bypass patients lose some 60 to 80 percent of their excess weight, and 60 to 80 percent of those patients keep off at least two-thirds of the weight they lose. Such people often experience a near-complete reversal of diabetes, sleep apnea, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, arthritis pain and a host of other health-compromising problems, frequently going from several prescription drugs a day to none.\n\nThe thing is, for about 20 to 40 percent of patients, the operation fails over the long term. It's not always clear why. In a number of people, the stomach pouch softens, as does the opening between the stomach and the small intestine. That allows more food through more quickly, and the person's old level of hunger begins to return. As Joseph Moresca, a New York nurse who initially went from 440 pounds to 220 with a bypass, put it, \"instead of being able to eat a quarter of a sandwich, I was eating three-quarters of a sandwich.\" He regained 45 pounds by the time he decided to go for banding.\n\nIn contrast to the bypass, the band does its work by separating the stomach into two parts: a tiny upper pouch and a larger pouch below the band. The tighter the band, the more slowly food goes from the upper part of the stomach to the lower, reducing hunger dramatically. The operation is far safer than bypass surgery because organs are not being cut and sewn. In addition, there's no nutrient malabsorption as there is with the bypass, because the small intestine is left intact; banding patients do not have to take nutrient supplements for the rest of their lives, the way bypass patients do.\n\nBut the biggest difference is that when hunger starts to return, the banding patient can go in to his doctor's office for a tightening. The band is shaped like a little life preserver that can fill and go slack. Saline solution injected into it through a portal just beneath the skin makes it more taut. The tighter the band, the less hungry you are, the less food you can get down comfortably, and the less you eat.\n\nBut in that advantage lies the band's disadvantage. If the patient doesn't go in for adjustments, the whole thing won't work. Also, you can eat around, or rather, through, the band. Ice cream shakes and other very soft or liquid foods can go through even a tight band, and every obesity surgeon can point to band patients who have sabotaged their operations by eating foods that slip right through. The ability to control the tightness is presumably part of the reason that patients who opt for banding lose less weight, at least initially, than gastric bypass patients -- an average of 50 to 65 percent of their excess weight in the first three years.\n\nAnother difference between the band and the bypass that proves both a plus and a minus is that the band doesn't cause the dumping syndrome. That's an often frightening attack of sweating, nausea, faintness, diarrhea, cramps and rapid pulse that bypass patients sometimes suffer after eating just a bite of a sugary food -- a deterrent to consuming certain calorie-dense items.\n\nOf course, a second obesity surgery comes with increased risk. After a gastric bypass, there's often scarring that causes organs to adhere to one another. \"The liver, stomach, spleen and diaphragm -- they all get drawn in together in a big blob of scar,\" says NYU surgeon Fielding. Thayer says his banding operation, which would typically take about an hour, kept him under general anesthesia for 3 1/2 hours because his surgeon \"ran into a lot of adhesions.\"\n\nAlong with the risk comes the uncertainty of how well people will be able to lose -- and keep off -- weight the second time around. Not enough time has elapsed since the advent of second operations to get a long-term assessment.\n\nWhat obesity surgeons do feel confident saying is that no matter which type of surgery is chosen, and whether it's the first or second time, the patient has to meet the operation halfway. You \"still have to follow some semblance of dietary compliance,\" says Tufts's Shikora. \"You also have to be more physically active, take care of your health. And you have to follow up.\"\n\nIn other words, anyone who sees obesity surgery as a solution in itself is chasing weight-loss rainbows.\n\nThayer, who was down 30 pounds a month after having had his band inserted, gets it. \"You still have to diet,\" he says. \"You still have to commit to an exercise plan.\" No obesity operation is \"a magic bullet.\" But what he misses is that the bypass operation initially let him maintain his weight loss without putting extraordinary focus on his efforts.\n\nLike a lot of other obese people, he says, he \"had always been a person who could lose 100 pounds. I did it many, many times. The problem is, I'm not a great maintainer.\" The bypass, at least at first, let him not only achieve but also maintain the weight loss without thinking much about it. \"I didn't have to count calories. I exercised,o but I didn't have to exercise two hours a day in order to stay at that weight.\"\n\nHe wants the new procedure to return his appetite to a more manageable level so that it helps the pounds stay off. \"I'm hoping that this band will not allow me to eat a whole pizza anymore,\" he says. \"Last summer I was able to eat a whole pizza again, and I was like, this can't be right.\"\n\nLarry Lindner's latest book is \"Fighting Weight\" (HarperCollins), co-authored with George Fielding, Christine Ren and Khaliah Ali, Muhammad Ali's daughter, whose weight loss is the subject of the book.

Common warning signs include snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness. One treatment option for sleep apnea is PAP therapy, which uses mild levels of air pressure, provided through a mask, to keep the throat open while you sleep.\n\nThe study involved 2,027 patients with sleep apnea who began PAP therapy between Jan. 1, 2010, and Dec. 31, 2014. Participants had a mean age of 56 years, and about 54 percent were men. General quality of life measures, such as mobility and usual activity, were assessed using the European Quality of Life-5D (EQ-5D) questionnaire. Sleep-specific quality of life was examined with the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), which assesses the effect of sleep disorders and excessive daytime sleepiness on activities of daily living such as productivity and intimacy. Scores before and after up to one year of PAP therapy were compared.\n\nResults also show that older patients and those in a higher socioeconomic subgroup had better quality of life measures after PAP therapy.\n\n\"Our study also serves as a basis for targeted efforts to optimize quality of life in younger adults and lower socioeconomic subgroups,\" said Walia. \"This information will guide clinicians in terms of expected quality of life outcomes with sleep apnea treatment.\" The American Academy of Sleep Medicine previously identified quality of life as one of three sleep apnea outcome measures that clinicians can track to optimize care for adult patients. Implementation of a quality assurance program to track these quality measures can help improve patient outcomes, reduce the public health burden of sleep apnea, and provide a measurable standard for evaluating and managing sleep apnea.\n\nThe study was funded by a scholar award from the Cleveland Clinic Neurological Institute-Center of Research Outcomes and Evaluation and by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nFor a copy of the study, \"Impact of Sleep-Disordered Breathing Treatment on Quality of Life Measures in a Large Clinic-Based Cohort,\" or to arrange an interview with a study author or an AASM spokesperson, please contact the AASM at 630-737-9700 or media@aasm.org.\n\nThe monthly, peer-reviewed Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine is the official publication of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, a professional membership society that improves sleep health and promotes high quality, patient-centered care through advocacy, education, strategic research, and practice standards.

The drug is approved for use with a companion diagnostic, the LeukoStrat CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay, which is used to detect the FLT3 mutation in patients with AML.\n\n \n\nAML is a rapidly progressing cancer that forms in the bone marrow and results in an increased number of white blood cells in the bloodstream. The National Cancer Institute estimated that approximately 19,930 people would be diagnosed with AML in 2016 and 10,430 were projected to die of the disease.\n\n\u201cRydapt is the first targeted therapy to treat patients with AML, in combination with chemotherapy,\u201d said Richard Pazdur, M.D., acting director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and director of the FDA\u2019s Oncology Center of Excellence. \u201cThe ability to detect the gene mutation with a diagnostic test means doctors can identify specific patients who may benefit from this treatment.\u201d\n\nRydapt is a kinase inhibitor that works by blocking several enzymes that promote cell growth. If the FLT3 mutation is detected in blood or bone marrow samples using the LeukoStrat CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay, the patient may be eligible for treatment with Rydapt in combination with chemotherapy.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Rydapt for patients with AML were studied in a randomized trial of 717 patients who had not been treated previously for AML. In the trial, patients who received Rydapt in combination with chemotherapy lived longer than patients who received chemotherapy alone, although a specific median survival rate could not be reliably estimated. In addition, patients who received Rydapt in combination with chemotherapy in the trial went longer (median 8.2 months) without certain complications (failure to achieve complete remission within 60 days of starting treatment, progression of leukemia or death) than patients who received chemotherapy alone (median three months).\n\nCommon side effects of Rydapt in patients with AML include low levels of white blood cells with fever (febrile neutropenia), nausea, inflammation of the mucous membranes (mucositis), vomiting, headache, spots on the skin due to bleeding (petechiae), musculoskeletal pain, nosebleeds (epistaxis), device-related infection, high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) and upper respiratory tract infection. Rydapt should not be used in patients with hypersensitivity to midostaurin or other ingredients in Rydapt. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take Rydapt because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or a newborn baby. Patients who experience signs or symptoms of lung damage (pulmonary toxicity) should stop using Rydapt.\n\nRydapt was also approved today for adults with certain types of rare blood disorders (aggressive systemic mastocytosis, systemic mastocytosis with associated hematological neoplasm or mast cell leukemia). Common side effects of Rydapt in these patients include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, swelling (edema), musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, constipation, fever, headache and shortness of breath.\n\nThe FDA granted this application Priority Review, Fast Track (for the mastocytosis indication) and Breakthrough Therapy (for the AML indication) designations.\n\nThe FDA granted the approval of Rydapt to Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.

The number of women taking them early in pregnancy is unknown but probably is small, the study suggests.\n\nACE inhibitors are the second-most commonly prescribed class of pharmaceuticals in the United States, with 149 million prescriptions dispensed last year. They came on the market 25 years ago.\n\n\"It would be important for a pregnant woman and her health-care provider to be aware of this, so they can identify an alternative medicine to treat her hypertension,\" said William O. Cooper, a pediatrician at Vanderbilt Children's Hospital who headed the study, published in today's New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nExposure to ACE inhibitors early in pregnancy nearly tripled the risk of birth defects, the study showed. \"We all believe that we want to see more data. But this is important enough and impressive enough to tell people about,\" said Robert Temple of the Food and Drug Administration, who spoke to reporters about the findings.\n\nThe agency will consider broadening the \"black box\" warning against taking ACE inhibitors late in pregnancy, he said. The message is that women trying to get pregnant should switch to a different blood-pressure drug, Temple said.\n\nOne-third of the defects involved the heart, one-quarter the limbs or face, and one-tenth the brain or spinal cord, the study found. Many defects, especially the heart problems, are curable with surgery or other treatment. Others, however, cause permanent disability or retardation.\n\nCooper and his colleagues looked at 29,507 births to women covered by Medicaid in Tennessee between 1985 and 2000.\n\nOf that group, 209 babies were born to women who took an ACE inhibitor, and 18 had birth defects. Among 202 babies born to mothers taking some other blood-pressure medication, four had defects. The fraction of babies with defects was 7.1 percent in the ACE-inhibitor group; 1.7 percent in the other anti-hypertensive group; and 2.6 percent in the group taking no blood-pressure medication.\n\nThat such an effect was first noticed a quarter-century after ACE inhibitors arrived on the market points up the lack of data about the effect of drugs in pregnancy.\n\nAll new drugs are tested on pregnant animals to see whether they cause malformations, but those tests can be misleading. It's considered unethical to include pregnant women in studies of new drugs unless the medication is intended to treat pregnancy-related conditions.\n\nAs a consequence, the labels on nearly all medications carry a statement saying their safety to fetuses has not been established.\n\n\"I think it is safe to say that not a lot is known about the options for women in pregnancy,\" said Sandra L. Kweder of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.\n\nStudies of large databases such as Medicare records or registries that enroll pregnant women already taking particular drugs are the chief ways to discover and measure possible risks to the fetus from prescription drugs.\n\nIncreasingly, the FDA is seeking such data. It paid for the ACE-inhibitor study with help from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

It is the most common cause of job-related disability. Low back pain affects men and women equally.\n\nMost back pain is short-term, but about 20 percent of people affected by acute low back pain go on to develop chronic low back pain lasting a year or more. A compressed and herniated disk, in which the rubbery cushion between vertebrae impinges on and irritates nearby nerves, is a major cause of low back pain that can radiate to the legs.\n\n\"The nerve root is a sensitive structure that when pinched becomes inflamed and causes pain,\" said lead investigator Alessandro Napoli M.D., Ph.D., an interventional radiologist at Sapienza University of Rome. \"The body reacts with muscle constriction, which decreases the distance between vertebrae, and a vicious cycle is created.\"\n\nThe single-center prospective study included 80 patients experiencing at least three months of low back pain due to a herniated disk that had not responded to conservative treatments including exercise and medication.\n\nThe patients underwent a minimally invasive interventional radiology procedure in which, with the help of CT imaging, a needle is guided to the location of the bulging disc and nerve root. A probe is then inserted through the needle tip and delivers pulsed radiofrequency energy to the area over a 10-minute period. Even without touching the disc, the pulsation serves to resolve the herniation.\n\n\"The probe delivers a gentle electrical energy, so there's no thermal damage,\" Dr. Napoli said. \"The results have been extraordinary. Patients have been relieved of pain and resumed their normal activities within a day.\"\n\nOf the 80 patients treated, 81 percent were pain free one year after a single 10-minute treatment session. Six patients required a second pulsed radiofrequency session. Ninety percent of the patients were able to avoid surgical treatment.\n\n\"Following this treatment, inflammation and pain go away. With relaxation of the muscles, the distance between the vertebrae returns,\" Dr. Napoli explained.\n\nDr. Napoli said no patients experienced side effects after receiving the minimally invasive outpatient treatment.\n\n\"There's a big gap between conservative treatments for disc compression and herniation and surgical repair, which can lead to infection, bleeding and a long recovery period,\" Dr. Napoli said. \"Evolving technologies like this image-guided treatment may help a substantial number of patients avoid surgery.\"\n\nNote: Copies of RSNA 2017 news releases and electronic images will be available online at RSNA.org/press17 beginning Monday, Nov. 27.\n\nRSNA is an association of over 54,000 radiologists, radiation oncologists, medical physicists and related scientists, promoting excellence in patient care and health care delivery through education, research and technologic innovation.

The announcement does not affect Avastin's status as an approved therapy for lung cancer, kidney cancer, colorectal cancer and brain cancer.\n\nReflecting splits in the medical community, the European Medicines Agency said Thursday that Avastin would remain an approved therapy for breast cancer in European Union countries, although only in one particular combination: with the drug paclitaxel.\n\nAvastin, first approved as a cancer treatment in 2004, helps by inhibiting a tumor's blood supply. In 2008, the FDA granted Avastin what's known as accelerated approval of its use as a therapy for metastatic breast cancer -- cancer that has spread from one part of the body to another. The move was based on data in one preliminary study known as E2100. At that time, researchers reported that Avastin, when used in combination with other drugs, extended the time that patients went without their illness getting worse, a measure known as progression-free survival, or PFS.\n\nAlong with the initial approval, the FDA required Genentech, Avastin's maker, to complete larger studies. The results of those studies were a bitter pill for patients thriving on Avastin and researchers excited by the promise of the early data. The E2100 study found that for women taking Avastin plus paclitaxel, the cancer stopped spreading for an average of five-and-a-half months more, compared to those just taking standard chemotherapy. In the subsequent three larger studies, the benefit was much smaller, ranging from just 24 days to about two months.\n\nNone of the studies, including the E2100 study, showed that patients getting Avastin lived longer than patients on standard chemotherapies. \"We now have four studies that show no survival benefit,\" Woodcock said.\n\nAlong with those disappointing findings, serious side effects became apparent in patients taking Avastin, including high blood pressure, internal bleeding, perforated internal organs, heart failure and heart attacks, and in some cases, even swelling of the brain.\n\nBased on the new data, an FDA advisory panel voted 12-1 to reverse the accelerated approval in July.\n\nThursday's announcement is only a first step in removing the FDA's approval for this drug in treating breast cancer patients. As part of the complex process, Genentech has a right to appeal, and company spokeswoman Charlotte Arnold said it would request a hearing to press its case.\n\nPhysicians who favor Avastin's use say the FDA is being overly cautious, and that the drug can be used safely if patients are closely monitored.\n\n\"This is a very sad and confusing day for our patients,\" said Dr. Joseph Sparano of Montefiore-Einstein Center for Cancer Care in New York. \"Survival was consistently better at one year in all of the studies, indicating that this is a safe and effective option. What makes this even more frustrating is that the drug will still be available to prescribe, but will only be an option for those who can afford it rather than those who really need it.\"\n\nAvastin's cost, which can run to several thousand dollars a month, has sometimes been used as an example by critics of the health care system who fear that cost-cutting may win out over patient care. After the advisory committee's decision in July, Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, wrote a letter to the FDA complaining that \"the (FDA advisory) committee's concerns appear to have been based on cost-effectiveness,\" and adding that a reversal on accelerated approval would amount to \"cost-rationing.\"\n\nThe FDA says it does not consider cost when evaluating the safety or effectiveness of a drug.\n\nDr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, said it's clear that \"some women with metastatic breast cancer have benefited from Avastin, but others not only have not benefited, they've been harmed.\n\n\"What we clearly need is a way for doctors to more accurately predict which women will have a better chance of benefitting from this important targeted therapy,\" he said in a statement on the American Cancer Society website.\n\nThursday, Woodcock held out the possibility that Avastin might eventually prove helpful in a targeted group of patients. \"We certainly hope that additional data could be generated to see if there is a subset of tumors (that would respond more than others),\" she said. \"The FDA stands ready to work with Genentech on future studies.\"\n\nSuch research is already underway, Arnold said, but it's too early to discuss the findings.\n\n\"This is something Genentech is very committed to. Our scientists are dedicated to learning more about who might derive a greater benefit from Avastin,\" she explained.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "There was some room for improvement here.

[Brown University] -- To the tantalizing delight of chocolate lovers everywhere, a number of recent studies employing various methods have suggested that compounds in cocoa called flavanols could benefit cardiovascular health. Now a systematic review and meta-analysis of 19 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of cocoa consumption reveals some further pieces of supporting evidence.\n\nThe meta-analysis in the Journal of Nutrition, an assessment of the combined evidence from all 19 RCTs, focused on whether consumption of flavanol-rich cocoa products was associated with improvements in specific circulating biomarkers of cardiometabolic health as compared to consuming placebos with negligible cocoa flavanol content. In all, 1,139 volunteers were involved in these trials.\n\n\"Our meta-analysis of RCTs characterizes how cocoa flavanols affect cardiometabolic biomarkers, providing guidance in designing large, definitive prevention trials against diabetes and cardiovascular disease in future work,\" said corresponding author Dr. Simin Liu, professor and director of the Center for Global Cardiometabolic Health at Brown University who worked with epidemiology graduate student and lead author Xiaochen Lin. \"We found that cocoa flavanol intake may reduce dyslipidemia (elevated triglycerides), insulin resistance and systemic inflammation, which are all major subclinical risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases.\"\n\nLiu noted some limitations in the trials. All studies were small and of short duration, not all of the biomarkers tracked in these studies changed for the better, and none of the studies were designed to test directly whether cocoa flavanol consumption leads to reduced cases of heart attacks or type 2 diabetes.\n\nBut taking into account some of these heterogeneities across studies, the team's meta-analysis summarizing data from 19 trials found potential beneficial effects of flavanol-rich cocoa on cardiometabolic health. There were small-to-modest but statistically significant improvements among those who ate flavanol-rich cocoa product vs. those who did not.\n\nThe greatest effects were seen among trial volunteers who ate between 200 and 600 milligrams of flavanols a day (based on their cocoa consumption). They saw significant declines in blood glucose and insulin, as well as another indicator of insulin resistance called HOMA-IR. They also saw an increase in HDL, or \"good,\" cholesterol. Those consuming higher doses saw some of the insulin resistance benefits and a drop in triglycerides, but not a significant increase in HDL. Those with lower doses of flavanols only saw a significant HDL benefit.\n\nIn general, Lin said, where there were benefits they were evident for both women and men and didn't depend on what physical form the flavanol-rich cocoa product was consumed in --dark chocolate vs. a beverage, for example.\n\n\"The treatment groups of the trials included in our meta-analysis are primarily dark chocolate -- a few were using cocoa powder-based beverages,\" Lin said. \"Therefore, the findings from the current study apparently shouldn't be generalized to different sorts of chocolate candies or white chocolates, of which the content of sugar/food additives could be substantially higher than that of the dark chocolate.\"\n\nThe authors therefore concluded, \"Our study highlights the urgent need for large, long-term RCTs that improve our understanding of how the short-term benefits of cocoa flavanol intake on cardiometabolic biomarkers may be translated into clinical outcomes.\"\n\nIn addition to Lin and Liu, the study's other authors are Isabel Zhang, Alina Li from Brown University, JoAnn Manson, Howard Sesso and Lu Wang from Brigham and Women's Hospital.\n\nThe authors acknowledge funding from the National Institutes of Health including the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, the American Heart Association, and Pfizer.

The results, published in the June 23, 2017, online edition of The Laryngoscope, may transform how doctors approach cochlear implant procedures to give patients the best possible outcomes.\n\nCochlear implants help preserve hearing in patients with nerve deafness who cannot benefit from hearing aids. They are surgically placed in the inner ear to convert sound waves into electrical signals that stimulate the auditory nerve to provide hearing.\n\n\"This is the largest clinical study done in the world on conventional electrodes and will have major implications for doctors and their patients who need their long-term hearing restored,\" said the study's lead investigator, George Wanna, MD, Site Chair, Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai (NYEE) and Mount Sinai Beth Israel; Chief, Division of Otology-Neurotology and Director of the Center for Hearing and Balance and Ear Institute at Mount Sinai Health System. \"This study is a breakthrough for patients with hearing loss, and improvements in practice and techniques will allow them to enjoy many hearing benefits such as music enjoyment, listening in complex environments, and sound localization.\"\n\nDr. Wanna and a team of researchers from Vanderbilt University examined roughly 230 patients with every type of cochlear implant, including three FDA-approved implants that use different types of electrodes to stimulate the auditory nerve. They found that electrodes designed with no wire (called lateral wall electrodes) performed the best in maintaining residual hearing in the inner ear, compared to electrodes made with wire. More specifically, the non-wire electrodes were less traumatic, causing less injury and minimizing fractures inside the inner ear. The study found that the actual brand of the electrode did not make a difference; the presence or absence of wire was the only distinguishing factor.\n\nDr. Wanna and the researchers also looked at the impact of two major surgical approaches used to insert the electrodes in the inner ear: \"round window\" (where surgeons open the membrane without bone removal or drilling in the inner ear) and \"cochleostomy\" (which requires drilling into the bone to get inside the inner ear). They reported that patients who had the round window approach had a much better chance of keeping their residual hearing in the long term.\n\n\"The cochleostomy approach causes fibrosis and scarring, leading to hearing loss over time,\" said Dr. Wanna. \"Our results also revealed that using oral steroids also helped in the long term to preserve hearing by preventing inflammation.\"\n\n\"We hope the findings will help surgeons choose the best implants and approaches for their patients,\" said Dr. Wanna. \"This is an exciting time in this field, and the advancement in hearing technology and continued improvements in techniques and outcomes will benefit patients and their families.\"\n\nThis research was supported by the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders the National Center for Advanced Translational Sciences.\n\nThe Mount Sinai Health System is an integrated health system committed to providing distinguished care, conducting transformative research, and advancing biomedical education.

But if a pregnant woman becomes infected, the virus can target neural progenitor cells in her fetus, putting the infant at risk of being born with microcephaly. This is where the head develops smaller than normal.\n\nThe study showed that a live-attenuated Zika vaccine (containing a weakened version of the virus that does not cause disease in humans) could selectively infect and kill human glioblastoma stem cells, explained Shi. That\u2019s because glioblastoma stem cells have similar properties to neural stem cells.\n\nTo investigate whether ZIKV-LAV, a vaccine developed at the University of Texas shown to protect mice and non-human primates against the virus, could kill human glioblastoma stem cells, the scientists injected a combination of glioblastoma stem cells from two human donors and the vaccine into mice.\n\nThe animals dosed only with the stem cells developed tumors. But those injected with the combination lived to around 50 days, 20 days longer than the stem cell mice.\n\nWhen the team sequenced the RNA (a molecule that helps with gene expressions) of glioblastoma stem cells exposed to the vaccine and then those which weren\u2019t, they found the virus prompted an antiviral reaction in the exposed cells in what is known as an oncolytic response.\n\nBefore undergoing surgery, cancer patients could be given the Zika vaccine to \"let the viruses hunt down the GSCs [glioblastoma stem cells] and eliminate them,\u201d said virologist Dr. Cheng-Feng Qin of the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences in Beijing, who worked on the study.\n\nShi said: \u201cScientists may turn the 'bad' side of a devastating pathogen\u2014Zika virus\u2014for potential cancer therapy.\u201d\n\nHowever, he cautioned any potential treatment which could emerge from the study is far from being rolled out.\n\n\u201cWe still need to further improve the specificity of the cancer-killing ability, while retain the safety of the vaccine strain,\u201d Shi explained. \u201cFor example, we need to make sure that the therapeutic vaccine virus does not infect and kill normal neurons in humans.\u201d\n\nDr. Harry Bulstrode, brain tumor expert funded by the charity Cancer Research U.K. who is researching how Zika could be used to treat aggressive brain tumors, who was not involved in the study, told Newsweek: \"This study is another interesting piece in the jigsaw, but it is never going to demonstrate what we believe to be the really exciting properties of the virus.

Equally problematic are the decisions to stop play or activities, or when patients who have suffered a concussion can safely return to normal activities without risking further injury.\n\nIn the new study, researchers have demonstrated that a blood test can now accurately diagnose a concussion using a form of blood profiling known as metabolomics. Dr. Douglas Fraser, a physician in the Paediatric Critical Care Unit at Children's Hospital, London Health Sciences Centre and Lawson scientist, led the study with his co-investigator Mark Daley, a professor in the Departments of Computer Science, Biology and Statistics & Actuarial Sciences at Western University.\n\nIn the relatively inexpensive test, blood is drawn from an individual that may have suffered a concussion as the result of a sudden blow to the head (or from transmitted forces from a sudden blow to the body) within 72 hours of the incident. The scientists measure a panel of metabolites - small molecules that are the products of the body's metabolism - in the blood to search for distinct patterns that indicate a concussion has occurred.\n\n\"This novel approach, to use blood testing of metabolites as a diagnostic tool for concussions, was exploratory and we were extremely pleased with the robustness of our initial results,\" says Dr. Fraser, also an Associate Professor in Western's Departments of Paediatrics, Physiology & Pharmacology and Clinical Neurological Sciences at the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry. \"We looked at a host of patterns and it appears that those who suffered a concussion have a very different pattern than those who have not had a concussion.\"\n\nThis new method, fully funded by the Children's Health Foundation and conducted by the Western Concussion Study Group, is unique in that previous attempts have looked unsuccessfully for a single highly accurate protein biomarker that can distinguish concussed from non-concussed adolescent patients.\n\nIn this latest successful attempt, the researchers took a different approach and investigated a full spectrum of 174 metabolites.\n\n\"We looked at all of these metabolites in concussed male adolescent patients and in non-concussed male adolescent patients and it turns out that the spectrum is really different,\" explains Daley, who is also Western's Associate Vice-President (Research) and a principal investigator at Western's renowned Brain & Mind Institute. \"There is no one metabolite that we can put a finger on but when we looked at all of them, those profiles are different enough that we could easily distinguish concussed patients from non-concussed. In fact, with fine tuning we can now look at sets of as few as 20-40 specific metabolites and maintain the diagnostic accuracy level of the test over 90 per cent.\"\n\nConcussion is a major public health concern, often resulting in significant acute symptoms and in some individuals, long-term neurological dysfunction.\n\n\"The discovery of a blood test that can aid in concussion diagnosis is very important,\" says Dr. Fraser. \"With further research, we anticipate that our blood test will also aid clinicians in predicting concussion outcome, as well as aid rehabilitation after concussion.\"\n\nThe findings were recently published in the international journal Metabolomics.\n\nThe technology is subject to a patent application filed through WORLDiscoveries\u00ae, the joint technology transfer office of Lawson and Western.\n\n\"This relatively quick and inexpensive blood test for concussion is by far the most accurate reported with tremendous potential for clinical management and commercialization,\" says Kirk Brown, Manager of Business Development for Lawson.\n\nWestern delivers an academic experience second to none.

But diagnosing allergies can be tricky, and kids can outgrow them, too.\n\nNow, a new study sheds light on the effectiveness of a test called a food challenge to determine whether a person can tolerate a food they once reacted to.\n\nJula Cieciuch, a fifth-grader who lives in Telluride, Colo., recently took a food challenge to find out if she was still allergic to eggs.\n\nWhen she passed, she was ecstatic. After years of avoiding all foods with eggs, she was a bit shocked. \"For so long, it was: You can't eat this. You can't eat this,\" Jula says. \" I was very emotional!\"\n\nShe's also outgrown allergies to walnuts and almonds. \"It's a huge relief ... it has really opened up her diet \u2014 a lot,\" her mom, Kendall Cieciuch, told us. Once you can eat eggs, you can eat cakes and breads and frittatas, and lots of other baked goods.\n\nJula is still allergic to some foods, including milk and cashews, so she still needs to be careful. But Kendall says every time she's crossed a food off her allergy list, \"it makes life a little easier.\"\n\nJula Cieciuch's story is not uncommon. About 70 to 80 percent of children with an egg allergy will outgrow it. And about 20 percent of kids outgrow peanut allergies.\n\nIn Jula's case, her allergists at National Jewish Health in Denver, Colo., repeated the standard allergy blood tests last summer. That's when they realized she may have outgrown her egg allergy. \n\n \n\nThe blood test measures the levels of a certain type of antibody, immunoglobulin E (IgE). The higher the level, the more likely a person is to have an allergic reaction. Jula's blood revealed a drop in antibody count.\n\n \n\nBut the only way to confirm that it was safe for Jula to eat egg was to take the food challenge test. Basically, the test entails eating small quantities of the foods you've been allergic to. The testing is done under medical supervision.\n\n\"What they do is give you a really small dose, like a crumb, basically,\" explains Jula. Then after 20 minutes or so, if you don't have any reaction, \"you can take a dose that's a little bigger.\" If you can eat an entire egg, you pass.\n\nA new study published in the Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology illuminates just how many people come to find out they can eat foods they've long avoided. \n\n \n\n Researchers studied the results of about 6,300 food challenges. The tests were done in adults and children whom doctors suspected had become tolerant to foods they'd once reacted to.\n\n \n\n\"We found that 14 percent of the patients challenged had mild or moderate allergic reactions,\" explains study author Carla Davis, an allergist and director of the Food Allergy Program at Texas Children's Hospital. \"If the symptoms were treated with just Benadryl or another antihistamine, they were considered mild or moderate. She says 2 percent of the reactions were more serious, requiring treatment with epinephrine.\n\nBut the vast majority of patients, 86 percent, did not have an allergic reaction. In other words, they tolerated the food just fine. She says the results aren't that surprising, since allergists had classified these patients as low-risk for reacting to the foods they were being tested for.\n\n \n\n\"I think [the results] are very encouraging,\" Bruce Lanser, a pediatric allergist who directs the Pediatric Food Allergy Program at National Jewish Health in Denver, told us. He was not involved in the study, but he says the findings mirror what he sees in his clinical practice. \"We know a certain percentage will outgrow [their] allergies,\" Lanser says. \"And the last thing I want to miss is the opportunity to get a food into a kid's diet.\"\n\nHe says many of the patients in the study may have outgrown their allergy, just like Jula did. \"But it's also possible [some of them] never truly had a food allergy.\" As we've reported, people sometimes misinterpret the symptoms of a condition such as lactose intolerance for a food allergy.\n\nLanser says it can be tricky to diagnose food allergies. That's because the two main tests doctors use \u2014 the blood test and the skin prick test \u2014 only reveal part of the story. \"Both tests only measure sensitization,\" he explains. \"All they can tell us is how likely you are to react when you eat the food.\"\n\n \n\nAnd that's where the oral food challenge comes in. It's become the gold standard test to rule out an allergy.\n\n \n\nSo, if you or your child tested positive for a food allergy years ago, you may want to consider seeing an allergist again.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story cites one expert not involved in the research, and we could find no potential conflicts of interest that should have been disclosed.

In about half of patients with melanoma that has spread, tumor growth is caused by genetic mutations that keep the BRAF protein -- part of the MAPK cell growth pathway -- constantly activated. Drugs that inhibit BRAF activity can rapidly stop and reverse tumor growth in about 90 percent of patients. But the response is temporary in most cases, and tumor growth resumes in six or seven months, the researchers explained.\n\nPrevious research suggested that this drug resistance develops because the MAPK pathway gets turned back on through activation of MEK, another protein that is part off the MAPK pathway.\n\n\"We investigated this (drug) combination because of research we and others have conducted into the molecular underpinnings of resistance to BRAF inhibitor therapy,\" study lead author Dr. Keith Flaherty, of the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, said in a hospital news release.\n\nThe phase 1 and 2 study was sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline, which developed both drugs.\n\n\"We found that adding the MEK inhibitor trametinib to BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib clearly delays the emergence of resistance. In fact, the combination was at least twice as effective as BRAF inhibition alone,\" he said.\n\nOne expert agreed that the results were encouraging.\n\n\"This study addresses the problem of resistance to the mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK] pathway. This study combined dabrafenib [a selective BRAF inhibitor] and trametinib, [a selective MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor]. These drugs can be safely combined, and the survival was significantly improved without untoward side effects,\" said Dr. Michele Green, a dermatologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\nThe study was conducted at 14 sites in the United States and Australia and included 162 patients who received different dose combinations of the drugs: two daily 150 milligram (mg) doses of dabrafenib plus one 2 mg dose of trametinib; the same dabrafenib dose with a 1 mg dose of trametinib; or treatment with dabrafenib alone.\n\nPatients who received dabrafenib alone were able to receive the full-dose combination treatment if their cancer resumed progression.\n\nTreatment with both combinations of dabrafenib and trametinib led to a four-month longer delay in drug resistance than treatment with dabrafenib alone. After one year of treatment, 41 percent of patients receiving the full-dose combination treatment had no progression of their melanoma, compared with 9 percent of those receiving dabrafenib alone.\n\nAmong patients receiving the combination treatment, the development of side effects such as skin rash and a less dangerous type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma was similar to that typically seen in patients taking only one of the drugs.\n\nThe study was scheduled for presentation Saturday at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Vienna and simultaneous publication in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThe drug combination is now being tested in a larger phase 3 study, which is required for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval.\n\nThe American Cancer Society has more about melanoma.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story informs readers that both drugs studied are being developed by GSK, which sponsored the studies.

Kelly Nichols, O.D., Ph.D., a dry eye expert and dean of the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Optometry, conducted research studies for the parent drug company to explore the efficacy and safety of lifitegrast in treating this eye condition that affects more than 16 million adults in the United States.\n\nInflammation associated with dry eye may eventually lead to damage to the surface of the eye.\n\n\u201cDry eye is a common complaint to eye care professionals, with millions of U.S. adults experiencing the symptoms of this often chronic disease,\u201d Nichols said. \u201cIt is critical for eye care professionals to have a dialogue with patients who report symptoms because dry eye can be a progressive ocular surface disease.\u201d\n\nThe twice-daily eye drop solution of 5 percent lifitegrast ophthalmic solution is the only prescription eye drop indicated for the treatment of both signs and symptoms of dry eye, and it is the first new dry eye prescription drop approved in the last 13 years.\n\nNichols and a team of researchers studied 1,181 patients, of whom 1,067 received lifitegrast in four placebo-controlled 12-week trials. Signs and symptoms were assessed at baseline and at weeks two, six and 12.\n\nIn all four studies, eye dryness was significantly reduced, with two of the studies showing improvements at week two. Results from inferior corneal staining tests \u2014 used by physicians to detect abrasions on the cornea \u2014 showed improvement in three of the four studies.\n\nNichols continues to push for funding and advancement for dry eye research and treatment. Prior to FDA approval of the lifitegrast eye drop, Nichols presented a congressional briefing in Washington, D.C., addressing research into dry eye for the National Alliance for Eye and Vision Research. She focused on the cause and potential therapies for dry eye that are being funded through the National Eye Institute and in private industry.\n\nFocusing her research on all aspects of the eye, Nichols discussed the mechanics of the three layers of the tear film and the importance of each from the cornea outward:\n\u2022 Mucin layer: helps tears adhere to the eye\n\u2022 Aqueous layer or water layer: nourishes and protects the cornea\n\u2022 Lipid or oil layer: lubricates and prevents evaporation and provides smooth refractive surface needed for optimal vision\n\n\u201cWe are unsure which of the 200-plus different lipids and 500-plus unique proteins are most important for protecting and lubricating the eye, and the absence or insufficiency of which results in dry eye,\u201d Nichols said.\n\nThere are more than 30-plus new dry eye basic, translational and clinical studies being funded by the NEI/National Institutes of Health to further explore these lipids and proteins, with more than 50 papers being published monthly.\n\n\u201cFunding from NIH is helping the optometry world make significant strides in understanding the cause and treatment of dry eye,\u201d Nichols said. \u201cWe still have a long way to go, but prevention and early detection are major goals. There is hope for dry eye patients worldwide.\u201d\n\nDiagnosis of dry eye is identified by an eye care professional based on careful evaluation of signs and symptoms, including dryness, discomfort, vision changes and damage to the surface of the eye.

I can\u2019t think of any other product that has this much positive epidemiologic evidence going for it.\n\nI grant you that pretty much none of the research I\u2019m citing above contains randomized controlled trials.

The low-cost approach, grounded in psychological theories of pain, could help address the nation's epidemic of addictions to opioid painkillers and illicit drugs.\n\nVeterans who received this pain-focused care while also being treated for addiction found that the intensity of their pain decreased, their ability to function increased, and their alcohol use went down, compared to veterans who received a less-focused approach. However, the two groups had similar rates of drug use.\n\nJust 10 weekly sessions of the approach, called ImPAT for Improving Pain during Addiction Treatment, had an effect that lasted up to a year in 55 veterans who took part, according to the new results published in the journal Addiction by a team from the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System's Center for Clinical Management Research and University of Michigan Medical School's Addiction Center.\n\nThe researchers have already launched a follow-up study in a larger group of 480 non-veterans in a residential addiction treatment program. And the study's authors note that the ImPAT approach has the potential to be easily and inexpensively adopted by addiction treatment centers and groups worldwide, through team members trained in standard psychological techniques.\n\n\"These results highlight the need for addiction treatment programs to offer a multifaceted approach that doesn't only address substance use but also the other factors that might be driving substance use, including pain,\" says Mark Ilgen, Ph.D., the study's lead author and a VA and U-M psychologist specializing in addiction research. \"We've shown that it's possible to improve pain outcomes in people with addiction, and even have some spillover effects on their substance use.\"\n\nAddiction treatment programs often have patients who suffer from chronic pain, but offer few options to treat them, Ilgen says.\n\nTo make matters worse, \"Past studies of psychosocial approaches for pain have often excluded people with drug or alcohol problems, addiction treatment programs do not usually have providers trained in pain care, and many pain specialists will not treat people who also have addiction. So patients are caught in the middle.\"\n\nAll 129 patients in the study, most of them men in their 40s and 50s, were receiving outpatient addiction treatment in a CBT-based, non-abstinence setting at the Ann Arbor VA. Half were randomly assigned to ImPAT sessions, the other half to support groups of peers, led by a therapist, where pain and addiction could be discussed.\n\nImPAT combines elements of cognitive behavioral therapy with another psychosocial approach called acceptance and commitment therapy.\n\nWhile the two approaches aren't usually used together, they are often used in pain treatment settings - but those clinics and programs don't often accept people who also acknowledge they have addiction issues. Ilgen and his colleagues hope their results will help bring the techniques into addiction treatment settings, where the cognitive behavioral therapy approach is often used.\n\nThe ImPAT technique seeks to use integrated approaches both to help patients focus less on their pain and more on other aspects of life. This includes techniques to help people adapt to their pain, find ways to distract themselves from their pain, and think of ways to function in the face of pain.\n\n\"We want to take the focus off pain and put it onto functioning, and finding pleasurable ways to spend time,\" Ilgen says. \"There's also a strong link between depression and pain. Pain is responsive to mood, and mood is responsive to social support.\"\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the new paper, another addiction and pain specialist, William C. Becker, Ph.D. of Yale University and the Connecticut VA, notes that the new results are even more impressive because ImPAT was compared with another psychosocial approach.\n\nThe newly published study did show that one in five veterans randomly assigned to ImPAT or the comparison approach did not actually attend any sessions - likely because of delays in getting the sessions going. The larger ongoing study, based in an abstinence-based treatment facility in Michigan and funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, has largely avoided that issue by decreasing the delay between study recruitment and the start of the treatment groups, Ilgen says.\n\nThe study in veterans was planned just before the rapid rise in, and increased awareness of, opioid painkiller addiction issues in the U.S. While opioid addiction was one of the issues faced by veterans in the study, most had issues with multiple substances.\n\nThe sharp rise in opioid addiction in recent years - often among people who started taking the painkillers as treatment for acute or chronic pain -- has made the search for effective non-drug pain treatment options even more urgent, Ilgen notes.\n\n\"Long-term use of opioids can sometimes lead to a hypersensitivity to pain, so there may actually be a causal link between use of these medications and pain,\" he notes. \"We need to study psychological pain management approaches in opioid-dependent patients, including those receiving addiction therapies such as buprenorphine.\"\n\nIn the meantime, he notes, people struggling with addiction who want to seek relief from pain should explore the full range of treatment options that have been shown to work in non-addicted patients, including physical therapy, exercise and psychotherapy as well as antidepressant medications. And while existing prescription guidelines do not explicitly prohibit the use of opioid painkillers in people with pain who have substance use disorders, these guidelines recommend only using opioids sparingly and under close supervision, he says.\n\nIn addition to Ilgen, an associate professor in the U-M Department of Psychiatry and member of the U-M Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, the study team included Addiction Center director Frederic Blow, Ph.D., as well as Amy S.

By contrast, the lifetime risk of breast cancer among women generally is about 12 percent, and for ovarian cancer, it's less than 2 percent.\n\nRoughly half of the women in the study had undergone either mastectomies (surgery to remove their breasts) or salpingo-oophorectomies (surgery to remove the ovaries and fallopian tubes) between 1974 and 2008, in order to proactively lower their risk of cancer. The women were followed for an average of about 3.5 years.\n\nDuring the follow-up period, no breast cancer events occurred in the women who underwent mastectomies, while 7 percent of the women in the group who didn't undergo surgery were diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nIn addition, women who had their ovaries removed lowered their risk of ovarian and breast cancer, and also lived longer than women who didn't have the surgery. For example, over 6 years of follow-up, no ovarian cancer cases were seen among BRCA2 mutation carriers who underwent salpingo-oophorectomy, compared with 3 percent of carriers who did not undergo the procedure, the researchers report.\n\n\"One of the main messages of our study is that salpingo-oophorectomy should be part of any management plan for any woman who is found to have these genetic mutations,\" said Rebbeck. \"There really isn't anything else that can reduce a woman's risk by this much.\"\n\n\"These findings really emphasize how important it is for all women with a family history of early breast or ovarian cancer to undergo genetic testing,\" said Dr. Virginia Kaklamani, co-author of an editorial that accompanied the study. \"I see women all the time who get the genetic test only after they're diagnosed with cancer,\" said Kaklamani, who is director of translational breast cancer research at the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University, in Chicago.\n\nKaklamani added that she hoped the findings would encourage more women to ask their primary care physicians whether they are candidates for genetic counseling.\n\n\"This is a very important study because it gives us more information in order to counsel women at risk,\" said Dr. Daniel Silver, assistant professor of medicine at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School. Silver added that women who are found to carry one of these genetic mutations face \"a very complex set of considerations, so the more hard facts you can give them, the better.\"\n\nAccording to Rebbeck, doctors usually recommend that women who test positive for the genes have their ovaries removed at around age 35, but are okay with putting it off until age 40 if they haven't finished having children. He said the surgery today is often done in an outpatient setting, with the use of laparoscopes, which limits scarring and shortens a patient's recovery time.\n\nFind out more about the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes at the U.S. National Cancer Institute.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "1clip_filelist.xml\" rel=\"File-List\"/>\n\n\n\nThe story includes comments from an author of an editorial in the journal who was not involved in this study.

Chan, PhD, Debbie and Andy Rachleff Distinguished Professor of Neurology, vice chief of the Division of Neuroinflammation and Glial Biology, and senior author of the new study. First approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1977 for allergies, the drug has been available over the counter in generic form since 1993.\n\nThe researchers said that the Phase II results, published online on 10 October, 2017 in The Lancet, are the first in which a drug has been shown to reliably restore any brain function damaged by a neurological disease in human patients.\n\n\"To the best of our knowledge this is the first time a therapy has been able to reverse deficits caused by MS. It's not a cure, but it's a first step towards restoring brain function to the millions who are affected by this chronic, debilitating disease,\" said the trial's principal investigator, Ari Green, MD, also Debbie and Andy Rachleff Distinguished Professor of Neurology, chief of the Division of Neuroinflammation and Glial Biology, and medical director of the UCSF Multiple Sclerosis and Neuroinflammation Center.\n\nChan and Green are co-directors of the UCSF Small-Molecule Program for Remyelination, and both are members of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences.\n\nThe new results are particularly notable, Chan said, because patients in the trial had suffered from MS symptoms caused by injury to myelin for years. \"People thought we were absolutely crazy to launch this trial, because they thought that only in newly diagnosed cases could a drug like this be effective -- intuitively, if myelin damage is new, the chance of repair is strong. In the patients in our trial the disease had gone on for years, but we still saw strong evidence of repair.\"\n\nMS is an autoimmune neurodegenerative disorder that affects nearly 2.5 million people worldwide. The disease strikes when the immune system attacks myelin, layers of fatty insulating membrane that surround nerve fibers. Unlike the rubber insulation around wires, however, myelin helps electrical signals in neurons move faster and more efficiently. As myelin damage continues over the course of the disease, neurons progressively lose their ability to reliably transmit electrical signals, resulting in progressive loss of vision, weakness, walking difficulties, and problems with coordination and balance.\n\nCurrent MS treatments aim to prevent the immune system from doing further harm, but none have been shown to repair damaged myelin. In both his 2013 research and in subsequent studies with a mouse model of MS, however, Chan and colleagues had demonstrated that clemastine fumarate promotes myelin regeneration and restores neural function, promising preclinical results that inspired the new study, known as the ReBUILD trial.\n\nBecause the visual system is often one of the first and most prominent parts of the brain to be affected in MS, and because there are well-established tools to measure the speed of neural transmission in the areas of the brain devoted to vision, the research team used a method known as visual evoked potentials, or VEPs, to assess clemastine's therapeutic effects in the trial.\n\nThe five-month Phase II trial enrolled 50 patients with relapsing but generally long-standing MS whose VEPs reflected preexisting deficits in neural transmission. The researchers showed flickering patterns on a screen to participants, and used electrodes placed over the brain's visual areas at the back of the head to gauge how long it took for the flickering signal presented to the eye to generate an electrical response that could be detected by the electrodes. The time from presentation of the pattern to the detection of the VEP is a measurement of how long it took for the signal to travel via nerve fibers from the retina, at the back of the eye, to the visual areas at the back of the brain.\n\nTo enhance the power of their study, the researchers used a \"crossover\" design: they divided the patient population in two and gave the drug, blinded to both participant and researcher, to one group, and a placebo to the other for 90 days; then they switched between the two groups, giving a placebo to the first group and the drug to the other for the next 60 days. This \"flip-flop\" technique gave the researchers the ability to compare patients to themselves -- a form of control that increased the statistical power of the study by nearly an order of magnitude, Green said.\n\nDuring the periods when each group was taking the drug, the neural signal from the eye to the back of the brain was significantly accelerated over the baseline measurements taken before the patients began the study. The effect persisted in the group that had switched to placebo, suggesting that durable repair of myelin had been induced by the drug.\n\nAlthough the research team could not directly observe evidence of rebuilding of myelin in trial participants using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Chan and Green said that this reflects a weakness of current MRI techniques as a tool for this purpose rather than evidence that myelin regeneration did not take place. \"We still don't have imaging methods that have been proven to be able to detect remyelination in humans,\" said Chan.\n\nThat myelin increases the speed of neural transmission is one of the most well-established concepts in neurobiology, and combined with the clear evidence from Chan's preclinical research showing that clemastine fumarate promotes myelin formation, myelin regeneration is the only plausible explanation for the VEP results, the authors said.\n\n\"This is the first step in a long process,\" Green said. \"By no means do we want to suggest that this is a cure-all. We want to ground-truth myelination metrics -- we're designing the crucible that's going to be used to test any future method for detecting remyelination.\"\n\nThe work was funded through generous support from the Rachleff Family.\n\nIn addition to Green and Chan, authors (all at UCSF) include Jeffrey M Gelfand, MD, MAS; Bruce A Cree, MD, PhD, MAS; Carolyn Bevan, MD; W.

Doctors now dare to hope that giving these new drugs in sequence, or in combination, will help people with melanoma live for years while feeling relatively good.\n\nUnlike traditional chemo, which indiscriminately kills growing cells, the new generation of melanoma drugs work in a precise way, based on a better understanding of the specific genes and proteins that drive cancer growth, says Timothy Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation.\n\n\"The reason we're seeing these breakthroughs is because we did the basic science research to help us understand how this cancer happens, how it escapes therapy and how it progresses,\" Turnham says.\n\nMany of the new drugs aim to remove melanoma's \"cloaking device,\" allowing it to be recognized and killed by the immune system, says Roy Herbst, chief of medical oncology at the Yale Cancer Center.\n\nOther drugs \u2014 such as the two approved Wednesday, trametinib and dabrafenib \u2014 target growth signals within cancer cells.\n\nHerry has tried two of the newer drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb: ipilumumab, approved in 2011, and an experimental drug called nivolumab.\n\nAlthough her tumors increased while taking ipilumumab, Herry says a CT scan earlier this year found they had shrunk by half after beginning nivolumab.\n\nThe most noticeable side effects from nivolumab have been moderate fatigue and vitiligo, a loss of pigment on some areas of her hands and arms, says Herry, 57, from Santa Cruz, Calif. She's been able to continue working as a registered nurse throughout these latest treatments.\n\nOlder melanoma therapies \u2014 including interferon, interleukin-2 and five chemo drugs \u2014 caused much more serious side effects, leaving her too sick to work, Herry says.\n\nWhen the new immune therapies work, they often keep cancer at bay for a long time, says Schuchter, who has patients whose cancer has been controlled by ipilumumab for three years.\n\nAt the cancer meeting, featured presentations include a study by researcher Mario Sznol, of the Yale Cancer Center, who will discuss long-term results of nivolumab. Researcher Stephen Hodi, of Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, will present the results of combining ipilumumab with an immune-stimulating drug.

And none are risk-free.\n\nIpilumumab can cause severe side effects, created when the immune system attacks the body itself, Schuchter says. Vemurafenib, approved in 2011, can cause non-lethal skin cancers.\n\n\"Doctors will say, 'There are side effects, but they are manageable,'\" Turnham says. \"Well, 'manageable' can mean something different to patients.\"\n\nTurnham knew a 19-year-old woman with melanoma who \"woke up bleeding every morning\" because of rashes caused by one of the new drugs, which targets mutations in a gene called MEK. The woman died a year later.\n\nDrugs such as ipilumumab can seem like breakthroughs to doctors because they help 15% of patients. Patients with a limited time to live may not be so positive, Turnham says.\n\n\"If you are a patient and someone says, 'There is an 85% chance of you spending $120,000 on a drug, and spending four months of your life being sick, with no benefit,' you're not going to be so excited.\"", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Adequate sourcing, including important contributions in quotes from the executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Older people who use olive oil in their cooking and on their salads may have a lower risk of suffering a stroke, researchers reported Wednesday.\n\nIn a study that followed older French adults for five years, researchers found that those who regularly used olive oil were 41 percent less likely to have a stroke than those who never used the oil.\n\nThe findings, reported in the journal Neurology, hint that the well-known connection between olive oil and heart disease might extend to stroke as well. Olive oil is a key ingredient in the so-called Mediterranean diet. And some clinical trials have suggested that the diet helps control risk factors for heart disease, like high blood pressure, abdominal obesity and elevated levels of \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol.\n\nHigh olive oil intake is also linked to a lower risk of heart attack, and a longer lifespan among heart attack survivors. These latest findings support the general advice that people replace dubious dietary fats \u2014 namely, saturated fats and \u201ctrans\u201d fats \u2014 with olive oil and other unsaturated fats, according to an expert not involved in the study. But he also stressed that the study does not prove that olive oil, per se, helps prevent strokes.\n\n\u201cWe need to remember that this is an observational study,\u201d said Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, a neurologist at Columbia University Medical Center in New York who wrote an editorial published with the study.\n\nThe study found a correlation between people\u2019s olive oil use and their stroke risk, he told Reuters Health \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into cause-and-effect.\n\n\u201cPeople who use a lot of olive oil may be very different from people who don\u2019t,\u201d Scarmeas said.\n\nOlive oil users may, for example, have higher incomes, eat better overall or exercise more often than people who never use the oil. The researchers on the new study, led by C\u00e9cilia Samieri of the French national research institute INSERM, tried to account for those differences. And after they did, olive oil was still linked to a lower stroke risk.\n\nBut it\u2019s impossible to fully account for all those variables, Scarmeas noted. What\u2019s needed, he said, are clinical trials where people are randomly assigned to use olive oil or not, then followed over time to see who suffers a stroke. Such clinical trials are considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d of medical evidence.\n\nThe current study included 7,625 French adults age 65 and older who reported on their diets and other lifestyle factors. People who said they used olive oil for both cooking and as a dressing were considered \u201cintensive users.\u201d\n\nOver the next five to six years, those intensive users suffered strokes at a rate of 0.3 percent per year. That compared with just over 0.5 percent among non-users, and 0.4 percent among moderate users.\n\nWhen the researchers factored in other diet habits, exercise levels and major risk factors for stroke \u2014 like high blood pressure and diabetes \u2014 heavy olive oil use was tied to 41 percent reduction in the odds of stroke.\n\nSamieri\u2019s team also took blood samples from another 1,245 older adults, measuring their levels of oleic acid \u2014 a monounsaturated fat that accounts for most of the fatty acids in olive oil. The one-third of participants with the highest oleic acid levels were 73 percent less likely to suffer a stroke than the one-third with the lowest levels.\n\nThe findings, according to Scarmeas, argue for more research into olive oil\u2019s potential benefits against not only heart disease, but stroke and other neurological diseases as well.\n\nFor now, he suggested that people choose olive oil and other unsaturated fats over saturated fats (found largely in meat and dairy) and trans fats (found in some processed foods, like crackers, cookies and chips).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to rely on this type of fat for your overall health,\u201d Scarmeas said.\n\nThat said, no single food is consumed in isolation, he points out in his editorial.

They also tried to find out how much environmental factors such as diet mattered versus genetics.\n\nThe team examined data from more than 1,000 pairs of female twins from the United Kingdom. Participants answered a food questionnaire to track the intake of vitamin C and other nutrients, including vitamins A, B, D, E, copper, manganese and zinc. To measure the progression of cataracts, digital imaging was used to check the opacity of their lenses at around age 60. They performed a follow-up measurement on 324 pairs of the twins about 10 years later.\n\nDuring the baseline measurement, diets rich in vitamin C were associated with a 20 percent risk reduction for cataract. After 10 years, researchers found that women who reported consuming more vitamin C-rich foods had a 33 percent risk reduction of cataract progression.\n\nGenetic factors accounted for 35 percent of the difference in cataract progression. Environmental factors, such as diet, accounted for 65 percent. These results make the study the first to suggest that genetic factors may be less important in progression of cataract than previously thought. How vitamin C inhibits cataract progression may have to do with its strength as an antioxidant. The fluid inside the eye is normally high in vitamin C, which helps prevents oxidation that clouds the lens. More vitamin C in the diet may increase the amount present in the fluid around the lens, providing extra protection. Researchers noted that the findings only pertain to consuming the nutrient through food and not vitamin supplements.\n\n\u201cThe most important finding was that vitamin C intake from food seemed to protect against cataract progression,\u201d said study author Christopher Hammond, M.D., FRCOphth, professor of ophthalmology at King\u2019s College London. \u201cWhile we cannot totally avoid developing cataracts, we may be able to delay their onset and keep them from worsening significantly by eating a diet rich in vitamin C.\u201d \u201cGenetic and Dietary Factors Influencing the Progression of Nuclear Cataract,\u201d Yonova-Doing, et al.

It significantly raises the risk of stroke.\n\nPatients in the Medtronic-sponsored trial who underwent the cryoablation procedure \u2014 which involves using a catheter to freeze away the heart tissue where the problem originates \u2014 was just as safe as drugs used to treat the condition and far more effective, meeting the study\u2019s primary goal of eliminating atrial fibrillation one year after the procedure.\n\nDubbed Stop-af, the Medtronic trial showed that almost 70 percent of patients who had cryoablation remained free of the condition after one year, compared with just 7 percent of patients who received drug therapy, according to data presented at the American College of Cardiology meeting in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cThis is the best data we have at this point in support of cryoablation (to treat atrial fibrillation),\u201d said Dr. Douglas Packer of Mayo Clinic, the lead investigator of the study.\n\nOver 3 percent of patients treated by cryoablation experienced a serious condition \u2014 a narrowing of the pulmonary vein in 7 out of 228 patients, one of whom required another procedure to widen the vein.\n\nDamage or irritation to the nerve that controls the diaphragm was reported in 11 percent of the cryoablation procedures, but none of the cases was considered serious, with 98 percent resolved by the 12-month follow-up.\n\nComplications related to the atrial fibrillation itself were also monitored. During the follow-up period, 97 percent of patients who got the procedure and 92 percent of the drug therapy patients did not suffer heart attack, stroke or death.\n\nLess than 1 percent of patients treated with cryoablation were hospitalized for a recurrence of the disease, compared with 6 percent in the drug group.\n\nPatients in the pilot study had advanced atrial fibrillation and tended to have other medical problems, such as high blood pressure, diabetes or coronary artery disease,\n\nPacker, who also led the pilot study, dubbed Cabana, acknowledged that the main limitation of this study was its small size, but said it lays the foundation for a larger one.\n\nHe said the larger study, which will include 180 centers, is currently enrolling patients.\n\nAnti-arrhythmic drugs eliminate atrial fibrillation in about half of all patients but can have adverse side effects.\n\nCryoablation is an alternative that is growing in popularity. Over the past decade, more patients have been referred for ablation procedures when drugs proved ineffective.\n\nCatheter ablation involves inserting a thin tube into a blood vessel, usually through a site in the upper leg or neck, and then threading it though the body until it reaches the heart. When it reaches the area of the heart that causes abnormal rhythms, the tissue is ablated, or destroyed.\n\nThe procedure has been used to treat arrhythmias for years. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration initially cleared ablation catheters to treat arrhythmias, such as atrial flutter, but not atrial fibrillation.\n\nOnly Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) has an ablation device approved by U.S. health regulators specifically to treat atrial fibrillation.\n\nThe Medtronic device, which the company added to its portfolio with the 2008 acquisition of CryoCath, has been approved in Europe and Australia.\n\nMedtronic shares were up 3.7 percent to $45.55 in late-morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "\u00a0There were no independent sources interviewed to discuss the potential of this device to affect outcomes and patient care. \u00a0This is a problem.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "For years, research has shown that babies born by cesarean section are more likely to develop health problems. Now, a groundbreaking study suggests that not all C-sections are equally risky.\n\nThe research looked at all full-term, firstborn births in Scotland over a 15-year period and tracked the babies\u2019 long-term health. It is one of the largest and longest studies to explore how planned C-sections differ from other deliveries.\n\nSurprisingly, the data showed more health problems among babies born by planned C-section than among those delivered by emergency C-section or vaginal birth, even though the planned surgery is done under more controlled conditions. The finding suggests that the arduous experience of labor \u2014 that exhausting, sweaty, utterly unpredictable yet often strangely exhilarating process \u2014 may give children a healthy start, even when it\u2019s interrupted by a surgical birth.\n\nThe new findings, published in JAMA this month, are important because the number of babies born by C-section has increased tremendously. In the United States, nearly one in three babies are born by C-section. Cesarean births that had no medical indication increased, to 5.5 percent of low-risk women in 2001, up from 3.3 percent of such women in 1991.\n\nDr. Mairead Black, the University of Aberdeen obstetrician who led the study, said that as cesarean births had increased in Scotland and worldwide, the researchers wondered what, if anything, children born by C-section \u201care missing out on.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur thinking was: If a baby is born naturally, it comes into contact with bacteria from the mother, which might help with immune system development,\u201d Dr. Black said.\n\nEven attempted labor may provide some exposure to bacteria, she said. But babies delivered by a planned C-section, which is usually scheduled to take place well before the first pang of labor, may miss out entirely.\n\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t wait for labor to begin on its own, you cut short all kinds of physiological changes and preparations for birth that are taking place toward the end of pregnancy,\u201d said Carol Sakala, the director of the nonprofit Childbirth Connection programs at the National Partnership for Women & Families. \u201cWhat is the effect of cutting off those processes so casually on such a large scale?\u201d\n\nStudies have consistently found that children born by C-section are at higher risk for health problems like obesity and allergies. C-section birth has also been associated with a higher risk for Type 1 diabetes.\n\nThe Scottish study took advantage of the small country\u2019s rich trove of linked birth and medical databases to track the long-term health of 321,287 babies. Nearly 4 percent were born by planned C-section and 17 percent were delivered by emergency surgery. The remaining 252,917 were vaginal births.\n\nThe researchers compared a range of health outcomes among the babies, including asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, Type 1 diabetes, early death and cancer.\n\nOver all, the differences between a scheduled C-section and an emergency C-section were slight. However, the data do begin to shed light on why babies born through vaginal birth may have fewer health risks than babies born by C-section.\n\nThe biggest difference between babies born by scheduled and unscheduled C-section appeared in risk for Type 1 diabetes. The results showed that babies born by planned C-section had a 35 percent higher risk of Type 1 diabetes compared with babies born by emergency C-section, after adjusting for differences among the mothers.\n\nAll of the babies born by C-section were slightly more likely to use an asthma inhaler at age 5: 10.3 percent of planned C-section babies and 10.19 percent of unscheduled C-section babies wound up using an inhaler, compared with 9.6 percent of vaginally born babies. Asthma hospitalization rates were also higher for babies born by planned C-section with a statistically significant increase of 22 percent over vaginally born babies.\n\nAlthough all of the C-section babies were more likely to be obese at age 5, the differences were not statistically significant after adjusting for differences among the mothers. There were no significant differences in cancer and irritable bowel disease among any of the types of births.\n\nNo one knows exactly why labor may be protective, but the spontaneous onset of labor prompts fluid to clear from a baby\u2019s lungs, said Dr. Aaron Caughey, who helped draw up 2014 guidelines for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that urged providers to let women spend more time in labor and avoid an unnecessary C-section.\n\nThe step is just one of a cascade of physiological changes that take place in mother and baby during the labor process, including surges in stress hormones and reproductive hormones like oxytocin that may help the fetus adapt during labor, preserve blood flow to the organs, and keep the baby alert and prepared for breast-feeding.\n\nDuring labor, a newborn absorbs maternal microbes into its mouth and gastrointestinal tract, said Dr. Josef Neu, a neonatologist at the University of Florida who has written about C-section babies and the hygiene hypothesis.\n\nThe theory is that maternal microbes \u201ctrain\u201d the infant\u2019s immune system, so it doesn\u2019t overreact or become destructive and precipitate autoimmune disorders like Type 1 diabetes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an education process that says, \u2018Calm down, you\u2019re going to be seeing this antigen again, you don\u2019t have to be so aggressive,\u2019\u201d Dr. Neu said.\n\nDr. Neu said the broad-spectrum antibiotics prescribed to the mother before a surgical delivery were another concern; the antibiotics can be transmitted to the baby through breast milk if not before birth, decreasing the diversity of natural bacteria.\n\nThe findings are a reminder that although C-sections are appropriate in some circumstances, they are a poor substitute for labor.\n\nChildbirth and labor are \u201ca physiological process that we\u2019ve evolved to over millions of years,\u201d Dr. Caughey said. \u201cIt\u2019s been really well-designed by evolution.\u201d\n\u2022 Does Frequent Sex Prime the Immune System for Pregnancy?\n\n\n\n For more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Several independent experts were quoted.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "HEART DISEASE\n\nMen with high blood pressure who have one or two drinks per day are less likely to have a heart attack, says a study in the current Annals of Internal Medicine. People with hypertension have traditionally been advised to stay away from alcohol because excessive drinking can increase blood pressure. An international team of researchers led by Dr. Kenneth Mukamal and Joline Beulens sought to find out how moderate drinking affects cardiovascular disease in people with high blood pressure. A group of 11,711 men with hypertension were surveyed about their drinking habits every four years from 1986 to 2002. The researchers found that people who drank moderate amounts of beer, wine, or liquor had fewer heart attacks, though their risk of death was not significantly different from that of the other subjects in the study.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Having one or two drinks a day may be beneficial for men with high blood pressure, but studies like these shouldn't be used to justify excessive drinking. \"Men with hypertension who drink moderately and safely do not need to change their drinking habits,\" said Beulens, of the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands, who was the study's lead author.\n\nCAUTIONS: The study included only male healthcare providers, so it might not be generalizable to a broader population. And, one of the study authors, Eric Rimm of the Harvard School of Public Health, has been sponsored by the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States to speak at academic conferences.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT: Researchers said they want to see whether moderate drinking also benefits women with hypertension.\n\nWHERE TO FIND IT: Annals of Internal Medicine, Jan 2.\n\nCould negative stereotypes be self-fulfilling prophecies? Maryjane Wraga , associate professor of psychology at Smith College in Northampton, tested 54 women for spatial reasoning skills -- the ability to solve problems related to shape and measurement. Before the test, one group was exposed to a negative stereotype: They were told that women do not perform well at spatial reasoning. A second group received a positive message, and the control group received no message. The negative-message subjects made 14 percent more errors than the positive, with the control subjects falling in between. MRI measurements of brain activity in the subjects suggested that the difference was related to a surge in negative emotions. \"It's the difference between a B and an A\" on a test, says Wraga. Spatial reasoning skills are believed to be important in how people perform on standardized tests such as the SAT. A similar study by Wraga, soon to be published, finds men also perform worse under similar conditions. Overall, the results suggest that a change in societal messages could spur changes in actual performance. \"It sounds corny, but 'accentuate the positive,' \" Wraga says.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Exposure to negative stereotypes can actually cause people to perform more poorly.\n\nCAUTIONS: The study looks only at spatial reasoning. Different activities -- such as speech or music -- may be affected differently by stereotypes.

And for now, the research is preliminary, so it's too early to know for sure if the treatment is appropriate to be used for any kind of depression.\n\nStill, the study suggests that brain stimulation \"not only just helps patients who haven't been able to recover from depression, but it seems to be associated with the absence of relapses.

The level of stimulation is controlled by a pacemaker-like device implanted in the chest.\n\nDeep brain stimulation has been around for more than 20 years, Mayberg said, and is commonly used to treat Parkinson's disease. The cost of the surgery is about $50,000, she said.\n\nPrevious research by Mayberg and others suggested that deep brain stimulation had potential as a treatment for depression. The St. Jude Medical Neuromodulation company, which has provided consulting fees to Mayberg and some of the other study authors, is currently recruiting patients for a study that could pave the way for its approval as a treatment for depression, Mayberg said.\n\nThe new study, which appears online Jan. 2 in the Archives of General Psychiatry, began with 10 patients with depression and seven with bipolar disorder -- a condition that causes severe mood swings and is also known as manic depression. They all received deep brain stimulation for 24 weeks after going through four weeks either with or without stimulation.\n\nMost of the patients continued to receive the treatment over two years, although researchers temporarily turned it off in three of them as part of the study before realizing that doing so caused their depression to return.\n\nThe researchers found that 18 percent of patients went into remission after 24 weeks, 36 percent (of 14 patients) after one year. After two years, of the 12 patients still in the study, seven patients (58 percent) were in remission.\n\n\"The number of patients who got better increased over time, but it's not quite clear as to why,\" Mayberg said.

However, it also has been shown to increase protein in the urine and its long-term safety will need further investigation.\n\nLike aspirin, salsalate is an anti-inflammatory drug derived from salicylate and is often used to treat arthritis. Researchers say the first reports of salicylate-based drugs aiding in the treatment of diabetes were published more than a century ago.\n\nMore recently, inflammation has been implicated in development of the insulin resistance that leads to elevated blood sugar levels associated with type 2 diabetes. Aspirin has also been shown to lower blood sugar levels, but the high doses required are associated with a risk of bleeding, which limits its utility.\n\nThat prompted researchers to take another look at salsalate in reducing blood sugar levels. Salsalate contains the same active ingredient as aspirin but is associated with fewer side effects.\n\nIn the study, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers randomly assigned 108 people with type 2 diabetes to receive 3, 3.5, or 4 grams per day of salsalate or a placebo in addition to their current diabetes therapy for 14 weeks.\n\nThe results showed those who took salsalate at each of the dosage levels experienced a beneficial decrease in blood sugar A1c levels of 0.5% or more.

Off the campaign trail, there's intense debate over using opioid meds to kick opioid addiction.\n\nScott Jernigan became addicted to painkillers after his failed back surgery. His doctor had prescribed a month\u2019s worth of OxyContin, the signature drug of the nationwide painkiller addiction epidemic, and Jernigan followed it to the letter. Soon, the well-off businessman, husband, and father of two from Florida was an addict, buying pills on the street. In the last year of addiction, Jernigan snorted away a house, a boat, and almost his life. Even his dealer told him he needed to cut back. \u201cA drug dealer telling you, \u2018Hey man, you really ought to slow down,\u2019\u201d Jernigan, 52, told BuzzFeed News. \u201cCan you imagine?\u201d He\u2019s just one of an estimated 2.1 million people across the United States who are addicted to opioid painkillers like oxycodone and hydrocodone (sold as OxyContin and Vicodin, respectively). Every day, 44 Americans die from a painkiller overdose. The central irony of the painkiller \"pandemic,\" as Sen. Jean Shaheen of New Hampshire called it in a January Senate hearing, is that it\u2019s easy to prescribe painkillers but hard to prescribe medication to treat an addiction. These medications, notably the drug buprenorphine, are not panaceas, but studies have shown that they\u2019re the best choice to help addicts get off painkillers. Trouble is, they\u2019re also opioids themselves, and can result in dependency and highs all on their own, turning into street drugs in the last decade. Partly as a result, relatively few doctors are allowed to prescribe them, and these docs are limited in how many recovering addicts they can treat. In Shaheen\u2019s Feb. 9 primary state of New Hampshire, the drug epidemic ranks as the No. 1 concern of voters in polls. There, presidential candidates such as Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey are calling for treating addiction as \u201ca disease, not a moral failing.\u201d And a move is afoot in Congress and the White House to ease restrictions on medications meant to fight addiction. Last Tuesday, the Obama administration announced that it is seeking $1.1 billion to fight the opioid epidemic, including a $920 million boost to medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction. And on Thursday, the FDA unveiled a new strategy for curbing rampant painkiller prescriptions, which includes making medication treatments more widely available. \u201cI think the situation is sinking in,\u201d Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon told BuzzFeed News. \u201cIt is so out of control, and there is a real opportunity for action in this Congress.\u201d Pharma, meanwhile, is ramping up its marketing of these medications, pitching them as pain relievers themselves and releasing new forms such as a patch and a mint-flavored tablet. One new option awaiting FDA approval, an implant, Jernigan credits with saving his life.\n\nTwo years into Jernigan\u2019s addiction, at a stage when he was getting high only to stave off withdrawal, listless and miserable, another addict told him about a study a drug company was sponsoring at a nearby rehab center testing buprenorphine pills as a quitting aid. \u201cI called on a Thursday and they said they had no openings. I was crushed,\u201d Jernigan said. \u201cThen they called back and said they had a sudden opening on Monday. I was very lucky.\u201d Indeed, most addicts don\u2019t get that opportunity. At the Senate hearing, politicians from both parties voiced outrage over the statistic that only about 1 in 5 prescription painkiller addicts who want help can gain entrance into a recovery program that offers them both medication and counseling, the best proven way to recover from addiction. (Many instead end up in dodgy rehab centers that quickly detox addicts, but don\u2019t offer them medication or counseling to keep them from relapsing.) \u201cI\u2019m incredibly discouraged that we have more folks signing up for addiction treatment in Vermont now than we did when we started,\u201d Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin testified, decrying the FDA\u2019s recent approval of oxycodone for children. \u201cWe simply pass out painkillers like candy in America.\u201d To counteract addictions to prescription painkillers (as well as heroin, their chemical cousin), Shumlin called for allowing nurses and physician assistants to prescribe buprenorphine, something they can readily do now for painkillers. The idea was seconded by senators from both parties. Since its approval in 2002, buprenorphine has become a leading medication for treating opioid addiction. Although it\u2019s a chemical cousin to opioid painkillers and heroin, it provides less euphoria while saturating the brain\u2019s opiate receptors, making it nearly impossible to overdose or get high off of other opiate drugs, like heroin. Most often it is sold as the drug Suboxone (a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone, which blocks the high from other opioids to prevent misuse) in the form of strips that dissolve under the tongue, although it is also sold in generic tablets. Essentially buprenorphine serves as a bridge to stave off the pain of withdrawal. \u201cYou can\u2019t quit when you are feeling sick,\u201d said Jernigan, who started taking buprenorphine two years, five months, and a couple of days ago. He counts each day. Despite its effectiveness, buprenorphine has been slow to catch on: It\u2019s now prescribed about 10 million times a year, typically in a monthlong dose, a fraction of the 200 million\u2013plus prescriptions for opioid painkillers. Partly that\u2019s because the government says that doctors can\u2019t prescribe it to more than 100 patients, and most are limited to 30 or fewer. Even those doctors must take a short course to receive a waiver allowing them to prescribe the drug. Along with many doctors staying away from treating addicts, the restrictions explain why only about 29,000 of the nation\u2019s 916,000 doctors prescribe the drug. In contrast, there are about 320,000 U.S. prescribers of extended-dosage opioid painkillers with unlimited prescribing privileges, according to FDA. Surveys suggest that most of the doctors allowed to prescribe buprenorphine are not psychiatrists or addiction specialists, epidemiologist Hannah Knudsen of the University of Kentucky in Lexington told BuzzFeed News. Their numbers have grown by about 20% in the last two years, however, partly reflecting southern states catching up to northern states in the number of accredited doctors.\n\n\n\nTraditional detoxification, where a patient is nursed through withdrawal and then returns home after about a month, is a lousy way to treat addiction. It leads to relapse about 90% of the time. But buprenorphine is not a miracle alternative. Of the 24 addicts, including Jernigan, who were in the study testing the drug with counseling, only 3 successfully quit, including him. Across many trials, buprenorphine leads to success in only one-quarter to one-third of addicts, according to FDA survey data presented last month at an advisory committee meeting. Plus, people do get high on buprenorphine. \u201cIf you make a drug more available, it will be abused,\u201d R. Terry Furst of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice told BuzzFeed News. His own interviews with addicts and dealers suggest that opioid addicts sometimes use buprenorphine as a way to tide their cravings over, until they next binge on heroin. Furst is also worried about recreational drug users who binge on the weekends \u2014 he calls them \u201cweekend warriors\u201d \u2014 who are finding their way to \u201cbupes.\u201d So he\u2019s not happy about the new moves in Washington to make prescribing buprenorphine easier. Raising the limits on the number of patients who can receive prescriptions or letting nurses prescribe buprenorphine under a doctor\u2019s supervision \u201cis insane,\u201d he said. Not everyone agrees. Addiction specialists such as Gail D\u2019Onofrio of Yale say that restricting buprenorphine prescriptions could hinder full-fledged recovery centers that offer counseling as well as medication. \u201cPeople need help with a job, with mental issues, with their family, with putting their life together again,\u201d D\u2019Onofrio told BuzzFeed News. Those kind of services cost money, and the doctor becomes a bottleneck on the number of addicts that quality recovery centers can treat.\n\nLast month, an FDA scientific advisory committee voted 12 to 5 in favor of a new approach: a six-month implant of buprenorphine for addicts who are \u201cstable\u201d in their recovery from prescription painkiller addiction. Called Probuphine, and developed by Titan Pharmaceuticals of California and Braeburn Pharmaceuticals of New Jersey, the implant buried in a patient\u2019s upper arm will in theory deliver a six-month supply of the medication while limiting illicit sales. \u201cIt sounds like a reasonably good option for someone in recovery to \u2018get it and forget it\u2019 so they don\u2019t have to remember their medication,\u201d addiction treatment expert Marc LaRochelle of Boston Medical Center told BuzzFeed News. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t give it to everyone, but it would be nice to have another option.\u201d The FDA had nixed the implant in 2013, overriding an earlier science panel vote for its approval, out of concern about a lack of safety data. FDA scientists again voiced concerns again at last month\u2019s hearing, which largely debated a Braeburn-funded study finding the implant performed at least as well as the other approved forms of the drug in 176 addicts. Jernigan was one of the study volunteers, and he testified in favor of the implant at the Jan. 12 hearing, his travel paid for by Braeburn. \u201cWhat the implant does is take away the reminder of how I screwed up every day, and the worry about missing my medication,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to go to the pharmacy to get the look, \u2018Oh you are one of those.\u2019\u201d At the same hearing, Braeburn representatives suggested that only 14% of the implant patients relapsed into illicit drug use during the trial, compared with 28% of daily pill users. About 25% of people now prescribed low doses of buprenorphine to treat addiction after about six months of recovery \u2014 or about 400,000 addicts \u2014 could benefit from implants, the company says. But the implant users ended up taking more medication overall than the daily drug users, pharmacologist Tracy Rupp of the National Center for Health Research testified, in a critique. That\u2019s likely because it might take up to four weeks for the implant\u2019s medication to kick in, she said, and the patients required extra medication until that happened. Doctors mishandling the transition from daily doses of buprenorphine to the implant might leave recovering addicts suddenly vulnerable to relapse. Furst also worries about addicts ripping the implants out of their arms to get high. \u201cNever underestimate the ingenuity of someone addicted,\u201d he said. But Braeburn representatives said at the hearing that little of the drug could be recovered from the implant that way. For Jernigan, an implant\u2019s potential to remove him from the stigma of picking up his prescription counts as much as anything in its favor. \u201cEveryone\u2019s recovery is different, but this stuff saved my life,\u201d Jernigan said to BuzzFeed News. \u201cNot having to worry about forgetting it and reminding my wife of the problems I caused all the time would be wonderful.\u201d \u201cI feel sorry for all the people who didn\u2019t make it,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve worked hard, harder than I worked when I was young, the last few years. But it is also fun, clearing my mind finally.

A recent evidence review of several alternatives to medication found that using cognitive behavioral therapy as the first treatment for depression can be equally effective as using a second generation antidepressant.\n\nThe research from the RTI International-University of Chapel Hill Evidence-based Practice Center was published today in the British Medical Journal. The authors focused specifically on comparing second generation antidepressants, such as Wellbutrin, Lexapro and Prozac with cognitive behavioral therapy, which includes several in-person or phone sessions with a therapist to examine how actions and thoughts can impact depression. Second-generation antidepressants refers to newer antidepressants introduced primarily in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n\"Major depressive disorder is a disabling and prevalent form of depression, experienced by more than 16 percent of U.S. adults during their lifetime,\" said Arlene Bierman, M.D., Director, Center for Evidence and Practice Improvement, at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which funded the study. \"Most patients will be prescribed antidepressants. However, the evidence shows that cognitive behavioral therapy can be just as effective, providing important information for patients and their physicians to consider when choosing among available treatment options.\"\n\nAfter conducting a full review of the scientific literature available, the researchers examined 11 randomized controlled trials with 1,511 patients that compared a second generation antidepressant with cognitive behavioral therapy. They found that symptom improvement and rate of remission were similar between the two options, whether used alone or in combination with each other.\n\n\"Primary care clinicians and their patients may not automatically consider alternatives when discussing treatment,\" said Halle Amick, research associate at the RTI International-University of Chapel Hill Evidence-based Practice Center and lead author. \"Our findings indicate that both options should be considered effective initial treatment strategies.\"\n\nSide effects from antidepressants can include constipation, diarrhea and dizziness. Patients also sometimes express concerns about becoming addicted to medications and therefore prefer psychotherapy. However, psychotherapy can be time-consuming and may be substantially more expensive, depending on the patient's insurance benefits.\n\n\"Given comparable effectiveness, doctors need to discuss advantages and disadvantages of both treatment options with their patients. Such shared and informed decision making might enhance treatment adherence which is one of the main challenges of treating major depressive disorder,\" said Gerald Gartlehner, M.D., associate director of the RTI-UNC Evidence-based Practice Center, who was the principal investigator of the evidence review, which was also published today by AHRQ.\n\nA journal article describing all the review findings will be published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in January.\n\n\"Bringing psychotherapy into discussions of treatment may also enhance coordination of care between primary care and mental health care providers in addition to addressing the issue of patient-centered care,\" Amick said. \"If primary care providers discuss psychotherapy with their patients as a valid treatment option, it may empower patients to voice their preferences and truly participate in medical decision-making and encourage them to adopt and adhere to effective treatment of their depression.\"\n\nRTI-UNC Evidence-based Practice Center is a collaboration between RTI and the five health professions schools and the Cecil G.

According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA), 15 million adults\u2014approximately 6.7 percent of the population\u2014suffer from major depressive disorder, which is most often treated through a combination of talk therapy and medication. Those who struggle with depression have imbalanced levels of serotonin, which maintains mood, and dopamine, which controls the pleasure and reward zones. The brain\u2019s synapses control how much of these chemicals are released, and drugs like Zoloft effectively prevent the little serotonin being produced from reabsorbing back into the nerve cells from which they were released, resulting in a higher concentration of serotonin. Some pill-averse patients have longed for a natural cure for depression, while others complain that the drugs they\u2019re on aren\u2019t enough. Hope for both groups may have arrived through an unlikely source: magnets. Researchers discovered they can harness the power of magnetism to increase serotonin production and combat depression through a process called Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS).\n\n\u201cEach [symptom of depression] maps onto a given circuit of the brain,\u201d neurologist Alvaro Pascual-Leone told NPR in April 2016 about treating patients using TMS. \u201cThe reason why that circuit of the brain is not functioning properly...has to do with a deficit of a certain chemical in the brain. But the point is that if we can identify the circuit that causes the symptoms, we can target that circuit and make it function better through brain stimulation. So, in a sense, [TMS is] not a treatment...for the ultimate cause of the disorder, but it\u2019s an intervention that improves how the patient is able to function.\u201d\n\nTMS has a lot in common with a traditional MRI scan. In fact, the only clue TMS treatment contains magnets at all is that patients must remove any jewelry and stow their credit cards (to prevent demagnetization) before treatment. According to Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine\u2019s description of the technique, a coil is fitted to the front of a patient\u2019s head so the electromagnetic pulses can target the prefrontal cortex of the brain, which controls emotion. A physician then tests the machine to see how much power is needed to affect the patient\u2019s reflexes. Once the patient\u2019s thumb involuntarily twitches, the current is strong enough to affect the patient\u2019s brain activity. At this point, specific symptoms can be targeted depending on the patient\u2019s needs.\n\nThe biggest drawback to TMS, according to advocates, is the limitations on just who can undergo the treatment. Though it was approved by the FDA in 2008, its use is federally restricted with exemptions only for those with severe depression, autism or Parkinson\u2019s. Even those who are approved to undergo the treatment face another barrier as TMS is not widely covered by health insurance. Its efficacy varies from patient to patient and, like most prescriptions for depression, TMS has its own set of side-effects. The most common, not surprisingly, are headaches. Although one-third of patients have reported experiencing painful scalp sensations and facial twitching, these tend to fade after several treatments.\n\nDespite these setbacks, researchers are optimistic about TMS\u2014and not just as a form of treatment for depression. Experiments treating Parkinson\u2019s and autism, the other two conditions for which TMS is approved, have seen some success among neurologists. More studies will be needed to determine whether this method can be used as a widespread treatment for other brain-related disorders, but if today\u2019s research is any indication, TMS could be a key to improving the lives of Americans suffering from a multitude of disorders.\n\nThis article was excerpted from Newsweek's Special Edition: Nature's Remedies\u2014Heal Your Body.

The research was an early-stage study, conducted to test the side effects and best dosage of a potential new combined therapy, and the findings were published today in the journal Cancer Discovery.\n\nPembrolizumab, which is marketed under the brand name Keytruda, works by blocking a protein called PD-1, which interferes with immune system function. Blocking PD-1 with pembrolizumab enables the immune system cells to better attack the cancer. While pembrolizumab has been a significant advancement for treating people with a variety of advanced or metastatic cancers, a majority of metastatic melanoma tumors are still resistant to the drug.\n\n\"We have found that the reason patients with metastatic melanoma do not initially respond to immunotherapy with an anti-PD-1 is that their immune system was not ready,\" said Dr. Antoni Ribas, the study's lead author, a professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and director of the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center Tumor Immunology Program. \"So we thought, 'What if we change that by injecting the therapy drug into the metastatic lesions and change the microenvironment of the cancer?'\n\n\"It's like having a pile of wood but not having a match to light it. With this new approach, SD-101 is the match that starts the fire.\"\n\nThe researchers found that SD-101 not only directs T cells to cancer cells, but it also makes the microenvironment more hospitable for the T cells, so that they can better kill the cancer cells.\n\nAll 22 people in the study had an advanced stage of inoperable or metastatic melanoma. Nine were receiving an immunotherapy treatment for the first time as part of the study. Seven of those nine had a positive response to the drug combination, including two for whom the tumors disappeared completely.\n\nThe other 13 people in the study had previously received a type of immunotherapy before the study. Of them, two had a partial response, meaning parts of the tumors shrank, but the tumors did not go away completely. Five more showed some reduction in the tumors, but the other participants did respond to the therapy.\n\nThe results of the study suggest that the combination of pembrolizumab and SD-101 could provide an alternative treatment for people with melanoma whose tumors have not responded or would be unlikely to respond to other therapies.\n\n\"For all patients with advanced cancer, immunotherapy using PD-1 inhibitors has really changed the face of cancer treatment.

People suffering from it often deal with a lifetime of painful symptoms. A new clinical trial is testing a natural treatment that researchers hope will provide a long-term solution for those dealing with the dry, itchy and painful skin that comes with chronic eczema. The trial uses a cream containing beneficial bacteria to fight harmful bacteria on the skin. While it may seem counterintuitive to treat bacteria with more bacteria, experts say this approach seeks to restore the natural microbial balance of healthy skin.\n\n\"There are over 1,000 species of bacteria that all live in balance on healthy skin, some that even produce natural antibiotics. However, we know that eczema patients lack the beneficial bacteria needed to kill Staph aureus, harmful bacteria that can worsen eczema,\" said Donald Leung, MD, head of the Division of Pediatric Allergy & Immunology at National Jewish Health.\n\nTo fight harmful bacteria, researchers isolate beneficial bacteria from our skin and grow it in a lab. It is then applied to eczema patients' skin as a lotion twice a day for a week. Bacterial DNA from patients' skin is then analyzed in a lab to determine if the cream effectively reduced the amount of bad bacteria present.\n\n\"Ideally, we want to eliminate all staph aureus from the skin of eczema patients,\" said Leung. \"What the cream does is help the skin gain back its natural balance and create that barrier needed to keep it healthy.\"\n\nResearchers hope that using the bacteria-infused cream will offer a long-term solution where other treatments fall short. Powerful antibiotics are commonly prescribed for eczema, but they kill good bacteria on patients' skin along with the bad. Creams containing corticosteroids are also often prescribed to eczema patients, but they come with harsh side effects, and patients usually can't tolerate them for long periods of time.\n\n\"The worst symptom of eczema is the itching and the scratching, and the more you scratch, the more it spreads. It can be very painful,\" said Cassandra Rodriguez, 33, who has struggled with eczema all her life.\n\nCassandra has tried just about every cream and medication on the market, and says when she learned about the clinical trial, she was on board to give it a try.\n\n\"The trial coordinator explained that it's like a probiotic for your skin,\" said Rodriguez. \"You hear all these things about good bacteria for your gut, so it seemed like a promising idea to apply that same concept to the skin.\"\n\nCassandra's son also has eczema, and she's hoping this research will lead to an effective treatment so that he won't have to suffer with the pain and embarrassment of the disease for as long as she has. \"He's little now, but dealing with eczema as a teen and an adult is really difficult,\" said Rodriguez. \"If there were something on the market that could help him and help everyone suffering with eczema every day, that would be amazing.\"\n\nExperts say there is more research to be done, but that the goal of the trial is to discover the best combination of bacteria to clear eczema from the skin and then make it available to patients as a prescription cream. The next steps involve testing those different combinations, ensuring they're safe and conducting a longer trial to see if the benefits of bacterial cream can truly provide a permanent solution for eczema patients.\n\nNational Jewish Health is the leading respiratory hospital in the nation.

That previous finding was \u201cvery good news in the field,\u201d said Dr. Bruce Johnson of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, who treats lung cancer patients and reviewed the results for Reuters Health.\n\nThis latest study, published in the journal Lung Cancer, looked at death rates in a different, smaller population of heavy smokers, and estimated that those who received up to two CT scans would have between a 36 and 64 percent lower risk of dying, compared to those who went unscreened.\n\nThe data are \u201cconsistent\u201d with earlier studies but there are still many issues to resolve regarding lung cancer screening, Johnson said.\n\nFor one, scientists haven\u2019t yet worked out how often to screen people, and when to start. It is not clear when or how guidelines for lung cancer screening could be drawn up, and until they are, insurers including government programs such as Medicare are unlikely to pay the average $300 cost of a scan.\n\nFurthermore, an April study showed that 21 percent of a patient\u2019s initial lung CT scans show suspicious lesions that turn out not to be cancer, but lead to needless invasive follow-up procedures and radiation exposure, as well as stress and anxiety for patients and their families.\n\nThe high so-called \u201cfalse positive\u201d rate is an issue, said Dr. James Hanley of McGill University, who also reviewed the findings for Reuters Health, but many mammograms also find lesions that turn out to be benign. And for lung cancer, doctors know there is a high false-positive rate and have a set protocol to follow in order to determine which lesions are dangerous, added Johnson.\n\nLung cancer kills 1.2 million people a year globally and it will kill 157,000 people in the United States alone this year, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nTobacco use accounts for some 85 percent of lung cancer cases in the U.S., and one estimate puts a smoker\u2019s lifetime absolute risk of developing lung cancer between 12 percent and 17 percent. Five-year survival rates for lung cancer are low.\n\nIn recent years, CT scans, in particular, have been promoted by some hospitals and advocacy groups for lung cancer screening, even though studies had not yet shown definitively whether such screening saves lives.\n\nIn 2006, Dr. Claudia Henschke, currently based at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and Arizona State University, caused a stir when she published a study concluding that 80 percent of lung-cancer deaths could be prevented through widespread use of spiral CT.\n\nHer ideas were controversial to start with, especially when other researchers found her work had been paid for by a tobacco company.\n\nIn the current study, funded in part by manufacturers of CT scanners (along with government and other sources), Henschke and her colleagues compared outcomes for nearly 8,000 smokers and former smokers who volunteered to undergo CT scans to outcomes in two sets of people with smoking histories who were not scanned.\n\nThe three groups of people had some important differences, such as in average age and how long and heavily they had smoked, so the researchers had to use mathematical tools to try to eliminate the influence of those differences, said Hanley. For instance, to compare death rates, the researchers tracked how many people died among those who were screened, then pulled out all the people with similar underlying characteristics in the other two groups and looked at their death rates, Hanley explained.\n\nA total of 64 people died in the screened population, the authors report \u2014 but applying the death rate among people with the same underlying characteristics in one of the unscreened populations, they estimated that the number of deaths would have been 100. This translates into a 36 percent lower risk of dying among the screened population.\n\nApplying the same methods to the other unscreened population, the authors estimated that screening was associated with a 64 percent lower risk of dying.\n\nOverall, research is suggesting that CT scans of people at risk of lung cancer might make a dent in cancer mortality, and it\u2019s possible that more frequent screening might make an even bigger dent, Hanley noted. \u201cIf screening is going to work, you\u2019ve got to keep at it.\u201d", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "\n\n\n\nThe story quotes two independent experts who provide valuable perspectives on this study.

But you may not want to start a raucous celebration just yet. The beer was effective only if it was nonalcoholic.\n\nRunning a marathon is, of course, punishing to the body, causing muscle soreness and inflammation. Grueling exercise can also weaken the immune system, making athletes susceptible to colds and other ills in the weeks after the event. Some athletes, particularly in Europe, long had downed nonalcoholic beer during hard training, claiming that it helped them to recover, but no science existed to support the practice.\n\nTo study the matter, researchers at the Technical University of Munich approached healthy male runners, most in their early 40s, who were training for the Munich Marathon, and asked if they would \u2014 in the name of science \u2014 be willing to drink a considerable amount of beer. Two hundred seventy-seven men agreed, even when told that the beverage would be nonalcoholic. Only half of the group received the alcohol-free beer, however; the other half got a similarly flavored placebo. No one knew who was drinking what.\n\nAll of the runners downed a liter to a liter and a half \u2014 about two to three pints \u2014 of their assigned beverage every day, beginning three weeks before the race and continuing for two weeks afterward. The scientists, meanwhile, collected blood samples from the men several weeks before the race, as well as immediately before to the start, at the finish line and on select days afterward. (These were an exceptionally obliging group of racers, it seems.) They monitored levels of various markers of inflammation in the men\u2019s blood, to see whether beer helped to blunt some of the immediate damage from running.\n\nFor the next two weeks, the men continued to dutifully swallow their nonalcoholic beer or other brew. They also reported any symptoms of colds or other upper respiratory ailments that developed during that time.\n\nThe men drinking the nonalcoholic beer reported far fewer illnesses than the runners swallowing the placebo beverage. \u201cIncidence of upper respiratory tract infections was 3.25-fold lower\u201d in the nonalcoholic beer drinkers, the scientists reported, in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. They also showed significantly less evidence of inflammation, as measured by various markers in their blood, and lower counts of white blood cells than the placebo group, an indication of overall better immune system health.\n\nThese effects matter, said Dr. Johannes Scherr, lead author of the study, because if a marathon runner\u2019s body is less sore and inflamed after a race, and he doesn\u2019t develop the sniffles, he can recover and return to training more quickly than he otherwise might have been able to. \u201cIt can be speculated that the training frequency could be higher (with shorter breaks after vigorous training sessions)\u201d in those drinking beer, he wrote in an e-mail response.\n\nJust how nonalcoholic beer eases the ravages of strenuous marathon training and racing is still being investigated. But, said Dr. Scherr, it almost certainly involves the beverage\u2019s rich bouquet of polyphenols, chemical substances found in many plants that, among other things, \u201csuppress viral replication\u201d and \u201cinfluence the innate immune system positively,\u201d all beneficial for fighting off a cold.\n\nAlcoholic beer happens to be drenched in polyphenols, too \u2014 \u201ceven more than nonalcoholic beer,\u201d Dr. Scherr said \u2014 but has the signal disadvantage of being alcoholic. \u201cWe do not know whether the side effects of alcoholic beer would cancel out the positive effects caused by the polyphenols,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFurthermore, it is not possible to drink one to one and a half liters of alcoholic beer per day, especially not during strenuous training.\u201d We all knew that, right?\n\nOf course, other substances containing polyphenols have shown early promise, and then underperformed in follow-up studies. Quercetin, for instance, a polyphenol derived principally from apple skins, was widely touted by endurance athletes several years ago after studies found that large doses allowed untrained lab mice to run for far longer than untreated animals. But the supplement has largely failed to show benefits in human athletes. An analysis of 10 human studies of the supplement presented at the American College of Sports Medicine annual meeting in June concluded that quercetin supplementation \u201cis very unlikely to provide an endurance performance advantage.\u201d\n\nBut the beer experiment did not begin by looking at mice. It began with human marathoners completing a punishing, unsimulated race, and showed demonstrable benefits, in terms of minimizing postrace damage.\n\nAll of which is good news as the fall marathon season approaches. Asked if he would recommend that serious marathon runners add nonalcoholic beer to their diets, Dr. Scherr said, \u201cWhen I look at the results of our study, I would have to answer \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible to get large amounts of polyphenols from other foods, he added, like those training-table staples chokeberries and mangosteens, as well as pomegranates and grapes. \u201cBut with these foods you do not consume the minerals, fluid and carbohydrates,\u201d he said, \u201cso nonalcoholic beer seems to be optimal\u201d for everything, perhaps, apart from your well-deserved celebratory carouse after the race.

The research team reports that the potential improvement in diagnostic accuracy will spare thousands of patients each year in the United States alone from having to undergo unnecessary surgery.\n\nIn a recent report on ongoing work to improve kidney tumor classification, published in the April issue of the journal Clinical Nuclear Medicine, the team reports that the sestamibi SPECT/CT test\u2014short for 99mTc-sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography(CT) \u2014 adds additional diagnostic information in conjunction with conventional CTs and MRI and improves physicians\u2019 ability to differentiate between benign and malignant kidney tumors.\n\n\u201cSestamibi SPECT/CT lets radiologists and urologists \u2018see\u2019 the most common benign kidney tumor, something CT and MRI have not succeeded in doing alone,\u201d says Mohamad E. Allaf, M.D., MEA Endowed Professor of Urology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \u201cThis noninvasive scan may prevent patients with a potentially benign kidney tumor from having to undergo a surgery to remove the tumor or potentially the entire kidney, along with its associated risks and high costs. At Johns Hopkins, use of this test has already spared a number of our patients from unnecessary surgery and unnecessary removal of a kidney that would require them to be on dialysis. These results are hugely encouraging, but we need to do more studies.\u201d\n\nFor this study, 48 patients who were diagnosed with a kidney tumor on conventional CT or MRI were imaged with sestamibi SPECT/CT at Johns Hopkins prior to surgery. Radiologists, who were not allowed to talk to each other or know the results of the surgeries, graded the conventional and sestamibi SPECT/CT images benign or malignant using a 5-point scale (1 = definitely benign, 5 = definitely cancerous).\n\nFollowing surgery, similarly \u2018blinded\u2019 pathologists analyzed the tumors without knowing the radiologists\u2019 imaging results. Pathology results of surgically removed tumors showed that 8 of the 48 were benign. The remaining 40 were classified as a variety of other tumor types, including malignant renal cell carcinomas.\n\nReviewing sestamibi SPECT/CT scan results in conjunction with CT or MRI changed the initial rating levels from cancerous (score 3, 4, 5) toward benign (score 1 and 2) in 9 cases, and changed reviewers\u2019 score from likely cancerous (score 4) to definitely cancerous (score 5) in 5 cases, or about 10 percent of all cases. The addition of sestamibi SPECT/CT increased the reviewers\u2019 diagnostic certainty in 14 of the 48 patients, or in nearly 30 percent of all cases.\n\nOverall, the investigators said, adding sestamibi SPECT/CT helped identify 7 of 9 benign tumors, and conventional imaging with added sestamibi SPECT/CT outperformed conventional imaging alone, as measured by a statistical analysis that measures tradeoffs between sensitivity and specificity. On this measure, a value of 0.50 indicates that a diagnostic test is no better than chance. Conventional imaging combined with sestamibi SPECT/CT had a value of 0.85, while conventional imaging alone had a value of 0.60.\n\nEven for patients whose tumors were not reclassified, the addition of sestamibi SPECT/CT increased physicians\u2019 ability to more confidently classify malignant tumors, which reduces the risk of misdiagnosis and unnecessary surgery for all patients, the researchers say.\n\nRadiologists and urologists have been frustrated for decades by the inability of conventional imaging tests, such as CT and MRI, to distinguish benign from malignant kidney tumors. At Johns Hopkins, multispecialty teams work together to determine the best care for patients and as partners on research innovations and quality improvement initiatives. \u201cThis collaborative venue enabled two then-residents [Drs. Michael Gorin and Steven Rowe] from different departments and specialties to design a clinical trial based on a few reports in the literature suggesting a potential role for sestamibi SPECT/CT in this diagnostic conundrum, and their hypothesis proved correct,\u201d says Mehrbod Som Javadi, MD, assistant professor of radiology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the senior author on the paper. Pamela T. Johnson, MD, associate professor of radiology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine notes, \u201cthese types of advances are critical to our precision medicine initiative, Hopkins inHealth, designed for individualized patient management, and to our mission of high-value health care, where the highest quality care is safely delivered at the lowest personal and financial cost to the patient.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs radiologists, we have struggled to find noninvasive ways to better classify patients and spare unnecessary surgery, but this has not been easy,\u201d says Steven P. Rowe, M.D., Ph.D., one of the two former residents who developed this approach, and now assistant professor of radiology and radiological science at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \u201cSestamibi SPECT/CT offers an inexpensive and widely available means of better characterizing kidney tumors, and the identical test is now being performed as part of a large trial in Sweden, for which the first results have just recently been published and appear to confirm our conclusions.\u201d\n\nAlthough further study is needed to validate the accuracy of sestamibi SPECT/CT, this test appears to be a less expensive, faster, noninvasive alternative to surgery, says Michael A. Gorin, M.D., the other resident involved in developing this approach and now chief resident with The James Buchanan Brady Urological Institute of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \u201cIn the absence of diagnostic certainty, surgeons tend to remove kidney tumors in an abundance of caution, leading to an estimated 5,600 surgically removed benign kidney tumors each year in the United States.\u201d\n\nOther authors on this paper include, Sara Sheikhbahaei, Christopher S.

A shorter urethra makes it easier for bacteria from rectum to enter the vagina and travel to the bladder.\n\nStudy author Dr. Thomas Hooton said it's thought that increasing fluid intake decreases UTI risk in two ways: by preventing bacteria from adhering to the bladder and by reducing the overall concentration of bacteria that could cause an infection.\n\n\"Flushing bacteria out of the bladder, it's been known, at least it's been thought, that it is protective. This study suggests that it is,\" said Hooton, clinical director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Miami School of Medicine.\n\nDr. Hunter Wessells, who wasn't involved in the study, called the additional fluid intake \"substantial,\" leading to a corresponding increase in urine output.\n\n\"It is the urine output which is of course the key factor leading to the effect seen in the study,\" said Wessells, chair of the department of urology at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.\n\nDr. Susan Bleasdale, medical director of infection control at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said the study \"may be a game changer\" for antibiotic \"stewardship\" programs aimed at reducing inappropriate antibiotic use.\n\nShe cited a 2010 review estimating that 11 million to 12 million women a year will suffer from a UTI, accounting for 1.6 billion antibiotic prescriptions a year.\n\n\"We might not even need to use antibiotics,\" she said.\n\nThe study, conducted in Bulgaria, involved 140 healthy premenopausal women who had at least three UTIs in the past year.

They continued their usual fluid intake.\n\nThe women were followed for a year, with clinic visits at the beginning of the study as well as 6 and 12 months later.

They also called the women each month to assess compliance and counsel them to return to the clinic for evaluation and possible treatment if they were experiencing UTI symptoms.\n\nOverall, the water group increased daily water intake by close to 5 cups a day. Their total daily fluid intake, including water and other beverages, averaged nearly 12 cups.\n\nBy contrast, the control group's total daily fluid intake was less than half of that.\n\nHooton noted that it's not clear exactly how much fluid intake must increase to deliver a benefit.\n\n\"There's no magic in a liter-and-a-half,\" he said.\n\nLikewise, he believes any increase in fluid -- not just water -- may be beneficial since fluids are mostly water.

But another from the United States gives more weight to findings from Africa that show the procedure, when it's performed on adult men, makes a major difference in preventing such diseases as AIDS.\n\nThe findings come as the American Academy of Pediatrics debates updating its recommendations regarding circumcision among newborns. The academy now takes a neutral stance.\n\nIn general, \"there is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the risks and benefits of circumcision,\" said Dr. Douglas S. Diekema, a pediatrician at the University of Washington who's familiar with both reviews and serves on a task force working on the academy's recommendations.\n\n\"There are some clear benefits to circumcision,\" he said. \"There are some risks to circumcision, although the significant ones appear to be rare.\"\n\nNot so, write the Australian researchers, who examined eight studies for a review in the latest issue of the Annals of Family Medicine. Two studies involved neonatal circumcision, and six involved older males, roughly 14 to 49 years old.\n\nThe review's lead author, researcher Caryn Perera of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, said the risk of major complications ranges from 2 percent to 10 percent. \"These may be considered unacceptable for an elective procedure,\" she said.\n\nParents who think circumcision has medical benefits should be aware that there's \"a lack of consensus and robust evidence\" on that, she added.\n\nThough African studies have linked circumcision in adult men to lower rates of sexually transmitted diseases, including the virus that causes AIDS, Perera said that only future studies will tell if those findings are applicable to the Western world, where AIDS is much less prevalent.\n\nAnd there's more to consider, Perera said. She said that circumcision poses problems from a mental point of view, potentially causing \"significant anger or feeling incomplete, hurt, frustrated, abnormal or violated.\"\n\nAs to whether circumcision reduces sexual sensitivity, Perera said there's no evidence that it affects sensation when performed on adults. The highest-quality studies, known as randomized controlled trials, don't report whether infant circumcision affects sensation, she said.\n\nA review in the January issue of Archives of Pediatrics & and Adolescent Medicine, which examined three studies, took a different tack.

He got cancer researchers so excited, some are already testing it out on laboratory animals.\n\nWhen 60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl first met Kanzius, he told us he didn't have a background in science or medicine; he didn't even have a college degree.\n\nWhat he did have was a deadly form of leukemia and a determination to use whatever time he had left to come up with a better way to treat the disease.\n\nUsing his wife's pie pans and what he knew best - radios - Kanzius, a former radio executive, built a machine in his garage that he hoped would zap cancer cells without the horrible side effects you get with chemotherapy and radiation.\n\n60 Minutes decided to keep track of Kanzius and his invention, so we followed him for over a year, as he pushed to speed up the research on his machine and fought to slow down his own cancer, which was killing him.\n\nWhen Stahl first met Kanzius in January 2008, he was finishing his 36th round of chemotherapy since being diagnosed with terminal leukemia. All that chemo had been keeping him alive, barely.\n\nApril 2008: The Kanzius Machine\n\nMD Cancer Center: Have questions about cancer?\n\nJohn Kanzius Research Foundation: Learn more about the research.\n\nHe said the leukemia was getting him mentally and physically. \"And I didn't think that one could feel this bad and still be alive as I did back in January.\"\n\nBut we were surprised by how healthy he seemed seven months later, in August 2008, when we visited with him and his wife Marianne at their home in Erie, Pa.\n\n\"I must say you look like a completely different person to me. You look energetic. And you've gained some weight, am I right?\" Stahl remarked.\n\n\"You're right about all of them,\" Kanzius replied.\n\nSo great, he had spent the summer outside doing things he hadn't been able to do since he'd been diagnosed with cancer six years earlier, like playing 18 holes of golf a day. What happened?\n\n\"I decided it was time to turn the switch on and try it\u2026Try treating myself,\" he explained. \"Got in the machine, adjusted it, and turned it on for a minute the first time. And [I] didn't feel anything strange.\"\n\nHe had turned himself into a human guinea pig.\n\n\"I've done it nine times,\" Kanzius told Stahl. \"Nine times and my blood work has improved all summer long. We're on vacation right now from cancer, I don't know whether it's a permanent leave but we're on vacation right now.\n\n\"Now that you feel so good, you feel great, you look good, do you have a constant worry that this is too good to be true kind of thing?\" Stahl asked.\n\n\"Sure. I mean, you wonder when the bubble's going to break,\" Kanzius admitted.\n\nSo even though he had been feeling good for awhile, he admitted there was always fear his disease could take a turn for the worse. \"The disease is relentless. It just keeps pushing and pushing and pushing.\"\n\nIt was that relentlessness of leukemia that had given Kanzius the idea to build his radio wave machine in the first place. When 60 Minutes met him back then, he showed Stahl how the radio waves - transmitted across a small field - created enough energy to light up a fluorescent bulb.\n\nWhen moving a fluorescent bulb into the force field, the bulb lit up.\n\nHe then wanted to show us that radio waves are harmless to humans, and even moved his hand back and forth into the force field. \"Nothing happens,\" he told Stahl.\n\nBut he knew that radio waves can heat up metal. So he wondered: if he injected a cancerous tumor with some kind of metal, would radio waves heat up the metal and cook the cancer cells to death, and only the cancer cells? He tried it out on a hot dog, injecting it with a metal solution.\n\nHe took a probe, and placed it into an injection site on the hot dog. When he turned the device on, the temperature went up in that one area where the metal was and nowhere else.\n\nKanzius thought he had discovered a way to attack cancer cells without the collateral damage caused by standard treatments like chemotherapy and radiation. \"I said 'Eureka, I've done it,'\" Kanzius remembered.\n\nHe managed to intrigue Dr. Steven Curley, a liver cancer surgeon at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.\n\nDr. Curley thought there was so much promise in Kanzius' invention, he began conducting his own research with the machine, using tiny bits of gold nano-particles that are so small, thousands of them can be injected into a single cancer cell. The radio waves then heat up the gold, which kills the cancer.

But working out the unique mutations of each person\u2019s cancer, a time-consuming and complicated process, must first be identified before a vaccine can be developed for them.\n\nIn two studies published in the journal Nature, researchers have shown promising results from Phase I clinical trials. While they are very small scale\u2014one was on six participants, the other 13\u2014the findings mean researchers can move ahead with the vaccines, which could potentially lead to new, more effective cancer treatments.\n\nIn the first study, scientists led by Catherine Wu developed a vaccine for people who had been treated for melanoma with surgery, but who had received no other treatment. They sequenced the DNA from the tumors then created a personalized vaccine that contained neoantigens (targets for the immune response) for predicted mutations.\n\nSix patients were given a full series of vaccinations, including five priming injections and two booster vaccinations. Four of the six had no recurrence of the disease after 25 months.\n\nIn the other study, by Ugur Sahin and colleagues, tested a personalized vaccine based on RNA (an essential link in the production of proteins encoded by DNA). They used a similar approach to Wu and her team to identify the mutations, then tested the vaccine on 13 people who were being treated for melanoma. All participants were found to have a boosted immunity against the antigens specific to their tumors. Eight were still tumor free after 23 months.\n\nBoth vaccines were deemed safe and are expected to be taken forward for further research.\n\nThese vaccines are not necessarily the future of personalized cancer treatment. Cornelius Melief, from the Leiden University Medical Center, Netherlands, said in an accompanying News & Views article that controlled, randomized Phase II clinical trials will be needed to work out if the vaccines are effective. He added, however, that the studies confirm the potential of cancer vaccines.\n\nElizabeth Williams, from the School of Biomedical Sciences at Queensland University of Technology, tells Newsweek the two studies \u201cdescribe tantalizing complementary and consistent results in Phase 1 trials in melanoma patients using vaccines.\"\n\n\"The vaccines are personalized for each individual\u2019s tumours by harnessing technologies that enable the comprehensive analysis of the molecular fingerprint of the tumour,\u201d she says. \u201cThe data shows that it is a safe and well tolerated strategy that stimulates relevant anti-tumor immune responses.\u201d\n\nHowever, the treatment has its downsides: \u201cAs the vaccine therapies are designed and generated specifically for each individual there is a lag time from enrollment to commencement of treatment\u2014approximately four months\u2014which may be too long from some patients with advanced cancer. As technologies and processes continue improve this is likely to be reduced,\" she continues.\n\n\u201cIt is still unknown whether these vaccines will extend the survival of cancer patients, or whether they are more effective than other recently developed immunotherapies. Additional clinical trials will be required to determine the utility of these individualised neoepitope vaccines.\u201d\n\nCatherine Pickworth, science communication officer at Cancer Research UK said: \u201cThe promising results from these two small, early-stage studies show that personalized cancer vaccines designed to treat skin cancer are safe to use, and that for some patients, they can successfully harness the power of the body\u2019s own immune system to kill cancer cells.

However, a similar approach might work for some other mutations.\n\nDuchenne, which affects as many as 15,000 Americans, mainly boys and young men, is the most severe common form of muscular dystrophy, a disease made more prominent by years of Jerry Lewis telethons. Those with the disease make barely any dystrophin, a protein necessary for muscles to function. Patients typically lose the ability to walk as teenagers and die by age 30.\n\nWhile steroids, which reduce inflammation, can slow progression of the disease, they have undesirable side effects. Eteplirsen, which Sarepta says has shown no side effects so far, is vying with a similar drug being developed by GlaxoSmithKline to become the first medicine that works by directly countering the cause of the disease.\n\nEteplirsen could also be the first drug to reach the market for Sarepta since it was founded 32 years ago. It changed its name recently from AVI BioPharma to distance itself from its underachieving past.\n\nShares of Sarepta nearly tripled on Wednesday, closing at $44.93. And the stock had already roughly quadrupled since July, when Sarepta announced some interim results from the study.\n\nThe study measured how far the boys could walk in six minutes. Those who received the higher dose walked an average of 21 meters farther after 48 weeks of treatment than at the beginning of the trial, a gain of about 5 percent. The boys in the placebo group walked 68 fewer meters at the end than at the beginning, a decline of about 17 percent.\n\nOne possible reason for skepticism is that two of the boys on a lower dose of the drug rapidly lost the ability to walk, even though the level of dystrophin in their muscles increased substantially.\n\nWhile the company excluded those boys from its analysis as outliers, the Food and Drug Administration might not do so. That could make it harder for the Sarepta to win approval for the drug based only on this small trial, something the company hopes to do.\n\n\u201cIf you wait and require this company to do another two-year study, a lot of these boys are going to be in a wheelchair,\u201d Christopher Garabedian, the Sarepta chief executive, said in an interview.\n\nPatient groups may also put some pressure on the Food and Drug Administration to approve the drug quickly. But some also want Sarepta to make the drug available to more patients on a compassionate basis even before approval.\n\nTen-year-old Max Leclaire of Saxtons River, Vt., who has been receiving the highest dose in the trial, can now walk up stairs without having to pull himself up by the handrail, according to his mother, Jenn McNary. \u201cHe\u2019s no longer riding the handicap bus to school,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Ms. McNary said Sarepta had refused to provide the drug to Max\u2019s 13-year-old brother, Austin, who could not be in the trial because he already could not walk.\n\nMr. Garabedian said Sarepta did not have the money or the manufacturing capacity to make the drug available outside of clinical trials. \u201cThat would be the quickest path to insolvency,\u201d he said.\n\nIf eteplirsen gets to market, it would come nearly three decades after the 1986 discovery of the gene responsible for Duchenne. It would also represent a success, after decades of setbacks, for the technology eteplirsen uses, called antisense, which is a way of turning off specific genes.\n\nEteplirsen actually turns off just one part of the dystrophin gene, known as exon 51, which contains a mutation that in some patients stops production of dystrophin.

The findings could be a significant step in treating people with resistant hypertension, which is a major risk factor for heart attack and stroke, the researchers said.\n\nThe technique -- called catheter-based renal denervation -- is minimally invasive. In it, doctors use a catheter inserted through the artery in the groin, which sends radio waves burning away nerve tissue around the arteries that feed the kidneys.\n\nThe procedure destroys nerves that help control and filter salt in the body and may be overactive in patients with high blood pressure. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved its use.\n\nThe study was funded by medical device maker Medtronic. The findings were published Dec. 17 in the journal Circulation.\n\n\"This is a very promising approach for managing medication-resistant hypertension,\" said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a spokesman for the American Heart Association and professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\n\"High blood pressure is a major contributor to heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and [kidney] failure,\" said Fonarow, who was not involved in the study. \"Despite the availability of a number of effective medications, many patients with hypertension have not achieved adequate control of their blood pressure. There is thus an important, but currently unmet, need for additional therapies to effectively control hypertension.\"\n\nFor the study, an international team lead by Dr. Murray Esler, professor and senior director of the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne, Australia, assigned 35 patients to renal denervation and compared them to 47 patients who had already had the procedure.\n\nAll the patients suffered from drug-resistant hypertension. Their systolic blood pressure -- the top number in a blood-pressure reading -- remained dangerously high at 160 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) or above despite having taking three or more drugs to control blood pressure, the researchers noted.\n\nEsler's team found that more than 83 percent of those who had denervation treatment before had a drop in systolic blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg after six months and almost 79 percent maintained the reduction at 12 months.\n\nThe 35 patients in this phase of the study had similar results to the initial group. Almost 63 percent of these patients saw a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg or more six months after treatment.\n\nFonarow noted: \"In all, reductions in systolic blood-pressure levels on the order of 25 to 30 mmHg were achieved and maintained without any loss in efficacy.\"\n\nThe procedure is safe as well as effective, the study authors said.\n\n\"Participants' kidneys were not damaged or functionally impaired,\" Esler said in a journal news release. \"We also found no ill effects on long-term health from the procedure.\"\n\nWhether this technique might be useful in treating less severe high blood pressure hasn't yet been tested. If it is applicable, it could mean patients need not take blood-pressure drugs, Esler suggested.\n\nAnother expert, however, said that scenario is likely overoptimistic.\n\n\"Hypertension is a hard disease to treat because there are so many things that go into getting blood pressure under control,\" said Dr. Varinder Singh, chairman of cardiology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"There's lifestyle and diet, there is getting to the right doses of medications, there are adherence issues. So anything that will help patients get their goals is exciting.\"\n\nEven with this technique, people will most likely still have to take blood-pressure medications, Singh said. \"You may have to take less medication and you may have to take lower doses of medication, but we all expect that patients will still have to take some medication,\" he said.\n\nSingh also noted that although this procedure is used in other countries it is not yet approved in the United States.\n\nFonarow added: \"While this study demonstrates that renal denervation provides sustained reduction of blood pressure up to one year and appears safe, additional studies with longer-term follow-up are needed.\"\n\nAccording to the American Heart Association, more than 78 million adults in the United States have high blood pressure, which is blood pressure higher than 140/90 mmHg.\n\nAmong these adults, about 9 percent have resistant hypertension, which means that even taking three or more medications to control their blood pressure, it remains higher than 140/90 mmHg.\n\nTo learn more about hypertension, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Medtronic funding\u00a0 was disclosed.\nThere was an independent expert who provided some needed balance \u2013 although that expert was not quoted about any real critical analysis of the evidence.\nNonetheless, enough to get a satisfactory score.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Sept. 6, 2011 -- \"A drink a day keeps disease away\" may be the new motto for middle-age women hoping to age gracefully.\n\nA new study shows women who drank the equivalent of a beer or small glass of wine each day were less likely to develop chronic diseases like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes as they got older compared to nondrinkers or those who drink four or more drinks at one time.\n\nIn the study, researchers looked at the effects of drinking alcohol at midlife on the risk of diseases commonly associated with aging in a group of 13,894 women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study.\n\nThe women filled out questionnaires about what they ate and drank at midlife, about age 58.

Originally from India, it is not associated with any particular religion or philosophy. It is thought to produce alpha brain waves that occur in deep relaxation. According to the Maharishi Foundation, more than 5 million people worldwide practice this type of meditation.\n\nThe research focused on blacks because they are at a higher risk than whites of having heart attacks and strokes and dying from heart disease, Schneider said. He added, however, that meditation would work as well among whites and other populations.\n\n\"Other studies have been done among whites and the results are similar,\" he said.\n\nThe report was published in the Nov. 13 issue of the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes.

Forty-one percent of the meditation group took aspirin, as did 31 percent of the health education group; 38 percent of the meditation group and 43 percent of the health education group smoked, the researchers noted.\n\nParticipants' average body-mass index -- a measurement of body fat based on height and weight -- was 32, which is considered obese.\n\nMeditation consisted of sitting with eyes closed for about 20 minutes twice a day.

In addition, 20 people in the medication group had a heart attack or stroke or died, compared with 32 in the health education group.\n\nBoth groups increased exercise and drank less. For those who meditated, there was a trend toward reduced smoking; however, this was not statistically significant.\n\nLearning how to do Transcendental Meditation isn't inexpensive. An initial 10-hour course runs about $1,500 when taught by nonprofit groups, and there is continued lifetime follow-up, Schneider said.\n\nAnd it's not something you can learn by yourself. \"You've got to have a teacher right there in front of you teaching according to experience,\" he said. \"So it's only learned live.\"\n\nTranscendental Meditation is not generally covered by health insurance, he said. \"One of the reasons we did the study is because insurance and Medicare calls for citing evidence for what's to be reimbursed,\" Schneider said. \"This study will lead toward reimbursement.

Patients with Crohn\u2019s disease should not use Siliq. Health care providers should also evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with Siliq. Health care providers should not administer Siliq to patients with active TB infection, and should avoid immunizations with live vaccines in patients being treated with Siliq.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions reported with the use of Siliq include joint pain (arthralgia), headache, fatigue, diarrhea, throat pain (oropharyngeal pain), nausea, muscle pain (myalgia), injection site reactions, influenza, low white blood cell count (neutropenia) and fungal (tinea) infections.\n\nSiliq is marketed by Bridgewater, New Jersey-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

They say the FDA wrongly still tends to view weight-loss drugs as diet pills \u2014 something frivolous and used primarily for cosmetic purposes.\n\n\"We are not talking about medications to help someone lose five pounds to fit into their prom dress or wedding dress. We're talking about medications to help those who are struggling with the health impact of obesity,\" Nadglowski says.\n\nSo Nadglowski and others are pushing the FDA to take into consideration whether the risks of new drugs may be outweighed by their benefits beyond weight loss, such as reducing the risk for heart disease, diabetes and other complications of obesity.\n\nWoodcock says officials realize they may have to think about things differently.\n\nAs the FDA works through this, many are watching how the agency handles Qnexa. An FDA advisory panel is scheduled to review Qnexa again on Feb. 22.\n\nBarbara Troupin of Vivus, the company that is developing Qnexa, says the drug appears to do a lot more than just help people lose weight.\n\n\"We see decreases in blood pressure. We see decreased rates of progression to diabetes. We see improvements in sleep apnea. We see improvements in quality of life. Pretty much all of our data shows significant benefits,\" she says.\n\nVivus hopes the FDA will agree that those benefits will outweigh some of the risks, including the concerns about birth defects. The company is submitting new data it says show that the risk is lower than had been feared. Vivus also has a plan to minimize the chances that pregnant women will take it.\n\nSome see Qnexa as a test of the FDA trying to recalibrate how it weighs risks and benefits for weight-loss drugs.\n\nFor her part, Wade just wants to be able to start taking it again. She's gained back half of the weight she lost.\n\n\"I need to lose 20 more pounds again,\" she says. \"And I need the help.\"", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Several independent sources were cited.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Newswise \u2014 HOUSTON \u2015 For the first time, transplanting gut bacteria from healthy donors was used to successfully treat patients suffering from severe colitis caused by treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). The study from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, which includes two patients, suggests fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is worth investigating in clinical trials as a therapy for this common side effect of immunotherapy.\n\nThe research, led by Yinghong Wang, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of Gastroenterology, Hepatology & Nutrition and director of Medication Induced Colitis and Enteritis, was published today in Nature Medicine.\n\n\u201cThe resolution of colitis in these patients can be confirmed clinically and endoscopically after FMT treatment,\u201d said Wang. \u201cBased on these results, this should be evaluated even as a first-line therapy for ICI-associated colitis because it\u2019s safe, quick, and the effect is durable - from one treatment.\u201d\n\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors, which release a block on the immune system to attack cancer, have been successful in providing durable responses for patients with several cancer types. However, these treatments are often associated with significant immune-related toxicities.\n\nColitis, inflammation of the colon, is the second most common side effect from ICIs, occurring in up to 40 percent of patients, explained Wang. When ICI-associated colitis is severe, guidelines require a patient to stop ICI treatment until the colitis is in remission.\n\n\u201cIf the patient is a good responder to immunotherapy, that means you\u2019ve taken their effective treatment away,\u201d said Wang. \u201cWe have a limited amount of time to fix the problem so they can resume ICI treatment, but I feel that we\u2019ve made great progress in this area.\u201d\n\nThe researchers chose to investigate the potential for FMT as an alternative, compassionate-use therapy for patients suffering from refractory, or unresponsive, ICI-associated colitis. The two patients included in the study were treated at MD Anderson between June 2017 and January 2018.\n\nFMT has shown promise in treating other types of gastrointestinal diseases, such as recurrent Clostridium difficile infection and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which shares many clinical and molecular characteristics with ICI-associated colitis. These conditions typically are treated with steroids and targeted immunosuppressive agents, which result in additional severe side effects and can counteract the effects of immunotherapy.\n\nBoth patients in the study had a complete resolution of their colitis following treatment with FMT. The first patient\u2019s colitis resolved within two weeks following a single FMT treatment; the second patient experienced a partial recovery after the first treatment, followed by complete recovery after a second FMT. With endoscopic evaluation before and after treatment, both patients displayed significant improvements in inflammation and ulcerations, including a reduction of inflammatory immune cells.\n\nPre- and post-treatment stool analyses revealed patients\u2019 gut microbiomes to be most similar to the donor immediately after treatment, with less resemblance to the donor over time. Still, post-treatment gut bacteria remained distinct from their own pre-treatment microbiome. Additionally, distinct new populations of bacterial species were evident in these patients following FMT compared to pre-treatment samples, including several species known to be protective or reduce inflammation.\n\nThe authors acknowledge significant limitations to this study based on the very small cohort, and they plan to pursue clinical trials to investigate the effectiveness of FMT in treating ICI-associated colitis as compared with standard immunosuppressive therapy. FMT continues to be offered to MD Anderson patients on a compassionate-use basis.\n\nPrevious MD Anderson research showed that bacteria in the gut influence patient response to ICI therapy, and other evidence suggests modifying the microbiome in mice can alter their response to immunotherapy. The current data further suggests there is the potential for many molecular studies to better understand the role of the microbiome in driving ICI-colitis and immunotherapy response more broadly.\n\nThe study was supported by the Andrew Sabin Family Fellowship Program; the American Association for Cancer Research \u2013 Stand Up to Cancer; the National Institutes of Health (CA219896-01A1, HL124112); the Cancer Prevention & Research Institute of Texas; and the Melanoma Moon Shot\u2122, part of MD Anderson\u2019s Moon Shots Program\u2122, a collaborative effort to accelerate the development of scientific discoveries into clinical advances that save patients\u2019 lives\n\nIn addition to Wang, other MD Anderson authors include: Diana Wiesnoski, Christopher Sanchez, and Chia-Chi Chang, Ph.D., all of Genomic Medicine; Beth Helmink, M.D., Ph.D., and Vancheswaran Gopalakrishnan, Ph.D., both of Surgical Oncology; Hamzah Abu-Sbeih, M.D., Gottumukkala Raju, M.D., and John Stroehlein, M.D., all of Gastroenterology, Hepatology & Nutrition; Edwin Parra, M.D., Ph.D., and Alejandro Francisco-Cruz, Ph.D., both of Translational Molecular Pathology; Matthew Campbell, M.D., Jianjun Gao, M.D., Ph.D., and Sumit Subudhi, M.D., Ph.D., all of Genitourinary Medical Oncology; Dipen Maru, M.D., of Pathology; Jorge Blando, DVM, and James Allison, Ph.D., both of Immunology; Padmanee Sharma, M.D., Ph.D., of Genitourinary Medical Oncology and Immunology; Michael Tetzlaff, M.D., Ph.D., of Translational Molecular Pathology and Pathology; Jennifer Wargo, M.D., of Genomic Medicine and Surgical Oncology; and Robert Jenq, M.D., of Genomic Medicine and Stem Cell Transplantation.

But scientists anticipate that some day a simple pill could help prevent the digestive upsets caused by ingesting the gluten in wheat, rye or barley products.\n\nThe only current treatment for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet. A new study, however, offers some potential for hope. Researchers have re-engineered a naturally occurring enzyme, kumamolisin-As, to break down gluten in the stomach into much smaller protein pieces, called peptides. They say these are less likely to trigger the autoimmune response that can create a wide range of painful and irritating symptoms.\n\nThe re-engineered enzyme, named KumaMax, appears to be highly effective, at least in a test tube. It dismantled more than 95 percent of a gluten peptide that is thought to cause celiac disease, according to the study, which was published recently in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.\n\nIdeally, the team could develop the enzyme into a food additive such as the gas remedies Beano or Gas-X and offer it without a prescription, said lead study author Justin Siegel, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of California, Davis. But this could take a few years to develop. If the researchers opt to make a prescription drug, the process of clinical trials and obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval could take a decade or more, he said.\n\nAn enzyme is a protein that performs a chemical reaction. Proteins are the workhorses in every cell of every living thing, and their function is defined by their shape and structure.\n\nIn this case, the researchers re-engineered the natural enzyme to recognize the peptide that triggers celiac disease and modified the protein in the laboratory so it would survive the acidic stomach environment. \"We did the engineering to change the genes and sent that into standard microorganisms to create the protein,\" Siegel said.\n\nThe next step is to show that the enzyme is not toxic and functions as designed in animals. \"It shouldn't be toxic; it's just a protein you're eating,\" Siegel said.\n\nHow effective might the enzyme be? \"For some people, even flour in the air makes them stop breathing. Some are very sensitive, and in some it just upsets their stomach a little,\" Siegel said. \"For those who are hypersensitive, this probably is not going to solve the problem, but it would allow them to go to dinner, and in case any gluten ended up in their meal, they wouldn't have to worry about it.\"\n\n\"For those less sensitive, they could pop one before each meal and eat anything they want,\" he added.\n\nThe process of identifying the precise trigger for a disease or condition and engineering a drug to circumvent the disease-causing process is part of what some call the personalized medicine revolution, Siegel said. \"We can design a small molecule, a pill, that can be specific to an exact target and have few side effects, if any,\" he said.\n\nSome experts identified limitations to the research.\n\n\"This is the earliest phase, and you now have to show that it actually breaks down the gluten peptides that trigger a response in the stomach at a speed that will protect the human,\" said Dr. Joseph Murray, a professor of medicine in the division of gastroenterology and the department of immunology at the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minn. \"Let's see how it goes with a whole slice of bread.\"\n\nMurray said that dismantling 95 percent of the protein component that is thought to trigger celiac disease may still not be enough to provide celiac patients protection. \"It will probably be helpful to someone who gets a low-level exposure [to glutens] by accident,\" he said.\n\nBut celiac disease is a common problem, with about 2 million to 3 million Americans suffering from it. \"People need alternatives, and this is an example of the scientific community taking novel approaches to helping people with celiac disease,\" Murray said.\n\nLearn more about celiac disease from the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The expert source quoted at the end of the article provides some very important context.

Four years after the procedure, patients over 65 who had coronary artery bypass surgeries (called CABG or \"cabbages\") were almost 20 percent less likely to die.\n\nPut another way, 21 percent of stented patients had died after four years compared with 16 percent of surgery patients.\n\nIs that a big difference?

Currently, guidelines reserve breast MRI screening for women who have a strong family history or other specific breast cancer risk factors. MRI screening has not been considered necessary for women at average risk, and there has been resistance to expansion of MRI into this population due, in part, to concern over higher costs.\n\nHowever, with breast cancer remaining a major cause of cancer death in women, there is good reason to pursue the search for improved screening methods, according to the study's lead author, Christiane Kuhl, M.D., chair of the Department of Radiology at RWTH Aachen University in Aachen, Germany.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2013, Dr. Kuhl and colleagues studied breast MRI's impact on 2,120 women, ages 40 to 70, with less than a 15 percent lifetime risk of breast cancer. The women had normal screening mammograms and, in the case of those with dense breast tissue, normal screening ultrasound. Breast MRI detected 60 additional breast cancers, including 40 invasive cancers, for an overall supplemental cancer detection rate of 15.5 per 1,000 women. Of the 60 cancers detected in the study group over the observation period (7,007 screening rounds), 59 were found only using MRI, one was found also by mammography, and none by mammography or ultrasound alone.\n\nAccording to Dr. Kuhl, the results suggest that MRI can serve as a useful supplemental screening tool for women at average risk, especially those with dense mammographic tissue, and that MRI is superior to supplemental ultrasound for this purpose.\n\nThe results also highlight the ability of MRI in the detection of more aggressive types of cancer.\n\n\"The faster a cancer grows and the better it is in seeding metastases, the better will it be picked up early by MRI,\" Dr. Kuhl said. \"In our cohort, cancers found by MRI alone exhibited features of rapid growth at pathology.\"\n\nThis ability is especially important in women with dense breast tissue in which aggressive cancers may be missed on mammography. Left undetected, these cancers will grow to become clinically palpable cancers, also known as interval cancers. The new study showed that, consistent with previous research, breast MRI can depict these rapidly growing cancers with high reliability.\n\nAccording to Dr. Kuhl, interval cancers exhibit an adverse biologic profile and are the main driver of breast cancer mortality. Additional cancers detected by MRI screening in the study had a skewed distribution towards a higher-than-normal prevalence or incidence of rapidly growing (grade 3) cancers.\n\n\"The interval cancer rate in our study was zero percent. Not a single cancer was undetected that became palpable,\" she said. \"This suggests that MRI finds breast cancers that also mammography would find, but MRI detects them earlier, and it finds the cancers which, if MRI had not been done, would have progressed to interval cancers.\"\n\n\"Supplemental Breast MR Imaging Screening of Women with Average Risk of Breast Cancer.\" Collaborating with Dr. Kuhl were Kevin Strobel, M.D., Heribert Bieling, M.Sc., Claudia Leutner, M.D., Hans H.

(AP Photo/Teresa Crawford)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 It was launched decades ago as an anesthetic for animals and people, became a potent battlefield pain reliever in Vietnam and morphed into the trippy club drug Special K.\n\nNow the chameleon drug ketamine is finding new life as an unapproved treatment for depression and suicidal behavior. Clinics have opened around the United States promising instant relief with their \u201cunique\u201d doses of ketamine in IVs, sprays or pills. And desperate patients are shelling out thousands of dollars for treatment often not covered by health insurance, with scant evidence on long-term benefits and risks.\n\nChicago preschool teacher Lauren Pestikas long struggled with depression and anxiety and made several suicide attempts before trying ketamine earlier this year.\n\nThe price tag so far is about $3,000, but \u201cit\u2019s worth every dime and penny,\u201d said the 36-year-old.\n\nPestikas said she feels much better for a few weeks after each treatment, but the effects wear off and she scrambles to find a way to pay for another one.\n\nFor now, ketamine has not received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating depression, though doctors can use it for that purpose.\n\nKetamine has been around since the 1960s and is widely used as an anesthesia drug during surgery because it doesn\u2019t suppress breathing. Compared to opioids such as morphine, ketamine isn\u2019t as addictive and doesn\u2019t cause breathing problems. And some studies have shown that ketamine can ease symptoms within hours for the toughest cases.\n\nIts potential effects on depression were discovered in animal experiments in the late 1980s and early 1990s showing that glutamate, a brain chemical messenger, might play a role in depression, and that drugs including ketamine that target the glutamate pathway might work as antidepressants.\n\nConventional antidepressants like Prozac target serotonin, a different chemical messenger, and typically take weeks to months to kick in \u2014 a lag that can cause severely depressed patients to sink deeper into despair.\n\nKetamine\u2019s potential for almost immediate if temporary relief is what makes it so exciting, said Dr. Jennifer Vande Voort, a Mayo Clinic psychiatrist who has used ketamine to treat depression patients since February.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of things that provide that kind of effect. What I worry about is that it gets so hyped up,\u201d she said.\n\nThe strongest studies suggest it\u2019s most useful and generally safe in providing short-term help for patients who have not benefited from antidepressants. That amounts to about one-third of the roughly 300 million people with depression worldwide.\n\n\u201cIt truly has revolutionized the field,\u201d changing scientists\u2019 views on how depression affects the brain and showing that rapid relief is possible, said Yale University psychiatrist Dr. Gerard Sanacora, who has done research for or consulted with companies seeking to develop ketamine-based drugs.\n\nBut to become standard depression treatment, he said, much more needs to be known.\n\nLast year, Sanacora co-authored an American Psychiatric Association task force review of ketamine treatment for mood disorders that noted the benefits but said \u201cmajor gaps\u201d remain in knowledge about long-term effectiveness and safety. Most studies have been small, done in research settings and not in the real world.\n\nWhen delivered through an IV, ketamine can cause a rapid increase in heart rate and blood pressure that could be dangerous for some patients. Ketamine also can cause hallucinations that some patients find scary.\n\n\u201cThere are some very real concerns,\u201d Sanacora said. \u201cWe do know this drug can be abused, so we have to be very careful about how this is developed.\u201d\n\nDr. Rahul Khare, an emergency medicine specialist in Chicago, first learned about ketamine\u2019s other potential benefits a decade ago from a depressed and anxious patient he was preparing to sedate to fix a repeat dislocated shoulder.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Doc, give me what I got last time. For about three weeks after I got it I felt so much better,\u2019\u201d Khare recalled.\n\nKhare became intrigued and earlier this year began offering ketamine for severe depression at an outpatient clinic he opened a few years ago. He also joined the American Society for Ketamine Physicians, formed a year ago representing about 140 U.S. doctors, nurses, psychologists and others using ketamine for depression or other nonapproved uses.\n\nThere are about 150 U.S. ketamine clinics, compared with about 20 three years ago, said society co-founder Dr. Megan Oxley.\n\nKhare said the burgeoning field \u201cis like a new frontier\u201d where doctors gather at meetings and compare notes. He has treated about 50 patients with depression including Pestikas. They\u2019re typically desperate for relief after failing to respond to other antidepressants. Some have lost jobs and relationships because of severe depression, and most find that ketamine allows them to function, Khare said.\n\nTypical treatment at his clinic involves six 45-minute sessions over about two weeks, costing $550 each. Some insurers will pay about half of that, covering Khare\u2019s office visit cost. Patients can receive \u201cbooster\u201d treatments. They must sign a four-page consent form that says benefits may not be long-lasting, lists potential side effects, and in bold letters states that the treatment is not government-approved.\n\nAt a recent session, Pestikas\u2019s seventh, she leaned back on a reclining white examining-room chair as a nurse hooked her up to a heart and blood pressure monitor. She grimaced as a needle was slipped into the top of her left palm. Khare reached up with a syringe to inject a small dose of ketamine into an IV bag hanging above the chair, then dimmed the lights, pulled the window curtains and asked if she had questions and was feeling OK.\n\nPestikas listened to music on her iPhone and watched psychedelic videos. She said it was like \u201ca controlled acid trip\u201d with pleasant hallucinations. The trip ends soon after the IV is removed, but Pestikas said she feels calm and relaxed the rest of the day, and that the mood boost can last weeks.\n\nStudies suggest that a single IV dose of ketamine far smaller than used for sedation or partying can help many patients gain relief within about four hours and lasting nearly a week or so.\n\nExactly how ketamine works is unclear, but one idea is that by elevating glutamate levels, ketamine helps nerve cells re-establish connections that were disabled by depression, said ketamine expert Dr. Carlos Zarate, chief of experimental therapies at the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\nA small Stanford University study published in August suggested that ketamine may help relieve depression by activating the brain\u2019s opioid receptors.\n\nJanssen Pharmaceuticals and Allergan are among drug companies developing ketamine-like drugs for depression. Janssen leads the effort with its nasal spray esketamine. The company filed a new drug application in September.\n\nMeanwhile, dozens of studies are underway seeking to answer some of the unknowns about ketamine including whether repeat IV treatments work better for depression and if there\u2019s a way to zero in on which patients are most likely to benefit.\n\nUntil there are answers, Zarate of the mental health institute said ketamine should be a last-resort treatment for depression after other methods have failed.\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

Nelson, the first author of the journal article and an internist and professor at the Oregon Health and Science University.\n\nThe report is based on a review of 43 studies of various nonhormonal drugs being used for hot flashes. Most were originally approved for other purposes. The drugs include the antidepressants Paxil (paroxetine), Effexor (venlafaxine), Prozac (fluoxetine) and Celexa (citalopram), the blood pressure drug Catapres (clonidine), and the seizure drug Neurontin (gabapentin). Some came into use for menopause because women taking them for other reasons told doctors the drugs seemed to diminish their hot flashes.\n\nThe researchers also examined studies of nonprescription extracts from soy and red clover, which contain plant estrogens called isoflavones and are marketed as a \"natural\" treatment for hot flashes.\n\nNone of the drugs or extracts are approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat hot flashes \u2014 only hormones are approved for that purpose \u2014 but doctors are free to prescribe medicines for any use they see fit, and many recommend the drugs or plant products for hot flashes, based on study findings and their patients' experiences.\n\nThe researchers found that on average, antidepressants and Catapres each appeared to reduce hot flashes by about one per day, and Neurontin by about two per day. For women with a lot of hot flashes, that is not a very impressive performance, Dr. Nelson said, but she added that the drugs may also lessen their severity.\n\nEstrogen, by comparison, gets rid of two to three flashes a day, and also makes them milder, Dr. Nelson said. Though hormones cause small increases in the risks for breast cancer and heart disease, a short course may still be the best choice for women with very severe symptoms, she said, though she added that women who have had breast cancer should definitely not take hormones.\n\nAll the nonhormonal drugs have side effects. The antidepressants can cause headache, nausea, dry mouth, dizziness and insomnia or sleepiness. Catapres can cause some of the same symptoms and also constipation. Neurontin causes sleepiness, and soy extracts can produce gastrointestinal troubles.\n\nAmong the antidepressants, Paxil seemed to have the strongest evidence of benefit. There were only two studies for Effexor, just one of which suggested it might help.\n\nFor the other antidepressants, Prozac and Celexa, and for the plant extracts, there was no statistically significant evidence that they worked for hot flashes.\n\n\"But I wouldn't want any drug company to get an edge,\" Dr. Nelson said. \"It's just where we are today. It's not the end of the story.\"\n\nShe took a cautious view because she and her colleagues found that there was relatively little reliable data on using the drugs for hot flashes. Of 10 studies on antidepressants, for instance, the researchers judged only two of the studies to be good, and the rest fair or poor. The poor rating often meant a study, even though well conducted, was too small or too short to be conclusive.\n\n\"If there were only 20 women in the study, how do we say it's appropriate for all the women in the country?\" Dr. Nelson said.\n\n\"Now we know what we need,\" she said. \"More bigger studies on more things.\"\n\nIn the meantime, both Dr. Tice and Dr. Nelson said that for women who find their symptoms intolerable and want treatment, they would favor antidepressants over hormones. But Dr. Tice warned that the drugs should not be used long term.\n\n\"I wouldn't encourage the mindset of putting women on these drugs thinking they're going to be on them for life,\" he said, adding that patients should try the drugs for a few months and then try to stop.\n\n\"We hate to medicalize a natural process,\" Dr. Nelson said, but she added that severe symptoms should not be dismissed. \"We want to take it seriously, but not everybody needs to be on prescription drugs for it.\"", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The study was not funded by any of the drug manufacturers with medications under study in the review.

Such an analysis is months away. And they pointed out that the study offers no reassurance about the safety of smoking or the advisability of CT scans for younger smokers or nonsmokers.\n\n\u201cNo one should come away from this thinking that it\u2019s now safe to continue to smoke,\u201d said Dr. Harold E. Varmus, director of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nPatients wishing to get a CT lung screen will most likely have to pay the roughly $300 charge themselves, since few insurers pay for such scans unless an illness is suspected. The federal Medicare program will soon reconsider paying for such screens, a Medicare official said.\n\nThe study, called the National Lung Screening Trial, was conducted by the American College of Radiology Imaging Network and the cancer institute. It involved more than 53,000 people ages 55 to 74 who had smoked at least 30 pack-years \u2014 one pack a day for 30 years or two packs a day for 15 years. Ex-smokers who had quit within the previous 15 years were included in the group.\n\nEach was given either a standard chest X-ray or a low-dose CT scan at the start of the trial and then twice more over the next two years. Participants were followed for up to five years. There were 354 lung cancer deaths among those who received CT scans and 442 among those who got X-rays. The $250 million study, which began in 2002, was paid for by the cancer institute and carried out at 33 sites.\n\nIts preliminary results were announced days after an independent monitoring board determined that the benefits of CT scans were strong enough to stop the trial. The study will be published in the coming months.\n\nThe study found that for every 300 people who were screened, one person lived who would otherwise have died during the study. But one-quarter of those given CT scans were found to have anomalies, nearly all of which were benign. These false signals generally led to more worry, more CT scans and sometimes to lung biopsies and thoracic surgery.\n\n\u201cThere are economic, medical and psychological consequences of finding these abnormalities,\u201d Dr. Varmus said.\n\nDeaths due to all causes declined by 7 percent among study participants who received CT scans, suggesting the tests helped to detect other life-threatening diseases besides lung cancer.\n\nDr. Claudia Henschke, a clinical professor of radiology at Mount Sinai Medical Center and a longtime advocate for use of CT to screen for lung cancer, said the study was likely to have underestimated the benefits of CT scans because participants were screened only three times. Had the screening continued for 10 years, as many as 80 percent of lung cancer deaths could have been averted, she said. Dr. Henschke\u2019s research has been controversial because of its statistical methods and its financing, which included money from a tobacco company. She earns royalties from makers of CT machines.\n\n\u201cWhat we also have found is that low-dose CT scan gives information on cardiovascular disease, emphysema\u201d and other pulmonary diseases, Dr. Henschke said. \u201cThose are the three big killers of older people. There is just tremendous potential.\u201d\n\nBut Dr. Edward F. Patz Jr., professor of radiology at Duke who helped devise the study, said he was far from convinced that a thorough analysis would show that widespread CT screening would prove beneficial in preventing most lung cancer deaths. Dr. Patz said that the biology of lung cancer has long suggested that the size of cancerous lung tumors tells little about the stage of the disease.\n\n\u201cIf we look at this study carefully, we may suggest that there is some benefit in high-risk individuals, but I\u2019m not there yet,\u201d Dr. Patz said.\n\nSince 46 million people in the United States smoke and tens of millions more once smoked, a widespread screening program could cost billions annually. Any further refinement of those most at risk could reduce those costs. Low-dose CT scans expose patients to about the same radiation levels as mammograms. Little is known about how the cumulative risks of years of such scans would balance the benefits.\n\nThe study\u2019s results could have both legal and political consequences. Suits against tobacco companies have sought to force cigarette makers to pay for annual CT screens of former smokers. But with the science uncertain, those claims have so far been rebuffed. Congress has diverted some research money to create pilot CT lung screening programs, diversions that may gain momentum now.\n\nSome Obama administration officials argued during the debate on the health care law that patients\u2019 health was often harmed by getting too many tests and procedures that, if reduced, would improve health while reducing costs. This study suggests that, at least in lung cancer, spending more on tests saves lives.\n\nLaurie Fenton, president of the Lung Cancer Alliance, which has lobbied for widespread CT lung screening, said the debate about the advisability of such scans is now over.\n\n\u201cThe challenge now shifts from proving the efficacy of the method to developing the proper quality standards, infrastructure and guidelines to bring this needed benefit to those at high risk for the disease \u2014 now,\u201d Ms. Fenton said.\n\nBut Dr. Peter B. Bach, a pulmonologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said no one should rush out and get a CT scan yet because further analysis will better define whom the screening helped.\n\n\u201cVery soon we\u2019ll have an answer about who should be screened and how frequently,\u201d Dr. Bach said, \u201cbut we don\u2019t have that answer today.\u201d", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "\n\n\n\nThere is an independent source and the story reports that the trial was government-financed. \nHowever, the story does not tell readers that the independent source, Dr. Claudia Henschke, has been a loud critic of this trial.

Patients with large-vessel occlusions can then be routed to a Comprehensive Stroke Center with endovascular capabilities. In contrast, a standard physical examination achieved only 40 to 89 percent accuracy in identifying patients with large-vessel occlusion who could benefit from endovascular therapy.\n\nThe volumetric impedance phase shift spectroscopy (VIPS) device (Cerebrotech VisorTM, Cerebrotech Medical Systems, Pleasanton, CA) works by sending low-energy radio waves through the brain that change frequency when passing through fluids. Such waves are reflected back through the brain and then detected by the device. When a patient is having a severe stroke, the brain's fluids will change, producing an asymmetry in the radio waves detected by the VIPS device. The greater the asymmetry, the more severe the stroke.\n\nEndovascular therapy within 24 hours is the standard of care for emergent large-vessel occlusion, but the chance of achieving a good outcome decreases by approximately 20 percent for each hour that passes before treatment.\n\nThe researchers hope that the device will save valuable time -- especially important in stroke where time is brain -- when it is deployed with emergency medical personnel in the field. This is because the accuracy of the device simplifies the decision made by emergency personnel about where to take patients first, according to Raymond D. Turner, M.D., professor of neurosurgery and chief of the Neuroscience Integrated Center of Clinical Excellence at MUSC. Turner served as principal investigator for MUSC in the VIPS for the Non-Invasive Detection of Hemispheric Bioimpedance Asymmetry in Severe Brain Pathology (VITAL) study reported in the article.\n\n\"Transfer between hospitals takes a lot of time,\" said Turner. \"If we can give the information to emergency personnel out in the field that this is a large-vessel occlusion, that should change their thought process in triage as to which hospital they go to.\"\n\nIn the study, the VIPS device was deployed with emergency medical personnel in regions served by five Comprehensive Stroke Centers equipped with the endovascular capabilities to treat large-vessel occlusions that underlie severe stroke. Their goal was to use the device to accurately identify severe stroke and then compare the results to established physical examination methods practiced by emergency personnel such as the Prehospital Acute Stroke Severity Scale.\n\nBoth healthy participants and patients with suspected stroke were evaluated by emergency personnel using the VIPS device. Three readings were taken and averaged -- a process that takes about 30 seconds. Patients were also later evaluated by neurologists who provided definitive diagnoses using neuroimaging.\n\nCompared to the neurologists' diagnoses, the device displayed 92 percent specificity -- the ability to detect the difference between patients with severe stroke and those with other conditions such as mild stroke or healthy participants with no brain pathology. This places the VIPS device above standard physical examination tools used by emergency personnel that display specificity scores between 40 and 89 percent.\n\nThe VIPS device is made by Cerebrotech Medical Systems, which paid consultants to analyze the neuroimaging data independently. The neuroimaging data was needed to teach the VIPS device which radio waves were indicative of stroke. Yet the consultants did not have access to the VIPS radio wave data during their review of the images, thereby eliminating the potential of the consultants to choose data that might artificially inflate the device's accuracy. It is also not clear how the device would work for patients with cranial implants, as metal interferes with the device's operating radio frequencies.\n\nThe device's success may be found in its ability to give emergency personnel a clear answer as to whether a patient is experiencing a severe stroke. The VIPS device requires very little training to operate compared to that required to learn standard emergency examination skills, thereby reducing the possibility of human error during emergency diagnosis.\n\nIn their next steps, the researchers are undertaking the VITAL 2.0 study to determine if the VIPS device can use complex machine learning algorithms to teach itself how to discriminate between minor and severe stroke without the help of neurologists. If so, the VIPS device could have widespread clinical implications, helping emergency personnel decide whether to take a patient to a comprehensive stroke center or a primary stroke center for treatment.\n\nTurner likens the use of the VIPS device in detecting severe stroke to the use of electrocardiography (ECG) to definitively detect acute myocardial infarction. He predicts that the device has the potential to be used widely by emergency personnel but also to appear in other public spaces. \"This could potentially be something like a defibrillator,\" said Turner. \"You can find out if a patient is having a stroke, just like you can put a defibrillator on a patient to see if they're having a heart attack.\"\n\nThis study was funded by Cerebrotech Medical Systems.\n\nAbout MUSC Founded in 1824 in Charleston, The Medical University of South Carolina is the oldest medical school in the South.

Uslaner is director of In Vivo Pharmacology at Merck & Co., which funded the study.\n\nMerck already has one such drug, suvorexant, under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nMore than 30 million Americans struggle to get a good night's sleep, and about one-third of these use drugs to help the process, the study authors pointed out.\n\nBut widely prescribed sleep medications such as Ambien (zolpidem) and Lunesta (eszopiclone) can leave people feeling hung over and inattentive the next day. So much so that the FDA recently cut recommended doses of Ambien and other drugs that contain zolpidem for fear that their use, even the night before, might impair driving or other activities the next day.\n\nLunesta and Ambien affect GABA receptors, which are found throughout the brain and are associated with side effects, including thinking disturbances, and deficits in attention and memory, explained Uslaner.\n\nAbout 15 years ago, scientists discovered chemical messengers known as orexins, which are released by a relatively small brain region known as the lateral hypothalamus. This area of the brain releases orexins during the day to keep us awake and lowers levels at night so we can sleep.\n\nThe appeal of orexin antagonists, said Dr. Michael Thorpy, director of the Sleep-Wake Disorders Center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, is that they \"target a system that's more specific for sleep.\"\n\nThat means, theoretically, fewer side effects and perhaps less of a tendency to be habit forming, Thorpy explained.\n\nUslaner and his colleagues investigated a compound called DORA-22, which has the same mechanism of action as suvorexant, to see how it fared alongside not only Ambien and Lunesta but also diazepam (Valium) in rats and rhesus monkeys.\n\nDORA-22 did not lead to the same mental impairments as the other three drugs. Rhesus monkeys and rats performed just as well on memory and attention tasks shortly after being administered DORA-22 as they did on an inactive placebo.\n\nIn each case, the minimum dose to achieve sleep was compared with the minimum dose that altered memory and thinking. DORA-22 promoted sleep at lower doses than those that impaired mental skills when compared with the \"control\" drugs.\n\nThis is the first time in years that scientists have targeted a totally different receptor in the quest to combat insomnia, said Dr. Alexandre Abreu, co-director of the UHealth Sleep Center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.\n\nBut many questions remain: Do the drugs truly have fewer side effects? Will they be habit forming? And will they change the quality of sleep in any way?\n\nThose questions will only be answered with more testing and use in humans, he said.\n\nExperts note that findings from animal studies do not always hold up in human trials.\n\nThe U.S. National Institutes of Health has more on insomnia.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story reports that the researchers work for Merck, the maker of a drug similar to the one they tested.

And while this study showed some symptomatic improvement, it didn't have enough objective data to show that the new technique would surpass surgery, she said.\n\nBenign prostate hyperplasia, also known as enlarged prostate, is a non-cancerous condition familiar to millions of aging males. The condition occurs when the prostate gland slowly enlarges and presses on the urethra, constricting the flow of urine.\n\nEnlarged prostate is characterized by a host of unpleasant symptoms, including weak or slow urine flow, an urgent need to urinate frequently, incomplete bladder emptying and having to get up repeatedly at night to urinate.\n\nThe surgery for enlarged prostate -- transurethral resection of the prostate, or TURP -- is used for men whose prostates are smaller than 60 to 80 cubic centimeters. The procedure is performed under general anesthesia and involves a hospital stay.\n\nMeanwhile, there is no size limitation for PAE, which requires only local anesthesia and also lowers the risk of other side effects, such as blood loss and retrograde ejaculation, which occurs when semen leaks into the bladder, researchers said. PAE can be an outpatient procedure as well.\n\nFor the procedure, a catheter is inserted into the femoral artery in the groin. The catheter delivers tiny \"grains\" to the arteries that lead to the prostate, which block blood flow and lead to shriveling of the gland.\n\nIn this study, PAE helped most of the 67 patients who underwent the procedure, according to the researchers, who noted that 66 men who had not responded to medications experienced improvements in symptoms as well as a reduction in prostate volume. After nine months, none had experienced sexual dysfunction and 25 percent still reported improvements.\n\nHowever, the authors did not see as great an improvement in \"urodynamic\" results, such as improved flow rate of the urine, which would indicate how well the bladder and urethra are performing; in this area, the patients did not improve as much as those who underwent TURP surgery, they noted.\n\nAnother drawback is that few doctors are trained in PAE so far, said Pisco, chair of radiology at Hospital Pulido Valente and professor in the Faculty of Medical Sciences at New University of Lisbon in Portugal.\n\nOther minimally invasive treatments for enlarged prostate that are currently available are less effective and have a greater risk of a need for reoperation, according to background materials that accompanied the study.\n\nDr. Franklin Lowe, associate director of urology at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York City, said PAE was \"unlikely\" to be used much to treat enlarged prostate.\n\nCurrent surgical procedures typically require no more than one night in the hospital and complications such as incontinence and impotence are uncommon, he said.\n\n\"PAE is potentially fraught with complications,\" Lowe said, adding that the study follow-up of less than one year was short for a disease that lasts decades.\n\nSince the study is being presented at a medical meeting and has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, the findings should be considered preliminary.\n\nThe U.S. National Institutes of Health has more on enlarged prostate.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Clinicians with expertise in treating benign prostatic hyperplasia and without apparent ties to the study reported on were quoted in this story.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Do this and similar exercises hundreds of times over multiple sessions weekly; continue for months; and, gradually, presbyopia lessens, a number of studies show.\n\nOne study also examined functions of the eye itself and found none of these improvements were because of changes in the eye.

For example, a study tested the approach in 23 young adults, around age 24. Compared with a control group of 20 young adults, the treatment group increased letter recognition speed. Similar training is an effective component in treating amblyopia, also called \u201clazy eye,\u201d which is the most frequent cause of vision loss in infants and children, affecting 3 percent of the population.

That typically happens to people with the mysterious illness commonly known as chronic fatigue syndrome. Research findings from Stanford University released Monday could point the way to a long-sought diagnostic laboratory test for the condition, and possibly a first-ever treatment.\n\nBelieved to affect at least a million people in the U.S., the condition is now increasingly termed myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS for short.\n\nMany patients see the name \"chronic fatigue syndrome\" as trivializing and misleading, giving the impression that they're simply tired or depressed. In fact, they're experiencing profound exhaustion that isn't relieved with sleep, flu-like symptoms, muscle pain, \"brain fog\" and various other physical symptoms, all of which characteristically worsen with even minor exertion. (A 2015 Institute of Medicine report proposed the name \"systemic exertion intolerance disease,\" but it hasn't really stuck.)\n\nThe symptoms can range from mild to extremely severe, with about a quarter of patients so ill they're mostly or completely confined to bed. Now, the Stanford researchers have linked ME/CFS to variations in certain cytokines, immune-signaling proteins, that track with illness severity. The study results were published online Monday in the the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe link to gradation in severity, rather than simply seeking a positive versus negative result, represents a new approach to the search for biological markers for the illness. The study involved 192 ME/CFS patients and 392 healthy controls matched for age and sex. Out of 51 cytokines investigated via sophisticated fluorescence-based testing, only two of the cytokines differed, in their total concentrations, between the ME/CFS and control groups.\n\nBut, levels of 17 of the cytokines varied dramatically between the patients with mild versus severe ME/CFS symptoms. Of those 17 cytokines, 13 were types that promote inflammation. This is significant because symptoms in these patients and findings from other studies also suggest that chronic inflammation plays a major role in the illness.\n\n\"This is a field that has been full of skepticism and misconception, where patients have been viewed to have invented their disease. These data clearly show the contrary, and demonstrate what can be achieved when we couple good research design with new technology,\" lead author Dr. Jose Montoya, professor of infectious diseases at Stanford, tells Shots.\n\nAccording to Dr. Anthony L. Komaroff, a Harvard internist and epidemiologist who has written a commentary to accompany the study, \"For many years medical scientists have speculated that the symptoms of ME/CFS might be caused by cytokines, molecules that the immune system use to wage war against foreign invaders of the body. Past studies have shown high levels of many cytokines but it was not clear that these high levels were causing symptoms.\"\n\nWhat the latest research shows, Komaroff tells Shots, is that \"levels of many cytokines do correlate with symptoms: The higher the blood level, the worse the symptoms. That supports the theory that the cytokines are a cause of the symptoms.\"\n\nSo why do routine lab tests that doctors order often come back negative or not informative in ME/CFS patients? Simply put, Montoya says, those tests aren't measuring the right things.\n\nTwo classic laboratory measures of inflammation are sedimentation rate \u2014 the ability of red blood cells to clump together, which isn't a factor in ME/CFS \u2014 and C-reactive protein, which reflects levels of a single cytokine that wasn't one of those linked to severity in this study.\n\n\"Inflammation is much more complicated than two imperfect old measures,\" Montoya says. \"We're showing an inflammation that has not been seen before.\"\n\nThe multidisciplinary Stanford team is now working on developing a panel that could be used commercially, that would test for around five of the 17 cytokines and would likely involve the doctor first classifying patients by severity in order to interpret the results. Such a test could both establish the diagnosis and serve to monitor patients' responses to treatment.\n\nWhat's more, the findings also point to possible treatment with immune-modifying or anti-inflammatory therapy. Montoya hopes that by publishing these findings \"a team of researchers somewhere in the world will see these cytokines and say they have the drug for that inflammation. We hope drug companies will pursue it.\"\n\nIndeed, a major drug trial is now being conducted in Norway investigating whether the immune-modifying drug rituximab alleviates ME/CFS symptoms, after preliminary studies suggested that it did in some patients.

Improvements in symptoms were greatest in patients diagnosed with normal coronary arteries or who had their medications discontinued and least in those with moderate nonobstructive disease or who received new prescriptions.\n\n\u201cAlthough CTCA removes diagnostic uncertainty and halves the rate of subsequent heart attacks, quality of life can be negatively impacted in those who are worried about their health and are found to have nonobstructive coronary artery disease,\u201d Newby said. \u201cMuch like screening tests for cancer, being told you have heart disease does not make the patient feel better,\u201d he added.\n\nIf a doctor is faced with a patient who is already on an aspirin and statin with an unconfirmed and questionable clinical diagnosis of angina due to coronary heart disease, he said, then CTCA would be useful because finding normal heart anatomy means that more invasive testing can be avoided, treatment could be stopped and quality of life improved.\n\n\u201cIf, however, a patient presents with atypical symptoms and is on no therapy, then the clinician needs to discuss with the patient the implications of potential CTCA findings, including nonobstructive disease that would mandate life-long preventative therapy,\u201d Newby said. \u201cCertainly, this is something we now discuss in more detail with our patients, some of whom have declined CTCA.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was striking for me that health status was very much related to receiving a (treatable) diagnosis or excluding such a diagnosis, rather than experiencing angina symptoms per se,\u201d said Dr. Paula M.

A genetic condition left her with intellectual disabilities and a weak immune system. By 26, she had endured dozens of bacterial infections \u2014 kidney, ear, sinus, heart, bone, and more \u2014 and taken hundreds of antibiotic pills. But when she entered the Harborview Hospital in Seattle for a foot operation, her body\u2019s defenses were pushed to a new limit. Hospitals are hotbeds for nasty \u2014 and sometimes deadly \u2014 infections. After her surgery, Rachel\u2019s lungs picked up two: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both bugs are part of a growing category of bacterial infections that don\u2019t respond to traditional antibiotics. Rachel was supposed to be in the hospital for five days. She stayed nine weeks. She developed pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and was put on a ventilator with a tube down her throat. When her doctors finally released her, they told her mother she had three years to live, at most, before the bugs won. Three years later, in January 2010, Rachel was indeed close to death. She was spending half of every month in intensive care, the other half at home, an IV constantly dripping into her bloodstream. By then she had cycled through more than a dozen powerful antibiotics. Each time the doctors would give her a new drug, then watch helplessly as the bacteria overpowered it. \u201cEvery time we took her back to the hospital, it was a question of whether or not this was going to be it,\u201d her mother, Rose George, told BuzzFeed News. One day the nurse on duty asked Rose if she\u2019d ever considered phage therapy. Rose had never heard of it, and that\u2019s unsurprising: The therapy, which uses specialized viruses (called bacteriophages) to kill bacteria, is only available in a handful of former Soviet countries. Rose asked her daughter\u2019s doctor, but she\u2019d never heard of phage either. Soon Rose was on the phone with doctors at a small clinic in Tbilisi, in the Republic of Georgia, ordering 100 glass vials of viruses at $8 a pop. She\u2019s one of at least 300 people desperate enough to try this little-known viral therapy from Eastern Europe. It\u2019s an extreme solution to what may be this century\u2019s biggest medical crisis: the death of antibiotics.\n\nSince the discovery of penicillin in 1928, scientists have amassed a medical arsenal of more than 130 antibiotics. The drugs have prevented soldiers from losing limbs, and mothers from dying during childbirth. With access to antibiotics, parents no longer worry about losing their kid to an ear infection or bad scrape. But now antibiotics are everywhere \u2014 not just in orange pill bottles, but in the food given to pigs, cattle, and chicken. And the more the bugs interact with antibiotics, the quicker they evolve defense mechanisms. At least 18 strains of bacteria have evolved into \u201csuperbugs,\u201d becoming resistant to most of our drugs. And pharmaceutical companies, more interested in profitable blockbusters like Viagra and Zoloft, haven\u2019t developed a new class of antibiotics in 25 years. We\u2019re dying because of it. More than 23,000 people in the U.S. die each year from antibiotic-resistant infections. By 2050, an estimated 10 million people worldwide will die by superbug. After two decades of warnings from the scientific community, the problem is finally getting serious attention. In his 2016 budget proposal released today, U.S. President Obama threw $1.2 billion at tackling the antibiotic-resistance crisis \u2014 nearly double the amount allocated last year. If approved by Congress, this money will go toward screening soil samples for new antibiotics, reducing the drugs in livestock feed, boosting hospital surveillance, and, perhaps, making phage therapy a viable option in the U.S. Phages are bacteria\u2019s natural enemies. They work by injecting their DNA inside bacterial cells, where they replicate wildly, produce new phages, and eventually cause the bacteria to rupture \u2014 releasing even more viruses to hunt for bacterial prey. Phages\u2019 power comes from two places: They are the most common and diverse organisms on Earth, and each phage harms only specific strains of bacteria. When you turn on the faucet, millions of phages flow out with your tap water. That leaves a nearly inexhaustible supply of potential agents to use in the fight against infection. Doctors have been using phages to kill bacteria for nearly a century \u2014 just not in the U.S. In 1923, a Georgian doctor named George Eliava set up the first phage therapy clinic, the Eliava Institute, in Tbilisi. Antibiotics hadn\u2019t been discovered yet, so phages were a revolutionary weapon against all kinds of infections, Ryland Young, head of the Center for Phage Technology at Texas A&M University, told BuzzFeed News. \u201cIt was kind of pre-scientific \u2014 no one knew what these phages were except that they worked.\u201d Five years later, penicillin came along. Effective, cheap, and quick to produce in large quantities, doctors in the U.S., U.K., and France quickly seized upon the \u201cmiracle drug\u201d as a key to winning World War II. That also meant keeping this weapon away from the Soviets. With no access to antibiotics, scientists behind the Iron Curtain bolstered their use of phages instead. \u201cAt its very peak, when they were supplying the Russian army, the Eliava Institute was producing two to three tons of phages per day,\u201d Zamphira Alavidze, a microbiologist in Tbilisi who worked at the Eliava Institute for 45 years, told BuzzFeed News. But after the fall of the Soviet Union, Eliava\u2019s phage production dropped significantly, and it downsized into a small research center. Today Georgian doctors frequently use antibiotics to treat infections, but often in combination with phages. \u201cEvery clinic, everywhere in Georgia, everybody uses the phages,\u201d Alavidze said. The last decade, she added, has brought another big change: Two small phage clinics in Tbilisi have sprung up to cater specifically to the boom of international patients like Rachel. \u201cTen or fifteen years ago, nobody believed the phages would be so popular. They thought we were crazy,\u201d Alavidze said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s not too easy to come to Georgia, but we try to help somehow because sometimes nothing else works.\u201d\n\nRandy Wolcott, a wound care doctor in Lubbock, Texas, first went to Tbilisi in 2007. He was fed up with the lack of options for his patients with drug-resistant infections, and wanted to investigate phages as a treatment of last resort. Wolcott spent a week at the Eliava Institute. It looked nothing like the gleaming and sterile high-rises of most U.S. hospitals \u2014 the building was small, some of the equipment looked ancient, and the walls were unpainted. But after observing the Georgian clinicians at work, Wolcott was sold. He walked into a city pharmacy and bought hundreds of vials of phages concocted for wound infections. \u201cThey were very cheap, and I bought them by the case,\u201d Wolcott told BuzzFeed News. The only hiccup came when explaining his viral cargo to U.S. customs officials. \u201cIt can cause some problems when our government hears that you\u2019re bringing viruses back from a former Soviet country,\u201d Wolcott said, chuckling. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain. It\u2019s a virus, but it\u2019s a virus only for bacteria, not for us.\u201d Phages aren\u2019t approved for use in the U.S. So, once back in Lubbock, Wolcott wrote to the Texas Board of Medicine and asked for permission to use the viruses on his wound patients. The board decided that, because these patients had exhausted all other options, Wolcott would be allowed to use the experimental treatment in a legal arrangement known as \u201ccompassionate use.\u201d Wolcott\u2019s patients saw improvement within days. In 11 of the cases, the patients\u2019 wounds healed enough to save their limbs. He treated hundreds of patients using the original batch of phages he brought over from Tbilisi. Five years ago, he went back for more. Wolcott usually uses the phages in combination with traditional antibiotics. But he says he couldn\u2019t have offered the same quality of treatment without the viruses. \u201cSomeone needs to do this in America,\u201d Wolcott said. \u201cTo have a bank of stuff that we can turn to for these chronic infections? That would be huge.\u201d\n\nUntil that happens, though, patients are looking abroad. Rose George\u2019s internet search led her to a clinic in Tbilisi called the Phage Therapy Center. It was set up in 2005 by Phage International, a fledgling medical tourism outfit founded in Danville, California, by a computer scientist named Chris Smith. The center\u2019s doctors asked Rose to send over a bacterial sample from Rachel\u2019s lungs. Over the course of a month, Rose attempted to send several samples, but each was rejected by U.S. customs. Rose\u2019s son tried driving a sample across the border into Canada, which led to a seven-hour interrogation by Canadian agents, followed by two more hours with the FBI on the U.S. side. Finally, Smith suggested that Rose ambiguously label the package as \u201cmedical records.\u201d She did, and the shipment slipped through. A few weeks later, the Georgian doctors called Rose with good news: They would be able to design a concoction of phages to treat Rachel\u2019s infections. After convincing Rachel\u2019s doctor to write a prescription for the viruses (so they could cross the U.S. border), Rose paid the Georgian clinic $800 for a three-month supply. She was surprised that phages were so inexpensive; in contrast, her insurance company was forking over roughly $14,000 a month for Rachel\u2019s antibiotics. A couple of weeks later, 10 boxes filled with 100 vials of phages landed on the Georges\u2019 doorstep. Rose used a nebulizer to administer the phages twice a day so that Rachel could breathe the liquids into her lungs. Within three weeks, Rachel\u2019s MRSA \u2014 the same infection she\u2019d been fighting with antibiotics for three years \u2014 disappeared. It hasn\u2019t returned in the five years since.\n\nAdvocates of phage therapy see it as a powerful new weapon in the war we\u2019re quickly losing against bacterial infection. But phages are certainly not a cure-all. Just ask Roger Mintey, a 65-year-old retired accountant from the sleepy English town of Reigate. In 1991, Mintey caught a severe sinus infection that left him with a near-constant cold. He\u2019s had it, on and off, ever since. In the first decade of fighting his illness, Mintey sought help at five English hospitals, underwent two surgeries, and took more than two dozen courses of antibiotics. Nothing worked. In 2006, he heard about phage therapy from his cousin\u2019s wife, who\u2019d gone to Tbilisi to treat a chronic bladder infection. She pointed Roger to Phage International, the same company that helped Rose George get her daughter\u2019s phages. The Georgian doctors affiliated with the company said they could treat his sinus infection, so Mintey cut Phage International a check for $5,000 and sent a sample of his nasal discharge to Georgia via FedEx. Then, accompanied by a friend, he boarded his first-ever plane to fly to the company\u2019s Phage Therapy Center. They landed in Tbilisi at 3 a.m. and were met by someone from the clinic, who escorted them to their hotel. Mintey was instructed to drink a phage preparation three times a day from his hotel room. Every couple of days he would go into the clinic for additional phage treatments. The clinic was inside a nondescript building, set up something like an indoor mall. \"You went through a set of double doors, passed by a suntanning place, and there you were: one office, two treatment rooms, and that was it,\u201d Mintey told BuzzFeed News. A doctor and two nurses had him sit on a cushioned patient\u2019s chair. They tipped the chair back so his nostrils faced up, and poured the phage liquid into his nose. He was instructed to say the word \u201ccuckoo\u201d as the phages slowly slid into all of his sinuses, seeping out from his nasal passages into his forehead and cheekbones. His nose started bleeding, but the clinicians told him it was nothing to worry about. They also gave him a shot of manuka honey extract in his butt, telling him it had antimicrobial properties. \u201cIt was all quite uncomfortable,\u201d Mintey said. After two weeks, Mintey flew back to England. Three days later, his infection was back. \u201cI realized the entire treatment had done absolutely nothing,\u201d he said. Mintey claims to have called, emailed, faxed, and sent physical letters to his doctors in Georgia and to Phage International\u2019s headquarters in California. He heard nothing back. (Smith, of Phage International, claims that emails sent to Roger at the time were bouncing, and that he only had Mintey\u2019s friend\u2019s phone number.) Eventually, the clinic sent Mintey more phages in the mail, but the infection persisted. He says he has not heard from them since. \u201cI was very disappointed,\u201d Mintey said. \u201cBy the end of 2007, I had given up on phages.\u201d Mintey\u2019s situation highlights many of the difficulties surrounding a therapy only accessible through a small and largely unregulated medical tourism industry. Smith says Phage International has served more than 300 patients to date, with some 4,000 registered on its website. He wants to open a new phage therapy clinic in Trinidad, which could be easier for American patients to visit. \u201cDuring the past 10 years, you\u2019d go to an investor or venture capitalist, and they\u2019d never heard of phage \u2014 and they didn\u2019t want to know about it,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that\u2019s changed.\u201d Nothing about Phage International is decidedly illegal, I. Glenn Cohen, a law professor at Harvard\u2019s Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology and Bioethics, told BuzzFeed News. But there are many ethical issues at play. What happens when something goes wrong? Or, as in Roger\u2019s case, when a patient feels like he\u2019s not getting what he paid for? \u201cWho do you go after? Where do you do it?\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThat\u2019s where things get more tricky.\u201d\n\nThis year, two clinical trials are testing phage treatment against several antibiotic-resistant infections. The first, called Phagoburn, is big, testing 220 burn victims at three European hospitals with a $5.2 million investment from the European Union. The second, led by a Richmond, Virginia-based biotech called AmpliPhi, is smaller and privately funded, but will include a collaboration with the U.S. Army, which has a vested interest in treating wounded soldiers. Both studies will be an important first step in giving phage therapy the credibility it will need to pass muster with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and to gain the support of drug companies needed to fund its eventual commercial development. \u201cBig pharmaceutical companies like stuff to appear in bottles and in tablets,\u201d Jeremy Curnock Cook, AmpliPhi\u2019s CEO, told BuzzFeed News. \u201cThey\u2019re waiting for people like us to come back with the clinical data.\u201d But the biggest obstacle for phage therapy in the U.S. may ultimately have less to do with the science than its implementation into the medical system. Rachel George and Roger Mintey both received personalized phage treatments, meaning that the viruses were selected to specifically attack their particular infections. It\u2019s uncertain whether the FDA would be able to adopt such a tailor-made approach, which stands in such stark contrast to the one-size-fits-most approach of antibiotics. What\u2019s more, because of the number and diversity of phages \u2014 and a regulatory system that\u2019s been set up to deal with manufactured chemicals rather than the messiness of nature \u2014 each phage would have to be tested as its own drug, even if it's used in combination. In a concoction of nine phages designed to treat a mixture of three bacteria, that could mean hundreds of trials. Depending on who you ask, this is viewed as anything from costly to impossible. Regardless of whether phage therapy reaches wide-scale use, one thing is clear: Sticking to the status quo is not an option. With 2 million Americans a year acquiring bacterial infections that are no longer thwarted by antibiotics, the era of blissful overdependence on these onetime miracle drugs is drawing to a close. \u201cI\u2019m quite optimistic about the future of phage,\u201d says Randy Kincaid, senior scientific officer for the arm of the National Institutes of Health that will be overseeing phage therapy development. \u201cBut I think until \u2014 and unless \u2014 people take the more structured approach to understanding and using and developing the treatment, we\u2019ll always be asking what if: What if we\u2019d only done it better, what if we\u2019d only done it the right way.\u201d For Rose George, the knotty issues surrounding phage therapy are all beside the point. The Phage Therapy Center gave her access to a treatment she couldn\u2019t get in her own country. And that treatment is still ongoing. Though phages cleared one of Rachel\u2019s infections beautifully, the other \u2014 the Pseudomonas \u2014 is a stubborn bug. Every three months, the Phage Therapy Center asks Rose to send a new sample from Rachel\u2019s lungs, and when the bacteria mutates, they send a new mixture of phages. Somehow the infection persists. But Rose is grateful that Rachel\u2019s infections are finally under control. While the hospital is still their \u201csecond home\u201d because of Rachel\u2019s numerous other health issues \u2014 she recently had hip replacement surgery and had her gallbladder removed \u2014 the infections are no longer what are bringing here there. \u201cThese people saved my daughter\u2019s life,\u201d Rose said. \u201cIt is crazy that it\u2019s not part of our arsenal.\u201d", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The majority of the sources in the story appear to be advocates for phage therapy.

But this type of light can cause skin cancer and cataracts, so it's not used in public spaces.\n\nHowever, Brenner and his colleagues wondered if a much narrower spectrum of ultraviolet light, far-UVC, might be a safer option.\n\nIn prior studies, they found that far-UVC light killed methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacteria -- a common and dangerous \"superbug\" -- without harming human or mouse skin.\n\nIn this new study, they found that far-UVC light also killed airborne H1N1 virus, a common strain of flu virus.\n\n\"Far-UVC light has a very limited range and cannot penetrate through the outer dead-cell layer of human skin or the tear layer in the eye, so it's not a human health hazard,\" said Brenner, who directs Columbia's Center for Radiological Research.\n\nHowever, \"because viruses and bacteria are much smaller than human cells, far-UVC light can reach their DNA and kill them,\" he said in a university news release.\n\nLamps with this type of UV light currently cost less than $1,000, Brenner said, but that price would likely fall if the lamps were mass-produced.\n\n\"And unlike flu vaccines, far-UVC is likely to be effective against all airborne microbes, even newly emerging strains,\" he said.\n\nTwo flu experts were encouraged by the findings.\n\n\"The prospect of reducing the transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses using far-UV radiation is very exciting,\" said Dr. Michael Grosso, chief medical officer at Huntington Hospital in Huntington, N.Y.\n\n\"Though hand-washing remains critically important, it does not prevent every instance of transmission,\" Grosso said. \"Immunization and antiviral medications are also important, but again, have limitations. It appears that low-dose far-UV light is safe and effective, and has the advantage of inactivating a wide range of disease-causing viruses.\"\n\nDr. Len Horovitz, a pulmonary specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, agreed.\n\nHe noted that the technology's cost \"is not prohibitive, and it is safe. This use can sterilize the air in a public space, reducing the spread of respiratory droplets containing flu viruses and other bacteria and viruses.\"\n\nThe findings were published online Feb. 9 in the journal Scientific Reports.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on flu.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The lead researcher, as well as two physicians not affiliated with the study, are quoted.

During an inflammatory response, immune cells flood the bloodstream with proteins known as cytokines.\n\nDrugs to counteract these cytokines are the newest generation of anti-inflammatories. Some are so new, clinical trials are still testing their efficacy and safety for human use.\n\nThese trials form the basis of the Cambridge research that was published Tuesday in the journal Molecular Psychiatry\n\nBased on previous findings about depression, the team looked at the side effects experienced by patients given anti-cytokine drugs in 20 separate studies. All the participants had chronic autoimmune inflammatory diseases, which occur when healthy cells are mistaken for infected cells, causing the immune system to attack the body and leading to inflammation.\n\nAnti-cytokine drugs \"dampen down inflammation by blocking the actions of specific inflammatory cytokines ... with 'surgical precision' and are now routinely used for treating patients who respond inadequately to standard treatments for inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and Crohn's disease both in the US and Europe,\" explained Dr. Golam Khandaker, a clinical lecturer in Cambridge's department of psychiatry and lead author of the new study.\n\nUsing data from the 20 studies, Khandaker and his colleagues found that anti-cytokine drugs improved symptoms of depression, regardless of whether they lessened the symptoms of physical illness.\n\n\"The findings suggest that inflammation may contribute to the pathogenesis of depression,\" Khandaker said. The findings also suggest that \"anti-inflammatory drugs may be helpful in treating patients with depression who are chronically inflamed.\"\n\nThe immune system acts like a thermostat, turned down low most of the time but cranked up when we have an infection, according to Khandaker. In some people, the thermostat is always set slightly higher, behaving as if they have a persistent low-level infection.\n\nFor the current report, Khandaker and his colleagues looked at studies of drugs blocking specific cytokines.\n\nKhandaker said that five of the 20 studies focused on one specific cytokine. All five showed the same result, that blocking the action of this cytokine to reduce inflammation lessened symptoms of depression.\n\nTwo clinical trials examined by Khandaker focused on another drug blocking the action of a different cytokine, and both studies showed it improved symptoms of depression.\n\nLooking to the future\n\n\"Evidence at this point suggests that cytokine antagonists -- which are much more specific in their anti-inflammatory effects than drugs like aspirin -- show modest antidepressant effects in individuals with depression and increased inflammation,\" said Raison, who did not participate in in Khandaker's research.\n\nThough it's still too early to prescribe these drugs to depressed patients, Khandaker believes that anti-inflammatory drugs may offer hope to people who find current antidepressants ineffective.\n\n\"We need more studies,\" he said, particularly research involving patients with depression who are inflamed but healthy to investigate the effect of these drugs on depression.

Although there is ongoing debate regarding the safety and effectiveness of vaginal laser surgery, a new study suggests that it may be effective, especially after multiple treatments. Study results are published online in Menopause, the journal of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS).\n\nCollectively known as the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), the various genital and urinary problems associated with menopause have created a market for new therapies and treatments to help women regain sexual function and bladder control. Vaginal laser surgery represents one of the newer and more hotly contested approaches.\n\nIn the case of microablative fractional CO2 laser surgery, a series of microscopic laser beams using fractionated energy penetrate the skin to remove old and damaged skin cells, intended to rebuild the vaginal pathway. In this new study, GSM symptoms were evaluated up to12 months after the last laser surgery and compared based on the number of total therapies applied (up to a total of five).\n\nThe results of this small, retrospective, non-sham-controlled study demonstrated that this type of laser surgery was particularly effective in reducing the intensity of dyspareunia (painful sex) and dryness. It further demonstrated that four or five laser therapies may be superior in lowering the intensity of GSM symptoms compared with three laser therapies in both short- and long-term follow-up. Study results are published in the article \"Microablative fractional CO2 laser for the genitourinary syndrome of menopause: up to 12-month results.\"\n\n\"This study adds to the literature on vaginal laser therapy for GSM.

The third in a series of studies from the Andersen lab involving PD and low-dose lithium, the results add to mounting evidence that low-doses of the psychotropic drug could benefit patients suffering from the incurable, degenerative condition.\n\nThis study, published online in Brain Research, involved Parkinsonian mice that were given Carbidopa/Levodopa (sold as Sinemet\u00ae), a drug used to boost levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is lost in PD. While the medication remains the single most effective agent in the management of PD symptoms, long-term use causes its own side effects, among them abnormal involuntary movements or AIMS. Buck professor and senior scientist Julie Andersen, PhD, says AIMS become problematic for 30 percent of patients after four to six years of treatment with Sinemet, with 90 percent of patients suffering from the complication after nine years of chronic use. \"For patients these side effects are just as devastating as the freezing that is associated with PD.\" \"In our mice we saw significant behavioral improvement.\"\n\nIn this study, Andersen and her team dosed the mice with an amount of lithium equivalent to about a quarter of what humans receive for the treatment of psychiatric diseases. Researchers found that lithium boosted the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase which increases dopamine synthesis via the inhibition of calpain-1, an enzyme that normally reduces dopamine synthesis.\n\nIn earlier studies, Andersen's team found that low-dose lithium was protective in two different mouse models of PD. Treatment in mice with a human mutation for PD began when the animals reached late middle-age, the human equivalent of about 60, which is the average age of onset of Parkinson's in humans. \"We clearly saw a prevention of the motor difficulties we would expect to see in the animals,\" said Andersen. \"The treatment also protected the area of the brain that is normally damaged by Parkinson's.\"\n\nPlans for a clinical trial of low-dose lithium for PD patients are in early stages. \"This study suggests potential therapeutic benefit in PD,\" said David K. Simon, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Simon chairs the Scientific Review Committee for the Parkinson's Study Group, a not-for-profit network of Parkinson's Centers. \"One caveat is that other agents that have shown clear efficacy in this model of PD have subsequently failed to show benefit in clinical studies in PD (e.g. CoQ10, creatine, and pioglitazone). However, this study provides additional evidence on top of prior work from Dr. Andersen's lab and others that lithium may have therapeutic potential in PD, which is a hypothesis that should be tested in clinical trials,\" he said.\n\nLithium is a naturally occurring element, not a 'developed' molecule like most medications.

Dr. Nagele's work focuses on utilizing autoantibodies as blood-based biomarkers to accurately detect the presence of myriad diseases and pinpoint the stage to which a disease has progressed. By detecting Alzheimer's disease long before symptoms emerge, Dr. Nagele hopes those with disease-related autoantibody biomarkers will be encouraged to make beneficial lifestyle changes that may help to slow development of the disease.\n\n\"There are significant benefits to early disease detection because we now know that many of the same conditions that lead to vascular disease are also significant risk factors for Alzheimer's. People found to have preclinical disease can take steps to improve their vascular health, including watching their diet, exercising and managing any weight and blood pressure issues to help stave off or slow disease progression,\" Nagele said.\n\nWhile the cause of Alzheimer's remains elusive, it is clear that maintaining a healthy blood-brain barrier is a critical preventative measure. Diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, stroke and being overweight jeopardize vascular health. As blood vessels in the brain weaken or become brittle with age, they begin to leak, which allows plasma components including brain-reactive autoantibodies into the brain. There, the autoantibodies can bind to neurons and accelerate the accumulation of beta amyloid deposits, a hallmark of Alzheimer's pathology.\n\nThe blood test developed by Dr. Nagele has also shown promise in detecting other diseases, including Parkinsons's, multiple sclerosis and breast cancer. His team's research on the role of autoantibodies explains that:\n\u2022 All humans possess thousands of autoantibodies in their blood;\n\u2022 These autoantibodies specifically bind to blood-borne cellular debris generated by organs and tissues all over the body;\n\u2022 An individual's autoantibody profile is strongly influenced by age, gender and the presence of specific diseases or injuries; and\n\u2022 Diseases cause characteristic changes in autoantibody profiles that, when detected, can serve as biomarkers that reveal the presence of the disease.\n\nIn Alzheimer's, the brain begins to change years before symptoms emerge. Detecting Alzheimer's antibodies at the preclinical stage would give patients an opportunity to work with their physician to make lifestyle changes or receive available treatments before they become symptomatic. Potentially, this early intervention could help those with preclinical Alzheimer's avoid or delay the most devastating symptoms.\n\n\"As osteopathic physicians, we constantly tell patients that a healthy lifestyle is the best medicine for preventing disease. We also know that many people tune out messages about nutrition and exercise until a health crisis gets their attention,\" said Jennifer Caudle, DO, assistant professor of family medicine at Rowan University. \"I can't think of a single patient who wouldn't take steps to prevent the progression of Alzheimer's if they could directly affect their prognosis.\"\n\nToday, there is no definitive FDA-approved blood test for Alzheimer's, which affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans.

Two had both inflammation and a malignancy.\n\nThe men also had to have at least 18 teeth and were examined for signs of gum disease, such as increased levels of inflammation and bleeding and/or loose teeth due to attachment and bone loss.\n\nAll the men had moderate to severe gum disease, for which they received treatment. They were tested again for periodontal disease four to eight weeks later and showed significant improvement.\n\nDuring the periodontal care, the men received no treatment for their prostate conditions. But even without prostate treatment, 21 of the 27 men showed decreased levels of PSA. Those with the highest levels of inflammation benefited the most from the periodontal treatment. Six participants showed no changes.\n\nSymptom scores on the IPSS test also showed improvement.\n\nBissada is now conducting follow-up research to support the first study's findings.

The study, funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), appears in the December 28 issue of JAMA Cardiology.\n\nFenofibrate is primarily used to help reduce elevated levels of triglycerides, or fat, in the blood. But the researchers wanted to know if the drug, when combined with statin treatment, could also reduce the risk of heart disease in people with type 2 diabetes. People with type 2 diabetes are at high risk of cardiovascular-related events, such as heart attacks, stroke, and even death, often because their levels of triglycerides are so high, and their high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels are low.\n\nTo answer their question, the researchers followed 4,640 participants from the NHLBI-funded Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Lipid Study for five years after the conclusion of the trial in 2009. The findings suggest that fenofibrate therapy may be beneficial in the way the researchers hoped: by reducing cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes who take statins but still have especially high triglycerides levels and low HDL cholesterol levels.

High levels of PSA can be a marker for prostate cancer, although it's far from a perfect screening tool, experts say. Men with both high and low levels of PSA can have cancer or not have cancer.\n\nThe thought was that since high PSA levels are correlated with prostate cancer, rapidly rising levels of PSA, called \"PSA velocity,\" from one year to another would also be an indicator of prostate cancer.\n\nHowever, the new study found that PSA velocity doesn't add any useful information beyond what physicians can already tell from other methods of prostate cancer screening, including the one-time PSA level test and digital rectal exams.\n\nCurrent screening guidelines that recommend biopsies for men who have high PSA velocity but no other signs of prostate cancer -- such as a suspected abnormality during a digital rectal exam or high PSA level during a single test -- are leading to many unnecessary biopsies, the researchers said.\n\n\"We found there was no strong association between PSA velocity and prostate cancer, and virtually none with aggressive prostate cancer,\" said study author Andrew Vickers, of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. \"The velocity didn't add anything more to detecting aggressive prostate cancers.\"\n\nThe study is published online Feb. 24 in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nThe whole issue of prostate cancer screening -- including the PSA test, the digital rectal exam and PSA velocity -- has been controversial, said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society (ACS).\n\nPart of the difficulty is, while current screening methods are good at detecting cancer, they can't distinguish between aggressive, life-threatening prostate cancers and those that are slow-growing and relatively benign. And many prostate cancers are just that -- of little risk to men during their lifetimes, Brawley said.\n\nCurrent ACS prostate screening cancer guidelines recommend that men make an informed decision with their doctor about whether to be tested for prostate cancer. \"Research has not yet proven that the potential benefits of testing outweigh the harms of testing and treatment,\" according to the ACS.\n\nAs for PSA velocity, the ACS doesn't have a position on what PSA velocity warrants a biopsy.\n\nBut the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American Urological Association guidelines do recommend biopsies based on high PSA velocities, even in the absence of an elevated PSA or a suspicious digital rectal exam, according to background information in the study.\n\nAnd many internal medicine and primary-care doctors, in part because of fears of litigation, do order biopsies based on fast-rising PSA levels, Brawley said.\n\n\"It's something that has become almost a community standard. If a guy has a PSA of .8 last year, and a year or so later you've repeated it and it's 1.9, because it has increased by a factor of 1 he gets sent to biopsy,\" Brawley said.\n\nIn the study, researchers used data on more than 5,500 men in their 60s and 70s who took part in a drug trial for a prostate cancer prevention drug. The men in the study were all from the placebo arm, meaning they had not received the drug. As part of the trial, all of the men agreed to have a biopsy at the end of the trial, needed or not.\n\nResearchers did find a statistical association between PSA velocity and the chances of a biopsy coming back cancerous. But when they factored in other things that can influence risk, including a family history of the disease, being older, being black, PSA level and results of a digital rectal exam, there was virtually no association between PSA velocity and biopsy outcome.\n\n\"PSA velocity measurement is not useful,\" Brawley said.\n\nGrace Lu-Yao, a cancer epidemiologist at the Cancer Institute of New Jersey who wrote an accompanying editorial, said she agreed with the authors' conclusions that PSA velocity does not seem to be a good predictor of prostate cancer.\n\nIn addition, tracking PSA levels overtime can also cause anxiety to men, who often worry if their PSA level has suddenly shot up.\n\n\"According to the data, PSA velocity does not add any value, but it may add more anxiety,\" Lu-Yao said.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute has more on the PSA test.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Two independent sources were quoted.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "All of these study participants \u2014 largely people in their 70s, all with a diagnosis of either \"mild cognitive impairment\" or atypical dementia \u2014 are living with the unconfirmed suspicion that they have Alzheimer's.

Now there's growing evidence that the same is true for your brain. A new study by researchers at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago shows a diet plan they developed -- appropriately called the MIND diet -- may reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease by as much as 53 percent. Even those who didn't stick to the diet perfectly but followed it \"moderately well\" reduced their risk of Alzheimer's by about a third. Diet appears to be just one of \"many factors that play into who gets the disease,\" said nutritional epidemiologist Martha Clare Morris, PhD, the lead author of the MIND diet study. Genetics and other factors like smoking, exercise and education also play a role. But the MIND diet helped slow the rate of cognitive decline and protect against Alzheimer's regardless of other risk factors. The study, published in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia, looked at more than 900 people between the ages of 58 and 98 who filled out food questionnaires and underwent repeated neurological testing. It found participants whose diets most closely followed the MIND recommendations had a level of cognitive function the equivalent of a person 7.5 years younger. The MIND diet breaks its recommendations down into 10 \"brain healthy food groups\" a person should eat and five \"unhealthy food groups\" to avoid. It combines many elements of two other popular nutrition plans which have been proven to benefit heart health: the Mediterranean diet and the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet. (MIND stands for Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay.) But the MIND diet also differs from those plans in a few significant ways and proved more effective than either of them at reducing the risk of Alzheimer's. Click through to see which foods to eat -- and which ones to avoid -- for optimal brain health.\n\nThe MIND diet recommends frequent servings of green leafy vegetables. Kale, spinach, broccoli, collards and other greens are packed with vitamins A and C and other nutrients. At least two servings a week can help, and researchers found six or more servings a week provide the greatest brain benefits. The Mediterranean and DASH diets do not specifically recommend these types of vegetables, but the MIND diet study found that including greens in addition to other veggies made a difference in reducing the risk of Alzheimer's.\n\nBerries are the only fruit specifically recommended in the MIND diet. \"Blueberries are one of the more potent foods in terms of protecting the brain,\" Morris said. She noted that strawberries have also shown benefits in past studies looking at the effect of food on cognitive function. The MIND diet recommends eating berries at least twice a week.\n\nIf beans aren't a regular part of your diet, they should be. High in fiber and protein, and low in calories and fat, they also help keep your mind sharp as part of the MIND diet. The researchers recommend eating beans three times a week to help reduce the risk of Alzheimer's.\n\nRaise a toast to the MIND diet: it recommends a glass of wine every day. Just one, though. Wine rounds out the list of of 10 \"brain healthy\" food groups that help protect against Alzheimer's: green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, nuts, berries, beans, whole grains, fish, poultry, olive oil and wine. Now here are the five food groups it says you should avoid to reduce your risk of developing dementia...\n\nYou already know they're not so good for your waistline, and it turns out pastries and other sweets could have a negative effect on brain health as well. The MIND diet recommends limiting yourself to no more than five of these treats per week.\n\nFried foods and fast food round out the MIND diet's list of unhealthy food groups. Limit your indulgence in fried food to no more than once a week for optimal brain health. But even if you slip up on the diet from time to time, the researchers say it can still have benefits. Even \"modest adherence\" to the MIND diet measurably reduced a person's chances of developing Alzheimer's disease, and the longer you stick with it, the greater the benefits. \"People who eat this diet consistently over the years get the best protection,\" said lead author Martha Clare Morris. \"You'll be healthier if you've been doing the right thing for a long time.\"", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "There appear to be no independent sources used in this story.\u00a0 The paper indicates that there is no conflict of interest for the authors, so no mention of conflict is acceptable.

It also found that the protective effect increases with age. The study is by Peter Rothwell, MD, PhD, FRCP, of John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, England, and colleagues, and has been published online by the journal the Lancet. A previous study by the same authors showed that low doses of aspirin (75-300 milligrams) reduced the number of cases of colorectal cancer by a quarter and deaths caused by the disease by more than a third. The latest study confirms the earlier results and concludes that similar effects can be shown for other types of cancers.\n\nThe study looked at eight trials examining the effects of a daily dose of aspirin on preventing heart attacks involving 25,570 patients, 674 of whom died from cancer. They showed a 21% reduction in the number of deaths caused by cancer among those who had taken aspirin, compared with people who had not. The investigation also showed that the benefits of taking aspirin increased over time. After five years, death rates were shown to fall by 34% for all cancers and by 54% for gastrointestinal cancers. Participants were also followed up after 20 years, by which point 1,634 of the original participants had died as a direct result of cancer. This 20-year follow-up established that the risk of cancer death remained 20% lower among those who had been allocated aspirin than those in the control group for all solid cancers, including lung, prostate, brain, bladder, and kidney cancers, and by 35% for gastrointestinal cancers. The fall in the risk of death broke down according to individual types of cancer: Reductions in pancreatic, stomach, and brain cancers were difficult to quantify because of smaller numbers of deaths, the authors say.\n\nThe protective effect of taking low doses of aspirin varied according to the type of cancer and how long aspirin had been taken, the authors found. For instance, it only became apparent after about five years for esophageal, pancreatic, brain, and lung cancer; about 10 years for stomach and colorectal cancer; and about 15 years for prostate cancer.

To determine an alternate but effective therapy, the researchers enrolled 100 patients age 45-78 with significant stroke risk and coupled with diligent pulse monitoring -- manually or by using a smartphone - twice a day with \"as needed\" anticoagulants for the treatment of AF. Patients were provided with novel oral anticoagulants and were instructed to start taking the medication if they suspected or detected an AF episode lasting longer than one hour.\n\n\"This kind of approach to anticoagulation therapy requires an open line of communication between the patient and the care team, and calls for a specific type of patient. We call them \"highly motivated patients,\" said lead author Monica Pammer, PA-C, a physician assistant in Electrophysiology at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. \"These are patients who were actively seeking, preparing for and are committed to the alternate treatment method, and who are informed about how to diligently and effectively monitor their pulse throughout the day.\"\n\nResearchers followed the participates for approximately 23 months, during which time 28 patients started taking the blood thinner at least once for a suspected or detected AF episode, and only 10 patients transitioned back to chronic oral anticoagulation therapy for recurrent AF. No patients experienced a stroke or transient ischemic attack - also called a mini-stroke -- and there was only one mild bleeding incident that required medical attention.\n\n\"It is extremely common for patients with AF to seek treatment that does not involve the use of chronic oral anticoagulants therapy, as there are other risks associated with their long term use,\" said co-author Francis E. Marchlinski, MD, FHRS, director of Electrophysiology for the University of Pennsylvania Health System and Richard T. and Angela Clark President's Distinguished Professor in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. \"The goal of this study was to find a safe and effected treatment option, and our initial results support 'as-needed' blood thinners and pulse monitoring as the alternative.\"\n\nAll patients enrolled had no AF recurrences during an extended period of telemetry monitoring before the study began, and were willing and able to check their pulses manually or by a smartphone-enabled device twice a day. Of these patients, 84 had been ablated, sixteen were being treated with drug therapy, and three had implanted devices that served as a quality control check.\n\n\"While this is an observational study with a relatively small patient sample, further research is certainly needed to better understand alternate treatment options,\" said Pammer. \"And, we stress that 'as-needed' blood thinners should not be considered unless the patient qualifies as highly motivated.\"\n\nPenn Medicine is one of the world's leading academic medical centers, dedicated to the related missions of medical education, biomedical research, and excellence in patient care.

At the same time, the women continued to be at a lower risk for breast cancer. That\u2019s the good news.\n\nThe bad news is that there is no benefit of being less likely to develop heart disease, and any reduction in the risk of hip bone fractures evaporates with time, according to a report in the latest issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nFor years, women took estrogen or a combination of estrogen and progestin to help alleviate hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause, and in the belief that the drugs had a host of health benefits, including protecting their hearts. But the Women\u2019s Health Initiative stunned doctors and women when researchers reported that the risks of the hormones outweighed any benefits. Hormone use plummetted, but women who had been using the drugs were left to wonder whether they were still at risk.\n\nIn the new analysis, researchers analyzed data collected from 7,645 women who were in the part of the study examining the effects of taking estrogen alone an average of 10.7 years, after the study was halted because of the evidence the drugs were harming women. The women had taken estrogen for about six years.\n\nThe researchers found that the risk for heart disease during the follow-up period was similar to that seen while the women were taking the hormone. But the increased risk for strokes and blood clots disappeared and the protective effect for breast cancer persisted. The protective effect for hip fractures disappeared. In fact, the women who took the hormone ended up being at somewhat higher risk for fractures.\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the study, Emily Jungheim and Graham Colditz of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis wrote that the findings indicate that while there \u201cmay still be a role for short-term use of unopposed estrogen for treating some women with menopausal symptoms ... this role may be vanishing as existing and emerging data continue to be better understood.\u201d\n\nRowan Chlebowski, one of the researchers who worked on the analysis, stressed that the study only looked at women who were taking estrogen alone.

Zeitzer's latest study, published Monday in the Journal of Clinical Investigation , could make treatment easier by providing light exposure during sleep, before the trip, without changing or interrupting your routine.\n\nThe circadian system is synchronized to the outside world through exposure to light; it controls sleep timing, hormone release and mood, said Zeitzer, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences. Jet lag occurs when sleeping and waking patterns are not synchronized to circadian rhythms.\n\nTo adapt to a new time zone, most people try to get as much light exposure as possible corresponding to their destination, either by waking up early before a trip or staying up late when they arrive, Zeitzer said. Or they do nothing and suffer the exhausting consequences; the body eventually adjusts at a slow pace of about one hour a day, taking up to three days to catch up.\n\nThrough light therapy, the technique Zeitzer is experimenting with, a person's brain can be tricked into adjusting more quickly to disturbances in sleep cycles by increasing how long he or she is exposed to light prior to traveling to a new time zone. The treatment \"exploits biology in the eye\" to speed up the brain's adjustment to time changes, he said.\n\nThis study builds on previous research published in 2014, which found that light therapy works best at night because the body's circadian rhythms are more sensitive to light at night, even through closed eyelids. In this latest study, Zeitzer and Raymond Najjar, a former postdoctoral scholar at Stanford now at Singapore Eye Research Institute, found that short flashes of light at night are more effective than continuous light exposure and could speed up the process of adjusting to a different time zone before a trip.\n\n\"The previous study was proof of principle: Can we elicit these kinds of changes and can we do it without interfering with sleep?\" Zeitzer said. This time around, researchers tried to further optimize the process.\n\nTo determine which would provide the fastest method of adjusting sleep cycles, researchers recruited 39 participants ages 19 to 36. They put them on a routine sleep-wake cycle, going to bed and waking up at the same time every day for about two weeks. They then had the volunteers sleep in the lab, where some were exposed to continuous light for an hour and others were exposed to a sequence of flashes of various frequencies for an hour.\n\nThey found that exposing people to two millisecond flashes of light, similar to a camera flash, every 10 seconds elicited two hours of change in circadian timing, compared with 36 minutes for those exposed to continuous light. Participants were able to sleep through the flashes of light without waking.\n\n\"You get more effectiveness out of flashes of light. It will enable us to have more potent countermeasures to jet lag than continuous light, which is the current prescribed light therapy treatment,\" Zeitzer said.\n\nThe treatment could benefit not only travelers but also overnight shift workers and people with constantly changing schedules, he said, but that's a long way off. There's still more testing to be done before the technique is available to the public.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "No outside expert was asked to comment and cast a critical eye on the quality of the evidence and the soundness of the study.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Hoping to reduce her thighs and midsection without the risks and inconvenience of liposuction, she paid $2,300 for six treatments from a chiropractor in the Denver area. Even though she continued to diet and work out, she had no change in her thighs, belly and hips. Her doctor offered her three more sessions at no cost. Still, no change.\n\nSince most aesthetic medicine is elective, and not covered by insurance, marketing plays a major role in capturing the minds and wallets of consumers. The concern is that promoting innovations for indications that the Food and Drug Administration hasn\u2019t approved will fuel patient expectations that clinical data may not substantiate.\n\nZeltiq Aesthetics, based in Pleasanton, Calif., is a cautious wallflower that aims to get the data behind its device approved by the F.D.A. before it makes too rowdy an entrance to the party. Its slogan is \u201cMore Science. Less Fat.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Erchonia Medical, based in McKinney, Tex., has aggressively marketed its Zerona laser as \u201cthe first non-invasive body contouring procedure to effectively remove excess fat\u201d even though it has yet to receive F.D.A. clearance to promote this use. (In general, the F.D.A. must sanction a medical device for a specific use before a company can market that use. But doctors are free to use devices off label. )\n\nNonetheless, a brochure for Zerona states patients can collectively \u201close up to 9 inches without the pain or down time of surgery.\u201d Nationwide, medical spas, chiropractors, cosmetic surgeons, plastic surgeons and dermatologists now offer Zerona for $1,700 to $3,800 for six sessions. Part of the reason the device has made inroads during these strapped times is that doctors don\u2019t buy it outright, but pay per use.\n\nSo how is Zerona supposed to work? The low-level laser causes \u201cfat to seep out of a cell, almost like a balloon being struck by a needle,\u201d said Ryan Maloney, medical director for Erchonia Medical. The fat enters the lymphatic system, and is eventually used as energy, Dr. Maloney said.\n\nZeltiq uses controlled cooling to target and eliminate fat cells, a process called selective cryolipolysis. Skin isn\u2019t damaged, but subcutaneous fat, which is more sensitive to targeted cold, begins a two-month death march soon after exposure to Zeltiq.\n\nDoctors on the advisory board for Zeltiq Aesthetics have put the word out about it on television news segments. But at this stage, the company itself has been careful not to promote its device directly to consumers since its F.D.A. clearances for, say, pain reduction during dermatologic treatments don\u2019t encompass fat reduction. Gordie Nye, the chief executive, sent an e-mail message declining to be interviewed for this article.\n\nThe company has clinical data that has been submitted to the F.D.A. for approval, according to a few doctors who were principal investigators. Data relayed at a meeting of the American Society of Dermatologic Surgery showed a 22 percent reduction of the fat layer as measured by ultrasound.\n\nErchonia Medical has published the results of its clinical trial in Lasers in Surgery and Medicine. Thirty-five patients in the treatment group lost an average of 3.5 inches total in hips, thighs and their midsection according to the company\u2019s clinical trial. The company has promoted Zerona as \u201ca new body-sculpting procedure designed to remove fat and contour the body without invasive surgery.\u201d But the F.D.A. has not sanctioned marketing this use. It has cleared the Zerona laser for pain reduction 24 hours after breast augmentation or as a way to decrease the pain associated with recovering from liposuction.\n\nIn general, Karen Riley, a spokeswoman for the F.D.A., said \u201cit is considered off-label promotion if you are marketing to the public a use that has not been cleared.\u201d Steven Shanks, the president of Erchonia Medical, said, \u201cSince we use the exact same power for liposuction and breast augmentation, we self-certified the device.\u201d He said that in January 2009, the company had applied for a 510K clearance \u2014 which is based on the notion that an older device is substantially equivalent to a new one \u2014 and had yet to receive it. (Such a delay is atypical, Ms. Riley said, adding, \u201cmost 510Ks are cleared within six months.\u201d)\n\nLast month, Dr. Robert B. Seltzer, a dermatologist in Pasadena, Calif., ran an advertisement in The Los Angeles Times for an informational seminar that called Zerona \u201cthe holy grail.\u201d In a phone interview, however, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not 100 percent convinced\u201d and planned to return his Zerona if he didn\u2019t continue seeing results in his patients. (So far 5 out of 6 have been pleased.)\n\nAfter reviewing Erchonia Medical\u2019s clinical study, Dr. Brian M. Kinney, a plastic surgeon in Los Angeles, said, \u201cI can\u2019t prove that it works.\u201d His concerns are that the tape measure method of gauging circumferential changes \u201cisn\u2019t consistently reliable.\u201d What\u2019s more, study participants and the placebo group were assessed only two weeks after their last treatment, not long enough to measure adequately whether results last.\n\nDr. Kinney doesn\u2019t have a Zerona or a Zeltiq cooling device, though in the case of the latter, he said, \u201cit is well documented that freezing fat tissue aggressively enough can lead to fat necrosis,\u201d or, fat dying, over a few months.\n\nPatient selection for any body contouring procedure is crucial, said Dr. Jeffrey M. Kenkel, vice chairman of plastic surgery at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. Dr. Kenkel, who recently replicated results of Zerona\u2019s clinical trial in 12 of his patients, doesn\u2019t offer Zerona to obese patients, or to ones who have had surgery in the area they want treated. \u201cIt\u2019s critical to be evaluated by a doctor,\u201d he said.\n\nSuccess is also dependent on diet and exercise, he said. If you\u2019re sedentary and not eating healthy food, he said, then once fat is leaked after Zerona treatments, \u201cyour body will just store it again.\u201d\n\nHow the body rids itself of fat, and how quickly, after any noninvasive body slimming procedure is unclear, said Dr. Lawrence S. Bass, a plastic surgeon in Manhattan who started using a Zeltiq device last July. That includes, he said, forthcoming devices like UltraShape and LipoSonix, which employ ultrasound waves to single out fat. It\u2019s a \u201csticking point with the F.D.A. with all these things,\u201d he said. Dr. Bass was not a clinical investigator for Zeltiq, but he said, \u201cI\u2019m convinced both on the science and clinical experience, it\u2019s able to eliminate fat noninvasively.\u201d\n\nNadine Tosk, a publicist for Zeltiq, explained that the rollout of the device was \u201cvery limited right now.\u201d Dr. Jeffrey Dover, a dermatologist in Chestnut Hill, Mass., who advises Zeltiq and participated in its clinical trial, said a few board-certified plastic surgeons and dermatologists were \u201chandpicked\u201d because \u201cwe know they do good work.\u201d Restraint is key, he said, because a doctor could apply Zeltiq to \u201cthe same spot\u201d in the same day, which isn\u2019t how it\u2019s meant to be used. Hourlong treatments are best spaced out by two months, said Dr. Dover, who charges $700 per spot.\n\nThat said, a doctor with a Zeltiq device isn\u2019t hard for patients to find. More than five dozen \u201cZeltiq specialists\u201d can be found by ZIP code at body-contouring.com, which is a patient guide not sponsored by manufacturers of body-slimming devices. Dr. Jason N. Pozner, a plastic surgeon in Boca Raton, Fla., appears topless in a YouTube.com video that shows his left flank being suctioned and cooled as he reads his Kindle. (His partner, Dr. David J. Goldberg, was an investigator for Zeltiq.)\n\nMs. Bonvouloir hasn\u2019t given up on Zerona. Recently, she paid $2,100 for six treatments at Parker Day Spa in Parker, Colo.

The PSA test is notoriously unreliable, but using it this way separates men who need a close watch from those who are so low-risk that they can skip testing for five years or more.\n\n-Screening women with no symptoms for ovarian cancer with a blood test and an ultrasound exam is harmful. It didn't prevent deaths and led to thousands of false alarms, unneeded surgeries and serious complications.\n\nThe last study is a warning to people who get screening tests that aren't recommended, or who question whether screening can ever hurt.\n\n\"The answer is, it could hurt a lot,\" said Dr. Allen Lichter, chief executive of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. The group published these and 4,000 other studies Wednesday, ahead of its annual meeting next month.\n\nCervical cancer is easy to prevent. It's very slow-growing and screening finds precancerous cells and allows early treatment. The new study was the first big one to examine a newer screening tool, HPV tests, with or without Pap smears in routine practice.\n\nFor a Pap test, cells scraped from the cervix, the gateway to the uterus, are checked under a microscope. But this can miss problems or raise false alarms.\n\nHPV tests detect the human papillomavirus, which causes most cases of cervical cancer. But HPV is \"the common cold\" of the nether regions \u2014 most sexually active young people have been exposed to it, said Debbie Saslow, the American Cancer Society's director of breast and gynecologic cancer. Most infections go away on their own; they're only a cancer risk when they last a year or more.\n\nYounger women tend to have short-term infections, so Pap tests are a better way to screen them. HPV tests are approved as an option along with Paps for women 30 and older, and the cancer society says that if a woman tests negative on both, she can wait three years to be screened again. Few take this advice, though.\n\n\"Women still want their annual Pap and doctors still want to give them,\" and think it's rationing care to test less often, Saslow said.\n\nThe new study gives \"very, very solid support\" for screening less often, Lichter said.\n\nHormuzd Katki of the National Cancer Institute studied more than 330,000 women getting HPV and Pap tests through Kaiser Permanente Northern California for five years.\n\nOnly about three out of 100,000 women each year developed cervical cancer after negative HPV and Pap tests. HPV tests were twice as good as Paps for predicting risk. Adding a Pap after a negative HPV test did little to improve risk prediction.\n\nHowever, if an HPV test was positive, a Pap test helped confirm or rule out the need for follow-up.\n\nThe study didn't look at the downside of HPV testing \u2014 how many false alarms and needless procedures it triggered. HPV tests cost $80 to $100 compared to $20 to $40 for Paps.\n\nThe prostate study sought a better way to use PSA tests, which are troublesome because PSA can be high for many reasons besides cancer, and doctors don't know which cancers need treatment or whether screening saves lives. Most groups don't recommend PSA tests, but most men over 50 get them anyway.\n\nThe new study \"is not going to end the controversy, but it suggests a very interesting middle ground,\" Lichter said.\n\nResearchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York used stored blood samples that 12,000 Swedish men gave for a heart study decades ago, when most were 44 to 50 years old. They also had second samples from some of them six years later, and samples from other 60-year-old men.\n\nLooking 27 years later, researchers saw that 44 percent of cancer deaths occurred in men whose initial PSAs had been in the top 10 percent when they were 44 to 50 years old.\n\nConversely, scoring below the median meant very little cancer risk years later.\n\n\"They're identifying a group of guys who don't need to be screened, or need to be screened less often,\" said Dr. Otis Brawley, the cancer society's chief medical officer.\n\nThe results are \"provocative,\" but this type of study can't prove that screening prevents deaths, said Dr. Matthew R. Smith of the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center. Few of the Swedish men were treated for prostate cancer as most men are today, which can affect survival.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute, the Swedish Cancer Society and several foundations paid for the work, and one researcher holds patents for two PSA-related tests.\n\nBaseline PSA tests for men in their 40s can't be recommended yet, Brawley said. The cancer society says men should be informed of the risks and benefits of PSA tests starting at age 50, and sooner for blacks and those with family history of prostate cancer.\n\nThe government-funded ovarian cancer study involved nearly 80,000 women. Half were screened annually with an ultrasound for four years and a blood test for six years. The blood test looked for CA-125, a substance often elevated in ovarian cancer.\n\nAfter 13 years, there were no major differences in ovarian cancers found or deaths from the disease. Screening found only 212 cancers while giving 3,285 false alarms that led to 1,080 unneeded biopsy surgeries and 163 serious complications.\n\n\"So many people say `how can cancer screening be harmful?' This thing documents it,\" Brawley said.\n\nThe results don't apply to using these tests on women with symptoms of ovarian cancer or abnormal physical exams.

It dilates blood vessels, giving it the potential to ease an abrupt cold water-induced constriction of blood vessels in the arms and legs that can lead to blood pooling in the heart and lungs.\n\nAthletes and others with this condition -- called swimming-induced pulmonary edema, or SIPE -- cough up blood, labor to breathe and have low blood-oxygen typically brought on by swimming or scuba diving, usually in cold water. Often the symptoms dissipate over 24 hours, but the condition can be serious and even fatal and medical attention is recommended. Many don't know they are prone to the problem until they are in the water and quickly develop symptoms.\n\n\"During immersion in water, particularly cold water, susceptible people have an exaggerated degree of the normal redistribution of blood from the extremities to the chest area, causing increased pressure in the blood vessels of the lungs and leakage of fluid into the lungs,\" said Richard Moon, M.D., an anesthesiologist and medical director of the Duke Center for Hyperbaric Medicine & Environmental Physiology.\n\n\"Some cases of SIPE appear to have been the result of cardiac problems,\" said Moon, who was lead author of the study published online February 16 in Circulation: Journal of the American Heart Association.\n\nMoon and colleagues studied these responses in 10 athletes who had experienced the condition while exercising or competing in triathlons. During a carefully monitored test in Duke's hyperbaric center, the researchers had the participants exercise under water in a dive pool that recreated the conditions of a swim that could trigger the SIPE response.\n\nThey compared those participants with 20 others who did not have a history of SIPE. None of the participants in either group had heart abnormalities, but the SIPE-susceptible athletes had higher pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary artery wedge pressure during the underwater exercise, confirming that SIPE is a form of pulmonary edema caused by high pressure in the blood vessels within the lungs.\n\nWhen the SIPE participants were given sildenafil and then performed the same underwater exercise, the pressures were no longer as elevated.\n\n\"This is a small study, but also very intensive with direct, accurate pressure measurements,\" Moon said. \"It appears that the drug, which dilates the blood vessels, could be creating more capacity in the blood vessels in the arms and legs, reducing the tendency for blood to redistribute to the thorax, and therefore reducing the high pressure in the pulmonary vessels.\"\n\nOne study participant, triathlete Katherine Calder-Becker, said her bouts with SIPE threatened to end her competitive career. She said she would have no problems during training in swimming pools, but then experienced debilitating shortness of breath and distress during the swim portions of competitions in colder open water. She coughed up blood and was once hospitalized.\n\nTriathlete Calder-Becker, 51, was diagnosed with SIPE and enrolled in studies at Duke in 2011. Afterward, she consulted her cardiologist and was prescribed a low dose of sildenafil that she takes shortly before competitions.\n\n\"I have successfully raced in 20 triathlons since I started taking sildenafil, including five ultra events that require 10-kilometer swims,\" Calder-Becker said. \"I have not had an incident since then. I didn't want to give up racing -- this is something my husband and I do together, and we travel together to competitions -- so it has meant everything to me to continue.\"\n\nMoon said larger studies are needed to replicate the results and learn more about possible adverse side effects of the drug.

In the United States, physicians diagnose more than 10,000 cases each year. While more than 4,000 American women die of the disease each year, the mortality rate has dropped more than 50 percent in the past four decades, largely due to the advent of well-organized screening and diagnostic programs.\n\nWhile the Pap smear can be performed by a non-specialist, colposcopy requires visualization of the cervix, relying on highly trained professionals and expensive equipment that is not easily accessible to underserved populations. These factors make cervical cancer more prevalent in women living in low socioeconomic communities.\n\nIn a new paper published on May 31 in the journal PLOS One, researchers from Duke believe they have found a better way.\n\n\"The mortality rate of cervical cancer should absolutely be zero percent because we have all the tools to see and treat it,\" said Nimmi Ramanujam, the Robert W. Carr, Jr., Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Duke. \"But it isn't. That is in part because women do not receive screening or do not follow up on a positive screening to have colposcopy performed at a referral clinic. We need to bring colposcopy to women so that we can reduce this complicated string of actions into a single touch point.\"\n\nCurrent standard practices for cervical cancer screening require three things: a speculum, a colposcope and a trained professional to administer the test.\n\nThe speculum is a metal device designed to spread the vaginal walls apart. The colposcope is a magnified telescopic device and camera designed to allow medical professionals to look through the speculum to see the cervix, which is located three to six inches inside the vagina. Colposcopes and people who know how to use them are difficult to find in many low-income regions, both domestically and internationally.\n\nRamanujam believes she can replace at least two of these requirements. Her laboratory has developed an all-in-one device that resembles a pocket-sized tampon with lights and a camera at one end. Health providers -- or even women themselves -- are able to capture images of the cervix using the rounded tip of the device to manipulate its position if necessary. The device also includes a channel through which contrast agents used for the cervical cancer screening procedure can be applied.\n\n\"We recruited 15 volunteers on Duke's campus to try out the new integrated speculum-colposcope design,\" said Mercy Asiedu, a graduate student working on the project in Ramanujam's lab. \"Nearly everyone said they preferred it to a traditional speculum and more than 80 percent of the women who tried the device were able to get a good image. Those that couldn't felt that they just needed some practice.\"\n\nRamanujam and Asiedu are now working on clinical trials to see how their design stacks up against the traditional colposcopy used with a speculum. By using both methods to visualize the cervix, the researchers will be able to make a direct comparison.\n\nAsiedu is also working to automate the screening process. By using image processing and machine learning to teach computers how to spot signs of precancerous and cancerous cells, Asiedu hopes to remove the need for a trained physician at any point in the screening process and shift the task to midwives, community health workers and even the women themselves.\n\n\"There have been a few other attempts to come up with a better solution, but none of them have succeeded,\" said Asiedu. \"One design using an inflatable cylinder proved just as uncomfortable as a traditional speculum. Another using directed airflow is just as bulky and expensive as a modern colposcope. With our handheld, low-cost design, we're hoping to redefine the entire procedure.\"\n\nThis work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (1R01CA195500, 1R01CA193380).\n\nCITATION: \"Design and Preliminary Analysis of a Vaginal Inserter for Speculum-Free Cervical Cancer Screening,\" Asiedu MN, Agudogo J, Krieger M, Miros, R, Proeschold-Bell, RJ, Schmitt JW, Ramanujam N.

The task force's guidelines are important because insurers and government programs often follow the panel's recommendations in deciding whether to cover certain preventive services.\n\nThe task force's final recommendation is likely to be controversial because some other groups say the screening should start earlier. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, for example, recommends that regular screenings begin at age 40, while the American Cancer Society calls for women to start yearly screening at age 45 and then move to screening every two years starting at age 55.\n\nCongress has sided with proponents of earlier screening. Last month, in anticipation of Monday's release of the task force\u2019s final recommendation, lawmakers took preemptive action: It directed insurers to ignore the task force's latest guidelines and, instead, to rely on its 2002 recommendation. That called for annual mammograms to begin at 40. As a result of the congressional action, women in their 40s will continue to be able to get annual mammograms at no cost.\n\nThe differences over when to start regular screening reflect the growing concern that the benefits of mammograms may have been oversold, and that they don't outweigh the anxiety and potential harm caused by over-diagnosis and false positives from the tests.\n\n[In major shift, these guidelines scaled back breast cancer screening for women in their 40s]\n\nThe debate over when to start regular screening involves only women of \"average risk\" who don't have specific risk factors for breast cancer such as the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic mutations or a family history of the disease. They're also not aimed at diagnostic mammography, which takes place once a woman has a symptom such as a lump. The screening recommendations are not binding on doctors, hospitals or insurers.\n\nIn releasing its final recommendations, the task force confirmed an earlier guidance it issued that said screening mammography had the greatest benefit for women ages 50 to 74. For women in their 40s, the likelihood of benefit is less and the potential harms are proportionally greater, it said. The most serious potential harm is unneeded treatment for a type of cancer that would not have become a threat to a woman's health during her lifetime.\n\nThe congressional action, which was included in the recently enacted spending law, has drawn criticism from some experts.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Congress thinks it's perfectly acceptable, even preferred, for a scientific document from 14 years ago to guide coverage policy on screening for breast cancer in women,\u201d says Kenneth Lin, a Georgetown University family medicine doctor who teaches preventive and evidence-based medicine.\n\nPart of the problem is the common perception that women deserve free mammogram coverage and that the scientific community is basing its decision on cost or rationing, said Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University law professor and expert on public health.\n\nFran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, said the task force's guidelines for women in their 40s \u2014 that they should discuss whether to get mammograms with their doctors and make individual decisions \u2014 come closest to following the evidence accumulated over the past three decades. Women should trust that process, she said.\n\nDespite the decades of marketing of mammography to women, \"women are capable of understanding the complexities of the issue, evaluating the evidence and making their own health decisions,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\"At some point we will have to decide that we are not going to pay for interventions that lack a high level of medical evidence,\" she said. \"At this time, what does concern us very much are attempts by Congress to interfere with the makeup and process of the US Preventive Services Task Force.\"\n\nThe task force first suggested in 2009 that breast cancer screening begin at 50 instead of 40, touching off enormous criticism. In 2010, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, which required that certain preventive services be provided for free \u2014 if those services got a strong recommendation from the task force. But it included an amendment that effectively directed insurers to use the 2002 recommendations for mammograms. That meant that women who were 40 and older could get mammograms at no cost.\n\nIn April 2015, the task force came out with its latest draft guidance, basically reaffirming its 2009 recommendations that the greatest benefit of mammography screening is for women between 50 and 74.\n\nWorried that millions of women under 50 could lose their free annual mammogram coverage if the guidelines became final, several health-care groups, including ACOG, the American College of Radiology and the Susan G. Komen Foundation, lobbied Congress to block that from happening.\n\nLanguage was included in the spending bill that says any recommendations of the task force related to breast cancer screening, mammography and prevention refers to those \u201cissued before 2009.\u201d\n\nSen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) was among the lawmakers who pushed for the language to be included. In a statement, she said her number one priority was to ensure that women can get mammograms if they and their doctors decide it's the right thing to do. \"This means making sure that cost is not a deterrent to care,\" she said.\n\nSeveral groups that lobbied for congressional action said in a statement last month that the task force recommendations conflict with those of other organizations. This results in confusion and puts more than 22 million women at risk of losing of losing insurance coverage for mammograms.\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nThe simple way doctors can make patients feel understood\n\nHow cancer will affect Americans in 2016: in seven charts\n\nOmega 3 is still good for the brain.

But, she added, because this is the first study of its kind, and the acupuncture protocol used was specifically designed for this study, \"you always need replication of the findings.\"\n\nDr. Shari Lusskin, director of reproductive psychiatry at the New York University Langone Medical Center, echoed that sentiment. \"It's encouraging to see alternative treatments being studied in a scientific manner, and this study should generate further studies. It needs to be replicated on a larger scale,\" she noted.\n\n\"This is one treatment, and perhaps it will become another possible treatment tool in our therapeutic toolbox,\" said Lusskin. But, she cautioned that \"acupuncture is not a substitute for the appropriate use of antidepressant therapy especially in women with a prior history of response to antidepressants.\"\n\nAs many as 20 percent of women may experience depression during pregnancy, according to the March of Dimes. Symptoms include sad, hopeless feelings that persist, generally for more than two weeks, Lusskin said. Women may also experience severe anxiety or feel disconnected from the baby. And, she cautioned, suicidal thoughts are never normal and are a sign that you should seek help.\n\nMany women are cautious about using medications during pregnancy, reports the study. Interpersonal psychotherapy is an option for women who are depressed during pregnancy, but this type of therapy isn't always available, according to the study.\n\nFor the study, Manber and her colleagues recruited 150 pregnant women who were diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. All were between 12 and 30 weeks of gestation.\n\nThe women were randomly assigned to one of three groups: depression-specific acupuncture (52 women), control acupuncture (49 women) or massage (49 women). The depression-specific protocol was designed just for this study, and the control acupuncture was specifically designed to avoid using acupuncture needles in any areas known to affect depression.\n\nThe treatments lasted for eight weeks. Women received treatment twice a week for the first four weeks, and then once a week for the next four weeks. The treatments lasted an average of 25 minutes.\n\nThe researchers found a 63 percent response rate in women who received the depression-specific acupuncture, while the response rate was 44.3 percent in the control acupuncture and massage groups. A response rate was defined as a 50 percent reduction in depression symptoms, Manber said.\n\nResults of the study are scheduled to be published in the March issue of Obstetrics & Gynecology.\n\n\"We found our acupuncture protocol was helpful, but that does not mean that any acupuncture for depression treatment will be effective. The quality of what you get can differ from one practitioner to another,\" said Manber.\n\n\"Our goal is always to find treatments that have the maximum benefits and minimum risk,\" said Lusskin. \"Many women think it's safer for the baby to go off antidepressants, but there's a real risk to the baby for untreated depression in pregnancy. And, we have enough safety data about antidepressant use in pregnancy that we can make informed choices about managing treatment during pregnancy.\"\n\nThe bottom line, she said, is to talk with your doctor to find the right combination of treatments that can help you. \"Depression is not a one-size-fits-all illness, and treatment won't be one-size-fits-all either.

Two to three times a week was not enough, the researchers found in an earlier study.\n\n\"Based on a series of studies performed by our team over the past 5 years, this 'dose' of exercise has become my prescription for life,\" said senior author Dr. Benjamin Levine, Director of the Institute and Professor of Internal Medicine at UT Southwestern. \"I think people should be able to do this as part of their personal hygiene - just like brushing your teeth and taking a shower.\"\n\nThe regimen included exercising four to five times a week, generally in 30-minute sessions, plus warmup and cool-down:\n\u2022 One of the weekly sessions included a high-intensity 30-minute workout, such as aerobic interval sessions in which heart rate tops 95 percent of peak rate for 4 minutes, with 3 minutes of recovery, repeated four times (a so-called \"4 x 4\").\n\u2022 Each interval session was followed by a recovery session performed at relatively low intensity.\n\u2022 One day's session lasted an hour and was of moderate intensity. (As a \"prescription for life,\" Levine said this longer session could be a fun activity such as tennis, aerobic dancing, walking, or biking.)\n\u2022 One or two other sessions were performed each week at a moderate intensity, meaning the participant would break a sweat, be a little short of breath, but still be able to carry on a conversation -- the \"talk test.\" In the study, exercise sessions were individually prescribed based on exercise tests and heart rate monitoring.\n\u2022 One or two weekly strength training sessions using weights or exercise machines were included on a separate day, or after an endurance session.\n\nStudy participants built up to those levels, beginning with three, 30-minute, moderate exercise sessions for the first 3 months and peaked at 10 months when two high-intensity aerobic intervals were added.\n\nThe more than 50 participants in the study were divided into two groups, one of which received two years of supervised exercise training and the other group, a control group, which participated in yoga and balance training.\n\nAt the end of the two-year study, those who had exercised showed an 18 percent improvement in their maximum oxygen intake during exercise and a more than 25 percent improvement in compliance, or elasticity, of the left ventricular muscle of the heart, Dr. Levine noted. He compared the change in the heart to a stretchy, new rubber band versus one that has gotten stiff sitting in a drawer.\n\nSedentary aging can lead to a stiffening of the muscle in the heart's left ventricle, the chamber that pumps oxygen-rich blood back out to the body, he explained.\n\n\"When the muscle stiffens, you get high pressure and the heart chamber doesn't fill as well with blood. In its most severe form, blood can back up into the lungs. That's when heart failure develops,\" said Dr. Levine, who holds the S. Finley Ewing Chair for Wellness at Texas Health Dallas and the Harry S. Moss Heart Chair for Cardiovascular Research. He also holds the Distinguished Professorship in Exercise Sciences at UT Southwestern, which is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year.\n\nEarlier research by UT Southwestern cardiologists showed that left ventricular stiffening often shows up in middle age in people who don't exercise and aren't fit, leaving them with small, stiff chambers that can't pump blood as well.\n\nHowever, the researchers also found that the heart chamber in competitive masters-level athletes remains large and elastic, and that even four to five days of committed exercise over decades is enough for noncompetitive athletes to reap most of this benefit.\n\nIn the current study, researchers wanted to know if exercise can restore the heart's elasticity in previously sedentary individuals - especially if begun in late middle age. Previous studies from Dr. Levine's research program have shown substantial improvements in cardiac compliance in young individuals after a year of training, but surprisingly little change if the training was started after age 65.\n\nTo start the study, researchers recruited 53 participants, ages 45 to 64. Many came from the Dallas Heart Study, which includes 6,000 Dallas residents and is the only single-center heart study of its size and multiethnic composition. The Dallas Heart Study is designed to improve the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of heart disease.\n\nThe new study appears in Circulation, a journal of the American Heart Association.

A smiley face means it's OK; a frowning face means it doesn't pass muster.\n\nAs a point of reference, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires manufacturers who choose to put a \"gluten free\" label on food packaging to meet the same 20 parts per million of gluten standard.\n\nGluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. People with celiac disease experience an immune reaction when they eat gluten that can lead to intestinal damage and impact the health of other organs if it's not managed well. It can cause stomach pain, a swollen belly, acid reflux, diarrhea, skin problems, and other symptoms.\n\nThe National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases estimates that about 1 in 141 Americans has celiac disease, but many people don't know they have the condition. Gluten-sensitive people experience similar symptoms to those with celiac disease and improve when they eliminate gluten from their diets.\n\nNima is triangular and relatively dainty, about three and a half inches tall by three inches wide, and a little less than an inch thick. \"Small enough to fit into your pocket along with your keys and mobile phone or a small clutch,\" said Sundvor.\n\nNima was first conceived when Sundvor and company co-founder Shireen Yates met about two years ago and realized they both had gluten intolerance and other food issues.\n\n\"We met at MIT through mutual friends. She was getting her MBA and I'd gotten my engineering degree from there. We had this shared experience; Shireen has several food allergies and I also have several food intolerances. We both just had these issues where we'd eat out and get sick or feel uncomfortable,\" Sundvor said. \"Shireen had the idea, 'Why can't I just test my food and figure out what's in it?'
