The lifetime risk of suffering symptomatic knee OA is estimated to be 44.7% and approximately 1 in 11 of the US population is diagnosed with symptomatic knee OA by age 60. With this knowledge, the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM) has released a new scientific statement that provides guidance for physicians and healthcare professionals who provide care for those patients with knee osteoarthritis.\n\nThere is a general consensus that the initial management of knee OA treatment should include weight loss and strengthening exercises. However, certain aspects of treatment for knee OA are controversial. In light of these issues, the AMSSM convened an expert writing group of four sports medicine physicians to review the latest data and provide recommendations for the sports medicine community.\n\n\u201cWe do not treat groups of people we treat individuals,\u201d said Dr. Thomas Trojian, Lead Author and Past AMSSM Board of Director. \u201cIt is important to look at how a person responds to a medication. Does the person improve if given an injection of viscosupplementation more likely than placebo or intra-articular steroid? Using a network meta-analysis we are able to compare the multiple studies done on viscosupplementation and have found that people are more likely to show clinical improvement with viscosupplementation over placebo (saline) and intra-articular steroids. This is different than studies recently published that say the average response differs.\u201d The full report, published ahead of print in the Clinical Journal of Sport Medicince (CJSM) and will appear in the (British Journal of Sports Medicine) BJSM, entitled, AMSSM Scientific Statement Concerning Viscosupplementation Injections for Knee Osteoarthritis Importance for Individual Patient Outcomes, includes the following notable AMSSM recommendations and one suggestion:\n\u2022 AMSSM RECOMMENDS viscosupplementation injections for Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) grade II-III knee osteoarthritis in those patients above the age of 60 based on HIGH quality evidence demonstrating benefit using OMERACT-OARSI Responder Rating but the evidence should be downgraded due to indirectness for those under 60 years of age.\n\u2022 AMSSM SUGGESTS viscosupplementation injections for knee osteoarthritis for those under the age of 60 based on MODERATE quality evidence due to response of treatment in those over 60.\n\u2022 AMSSM RECOMMENDS clinicians and researchers collect OMERACT-OARSI responder data to track individual response to the viscosupplementation.\n\nThe full paper will be published in print in the January 2016 issues of CJSM and BJSM.\n\nThanks to members Drs.

He's a professor of medicine at Duke University School of Medicine, in Durham, N.C.\n\nWhile other research has found that weight-loss surgery is the most effective treatment for obese patients, there is less data on long-lasting effects. The new study is notable because of the decade-long follow-up, said Maciejewski, who is also a research career scientist at Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center.\n\nIn the two-part study, Maciejewski's team first looked at the results of about 1,800 men and women who had gastric bypass surgery. The investigators compared weight changes in gastric bypass surgery patients to weight changes in more than 5,300 obese veterans who had no weight-loss surgery or formal weight-loss treatment.\n\nGastric bypass surgery involves making the stomach smaller, and attaching the lower part of the small intestine directly to the stomach, so much of the small intestine is bypassed. After surgery, people feel much fuller, faster. The surgery also appears to alter gut hormones, gut bacteria and metabolism, according to the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).\n\nAt the study's one-year mark, those who had the bypass had lost 31 percent of their starting weight, but the non-surgical patients had lost just 1 percent.\n\nAt 10 years, the researchers had weight information on 564 of the nearly 1,800 patients who had the gastric bypass. Only 19 of them had regained so much weight that they were nearly back to their starting weight; the rest kept off the weight.\n\nCompared to the non-surgical group, the bypass group weighed 21 percent less than at the start of the study.\n\nNext, the researchers compared three types of weight-loss surgeries: gastric bypass; sleeve gastrectomy; and adjustable gastric banding. In gastric banding, a band is placed at the top of the stomach to create a small pouch that reduces the size of the stomach. In sleeve gastrectomy, most of the stomach is removed, leaving a banana-shaped sleeve. As with gastric bypass surgery, both of these procedures leave people feeling full faster, according to NIDDK.\n\nAfter four years, those who had gastric bypass lost nearly 28 percent of their starting weight. People who had sleeve gastrectomy lost about 18 percent and those with gastric banding lost about 11 percent, the researchers found.\n\nThe average age of the men and women studied was about 52, and three-quarters were men. Most were white.\n\nThe study was published online Aug. 31 in JAMA Surgery.\n\nThe study helps address a knowledge gap about long-term outcomes of bariatric surgery, said Dr. Jon Gould, chief of general surgery at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee.\n\nThe study \"shows that the gastric bypass procedure compared to sleeve gastrectomy or adjustable gastric banding produces more weight loss and it was sustained over the long term,\" Gould said. He wrote a commentary to accompany the study in the same issue of the journal.\n\nBased on the new study findings, Gould said, \"I think a patient who is young and who has a long way to go may want to think about these results, and all other things being equal, might pick a gastric bypass for the long-term weight loss.\"\n\nThe new finding, he added, validates his belief that the gastric bypass could be a \"durable procedure.\"\n\nMaciejewski acknowledged that the study has limitations. For example, the study included mostly men, so the findings may not apply to women. In addition, women who undergo bariatric surgery are typically in their 30s through their 50s, he said. In this study, the average age of the men and women was 52.\n\n\"These results may not generalize to everyone,\" he said.\n\nAnother possible limitation was the loss of patients during the follow-up, which could have affected the results, the researchers noted.\n\nTo learn more about bariatric surgery procedures, visit the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Sources are clearly identified, along with information about their links to the study itself (one scientist was the study\u2019s lead researcher, and the other quoted in the story was independent).", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Probiotics are widely used to aid digestion and help restore gut bacterial balance after antibiotics.

Women on the placebo also improved over time, however.\n\nThe findings come from the same clinical trial that, last year, showed Lexapro halved the number of hot flashes women had each day. (See Reuters story of January 18, 2011.)\n\nA separate study a few months later showed no such benefit, however. In two trials of 36 women, researchers found that Lexapro did not cut the number or severity of hot flashes over eight weeks. (See Reuters Health story of May 26, 2011.)\n\nAnd the lead researcher on that study said these latest findings are \u201cnothing to write home about.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe differences between the treatment and placebo groups are very small,\u201d said Robert Freedman, a professor of psychiatry at Wayne State University in Detroit.\n\nIn general, studies of hot-flash remedies over the years have \u201cvirtually always found a large placebo effect,\u201d Freedman noted in an interview.\n\nThat could mean that study participants\u2019 hot flashes are just getting better over time, which they sometimes do.\n\n\u201cBut my feeling is that it\u2019s the placebo effect,\u201d Freedman said, referring to the phenomenon of study participants on placebos improving because they believe they are getting a real treatment.\n\nHot flashes, which mostly affect women transitioning to menopause and already in that phase of life, involve a sudden sensation of heat, sometimes accompanied by sweating or visible reddening of the skin.\n\nTheir exact cause is unknown, but hormonal regulation of body temperature is thought to be involved.\n\nBouts of hot flashes can happen many times a day and past research has found they can continue for anywhere from a few months to up to 10 years.\n\nSo far, Freedman noted, the only hot-flash treatment that has consistently worked in studies is hormone replacement therapy (HRT).\n\nAnd right now, HRT is the only treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for cooling hot flashes.\n\nBut women and doctors are wary of HRT these days \u2014 since a 2002 clinical trial linked the hormones to increased risks of heart attack, stroke, breast cancer and blood clots.\n\nSo researchers have been looking for alternatives. And studies have suggested that a few antidepressants, used at low doses, can be helpful for some women \u2014 including paroxetine (Paxil), fluoxetine (Prozac) and venlafaxine (Effexor).\n\nThis latest study, reported in the journal Fertility & Sterility, focused on hot flash \u201cinterference\u201d \u2014 the degree to which women feel hot flashes disrupt their lives.\n\nThat\u2019s important because it gets at quality of life, according to the researchers, led by Janet S. Carpenter of Indiana University in Indianapolis.\n\nThe trial included 205 women who were having at least 28 bouts of hot flashes or \u201cnight sweats\u201d a week. Carpenter\u2019s team randomly assigned half to use Lexapro for eight weeks, while the other half were given placebo pills.\n\nThe women kept diaries to record their hot flash symptoms. And every four weeks, they filled out a questionnaire on hot-flash interference.\n\nAfter four weeks, the study found, women on the antidepressant saw their score on the interference scale fall by half, on average. It remained there at week eight.\n\nBut women in the placebo group also improved, albeit more slowly and to a somewhat lesser degree.\n\nIn a separate analysis of the same study group, Carpenter\u2019s team found that women on Lexapro also reported bigger improvements in sleep problems: half saw their insomnia symptoms drop by at least 50 percent, versus 35 percent of placebo users.\n\nThose findings appear in a separate report in the journal Menopause.\n\nFreedman said that the overall research on antidepressants and hot flashes is still inconsistent. \u201cOverall, the picture is not optimistic.\u201d\n\nIn his own study last year, Freedman used a different approach to measuring hot flashes: instead of asking women to record their symptoms in a diary, the researchers had them wear a \u201cdetector\u201d to monitor objective measures of hot flashes.\n\nIt is possible for women\u2019s hot flashes to remain unchanged objectively, but have their subjective experience of them change. \u201cBut that raises the question of why,\u201d Freedman said.\n\nAnd for now, he noted, it\u2019s also not clear why antidepressants would have effects on hot flashes.\n\nLexapro, which costs about $125 a month, belongs to the group of antidepressants called selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). They increase levels of the brain chemical serotonin, which may have a role in regulating body heat.\n\nBut no one knows if altering serotonin levels actually does affect women\u2019s hot flashes. In fact, Freedman said, there\u2019s some evidence that lowering serotonin levels does not worsen hot flashes \u2014 which would be expected if the \u201cserotonin theory\u201d is correct.\n\nAntidepressants can also have side effects, like nausea, drowsiness, headache, constipation and dry mouth.\n\nRight now, no antidepressant is specifically approved to treat hot flashes. But in the U.S., doctors are allowed to prescribe drugs \u201coff-label\u201d for conditions other than their approved uses.\n\nBesides antidepressants, doctors sometimes prescribe certain blood pressure medications or the anti-seizure drug gabapentin, which some studies suggest may be helpful.\n\nHot flashes often need no drug treatment at all, though.\n\nIf they are not severe, experts say simple steps can be enough \u2014 like avoiding hot and spicy foods, turning down the thermostat, or trying relaxation techniques, such as yoga or meditation.\n\nThere are several herbal or \u201cnatural\u201d products marketed for easing menopause symptoms, including black cohosh, soy, red clover and dong quai. But there is little evidence that they work, according to the North American Menopause Society.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The article does appear to use independent sources including interviewing Dr Robert Freedman, a psychiatrist who was skeptical of the true benefits of using antidepressants to treat hot flashes.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "More than 35 million Americans are trying to quit smoking. Smoking cigarettes causes 480,000 premature deaths each year due mainly to a two-fold risk of cardiovascular disease and a 20-fold risk of lung cancer. In a commentary published in the current issue of the American Journal of Medicine, researchers from the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine at Florida Atlantic University reassure clinicians and their patients that varenicline, whose brand name is Chantix, is a safe and effective way to achieve smoking cessation and that failure to use this drug has caused preventable heart attacks and deaths from cardiovascular disease.\n\nIn 2006, varenicline was approved as a safe and effective means to quit smoking and achieved permanent quit rates of approximately 25 percent. In 2009, however, varenicline received a black box warning by the FDA based on their adverse event reports of neuropsychiatric symptoms like depression and thoughts of suicide.\n\nThere were plausible alternative explanations including that nearly half of the subjects had psychiatric histories, 42 percent were taking psychotropic drugs and about 42 percent were suffering from depression. Nonetheless, since then, there has been a 76 percent decline in the number of prescriptions dispensed from a peak of about 2 million in the last quarter of 2007 to about 531,000 in the first quarter of 2014.\n\nIn their commentary, the FAU researchers emphasize that, until recently, the totality of randomized evidence on varenicline had been restricted to eight small trials, which did not demonstrate a hazard. The researchers caution that the reliable detection of small to moderate risks and benefits of drug therapies requires cogent data from large-scale randomized trials designed a priori to test the hypothesis.\n\nSuch a large randomized trial was recently completed that included both apparently healthy individuals as well as those with severe mental illness. The trial was conducted for 12 weeks on about 8,000 long-term smokers and included equal subgroups of those without as well as with psychiatric disorders. In subjects without psychiatric disorders, those treated with varenicline had less neuropsychiatric symptoms and in subjects without psychiatric disorders there were no increases in these symptoms. Both groups of participants assigned at random to varenicline achieved significantly higher abstinence rates at 12 weeks than those assigned to placebo, nicotine patch or bupropion. Just a few months ago, the FDA removed the black box warning from varenicline.\n\nThe commentary was coauthored by Dianna Gaballa, a fourth-year medical student; Joanna Drowos, D.O., M.P.H., an associate professor of integrated medical science and associate chair of the Department of Integrated Medical Science; and Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., Dr.P.H., the first Sir Richard Doll Professor and senior academic advisor to the dean, all in FAU's Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine.\n\n\"The existing totality of evidence suggests an urgent need to increase the use of varenicline in the general population as well as in those with serious mental illness who on average die about 20 years earlier than the general population, in part, because their smoking rates may be as high as 75 percent,\" said Hennekens.\n\nQuitting smoking significantly reduces risks of cardiovascular disease beginning within a matter of months and reaching the non-smoker status within a few years, even among older adults. For lung and other cancers, however, reductions do not even begin to emerge for years after quitting and, even after 10 years, quitters achieve death rates only about midway between the continuing smoker and non-smoker.\n\n\"For reducing risks of cardiovascular disease it's never too late to quit, but to reduce risks of cancer, it's never too early,\" said Hennekens.\n\nThe authors speculate that if use of varenicline had not plummeted by 76 percent following the black box warning in 2009, perhaps 17,000 premature deaths from cardiovascular disease may have been avoided each year during the last few years. Public health efforts and effective cessation treatments including behavioral counseling and medication have resulted in a 14 percent decrease in smoking in the U.S. while the rates are markedly increasing in developing countries.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heart disease is the leading killer among men and women causing approximately 600,000 deaths each year.\n\nAmong the numerous honors and recognitions Hennekens has received include the Ochsner Award for reducing premature deaths from cigarettes in 2014. From 1995 to 2005, Science Watch ranked him as the third most widely cited medical researcher in the world and five of the top 20 were his former trainees and/or fellows. In 2012, Science Heroes ranked Hennekens No. 81 in the history of the world for having saved more than 1.1 million lives. In 2016, he was ranked the No. 14 \"Top Scientist in the World\" with an H-index of 173.\n\nAbout the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine:\n\nFAU's Charles E.

Yet 90% of these patients will be able to return home safely, as no trauma has been detected. Today, the only reliable diagnosis is the CT Scan, which is only available in some hospitals and, in addition to being expensive, exposes patients to radiations. Researchers from the University of Geneva (UNIGE), in collaboration with the Hospitals of Barcelona, Madrid and Seville, have developed a small device - Point-of-Care Test (POCT) - that analyses the level of proteins in the blood and allows, using a single drop of blood, to diagnose the possibility of a mild traumatic brain injury. This discovery, described in PLOS ONE, will not only relieve emergency departments, free patients from often long waits, but also save on costly medical examinations.\n\nFalling whilst skiing, tumbling down the stairs or getting hit on the head can cause symptoms such as blurred vision, vomiting, loss of consciousness or memory for about 30 minutes. There is then a risk of mild cerebral trauma, which represents more than 90% of brain injuries admitted to hospitals. But is there really a brain lesion? Or are these symptoms merely the consequence of the violence of the shock, of which will ultimately only leave a bump behind?\n\nToday, the injured patients have to go to the emergency rooms of hospitals equipped with a CT Scan, an expensive examination that sends X-rays to the brain to detect the presence or absence of brain trauma. As their case is not a priority, it often takes a long time for the majority of patients to return home without risk of sequelae, except for bad memories.\n\n\"We wondered if it was possible to isolate certain proteins whose presence in the blood increases in the event of mild traumatic brain injury,\u00bb explains Jean-Charles Sanchez, professor at the Department of Internal Medicine of Specialties and the Biomarkers Centre of the Faculty of Medicine of the UNIGE. \"Our idea was to find a way to do a quick examination that would allow, during a boxing or American football match for example, to determine whether the athlete can return to the field or if his condition requires hospitalization. The opposite of the CT Scan, an exam that lasts a long time and cannot be done anywhere,\" he adds.\n\nDuring a shock on the head, some brain cells are damaged and release the proteins they contain, increasing their level in the blood. Scientists at UNIGE and Spanish hospitals then compared the blood of patients admitted for mild traumatic brain injury but diagnosed as negative with that of patients actually suffering from a brain lesion. Using proteomic analyses, which can quantify thousands of proteins simultaneously and observe variations in their levels in the blood, they gradually isolated four molecules indicating the presence of a brain injury: H-FABP, Interleukin-10, S100B and GFAP. \"We have noticed that the H-FABP level alone makes it possible to confirm that there is no risk of trauma in one third of patients admitted after a shock,\" enthuses Jean-Charles Sanchez. The rest of the patients will have to undergo a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nIt was still necessary to develop a device that could be used everywhere, quickly and simply, and that could be available in pharmacies or sports halls. \"When a person has an accident in the mountain, few practices can do a CT Scan,\" notes the Geneva researcher. His team has developed a rapid diagnostic test (POCT) called TBIcheck, inspired by the principle of pregnancy testing: by placing a single drop of blood on the well of a small 5cm plastic case, the patient knows within 10 minutes whether there is a risk of mild trauma, namely whether or not his H-FABP level is higher than 2.5 nanograms per millilitre of blood. \"If a lane appears, the injured person must go to a hospital for a CT scan, if there is nothing, he can go home safely!\" Jean-Charles Sanchez says. In case of doubt when reading the result, a small reader, the Cube Reader, can be installed on TBIcheck. It will display the word \"positive\" or \"negative\" and send the result to the patient's or caregiver's smartphone via Bluetooth. No more doubts!\n\nThese results, patented by UNIGE and awarded the Prix de l'Innovation Academy in December 2017, will be marketed from 2019 by ABCDx, a start-up founded four years ago by Jean-Charles Sanchez of UNIGE and Joan Montaner of Vall d'Hebron Hospital in Barcelona, co-authors of this study. \"Today, our research shows that the results are even more accurate when we combine H-FABP and GFAP levels,\" continues Jean-Charles Sanchez. \"We are currently preparing an even more effective TBIcheck, which will allow 50% of patients to be sent home, but which requires an increase in the sensitivity of the test that receives the blood.\" ABCDx's ultimate goal is to bring to market biomarkers capable of diagnosing brain trauma, stroke and aneurysms. \"Biomarkers are a mine of information on patients' state of health, it is up to us to decode them,\" concludes the Geneva researcher.", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The news release stated that the test sponsor, the University of Geneva, holds a patent on the test which was developed by two of the study\u2019s authors who founded the company that will sell the test.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The way it works: A doctor draws a vial of your blood and separates it into its key components, the red blood cells, the clear serum and the platelets.

(Jan. 3, 2016) - Deregulation and inhibition of the immune system contributes to cancer development. Many therapeutic strategies aim to re-stimulate the immune system to recognize cancer cells and target them for destruction. Researchers from Moffitt Cancer Center report that a dendritic cell vaccine that targets the HER2 protein on breast cancer cells is safe and effectively stimulates the immune system leading to regression of early-stage breast cancer.\n\nThe HER2 protein is overexpressed in 20-25% of all breast cancer tumors and is associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis. Researchers have previously shown that immune cells are less able to recognize and target cancer cells that express HER2 as breast cancer progresses into a more advanced and invasive stage. This suggests that strategies that can restimulate the immune system to recognize and target HER2 early during cancer development may be effective treatment options.\n\nThe researchers previously developed a vaccine that helps the immune system recognize the HER2 protein on breast cancer cells. Their approach involves creating the vaccine from immune cells called dendritic cells that are harvested from each individual patient to create a personalized vaccine.\n\nIn order to determine if the HER2-dendritic cell vaccine is safe and effective, the researchers performed a clinical trial in 54 women who have HER2-expressing early-stage breast cancer. The dendritic cell vaccines were prepared by isolating dendritic cells from each patients' blood and exposing them to fragments of the HER2 protein. Patients were injected with a dose of their personal dendritic cell vaccine once a week for 6 weeks into either a lymph node, the breast tumor, or into both sites.\n\nThe researchers report that the dendritic cell vaccines were well-tolerated and patients only experienced low-grade toxicities. The most common adverse events were fatigue, injection site reactions, and chills. They also show that the vaccine was able to stimulate an immune response in the majority of the patients. Approximately 80% of evaluable patients had a detectable immune response in their peripheral blood and/or in their sentinel lymph node wherein their cancer is most likely to spread to first. Importantly, the immune responses among the patients were similar, regardless of the route of vaccine administration.\n\nThe Moffitt researchers assessed the effectiveness of the vaccine by determining the percentage of patients who had detectable disease within surgical specimens after resection. The absence of disease is termed a pathological complete response (pCR).

Earlier studies had proved that low-calorie diets could reduce weight and alter metabolism in obese people.\n\nA six-month study in 48 people directed by Dr. Ravussin, being published today in The Journal of the American Medical Association, is the first rigorous test of calorie restriction in people who are overweight but not obese. Most participants reduced calories by 25 percent, but some cut back more and ate only 890 calories a day for several months.\n\n\"There's never been a study like this one,\" said Dr. Evan Hadley, director of geriatrics and clinical gerontology at the National Institute on Aging, which paid for the study. He called the results \"striking,\" even though the experiment was only a pilot study for a two-year trial of calorie restriction due to begin in the fall.\n\nAmong the main findings of Dr. Ravussin's study was that calorie restriction led to decreases in insulin levels and body temperature. Both are considered signs of longevity, partly because an earlier study by other researchers found both traits in long-lived people. The diet also led to a drop in thyroid hormones and declines in DNA damage.\n\nBut Dr. Ravussin and Dr. Hadley cautioned that the study was preliminary, and that it did not prove that calorie restriction could make people healthier or add years to their lives.\n\n\"It's an important step along the way,\" Dr. Hadley said.\n\nScientists have known for years that when people cut calories and lose weight, the body tries to compensate by slowing its metabolic rate. The slowing is a defensive mechanism to fight weight loss. It was probably preserved by evolution because it saved people from starving to death when food was scarce, but it is the bane of dieters because it means that the more weight they lose, the harder it is to keep reducing.\n\nSeveral explanations exist for why a strict diet, low in calories but high in nutrients, may slow aging. Many scientists think that an important factor in aging is DNA damage caused by free radicals, highly reactive oxygen-containing molecules formed during normal metabolism. Eating less leads to a slower metabolism and fewer free radicals.\n\nAnother possibility is that being deficient in calories turns certain genes on and off, with a net effect of slowing the clock.\n\nIn rhesus monkeys, calorie restriction has had pronounced effects. A University of Wisconsin team led by Richard Weindruch has been studying 76 monkeys for more than a decade, half on low-calorie diets and half in a control group that eats normally.\n\nThe low-calorie animals weigh about 30 percent less and have 70 percent less body fat than the controls, as well as lower insulin levels. The calorie-restricted monkeys have had two cases of cancer, compared with five in the controls. The controls have had twice the death rate from aging-related diseases like heart failure and diabetes. About 90 percent of the monkeys on low-calorie diets are still alive, compared with only about 70 percent of the controls.\n\nDr. Ravussin's study included men and women, ages 27 to 49, who were overweight but not obese. Some were just a bit heavy, but others were 30 pounds overweight.\n\nFor six months, a control group ate a diet created to maintain members' weights. Another group ate 75 percent of what members needed to keep their weight steady. A third group had members' calories cut 12.5 percent and their exercise increased to burn off 12.5 percent.\n\nThe final group went on an extreme diet of 890 calories a day \u2014 less than half of what most adults need \u2014 for two or three months, until members lost about 15 percent of their body weight. They then switched to a diet meant to keep them at their new lower weight.\n\nPart of the reason for the study, Dr. Ravussin said, was to find out whether people could stand calorie restriction. The participants, who were paid, turned out to be highly motivated, he said. Some were concerned about their weight and health. They had to take time off work for metabolism tests and also ate many meals at the clinic.\n\nJerelyn Key, 44, a Social Security claims representative, joined because she wanted to learn better eating habits for herself and her family. Ms. Key was assigned to the very-low-calorie group. For two months, she ate four or five shakes a day and a specially formulated \"brownie,\" adding up to just 890 calories a day. She is 5-foot-7, and her starting weight was 165 to 170; after two months she had lost about 28 pounds.\n\n\"I look back now wondering how I managed to do it,\" Ms. Key said. She has regained a bit and now weighs 140 to 145 pounds.\n\nAnother participant, Oscar Couvillion, 45, an insurance database administrator, said he was lured by a radio advertisement offering participants $7,000. There was heart disease in Mr. Couvillion's family, and at 5-foot-9, he weighed 192 pounds, about 30 pounds too much.\n\nHe wound up in the group assigned to cut calories by 25 percent.

The score, published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal), can also identify patients at risk of subsequent heart issues after discharge.\n\n\"We have developed a simple lab score that is superior to using cardiac troponin alone for the identification of patients at low and high risk for heart attack or death at emergency department presentation,\" say Dr. Peter Kavsak, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario. According to Professor Andrew Worster, also from McMaster University, \"This lab score may reduce both the number of blood tests and time spent in the emergency department for chest pain patients.\"\n\nPatients with chest pain symptoms require multiple blood tests over several hours before a diagnosis is reached. Previous studies using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin alone to rule out and rule in heart attacks have not consistently demonstrated sufficient safety to use in clinical practice.\n\nIn this international study, researchers from Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Germany combined common laboratory blood tests available at many hospitals around the world to create a single laboratory score, or clinical chemistry score, to diagnose heart attack. These blood tests are part of the World Health Organization's list of essential in vitro diagnostics tests for health care facilities with clinical laboratories.\n\nThe researchers validated the clinical chemistry score as a predictor of heart attack or death within 30 days using data on 4245 patients from emergency department studies in the four countries. Within one month of the emergency department visits, 727 heart attacks or death in patients occurred. A negative (or low-risk) clinical chemistry score at emergency department presentation missed only one of these events compared with up to 25 missed heart attacks/death when using a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin test alone. A positive (or high-risk) clinical chemistry score also identified about 75% of patients at high risk of heart attack or death when positive compared with a low of 40% detected when the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin test alone was positive. The clinical chemistry score worked equally well in men and women.\n\nThe authors suggest the score can be useful for standardizing diagnoses and improving safety.\n\n\"Adoption of the clinical chemistry score algorithm would standardize reporting of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin test results, how the tests are interpreted in the normal range, and represent an option less susceptible to both analytical and preanalytical errors.

No longer did he always have to buy the aisle seat at the theater because \"you feel guilty hanging over the person sitting next to you.\" No longer did he have to endure humiliations such as breaking a chair at his brother's wedding.\n\nThe best part, says Thayer, a Boston area professor, was not having to \"think about food for the first time in my life. It was fantastic. I ate when I was hungry, stopped when I was full. I didn't feel like I was fighting an uphill battle.\"\n\nUntil five years later, when the weight started creeping back on.\n\nWhen the 6-foot Thayer edged up to 310 earlier this year at age 45, he decided to go for a second operation: adjustable banding, more commonly known as lap-band surgery, which allows for repeated stomach-tightening and thereby offers a new opportunity for reining in appetite. Reactions to his decision vary, he says. While some people close to him worry about his going under the knife again, others have asked, \"What the hell did you do wrong?\"\n\nSecond surgeries to combat obesity are on the rise. The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery doesn't keep statistics on repeat customers, but obesity surgeons are reporting upticks. Dennis Halmi, a member of the Bluepoint Surgical Group in Woodbridge, says that in 2002 \"we did a handful\" of second operations on obesity patients, \"maybe five, six. This year we are doing probably 30.\" Scott Shikora of Tufts Medical Center in Boston says that until recently he hadn't performed a second obesity operation on anybody but is already up to about a half-dozen patients. Thayer was one of them.\n\nGeorge Fielding, whose obesity surgery practice at the NYU Medical Center in New York has gone from two or three second operations in 2004 to \"probably 20 or 25 this year,\" isn't surprised at the trend. \"There was a huge surge in gastric bypass from 1998 to 2001,\" he says. \"Going into the early 2000s, everyone thought the gastric bypass was the best thing since Eric Clapton picked up a guitar. Then they went and hid, then they came in for help.\"\n\nThe second time around, many, like Thayer, are opting for the adjustable band, which works differently from the bypass. With a bypass, 95 percent of the stomach is closed off with a stapling device. What could once stretch to the size of a football is reduced to the size of an egg that can't hold more than a tablespoon or two of food. In addition, the small intestine, where food goes when it leaves the stomach, is cut into two pieces. The lower piece, two to three feet down from the upper piece, is connected to the new, tiny stomach pouch. Thus, when food empties from the stomach, it bypasses a few feet of upper intestine, which means that fewer nutrients (including fewer calories) are absorbed by the body.\n\nObesity surgeons, Fielding included, report a high success rate for the bypass. Bypass patients lose some 60 to 80 percent of their excess weight, and 60 to 80 percent of those patients keep off at least two-thirds of the weight they lose. Such people often experience a near-complete reversal of diabetes, sleep apnea, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, arthritis pain and a host of other health-compromising problems, frequently going from several prescription drugs a day to none.\n\nThe thing is, for about 20 to 40 percent of patients, the operation fails over the long term. It's not always clear why. In a number of people, the stomach pouch softens, as does the opening between the stomach and the small intestine. That allows more food through more quickly, and the person's old level of hunger begins to return. As Joseph Moresca, a New York nurse who initially went from 440 pounds to 220 with a bypass, put it, \"instead of being able to eat a quarter of a sandwich, I was eating three-quarters of a sandwich.\" He regained 45 pounds by the time he decided to go for banding.\n\nIn contrast to the bypass, the band does its work by separating the stomach into two parts: a tiny upper pouch and a larger pouch below the band. The tighter the band, the more slowly food goes from the upper part of the stomach to the lower, reducing hunger dramatically. The operation is far safer than bypass surgery because organs are not being cut and sewn. In addition, there's no nutrient malabsorption as there is with the bypass, because the small intestine is left intact; banding patients do not have to take nutrient supplements for the rest of their lives, the way bypass patients do.\n\nBut the biggest difference is that when hunger starts to return, the banding patient can go in to his doctor's office for a tightening. The band is shaped like a little life preserver that can fill and go slack. Saline solution injected into it through a portal just beneath the skin makes it more taut. The tighter the band, the less hungry you are, the less food you can get down comfortably, and the less you eat.\n\nBut in that advantage lies the band's disadvantage. If the patient doesn't go in for adjustments, the whole thing won't work. Also, you can eat around, or rather, through, the band. Ice cream shakes and other very soft or liquid foods can go through even a tight band, and every obesity surgeon can point to band patients who have sabotaged their operations by eating foods that slip right through. The ability to control the tightness is presumably part of the reason that patients who opt for banding lose less weight, at least initially, than gastric bypass patients -- an average of 50 to 65 percent of their excess weight in the first three years.\n\nAnother difference between the band and the bypass that proves both a plus and a minus is that the band doesn't cause the dumping syndrome. That's an often frightening attack of sweating, nausea, faintness, diarrhea, cramps and rapid pulse that bypass patients sometimes suffer after eating just a bite of a sugary food -- a deterrent to consuming certain calorie-dense items.\n\nOf course, a second obesity surgery comes with increased risk. After a gastric bypass, there's often scarring that causes organs to adhere to one another. \"The liver, stomach, spleen and diaphragm -- they all get drawn in together in a big blob of scar,\" says NYU surgeon Fielding. Thayer says his banding operation, which would typically take about an hour, kept him under general anesthesia for 3 1/2 hours because his surgeon \"ran into a lot of adhesions.\"\n\nAlong with the risk comes the uncertainty of how well people will be able to lose -- and keep off -- weight the second time around. Not enough time has elapsed since the advent of second operations to get a long-term assessment.\n\nWhat obesity surgeons do feel confident saying is that no matter which type of surgery is chosen, and whether it's the first or second time, the patient has to meet the operation halfway. You \"still have to follow some semblance of dietary compliance,\" says Tufts's Shikora. \"You also have to be more physically active, take care of your health. And you have to follow up.\"\n\nIn other words, anyone who sees obesity surgery as a solution in itself is chasing weight-loss rainbows.\n\nThayer, who was down 30 pounds a month after having had his band inserted, gets it. \"You still have to diet,\" he says. \"You still have to commit to an exercise plan.\" No obesity operation is \"a magic bullet.\" But what he misses is that the bypass operation initially let him maintain his weight loss without putting extraordinary focus on his efforts.\n\nLike a lot of other obese people, he says, he \"had always been a person who could lose 100 pounds. I did it many, many times. The problem is, I'm not a great maintainer.\" The bypass, at least at first, let him not only achieve but also maintain the weight loss without thinking much about it. \"I didn't have to count calories. I exercised,o but I didn't have to exercise two hours a day in order to stay at that weight.\"\n\nHe wants the new procedure to return his appetite to a more manageable level so that it helps the pounds stay off. \"I'm hoping that this band will not allow me to eat a whole pizza anymore,\" he says. \"Last summer I was able to eat a whole pizza again, and I was like, this can't be right.\"\n\nLarry Lindner's latest book is \"Fighting Weight\" (HarperCollins), co-authored with George Fielding, Christine Ren and Khaliah Ali, Muhammad Ali's daughter, whose weight loss is the subject of the book.

(Oct. 29, 2015) - Rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is one of the most dramatic medical emergencies a person can face. It usually strikes without warning, killing approximately 50 percent of those who experience it before they reach a hospital. Of those who do get to a health facility alive, only about 50 percent survive. When diagnosed through screening, aortic aneurysms are carefully monitored for signs of enlargement, and surgical intervention often is needed to prevent rupture of the vessel. Now, University of Missouri researchers have found that patients who took cholesterol-lowering medications before endovascular surgery experienced fewer complications and better outcomes.\n\n\"Although this condition usually occurs in men older than 50 with a family history of the disease, anyone can have an abdominal aortic aneurysm,\" said Todd Vogel, associate professor and chief of the Division of Vascular Surgery at the MU School of Medicine, and lead author of the study. \"Most patients with this disease are older and tend to have other health conditions such as high cholesterol. In an effort to prevent cardiovascular disease they take statin medications. These cholesterol-lowering medications protect blood vessels from plaque formation and stress, and in some cases can even slow the progression of aortic aneurysms. We wanted to understand the impact statin use has on surgical outcomes when repairing this type of aneurysm.\"\n\nVogel's research team reviewed nearly 20,000 cases where patients either had open surgery or an endovascular repair - a minimally invasive procedure that uses a catheter to access the aneurysm. The team then identified patients who took cholesterol-lowering medication before surgery.\n\n\"Our research showed that patients who took statins before either open or minimally invasive interventions had better outcomes compared to those who did not take statin medications,\" Vogel said. \"The patients who took statins and had endovascular repairs had a 26 percent decrease in mortality up to one year after surgery. Patients who took statins and had traditional open procedures also did better, but the difference was not nearly as significant as with endovascular repair. The bottom line is that patients who used statins were more likely to survive during and after an elective endovascular procedure.\"\n\nAdditionally, the study showed that statin use also reduced post-surgical complications for patients with other health issues such as peripheral artery disease, a condition that causes arterial blockages of blood vessels in the limbs.\n\n\"This information could be beneficial to patients who are about to have elective endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair,\" Vogel said. \"However, further research is needed to assess the benefits of using statins before surgical repair of other types of aneurysms.\"\n\nThe study, \"The Impact of Preoperative Statin Therapy on Open and Endovascular Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair Outcomes,\" recently was published in Vascular, the official publication of the International Society for Vascular Surgery.\n\nThe MU School of Medicine has improved health, education and research in Missouri and beyond for more than 165 years.

It is usually recommended when doctors feel someone's advanced age will allow them to outlive the generally slow-moving cancer or when someone has other conditions that are more likely to prove lethal.\n\nMen who are diagnosed with early prostate cancer -- meaning it's confined to the prostate gland and has not spread -- are confronted with a bewildering array of options for treating it: surgery; radiation; drugs to deprive the tumor of the hormone androgen that may drive its growth; or watchful waiting.\n\nIn 2008, AHRQ also commissioned a review of studies on other prostate cancer treatment options, but that report could not draw conclusions on the best approach either.\n\n\"What all of these analyses have found is there is very limited data that allows us to determine which of these approaches in the best approach,\" said Dr. Durado Brooks, director of prostate cancer for the American Cancer Society.\n\nBrooks said more comparative effectiveness research, which compares different kinds of treatments, is needed.\n\nIn the meantime, what are men diagnosed with early prostate cancer to do?\n\nMen and their doctors need to consider what the tumor looks like under the microscope, which can help gauge how aggressive it may be. They should also consider age and overall health status, including whether or not the patient has other conditions more likely to cause death than the prostate cancer.\n\nFinally, patients and their doctors should weight the potential debilitating side effects of the treatments, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction, against how comfortable the man is with holding off on treatment, experts say.\n\n\"Men need to learn as much as they can about the possible outcomes and benefits of the various treatments and the potential side effects, and choose which direction they are most comfortable with,\" Brooks said.\n\nIn the current review, researchers found several trials that compared different doses of radiation and different types of radiation therapy, including external beam radiation therapy, in which a radiation is delivered through a beam through the skin, or brachytherapy, in which radioactive isotopes are delivered via injection into the prostate.\n\nFor those methods, too, there was too little research to say with confidence which method was superior in preventing deaths from prostate cancer, the researchers said. Retrospective studies, however, found that radiation treatments were associated with increased urinary or bowel problems, compared with no treatment or no initial treatment.\n\nThere was also \"moderate strength evidence\" that a higher external beam radiation was more effective than a lower dose.\n\nTaken together, the review \"does point out that based on current evidence, doctors should not be telling their patients that this form of radiation is better than that form,\" Brooks said. \"Some of the distinctions being made are not really supported by the evidence.\"\n\nProton beam therapy in particular is expensive, but according to this report, there isn't enough evidence to show it's any better than other option.\n\nRadiation, he noted, may be the best option for men whose tumors have spread outside the gland, since simply removing the prostate gland surgically is not likely to be as effective, he said.\n\nThe American Cancer Society estimates that in 2009, approximately 192,000 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer and approximately 27,000 men died of the disease.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute has more on prostate cancer.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story turned to Dr. Durado Brooks of the American Cancer Society for an independent perspective.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Select patients age 90 years and older with aortic stenosis (AS) can benefit from a relatively new, minimally invasive surgery for aortic valve replacement, according to an article in the September 2015 issue of the Annals of Thoracic Surgery.\n\u2022 Both transfemoral and transapical approaches to TAVR appear to be safe and effective for treatment of aortic stenosis in select patients age 90 years and older.\n\u2022 By 6 months post-surgery, most quality-of-life measures had stabilized at a level considerably better than baseline, meaning patients quality of life was better than it was prior to surgery.\n\u2022 Future studies are needed to address potential differences in outcomes between TF- and TA-TAVR groups.\n\nAs part of the PARTNER-I trial, Vinod H. Thourani, MD, from Emory University in Atlanta, and colleagues from 12 other institutions in the United States found that transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a safe and effective way to treat aortic stenosis in nonagenarians who qualify for the surgical technique.\n\n\"Historically, extreme elderly patients can be at a very high risk for open surgery,\" said Dr. Thourani. \"We still believe that for those 90 year olds who are low-or intermediate risk, surgical options may be a viable procedure. However, with the advent of TAVR technology, we can now offer these extreme elderly patients a treatment option that otherwise would have been high-risk or prohibitive.\"\n\nAortic stenosis is the most common acquired valve disease in elderly patients and affects nearly 3% of those over the age of 75, according to the American Heart Association. The ability to safely treat AS patients has become increasingly important; the US government predicts that the number of Americans over the age of 85 will exceed 11 million in the next 20 years.\n\nFor the study, the researchers used two different approaches: transfemoral TAVR (TF-TAVR), which is the traditional approach performed via the groin, and transapical TAVR (TA-TAVR), which is performed via the heart muscle. TA-TAVR is an alternative for patients who are medically ineligible for TF-TAVR secondary to severe peripheral vascular disease. While the current study did not evaluate other alternative options for TAVR, these techniques may include transaortic, transcaval, transcarotid, or trans-subclavian.\n\nIn the largest series published to date, between April 2007 and February 2012, 531 nonagenarians underwent TAVR: 329 with TF-TAVR and 202 with TA-TAVR.\n\n\"We evaluated perioperative, short-, and mid-term outcomes following both TF- and TA-TAVR,\" explained Dr. Thourani. \"Compared with an age-sex-race-matched US population, the TAVR patients had a comparable risk of mortality, and quality of life improved within 6 months of the procedure. Our study shows that age alone should not preclude referral for TAVR in patients age 90 years and older.\"\n\nThe study also showed that the 30-day stroke risk was 3.6% in TF-TAVR patients and 2.0% in TA-TAVR patients. Major complications, such as bleeding or vascular issues, occurred in 35% of TF-TAVR patients and 32% of TA-TAVR patients, and more than 80% of patients were discharged home after the procedure.\n\n\"Future studies are needed to address potential differences in outcomes between TF- and TA-TAVR groups,\" said Dr. Thourani, \"but I'm thrilled that we're able to give elderly people the chance to continue enjoying life in their golden years. Many would not have had that option without TAVR.\"\n\nThourani V, Jensen H, Babaliaros V, Kodali S, Rajeswaran J, Ehrlinger J, Blackstone E, Suri R, Don C, Aldea G, Williams M, Makkar R, Svensson L, McCabe J, Dean L, Kapadia S, Cohen D, Pichard A, Szeto W, Herrmann H, Devireddy C, Leshnower B, Ailawadi G, Maniar H, Hahn R, Leon M, Mack M.

The findings suggest that many of our expectations about the inevitability of physical decline with advancing years may be incorrect and that how we age is, to a large degree, up to us.\n\nAging remains a surprisingly mysterious process. A wealth of past scientific research has shown that many bodily and cellular processes change in undesirable ways as we grow older. But science has not been able to establish definitively whether such changes result primarily from the passage of time \u2014 in which case they are inevitable for anyone with birthdays \u2014 or result at least in part from lifestyle, meaning that they are mutable.\n\nThis conundrum is particularly true in terms of inactivity. Older people tend to be quite sedentary nowadays, and being sedentary affects health, making it difficult to separate the effects of not moving from those of getting older.\n\nIn the new study, which was published this week in The Journal of Physiology, scientists at King\u2019s College London and the University of Birmingham in England decided to use a different approach.\n\nThey removed inactivity as a factor in their study of aging by looking at the health of older people who move quite a bit.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to understand what happens to the functioning of our bodies as we get older if we take the best-case scenario,\u201d said Stephen Harridge, senior author of the study and director of the Centre of Human and Aerospace Physiological Sciences at King\u2019s College London.\n\nTo accomplish that goal, the scientists recruited 85 men and 41 women aged between 55 and 79 who bicycle regularly. The volunteers were all serious recreational riders but not competitive athletes. The men had to be able to ride at least 62 miles in six and a half hours and the women 37 miles in five and a half hours, benchmarks typical of a high degree of fitness in older people.\n\nThe scientists then ran each volunteer through a large array of physical and cognitive tests. The scientists determined each cyclist\u2019s endurance capacity, muscular mass and strength, pedaling power, metabolic health, balance, memory function, bone density and reflexes. They also had the volunteers complete the so-called Timed Up and Go test, during which someone stands up from a chair without using his or her arms, briskly walks about 10 feet, turns, walks back and sits down again.\n\nThe researchers compared the results of cyclists in the study against each other and also against standard benchmarks of supposedly normal aging. If a particular test\u2019s numbers were similar among the cyclists of all ages, the researchers considered, then that measure would seem to be more dependent on activity than on age.\n\nAs it turned out, the cyclists did not show their age. On almost all measures, their physical functioning remained fairly stable across the decades and was much closer to that of young adults than of people their age. As a group, even the oldest cyclists had younger people\u2019s levels of balance, reflexes, metabolic health and memory ability.\n\nAnd their Timed Up and Go results were exemplary. Many older people require at least 7 seconds to complete the task, with those requiring 9 or 10 seconds considered to be on the cusp of frailty, Dr. Harridge said. But even the oldest cyclists in this study averaged barely 5 seconds for the walk, which is \u201cwell within the norm reported for healthy young adults,\u201d the study authors write.\n\nSome aspects of aging did, however, prove to be ineluctable. The oldest cyclists had less muscular power and mass than those in their 50s and early 60s and considerably lower overall aerobic capacities. Age does seem to reduce our endurance and strength to some extent, Dr. Harridge said, even if we exercise.\n\nBut even so, both of those measures were higher among the oldest cyclists than would be considered average among people aged 70 or above.\n\nAll in all, the numbers suggest that aging is simply different in the active.\n\n\u201cIf you gave this dataset to a clinician and asked him to predict the age\u201d of one of the cyclists based on his or her test results, Dr. Harridge said, \u201cit would be impossible.\u201d On paper, they all look young.\n\nOf course, this study is based on a single snapshot of an unusual group of older adults, Dr. Harridge said. He and his colleagues plan to retest their volunteers in five and 10 years, which will provide better information about the ongoing effects of exercise on aging.\n\nBut even in advance of those results, said Dr. Harridge, himself almost 50 and an avid cyclist, this study shows that \u201cbeing physically active makes your body function on the inside more like a young person\u2019s.\u201d", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "We are given no comments by a non-involved source on the value or limitations of this small study.

He walks about 50,000 steps a week, golfs, works out and tap dances and consumes about 1,800 daily calories.\n\nHis results do not surprise researchers.\n\nThe blood-sugar level for a healthy adult, measured as milligrams of glucose per deciliter, is generally 70 to 100 mg/dl. Mr. Held's blood-sugar levels remain at 101 -- the exact level he had 10 years ago. That's to say, he's delayed the onset of type 2 diabetes and potentially can prevent the onset for the rest of his life.\n\n\"I feel that it's keeping me healthy,\" said the retired metallurgist. \"It forces me to monitor myself. After doing it for so long, it's not hard to do.\"\n\nThe study, known as DPPOS, puts science behind Mr. Held's success. For 10 years, researchers tracked 2,766 people nationwide with pre-diabetes -- a metabolic condition featuring slightly elevated blood-glucose levels that often serves as a precursor to type 2 diabetes.\n\nDPPOS proved that intensive lifestyle changes resulting in even modest weight loss reduced development of type 2 diabetes by 34 percent, compared with people at high risk for diabetes who only took a placebo and didn't alter lifestyle.\n\nThe study is published online today in the The Lancet, a medical journal.\n\nOverall results show that participants randomly assigned to make lifestyle changes had more favorable cardiovascular risk factors including lower blood pressure and triglyceride levels, despite taking fewer drugs to control heart disease risk.\n\nThe group that took metformin prevented the onset of type 2 by 18 percent, compared with the control group on a placebo. That means lifestyle changes were twice as effective as medicine in delaying or preventing diabetes.\n\nThe study also concluded that participants who underwent positive lifestyle changes delayed type 2 diabetes by about four years, compared with the control group. Benefits of intensive lifestyle changes were most pronounced in the elderly, with people 60 or older reducing the rate of developing type 2 diabetes by half.\n\nIntensive lifestyle changes include lowering fat and calories in the diet, learning behavior modification skills and increasing physical activity to 150 minutes per week.\n\nElizabeth M. Venditti, assistant professor of psychiatry at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic and director of the Lifestyle Resource Corps for DPPOS, said the study proves people can prevent or delay the onset of diabetes. \"We were hopeful and now encouraged that modest lifestyle changes produce benefits,\" she said.\n\nStudy participants, who still undergo physical screening twice a year, show benefits, even for those with a weight loss of only 5 pounds. Most initially lost 15 pounds before regaining some of the weight.\n\n\"There is no magic bullet,\" Dr. Venditti said. \"We used solid behavioral principles and teachings, and a community of support.\"\n\nMore than 24 million people in the United States have diabetes, which is a main cause of kidney failure, heart disease, stroke, limb amputations and new-onset blindness.

The annual conference is hosted by the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) and The Obesity Society (TOS).\n\n\u201cThe significant weight loss achieved with the Obalon 6-Month Balloon System is maintained at 12 months,\u201d said Aurora Pryor, MD, study co-author and Chief Bariatric, Foregut and Advanced GI Surgery, Stony Brook University. \u201cThis combination of lifestyle modification and balloon therapy provides a new low risk option for patients struggling with obesity.\u201d\n\nThe Obalon 6-Month Balloon System, a swallowable, gas-filled intragastric balloon for weight loss in adults with obesity for whom diet and exercise has failed, was approved in September by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It involves a balloon contained within a capsule that, once it reaches the stomach, is inflated with gas via a microcatheter. Up to three balloons may be placed over the first three months, but the entire treatment period lasts six months. The inflated balloons make patients feel full. Treatment is accompanied by a moderate intensity diet and behavior modification program. The device is manufactured by Obalon Therapeutics, Inc., based in San Diego, CA.\n\nResults of the study were based on a double-blinded randomized, sham-controlled trial of 387 patients, about half of whom received treatment with the Obalon balloon and the other half with a sugar-filled sham capsule designed to look like the device. Patients, who had a body mass index (BMI) of between 30 and 40, swallowed three capsules over a 12-week period (one every three weeks). All patients at the 15 study sites also underwent 25 minutes of lifestyle therapy administered by a blinded registered dietitian every three weeks. After six months, patients were informed which capsule they received and those with the Obalon balloons had them removed endoscopically.\n\nAverage percent total weight loss after six months for Obalon balloon patients was 6.81 percent, while those in the sham control group had 3.59 percent total average weight loss. Balloon-treated patients had nearly 25 percent excess weight loss. Six months after the balloons were removed, 89.5 percent of the average total weight lost during the treatment period was maintained. Researchers say a single adverse event, a bleeding gastric ulcer, occurred in one balloon patient on high dose NSAIDs who had an outpatient knee replacement procedure. Non-serious adverse device events, mostly abdominal cramping and nausea, occurred in 90.8 percent of patients (99.6% were rated mild or moderate).\n\n\u201cThere is no magic pill for obesity, but this swallowable balloon and other intragastric balloons may offer new hope to people who otherwise would not seek treatment or not have as good a result with diet and exercise alone,\u201d said Raul J. Rosenthal, MD, ASMBS President and Chairman, Department of General Surgery, Cleveland Clinic Florida, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThe balloon and other technologies may help to fill the therapeutic gaps between diet and exercise and medical therapy, and medical therapy and surgery, where the gaps are quite large.\u201d\n\nPeople with obesity and severe obesity have higher rates of heart disease, diabetes, some cancers, arthritis, sleep apnea, high blood pressure and dozens of other diseases and conditions. Studies have shown individuals with a BMI greater than 30 have a 50 to 100 percent greater risk of premature death compared to healthy weight individuals.[1][2]\n\nMetabolic/bariatric surgery has been shown to be the most effective and long lasting treatment for severe obesity and many related conditions and results in significant weight loss. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) reported significant improvements in the safety of metabolic/bariatric surgery due in large part to improved laparoscopic techniques.[3] The risk of death is about 0.1 percent[4] and the overall likelihood of major complications is about 4 percent.[5]\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2011\u20132014, the prevalence of obesity was just over 36 percent in adults, with a higher prevalence among women than men (38.3% vs. 34.3%) and older than younger adults (37% vs. 32.3%). Obese is medically defined as having a body mass index (BMI), a measure of height to weight, that's more than 30. The ASMBS estimates about 24 million Americans have severe obesity, which would mean a BMI of 35 or more with an obesity-related condition like diabetes or a BMI of 40.\n\nAbout the ASMBSThe ASMBS is the largest organization for bariatric surgeons in the nation. It is a non-profit organization that works to advance the art and science of bariatric surgery and is committed to educating medical professionals and the lay public about bariatric surgery as an option for the treatment of morbid obesity, as well as the associated risks and benefits. It encourages its members to investigate and discover new advances in bariatric surgery, while maintaining a steady exchange of experiences and ideas that may lead to improved surgical outcomes for morbidly obese patients.

This allowed the investigators to see which parts of the brain were being activated in typical children versus children with autism.\n\n\"We were looking for areas of the brain that are more responsive during listening to bedtime stories than when they're not hearing that,\" Eyler said.\n\nIn the typically developing children, both sides of the brain involved in language processing were activated. In the youngest children, the activation was about equal in both the right and left hemisphere, while in the older children, activity became more pronounced on the left side, which is similar to adult patterns and to be expected, Eyler explained.\n\nBut in the autistic children, there was slightly more right hemisphere response than left hemisphere, and there was no change in activity across the age range.\n\n\"We didn't see that growth of the left hemisphere [in the children with autism],\" Eyler said.\n\n\"We now feel pretty confident that, in many children with autism, there are alterations either in structure growth or connectivity of the brain, but we really don't understand the implications of that for core features of autism, one of which is problems with communication,\" Amaral said. \"This provides more evidence for abnormal connectivity in the brain.\"\n\nThe Autism Society of America has more on this disorder.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The idependent sources were well chosen and well quoted.

But a new study suggests these drugs may also help keep dementia at bay.\n\nThe researchers said that the key is to start blood thinners, such as warfarin, soon after atrial fibrillation is diagnosed. That's true even for people at low risk of a stroke who wouldn't normally be given blood thinners.\n\n\"We found that people who are on warfarin -- the most common blood thinner used to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation -- experienced very low rates of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease,\" said lead researcher Dr. T. Jared Bunch. He's director of heart rhythm research at Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute in Murray, Utah.\n\nAtrial fibrillation is a common heart abnormality that affects nearly 3 million American adults. It causes the heart to beat abnormally or quiver. This causes blood to pool, and then it can clot.\n\nAtrial fibrillation can cause dementia by damaging tiny blood vessels in the brain through repeated tiny clots or small bleeds that people aren't even aware of, Bunch explained.\n\nWhile many patients are initially given aspirin, Bunch said aspirin's benefit in cutting the risk for dementia is limited, and patients should be started on warfarin or another blood thinner.\n\nAlthough the study looked at patients taking warfarin (Coumadin), newer drugs -- including rivaroxaban (Xarelto) and apixaban (Eliquis) -- should reduce the risk of dementia even more, Bunch said.\n\nIn patients with atrial fibrillation, the risk of stroke is usually measured using the so-called CHADS score, the researchers said. This score assigns points for several risk factors, such as age, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes and a previous stroke.\n\nA score of zero to one usually means blood thinners aren't needed because the risk for stroke is low. For patients with scores above one, blood thinners are considered necessary, as these patients are judged to be at moderate to high risk, according to the researchers.\n\nIn this study, however, the investigators said they found that even a short delay in giving blood thinners to patients at low risk for stroke increases the risk for dementia.\n\nIn patients considered at low-risk for stroke, delaying blood-thinning treatment increased the risk for dementia 30 percent. In high-risk patients, a delay increased the risk 136 percent, the researchers reported.\n\nThe longer the delay in giving blood thinners, the more the risk for dementia, the researchers said.\n\nFor the study, Bunch and his colleagues looked at information from more than 76,000 atrial fibrillation patients who had no history of dementia. The average age of the study participants was 69, and 57 percent were male. The researchers looked at when treatment began: either within 30 days of atrial fibrillation diagnosis, which was considered immediate; or after a year, which was considered delayed.\n\n\"Once you are diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, starting stroke-prevention strategies immediately is essential. We shouldn't wait longer than a month to begin treatment,\" Bunch said. \"The delay in treating can be devastating to patients when they start developing mental decline years later,\" he added.\n\nThe results of the study were scheduled for presentation Friday at the meeting of the Heart Rhythm Society in Chicago. Findings presented at meetings are generally viewed as preliminary until they've been published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nAccording to Dr. Byron Lee of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), \"There is a growing body of literature supporting the connection between atrial fibrillation and dementia.\" Lee is a professor of medicine and director of the electrophysiology laboratories and clinics at UCSF.\n\n\"Therefore,\" he said, \"we need to be extremely aggressive in treating atrial fibrillation patients with anticoagulants [blood thinners] when indicated. This study shows that treatment delays of even one month can greatly increase the incidence of cognitive [mental] decline,\" Lee said.\n\nFor more on atrial fibrillation, visit the American Heart Association.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "A second source appears to be independent of the study, although readers are not given enough information to determine that.

Many are pushing for cannabis as a treatment for the abuse of opioids and illegal narcotics such as heroin, and as an alternative to painkillers.\n\nIt's a tempting sell in New England, hard hit by the painkiller and heroin crisis. But there's a problem: There is very little research showing marijuana works as a treatment for such addictions.\n\nAdvocates argue a growing body of scientific literature supports the idea, pointing to a study in the Journal of Pain this year that found that chronic pain sufferers significantly reduced their opioid use when taking medical cannabis. Another study, published last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found cannabis can be effective in treating chronic pain and other ailments.\n\nThe research falls short of concluding marijuana helps wean people off opioids - Vicodin, Oxycontin and related painkillers - and heroin, though. Many medical professionals say there's not enough evidence for them to confidently prescribe it.\n\nIn Maine, which is considering adding opioid and heroin addiction to the list of conditions that qualify for medical marijuana, Michelle Ham said marijuana helped her end a years-long addiction to painkillers prescribed for a bad back and neck. Tired of feeling \"like a zombie,\" the 37-year-old mother of two decided to quit cold turkey, which she said brought on convulsions and other withdrawal symptoms. Then, a friend mentioned marijuana, which Maine had legalized in 1999 for chronic pain and scores of other medical conditions. Ham gave it a try in 2013 and said the pain is under control and she hasn't gone back on the opioids.\n\n\"Before, I couldn't even function. I couldn't get anything done,\" Ham said. \"Now, I actually organize volunteers, and we have a donations center to help the needy.\"\n\nBolstered by stories like Ham's, doctors are experimenting with marijuana as an addiction treatment in Massachusetts and California. Supporters in Maine are pushing for its inclusion in qualifying conditions for medical marijuana. Vermonters are making the case for addiction treatment in their push to legalize pot.\n\nAuthorities are also desperate to curb a sharp rise in overdoses; Maine saw a 31 percent increase last year, and drug-related deaths in Vermont have jumped 44 percent since 2010. Vermont officials also blame opioid abuse for a 40 percent increase over the past two years of children in state custody.\n\n\"I don't think it's a cure for everybody,\" said Maine Rep. Diane Russell, a Portland Democrat and a leader in the state effort to legalize marijuana. \"But why take a solution off the table when people are telling us and physicians are telling us that it's working?\"\n\nMost states with medical marijuana allow it for a list of qualifying conditions. Getting on that list is crucial and has resulted in a tug of war in many states, including several in which veterans have been unsuccessful in getting post-traumatic stress disorder approved for marijuana treatment.\n\nThis month, Pennsylvania became the 24th state to legalize medical marijuana. Sen. Mike Vereb, a Republican, called on lawmakers to take on what he called \"the number-one killer in Pennsylvania\" - opioid abuse.\n\n\"Opioid abuse has no party, has no color, has no religion,\" Vereb said. \"Let's face it, that's the killer. What we're doing today is the healer.\"\n\n\"It's hard to argue against anecdotal evidence when you are in the middle of a crisis,\" said Patricia Hymanson, a York, Maine, neurologist who has taken a leave of absence to serve in the state House. \"But if you do too many things too fast, you are sometimes left with problems on the other end.\"\n\nIn New Hampshire, where drug deaths more than doubled last year from 2011 levels, the Senate last week rejected efforts to decriminalize marijuana.\n\nThere are some promising findings involving rats and one 2014 JAMA study showing that states with medical marijuana laws had nearly 25 percent fewer opioid-related overdose deaths than those without, but even a co-author on that study said it would be wrong to use the findings to make the case for cannabis as a treatment option.\n\n\"We are in the midst of a serious problem. People are dying and, as a result, we ought to use things that are proven to be effective,\" said Dr. Richard Saitz, chair of the Department of Community Health Sciences at the Boston University School of Public Health.\n\nCannabis could have limited benefits as a treatment alternative, said Harvard Medical School's Dr. Kevin Hill, who last year authored the JAMA study that found benefits in using medical marijuana to treat chronic pain, neuropathic pain and spasticity related to multiple sclerosis. But he urged caution.\n\n\"If you are thinking about using cannabis as opposed to using opioids for chronic pain, then I do think the evidence does support it,\" he said. \"However, I think one place where sometimes cannabis advocates go too far is when they talk about using cannabis to treat opioid addiction.\"\n\nThe findings in the Journal of Pain study that found chronic pain sufferers reduced their opioid use when using medical pot were limited because participants self-reported the data.\n\nSubstance abuse experts argue there are already approved medications. It would also be wrong to portray marijuana as completely safe, they say, because it can also be addictive. But supporters point to doctors like Dr. Gary Witman, of Canna Care Docs, who has treated addicts with cannabis at his offices in Fall River, Stoughton and Worcester, Massachusetts. Since introducing the treatment in September, Witman said 15 patients have successfully weaned themselves off opioids. None have relapsed.\n\n\"When I see them in a six-month follow up, they are much more focused,\" Witman said. \"They have greater respect. They feel better about themselves.

But if you look closely, you\u2019ll see small memorials to one more: Liviana, who died in 2013 at the age of 5\u00bd of a rare, nightmare disease called late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy. MLD destroys brain cells and is caused by a single, faulty gene.\n\n\u201cShe was happy all the time,\u201d Brad said.\n\nShe was talkative, addicted to \u201cCaillou,\u201d the animated TV series, a lively little girl, \u2018til she was two. \u201cHer knees were going a little knock-kneed,\u201d Amy said. \u201cAnd she had been just randomly falling down.\u201d\n\nHer doctor said, \u201cNothing to worry about,\u201d but she quickly got worse.\n\n\u201cI was in the kitchen doing something and I heard her crying,\u201d Amy recalled. \u201cAnd I turned around and said, \u2018Liviana, what\u2019s wrong?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Mommy, my legs don\u2019t work.\u2019\u201d\n\nLiviana was diagnosed in the fall of 2010. Amy recalled: \u201cShe\u2019s sitting on the bed in her tutu and her colorful sweater, and they\u2019re telling me she\u2019s gonna die.\u201d\n\nMany children with the disorder are dead by the age of 6. And it runs in families. If it hadn\u2019t been for Liviana, Amy and Brad Price would never have known to have their other children tested. They learned that their infant son, Giovanni, had inherited the faulty gene, too.\n\n\u201cI get a call from the doctor\u2019s office,\u201d said Amy, \u201cI knew. And I was thinking, \u2018I\u2019ve just been told two of my kids now are gonna die.\u2019\u201d\n\nExcept that\u2019s not what happened.\n\nDoing research online, Amy Price discovered the existence of a medical trial in Milan, Italy, of an extraordinary gene therapy treatment for MLD that would save Giovanni\u2019s life -- and later, when his sister, Cecilia, was born with MLD, hers, too. The treatment works only on children who, like them, have not yet started showing symptoms.\n\nThe Price family scraped together the money to go to Milan.\n\n\u201cThe patients go to the surgery room for collection of the stem cells on Monday, and receive their cells back on Friday evening,\u201d said Dr. Alessandra Biffi, who oversaw the trial.\n\nA patient\u2019s stem cells contain the faulty gene, which the doctors have learned how to fix. Amazing, right? But then they need a vehicle to insert the good gene into the stem cells before those are put back into the patient\u2019s body.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s really amazing: That vehicle is the HIV virus, re-engineered so the children can\u2019t get AIDS.\n\nWhy the HIV virus? \u201cIs it particularly efficient at getting around the body?\u201d Teichner asked.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s very efficient in entering our cells, and that\u2019s why we use it,\u201d Dr. Biffi replied.\n\nHow well did the children do? It will take years to know for sure, but so far so good. \u201cAt least 70-80% of them have an outstanding benefit coming from the treatment,\u201d Dr. Biffi said. \u201cSome of the children were going to school and having a normal life.\u201d\n\nGiovanni Price is six now, in first grade. He and his sister Cecilia (Ceci for short) have to go back to Milan twice a year to be tested and monitored.\n\nBrad Price calls Dr. Biffi \u201cOur angel. She took us in like family.\u201d\n\nSo why Italy, and not the United States?\n\nGene therapy has a checkered history. In the 1990s, hyped as the Next Big Thing, research withered here after serious setbacks, including a death during clinical trials. But more than 15 years later, it\u2019s back. One sign: Dr. Biffi is now head of the gene therapy program at Dana-Farber/Boston Children\u2019s Cancer and Blood Disorders Center.\n\nTeichner asked, \u201cDo you believe that gene therapy is finally coming into its own?\u201d\n\nThe MLD trial, she thinks, demonstrates what\u2019s possible -- offering promise to the 30 million Americans who suffer from some 7,000 rare diseases.\n\nTrials for the experimental treatment Ceci and Giovanni Price received in Milan have not begun in the U.S. They are two of only 24 children in the world with MLD to receive it.\n\nCompare Giovanni to Calliope Joy Carr, also six, from Bala Cynwyd, Pa., outside Philadelphia. She can turn her head, a little. She can still smile and laugh. But that\u2019s about all. She was diagnosed at 2.\n\nFor her parents, college professors Patrick Carr and Maria Kefalis, coming to terms with the disease was wrenching. \u201cIt\u2019s decline in slow motion, and that\u2019s difficult,\u201d said Carr.\n\n\u201cI remember the social worker said, \u2018It\u2019s good to try to cry in the shower to save it from your family and your children,\u2019\u201d Kefalis said.\n\nAfter more than a year of rage and grief, Kefalis decided that she had to find some way of helping MLD children. It was too late for Cal, but she was desperate to give her daughter\u2019s life meaning.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not wealthy people,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know very influential people who could write a big check for a million dollars. And so we said, \u2018Well, we\u2019ll start selling cupcakes.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Calliope Joy Foundation was formed in 2013. It\u2019s been slow going, but the money added up. And when Kefalis learned about the Italian trial, and the fact that Amy Price had to keep going back to Milan with Giovanni and Ceci, it was clear she would use the money to help families get to Italy.\n\n\u201cShe sent me a picture of Giovanni playing in his front yard,\u201d Kefalis said. \u201cHe\u2019s three months younger than Cal, so he should\u2019ve been as sick as Cal. He should have been on a feeding tube. He should be paralyzed. And I thought, I gotta be a part of this. I need to help this happen again and again and again.\u201d\n\nMaria Kefalis has turned cupcakes into weapons of war -- her war against MLD. She\u2019s raised more than $250,000, and helped where she could, but she\u2019s hit a wall. So far, not a single gene replacement therapy has been approved by the FDA. The trial in Italy is closed to new patients. It could be years before any children with MLD will be allowed to receive the treatment in the United States.\n\n\u201cNow, it\u2019s just impatience,\u201d Kefalis said. \u201cNow it\u2019s, like, \u2018When do we get this here? What will it take. Tell me what you need me to do.\u2019\u201d\n\nUntil then, she continues to fight her battles one cupcake at a time -- the Price children, Giovanni and Cecilia, proof to her the war can be won.\n\nTeichner asked Brad and Amy Price, \u201cYou keep using the word \u2018miracle.\u2019 In what way is all of this a miracle?\u201d\n\n\u201cOur son\u2019s still with us, and Cecilia as well,\u201d they replied. \u201cThat\u2019s the miracle.\u201d\n\u2022 New hope for young patients with rare genetic disease (\u201cCBS Evening News,\u201d 10/16/15)\n\u2022 Follow the Calliope Joy Foundation on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "There are no independent sources quoted.

As many as three balloons were placed over three months, and all of the balloons were removed after six months. The balloons made patients feel full, the researchers explained.\n\nIn addition to the balloons, patients followed a moderate diet and behavior modification program. Whether the weight loss will last over the long term isn't known, said lead researcher Dr. Aurora Pryor, director of the Bariatric and Metabolic Weight Loss Center at Stony Brook University in New York.\n\nThe study lasted a year, but \"we don't know what happens after that,\" Pryor said.\n\n\"If they are able to stick to their newfound lifestyle with their diet and exercise program, they could maintain their weight loss,\" she said. \"The long-term results are dependent on patients keeping their motivation to stay with their diet and exercise programs.\"\n\nThe balloon treatment will be available starting in January, but the cost hasn't been announced, Pryor said. The device, called the Obalon Balloon System, was approved in September by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nAn advantage of the balloons is that patients have no downtime and can go back to work the same day, the researchers said.\n\n\"There is no sedation or recovery time when the balloons are placed, but there is sedation when the balloons are removed, so you wouldn't want to go back to work after that,\" Pryor added.\n\nPryor believes balloons are a better option for patients who are candidates for weight loss surgery but don't want surgery. \"For people who want to lose some weight but don't feel they are heavy enough for surgery or they're afraid of surgery, this is a really good next step to help them jump start their weight loss,\" she suggested.\n\nThe findings were to be presented Friday at the annual meeting of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery and the Obesity Society in New Orleans.

Six months after the balloons were removed, nearly 90 percent maintained the weight loss they achieved during treatment, Pryor said.\n\nAs for side effects, one patient had a bleeding stomach ulcer while taking high doses of pain pills after a knee replacement.

However, this phase 4 trial, which used Avastin (bevacizumab) plus chemotherapy in a large population found these problems were minimal.\n\nPhase 4 trials are done after a drug is on the market, to look for any new problems.\n\n\"Today we have a new option to treat non-squamous lung cancer, incorporating Avastin in chemotherapy regimens and in maintenance therapy,\" said lead researcher Dr. Lucio Crino, director of medical oncology at S. Maria della Misericordia Hospital in Perugia, Italy.\n\n\"The practical implication is the possibility to incorporate Avastin with any chemotherapy regimen in the frontline therapy of metastatic non-squamous lung cancer,\" he added.\n\nThe report, which is funded by the maker of Avastin, F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., is published in the July 20 issue of The Lancet Oncology. The funder was involved in study design, coordination of data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, and writing of the report, the journal noted.\n\nAdvanced non-small-cell lung cancer is a common cancer that kills 1.18 million people every year worldwide, according to background information in the study. Avastin is a so-called monoclonal antibody that works by blocking vascular endothelial growth factor A, which stimulates the growth of the tumor's blood supply.\n\nWhen used as an adjunct to chemotherapy, Avastin had already shown cancer-fighting activity in two phase 3 trials, the researchers noted.\n\nFor the study, Crino's team studied Avastin in more than 2,200 patients with advanced or recurrent non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. The patients were treated at centers in 40 countries around the world.\n\nThese patients were given the drug every three weeks along with standard chemotherapy, for up to six cycles. Patients were then treated with Avastin alone until the cancer began to progress (\"maintenance\" therapy).\n\nThe researchers reported few clinically significant adverse events, meaning that most were no greater than what one would expect in the general population. One percent of patients experienced bleeding in the lungs and 4 percent had bleeding, Crino's group found.\n\nOverall, 3 percent of the patients died due to adverse events associated with Avastin. These included 1 percent who had blood clots and 1 percent who suffered bleeding.\n\nOther serious adverse events associated with Avastin were blood clots in the lungs and nosebleeds, low white blood cell counts, fever along with a low white blood cell count and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), all of which occurred in 1 percent of the patients.\n\nDr. Robert Pirker, from the department of medicine at the Medical University of Vienna in Austria, and author of an accompanying journal editorial, said that Avastin \"can be safely given when certain precautions are taken.\"\n\nHowever, several issues remain to be determined, including the optimal dose and the role of maintenance therapy with Avastin, he said.\n\n\"In addition, it is unknown whether bevacizumab [Avastin] increases survival when added to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer,\" Pirker said.\n\nOverall, Avastin, like several other targeted agents have led to therapeutic advances in lung cancer, he added. \"Hurdles in clinical development do occur but -- as shown for bevacizumab -- can be overcome,\" Pirker said.\n\nAnother expert, Dr. Norman H. Edelman, chief medical officer at the American Lung Association, and professor of preventive medicine, internal medicine, physiology & biophysics at Stony Brook University in New York, called the study \"very good bread-and-butter clinical research.\"\n\nThe efficacy of the drug has been proven previously, he noted, but this study provides an in-depth analysis of Avastin's safety profile under \"real life\" conditions, he added.\n\n\"Too often this step is shortcircuited in the rush to market of a new drug and we have to await the laborious collection of after-market data to find the real dangers of many new drugs,\" Edelman said.\n\n\"So, the researchers and sponsors are to be congratulated for doing this study. They find that there are real deleterious side effects but that they are manageable, and conclude the drug is worth using under the proper circumstances,\" he said.\n\nAvastin is in the spotlight Tuesday for another reason, as well.

An estimated 5 million people in the world have an eye disease called trachoma that affects the cornea, and another 1.5 million to 2 million are thought to have developed cornea-related blindness through other diseases or trauma.\n\nFor more than a century, doctors have considered transplantation of corneal tissue from deceased donors to be the best treatment, the study authors wrote. Artificial corneas are another option, but they're difficult to implant into the eye and can cause side effects, the researchers said.\n\nIn the new study, researchers tested corneal implants that are \"biosynthetic,\" meaning they're created with the help of living tissues. In this case, the corneas are produced with the help of human collagen -- a kind of protein -- that's grown in yeast. The mock corneas were then placed into the eyes of 10 patients after the diseased corneas were removed.\n\n\"We were pleasantly surprised that in six patients, vision improved from about 20/400 to 20/100, meaning that these patients could see objects four times farther away than before the operation,\" said Griffith, director of the Integrative Regenerative Medicine Center at Linkoping University in Sweden.\n\nThe researchers went one step further and gave contact lenses to the patients. With the lenses in place, they all had improved vision, Griffith said.\n\nWhy didn't they all get better vision immediately without the contact lenses? \"We believe that sutures used in this study resulted in roughness on the surface,\" Griffith said. \"The contact lenses compensated for the surface roughness, resulting in improved vision. We will use less disruptive sutures in our next clinical study, and this should correct this problem.\"\n\nAs for side effects, Griffith said the patients didn't report any pain or discomfort, and there were no signs that their bodies tried to reject the corneas, a risk that people face when they get transplanted organs.\n\nAs for cost, Griffith said the biosynthetic corneas \"in theory\" should be cheaper than donated corneas. Griffith said a German study recently found that donated corneas cost about $2,500.\n\nThe next step in research, Griffith said, is to create a \"new generation\" of cornea implants and test them on a wider variety of patients.\n\nThe study appears in the Aug. 25 issue of Science Translational Medicine.\n\nDr. Mark J. Mannis, chair of the Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Science at the University of California, Davis Eye Center, said the findings in the study appear to be valid. \"This is true cutting-edge work and brings an exciting new option to the repertoire of corneal transplant surgeons,\" he said.\n\nFor more about corneal transplants, try the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story includes one independent source who is basically a booster for the research.

That is less effective than a good diet, exercise and not smoking, each of which can lower cancer risk by 20% to 30%, cancer experts say.\n\nMultivitamins also may have different results in women, younger men or people less healthy than those in this study.\n\n\"It's a very mild effect and personally I'm not sure it's significant enough to recommend to anyone\" although it is promising, said Dr. Ernest Hawk, vice president of cancer prevention at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and formerly of the National Cancer Institute.\n\n\"At least this doesn't suggest a harm\" as some previous studies on single vitamins have, he said.\n\nHawk reviewed the study for the American Association for Cancer Research, which is meeting in Anaheim, Calif., where the study was to be presented on Wednesday. It also was published online in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nAbout one-third of U.S. adults and as many as half of those over 50 take them. They are marketed as a kind of insurance policy against bad eating. Yet no government agency recommends their routine use \"regardless of the quality of a person's diet,\" says a fact sheet from the federal Office of Dietary Supplements.\n\nSome fads, such as the antioxidant craze over vitamins A and E and beta-carotene, backfired when studies found more health risk with those supplements, not less. Many of those were single vitamins in larger doses than the \"100% of daily value\" amounts that multivitamins typically contain.\n\nScience on vitamins has been skimpy. Most studies have been observational \u2014 they look at groups of people who do and do not use vitamins, a method that can't give firm conclusions.\n\nDr. J. Michael Gaziano, of Brigham and Women's Hospital and VA Boston, led a stronger test. Nearly 15,000 male doctors who were 50 or older and free of cancer when the study started were given monthly packets of Centrum Silver or fake multivitamins without knowing which type they received.\n\nAfter about 11 years, there were 2,669 new cancers, and some people had cancer more than once. For every 1,000 men per year in the study, there were 17 cancers among multivitamin users and more than 18 among those taking the placebo pills. That worked out to an 8% lower risk of developing cancer in the vitamin group.\n\nMultivitamins made no difference in the risk of developing prostate cancer, which accounted for half of all cases. They lowered the risk of other cancers collectively by about 12%. There also was a trend toward fewer cancer deaths among multivitamin users, but the difference was so small it could have occurred by chance alone.\n\nSide effects were fairly similar except for more rashes among vitamin users. The National Institutes of Health paid for most of the study. Pfizer Inc. supplied the pills and other companies supplied the packaging.\n\nThe main reason to take a multivitamin is to correct or prevent a deficiency, \"but there may be a modest benefit in reducing the risk of cancer in older men,\" Gaziano said.\n\nCancer experts said the results need to be confirmed by another study before recommending multivitamins to the public. These participants were healthier \u2014 only 4% smoked, for example.\n\nFor people who do want to take multivitamins, doctors suggest:\n\n\u2014 Be aware that they are dietary supplements, which do not get the strict testing required of prescription medicines.\n\n\u2014 Ask your doctor before taking any. Vitamin K can interfere with common heart medicines and blood thinners, and vitamins C and E can lower the effectiveness of some types of chemotherapy. For people having surgery, some vitamins affect bleeding and response to anesthesia.\n\n\u2014 Current and former smokers should avoid multivitamins with lots of beta-carotene or vitamin A; two studies have tied them to increased risk of lung cancer.\n\nCopyright 2012 The Associated Press.

About 25% of all women who become pregnant have a first-trimester loss. But for some women, every pregnancy results in a loss. The researchers studied the effects of micronized plant-derived progesterone in 116 of these women who had experienced two or more pregnancy losses.\n\nTo determine whether a woman's endometrium (uterine lining) is healthy and can sustain the embryo, the research team used the endometrial function test (EFT\u00ae), which was created by study co-author Harvey J. Kliman, M.D., director of the Reproductive and Placental Research Unit in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at Yale School of Medicine. An abnormal EFT is associated with pregnancy failure, while a normal EFT is associated with pregnancy success. Kliman and the team focused on the nCyclinE molecular marker as a way to assess patients with recurrent pregnancy loss.\n\nWomen in the study with an abnormal nCyclinE level were prescribed progesterone two days after ovulation, when the uterine lining matures in preparation for a possible pregnancy.\n\nThe researchers believe that the progesterone caused the patients' endometrium to produce more endometrial secretions. \"The endometrium feeds the baby up until the eighth week of pregnancy. Then at 9 to 10 weeks the mother's blood takes over to feed the embryo,\" said Kliman.\n\n\"In this subset of women experiencing multiple early miscarriages, we assume that their embryos were literally starving to death,\" Kliman added. \"They attached, but they were not getting enough food. When we give progesterone back to these women, the endometrium makes more nutrients and prevents their pregnancy loss.\n\nKliman said he initially created the Endometrial Function Test (EFT\u00ae), which uses the nCyclinE marker, to identify women with infertility. \"This study has shown that the EFT can also be an important tool for patients with recurrent pregnancy loss,\" he said.\n\nKliman worked with lead author Mary Stephenson, M.D., the Dr. Theresa S.

Veins contain valves that, when stretched, no longer keep blood moving back toward the heart efficiently. Risk factors include , age and standing still for prolonged periods.\n\nEighty-seven percent of people with varicose veins do not seek treatment, according to a 2008 survey of roughly 1,000 adults conducted nationwide by Vein Clinics of America and Opinion Research Corporation. But doctors say they should: these veins are not just a cosmetic problem, but can also lead to aches, pain, and heaviness from blood pooling in the legs.\n\nThe treatment known as sclerotherapy \u2014 an alternative to surgery \u2014 entails injecting a solution to irritate and collapse vein walls, so the vein eventually disappears. A series of sessions is usually required for a large area.\n\nVein specialists across the country often inject one of two drugs. One, sodium tetradecyl sulfate, or STS, has long been F.D.A. approved. The other, polidocanol, had not been legal, although some doctors used it, importing it from abroad or obtaining it from pharmacies that make drug compounds. \u201cYou have some legal exposure by doing so,\u201d said Dr. Morrison, a vein specialist in greater .\n\nThat said, polidocanol was the \u201csecond most commonly used sclerosing agent\u201d because, he said, \u201cmost physicians want to give their patients the best available treatment.\u201d\n\nF.D.A. approval of polidocanol should benefit patients several ways. Often the concentrations of polidocanol from compounding pharmacies were \u201cwrong\u201d and had \u201clots of contaminants\u201d that could damage the skin where injected, according to Dr. Robert A. Weiss, a dermatologist who directs the Laser, Skin and Vein Institute. By contrast, he said by e-mail, Asclera \u201cis very safe for skin.\u201d\n\nAn injector\u2019s experience matters, because if the injection misses the vein, (or open sores) can occur. In these rare, worst-case scenarios, Asclera is relatively forgiving and less likely to lead to ulceration.\n\nVein specialists must first figure out which patients would benefit from sclerotherapy alone, and which need inner varicose veins treated before injections. Using to map inner veins as well as visible ones is crucial for patients who complain of enlarged veins and symptoms like achy pain. \u201cThe underlying veins have to be addressed before you can even think of addressing the visible bulging veins,\u201d said Dr. Robert J. Min, radiologist in chief at . \u201cOtherwise they\u2019ll just come back.\u201d\n\nToday, sluggish underlying veins are best addressed with radio-frequency or laser treatment, said Dr. Min, who developed such a laser. Yet, he said both are \u201cvery safe and effective, and a heck of a lot better than surgery.\u201d (It entailed ripping out the groin-to-ankle vein with a wire via an incision.)\n\nFor Dianne Brought, who manages a clothing shop in , Md., each time Dr. Weiss injected her with STS, she felt only \u201ca little tiny pinch.\u201d But she cautioned that if \u201canybody hates needles they will mind it.\u201d Ms. Brought, 57, said her legs used to have \u201cvery nasty veins\u201d and her calves hurt. She is still due for treatments, so some veins remain visible, but they are no longer raised. She now wears sundresses instead of just selling them in her boardwalk shop.\n\nSome vein specialists use liquid irritants like STS or polidocanol to make an injectable foam that targets larger varicose veins. Why? A \u201csudsy foam will fill up the vein, come into full contact with the lining of the vein wall, whereas liquid works for very small veins only,\u201d said Dr. Nisha Bunke, a vein specialist. She said veins as large as a Sharpie marker can be tackled with foam sclerotherapy. But the F.D.A. considers a foam version of STS or polidocanol to be a different product from the liquid. So injecting it is an off-label use.\n\nDr. Min said in an e-mail message that foam sclerotherapy was \u201cvery safe,\u201d but that \u201cit is associated with higher risks than liquid sclerotherapy.\u201d Foam injections have been blamed as the cause of blood clots in leg veins, he wrote, adding that one known stroke \u201cmay have been caused by foam sclerotherapy.\u201d\n\nBut foam sclerotherapy has been a big relief for some patients.

A new study confirms that it is also effective in the management of postmenopause symptoms such as hot flashes, sleeplessness, vaginal dryness, and anxiety, without serious side effects. The study outcomes are published online today in Menopause, the journal of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS).\n\nThe use of complementary and alternative medicine for the management of menopause symptoms has surged in recent years as women have attempted to identify alternatives to hormone therapy (HT). Although HT is the most effective treatment for managing most menopause symptoms, some women have turned to herbal medicine because they are either not candidates for HT or are concerned about the negative publicity surrounding potential side effects. Fennel, an herb containing essential oils, has phytoestrogenic properties. Phytoestrogens are estrogen-like chemicals in plants that have been used to effectively treat a wide array of menopause symptoms.\n\nIn this small trial of 79 Iranian women aged 45 to 60 years, soft capsules containing 100 mg of fennel were administered twice daily for eight weeks. Improvements were compared between the intervention and placebo groups at four, eight, and 10 weeks, with a significant statistical difference documented. In the end, fennel was concluded to be a safe and effective treatment to reduce menopause symptoms without serious side effects. The study described in the article \"Effect of Foeniculum vulgare Mill. (fennel) on menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women: a randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial\" is one of the first clinical studies to examine the benefits of fennel for managing menopause symptoms, even though it had been previously studied and confirmed to manage premenopause symptoms.\n\nThe study was completed in Tehran, Iran, where the average age of women at menopause is younger than in the United States: 48.2 years versus 51 years, respectively. Some of the most common adverse effects of menopause are hot flashes, vaginal dryness, sleep problems, joint and muscular discomfort, exhaustion, irritability, anxiety, and depression.\n\n\"This small pilot study found that, on the basis of a menopause-rating scale, twice-daily consumption of fennel as a phytoestrogen improved menopause symptoms compared with an unusual minimal effect of placebo,\" says Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, executive director of NAMS. \"A larger, longer, randomized study is still needed to help determine its long-term benefits and side effect profile.\"\n\nFounded in 1989, The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) is North America's leading nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting the health and quality of life of all women during midlife and beyond through an understanding of menopause and healthy aging.

All received top-notch asthma treatment, and were randomly assigned to take either Gleevec or a placebo pill once daily during the 6-month trial.\n\nBlood tests showed that Gleevec did reduce mast cell activity in patients, Israel said.\n\nFurther, allergy challenge tests showed a decrease in airway reactivity among patients taking Gleevec, the researchers reported. Airways became less likely to close off after exposure to an allergen.\n\nPhysical examinations showed that people taking Gleevec actually experienced a slight overall widening of their airways, Israel added.\n\n\"There was a small but significant improvement in the airway narrowing in these patients, which we didn't expect because we didn't think the mast cells were necessarily promoting that airway narrowing all the time,\" Israel said.\n\nSide-effects were not as severe as expected, he added.

A brain biopsy now can be used to detect Alzheimer's plaques but is highly invasive and may miss parts of the brain where the plaques and tangles of Alzheimer's are densest. While diagnosis by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy is under study for early detection , accurate early detection by such noninvasive means is a ways away.\n\nAnd on Monday, the American Academy of Neurology released a new study showing that an agent called florbetaben also allowed detection of amyloid plaques when used with a PET scan. The florbetaben study is to be presented at the academy's \"Emerging Science\" program next week in New Orleans. Both Florbetapir F 18 and florbetaben help diagnose Alzheimer's by sticking to beta amyloid clumps and emitting radioactivity, which can then be picked up by a PET scan.\n\nThose questions are no longer hypothetical. Last week, the FDA approved an agent called Florbetapir F 18 injection (to be marketed as Amyvid), which will allow physicians using a positron emissions tomography (PET) scan to detect the presence and extent of amyloid plaques in patients concerned about declining mental function.\n\nNo one wants to hear that he or she has Alzheimer's disease. But if the beta-amyloid plaques that are the disorder's key physical hallmark could be detected before memory loss and cognitive troubles were evident to all, would you want to know? And since no treatment currently works to stem the inexorable progress ofAlzheimer's, who would pay for a costly test to detect it early -- and why?\n\nThe FDA says that Amyvid \"is not a test to predict the development of AD-associated dementia\" in those who have no problematic symptoms. It's an early test for those who already have cognitive concerns and who wonder whether Alzheimer's disease may be the cause. Among patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, about 60% have amyloid plaques and will go on to develop dementia that is likely Alzheimer's disease, said Dr. Michael W. Weiner of the Department of Veterans Affairs' Center for Imaging of Neurodegenerative Diseases.\n\nWeiner is the leading researcher on the largest and most comprehensive Alzheimer's research initiative of its kind, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. ADNI, a nationwide consortium that is still enrolling subjects, is a five-year, $60-million project that will track 800 participants to compare how mental and daily-life skills, and the brain's structure and function, change in those aging normally, those with mild cognitive impairment and those with dementia. Weiner conducted much of the research leading to Amyvid's approval.\n\nFor now, says Weiner, there is \"no consensus\" on which patients should get the costly new PET scans that use Amyvid, and large insurers such as Medicare and Medicaid have not made decisions about coverage for such tests. And some patients may question whether they would want to know that the source of their mental troubles is Alzheimer's disease, said Weiner.\n\n\"But for many, when you take a person to the doctor, you usually want an answer, whether it leads to a treatment or not. This is a way of getting closer to an answer,\" said Weiner. Many patients experiencing cognitive lapses may also be reassured if the test fails to reveal amyloid plaques, he added.\n\nWith growing understanding that the changes of Alzheimer's disease may be decades in the making, the value of early detection is gaining adherents, said Weiner. The \"real game-changer,\" he says, will be when one of the many experimental therapies under study for Alzheimer's disease succeeds in blocking or reversing its progress. Once that happens, physicians, researchers and insurers will need to figure out who should get the test and at what cost, and who will pay.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story quotes an expert source, Dr. Michael Weiner, who was involved in the development of Amyvid, but it does not mention that he has disclosed relationships with a number of pharmaceutical companies, including Eli Lilly, Amyvid\u2019s manufacturer.

Fenfluramine was taken off the market in 1997 after being linked to potentially life-threatening heart valve problems. But lorcaserin is far more selective than the drug fenfluramine and much safer, its manufacturer says, because it specifically targets the serotonin receptor associated with hunger while having no impact on the heart.\n\nAbout half the dieters who took lorcaserin for a year in the study lost at least 5% of their body weight, compared to 20% of dieters who took a placebo pill. About one in five lorcaserin users lost 10% or more of their body weight, compared to one out of 14 placebo users.

We are hopeful that in the future, nanoparticles can be utilized to personalize care to patients and reduce the late effects of therapy.\"\n\nNeuroblastomas are cancers that start in early nerve cells and commonly form in the tissue of the adrenal glands, near the kidneys. About 700 new cases of neuroblastoma are diagnosed each year in the United States and most cases appear in children younger than 5 years old. High-risk neuroblastoma is hard to cure and is more likely to become resistant to standard therapies or recur. These cancers are also associated with late effects after treatments have ended, including developmental delays, hearing loss, or other disabilities.\n\nCurcumin has been shown to have substantial anti-cancer ability, but its low solubility and poor stability have made its use in medicinal applications challenging.

This formulation induced substantial cell death in neuroblastoma cells while producing no or only minor toxicity in healthy cells. Overall, the nano-therapeutic treatments showed a more pronounced effect in MYCN-amplified cells, which are traditionally more resistant to drug therapies.\n\nNanoscience research, which explores the unusual properties of materials at the nanoscale, has led to advancements in medicine, energy, information storage, computing and other fields.

Ages ranged from 39 to 80.\n\nMore than half (55 percent) had lumpectomy and radiation, while 45 percent had mastectomy (complete breast removal) alone.\n\nHwang compared lumpectomy and radiation with mastectomy alone, not mastectomy plus radiation. \"We wanted to look at early stage disease, and those patients typically don't get radiation after mastectomy,\" she said.\n\nThe researchers tracked the women's progress for a median of more than nine years (half followed longer, half less). During that time, more than 31,000 women died, nearly 40 percent of them from breast cancer. The others died of other causes.\n\nFor the first three years after treatment, those who had a mastectomy had a higher risk of dying from heart disease and other ailments than those who had lumpectomy. This may indicate that the women who underwent lumpectomy were generally healthier, Hwang said.\n\nOver the entire follow-up, those who underwent lumpectomy were more likely to survive the breast cancer.\n\n\"The group that benefited the most -- who had the biggest difference in breast cancer survival -- were those women over 50 with estrogen-receptor positive disease,\" Hwang said. This means their cancer depends on estrogen to grow.\n\nAmong those women, the lumpectomy group had a 13 percent lower risk of death from breast cancer and a 19 percent lower risk of death from any cause than those who had a mastectomy.\n\nNot all women with early stage breast cancers can have a lumpectomy, Hwang said. In this procedure, just the tumor and some healthy tissue are removed, sparing the rest of the breast. Among the exceptions are those whose cancers are too large, or those who have different cancers in the same breast.\n\nThe percent of women with early breast cancers choosing a mastectomy has risen recently, after a dip in previous years. Hwang and others suspect that women told they could safely opt for lumpectomy were still afraid to try it.\n\nThe new research, which was funded by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, suggests that if a lumpectomy is possible, it may actually increase survival, Hwang said.\n\nThe findings may reverse the mastectomy trend, said Dr. Laura Kruper, co-director of the breast oncology program at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., who was not involved in the study.\n\nThe study is scientifically sound in many ways, Kruper said. \"They broke it down by year of diagnosis and by age category,\" she said. \"They looked at socioeconomic status, and they kept it early stage.\"\n\nDr. Wendy Woodward, section chief for breast radiation oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said that for women with early cancers, the study \"clearly reiterates there is no detriment to cancer control in having a lumpectomy and radiation for breast-conserving surgery candidates.\"\n\nBut, Woodward added, \"I am not sure the study convinces us that lumpectomy and radiation is better for breast cancer survival, but it may be.\"\n\nThe study was observational, Hwang stressed.

More patients treated with Siliq compared to placebo had skin that was clear or almost clear, as assessed by scoring of the extent, nature and severity of psoriatic changes of the skin.\n\nSuicidal ideation and behavior, including completed suicides, have occurred in patients treated with Siliq during clinical trials. Siliq users with a history of suicidality or depression had an increased incidence of suicidal ideation and behavior compared to users without this history. A causal association between treatment with Siliq and increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior has not been established.\n\nBecause of the observed risk of suicidal ideation and behavior, the labeling for Siliq includes a Boxed Warning and the drug is only available through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Siliq REMS Program. Notable requirements of the Siliq REMS Program include the following:\n\u2022 Prescribers must be certified with the program and counsel patients about this risk. Patients with new or worsening symptoms of depression or suicidality should be referred to a mental health professional, as appropriate.\n\u2022 Patients must sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement Form and be made aware of the need to seek medical attention should they experience new or worsening suicidal thoughts or behavior, feelings of depression, anxiety or other mood changes.\n\u2022 Pharmacies must be certified with the program and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive Siliq.\n\nSiliq is also approved with a Medication Guide to inform patients of the risk of suicidal ideation and behavior, and that because Siliq is a medication that affects the immune system, patients may have a greater risk of getting an infection, or an allergic or autoimmune condition. Patients with Crohn\u2019s disease should not use Siliq. Health care providers should also evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with Siliq. Health care providers should not administer Siliq to patients with active TB infection, and should avoid immunizations with live vaccines in patients being treated with Siliq.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions reported with the use of Siliq include joint pain (arthralgia), headache, fatigue, diarrhea, throat pain (oropharyngeal pain), nausea, muscle pain (myalgia), injection site reactions, influenza, low white blood cell count (neutropenia) and fungal (tinea) infections.\n\nSiliq is marketed by Bridgewater, New Jersey-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

The patients, who were unresponsive to other treatments, were considered to have no other options (refractory).\n\nThe researchers used intramyocardial delivery into the ischemic zone after 3-D mapping to register both electrical and mechanical activities of the left ventricle.\n\nOutcomes from the \"ACT-34-CMI\" study, a two-year, phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, will be published in an upcoming cardiac issue of Cell Transplantation.\n\n\"There are an increasing number of patients with advanced coronary artery disease that are not amenable to surgical or percutaneous revascularization,\" said study co-author Dr. Timothy D.

Encouraging early clinical trials suggest that cell therapy is an attractive treatment option for these patients, especially trials in which subjects were transplanted with autologous (self-donated) CD34+ cells.\"\n\nCD34+ cells drew the attention of researchers for possible therapeutic testing because recent studies pointed to the importance of CD34+ cell content in the bone marrow of patients with risk factors for coronary artery disease in predicting not only baseline, but also future exercise capacity.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the study demonstrated that CD34+ cells have the ability to restore the microcirculation and improve myocardial tissue perfusion. All of the 167 patients participating in the ACT34-CMI study saw significant improvement in both angina frequency and exercise at 12 months and a trend toward decreasing major cardiac events. There was also a reduction in angina in the placebo group at six months, but the effect was less prominent at 12 and 24 months, reported the researchers. In addition, there was a significant reduction in the time to first hospitalization in cell-treated patients, with a trend toward reduction in mortality as well.\n\n\"The results of our study are even more provocative given that the outcomes represent the effect of a single treatment,\" wrote the researchers. \"Recent reports suggest that in patients with recurring symptoms, repeated cell administration may replicate the initial positive results.\"\n\nThe researchers concluded that for \"no option\" patients with class III/IV angina refractory that was unresponsive to conventional medical therapy and who were not candidates for revascularization, injection of CD34+ cells resulted in persistent improvement in angina at two years post-treatment.\n\nCitation: Henry TD, Schaer GL, Traverse JH, Povisc TJ, Davidson C, Lee, JS, Costa MA, Bass T, Mendelsohn F, Fortuin FD, Pepine CJ, Patel AN, Riedel N, Junge C, Hunt A, Kereiakes DJ, White C, Harrington RA, Schatz RA, Losordo DW, the ACT34-CMI Investigators.

In most cases, the lump or lesion is benign or noncancerous and does not require further treatment.\n\nBiopsies may be performed via open surgery on the breast or with a less invasive core-needle biopsy in which a small sample of breast tissue from the affected area is removed through a special needle inserted through the skin.\n\nResearchers say needle biopsy has fewer complications and a shorter recovery time than open surgical biopsy, but some women and doctors may have concerns about the accuracy of the procedure compared with traditional open surgery methods of breast cancer diagnosis.\n\nIn the study, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers reviewed 83 studies on the two methods.\n\nThe results showed that core needle biopsies were about as accurate as open surgery at detecting cancerous vs. noncancerous breast lesions.\n\nNeedle biopsies also had a much lower rate of complications (less than 1% compared with 2%-10% with open surgery).\n\nIn addition, the study showed women initially diagnosed with breast cancer with needle biopsy were more likely to be treated with a single breast cancer surgery than those initially diagnosed by open surgical biopsy.\n\n\"Based on currently available evidence, it appears reasonable to substitute core needle biopsy procedures for open surgical biopsy given the comparable sensitivity and lower complication rates,\" write researcher Wendy Bruening, PhD, of the ECRI Institute Evidence-Based Practices Center in Plymouth Meeting, Pa., and colleagues.

Yet health-conscious Americans despise them, designing entire diets just to cut them out.\n\nBut out of the pile of cast-off carbs, there are some you should keep. New research around a certain kind of carb, called \u201cresistant starch,\u201d suggests that they could be a key way to help control weight.\n\nWhen we eat refined carbohydrates, like white bread and cookies, our bodies absorb them very quickly, and the hormone insulin ushers them into our cells. Eat a lot of them, and the body will store most of those calories instead of burning them\u2014which is why we gain weight on high-carb diets.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the case with resistant starches, so named because they resist digestion. These kinds of carbs bypass the small intestine (where most food is digested) and head to the large intestine (also known as the colon) to be metabolized. There, they\u2019re fermented and turned into short-chain fatty acids, which the body burns as energy. Resistant starches also serve as powerful prebiotics\u2014food for intestinal bacteria in the colon.\n\nThose benefits\u2014getting digested slower, being converted into fatty acids and sustaining colonies of gut bacteria\u2014set resistant starch apart. Resistant starch is being explored as a healthy food for people with type-2 diabetes; eating it improved certain measures of inflammation, a condition that often precedes type-2 diabetes, and lipid profiles in women with the condition, showed one 2015 study.\n\n\u201cCertain populations and cultures have been benefiting from resistant starches for a long time,\u201d says Paul Arciero, professor in the health and exercise sciences department of Skidmore College. \u201cIn my belief, that\u2019s what\u2019s protected them against some of the ravages of the more modern-day high carbohydrate diet.\u201d\n\nLuckily, resistant starch is found in a range of delicious foods. Legumes, beans, whole grains and some seeds have it, as do uncooked potatoes and unripe bananas. Products made from these foods, including bean flour, potato starch, tapioca starch and brown rice flour, also count.\n\nMost intriguing and surprising of all is that so many leftovers contain resistant starch. When you cook a certain starchy food, like white rice, pasta or a potato, and then cool it in the refrigerator, the food develops resistant starches. \u201cCooking the carbohydrate starch alters the chemical bonds in the food,\u201d Arciero explains. Stick it in the fridge, and as the food cools, those bonds reform in a new design. \u201cThe ensuing structure of those bonds during the cooling process is what makes them resistant to then being digested in the small intestine,\u201d Arciero says. Even if you heat them up again, they retain their new resistant starches.\n\nIn all of its forms, resistant starch shows promise for helping people control their weight. In a study published in October 2015, Arciero and his team cooked a series of four pancake breakfasts for 70 women. The four pancakes were made from ordinary starch, starch plus whey protein, resistant starch (a tapioca-based starch modified to become resistant\u2014much like leftovers are), and resistant starch with whey protein.\n\nArciero and his team monitored the women after each meal for three hours and used a device to see how many calories they burned, and what type. To Arciero\u2019s surprise, after women ate pancakes containing resistant starch plus protein, they experienced an increase in fat burning, compared to all of the other kinds of pancakes. \u201cAfter you eat a meal that\u2019s principally carbohydrate, the fact that your body can burn a greater percentage of fat as its energy source is very unusual,\u201d he says. Adding protein to the batter also made the women feel fuller, they found\u2014which hints at a potentially powerful food combo for people trying to control their weight. \u201cIf you can combine a resistant starch with a hardboiled egg, or whey protein, or pea protein, or chicken or Greek yogurt, that\u2019s a pretty powerful combination,\u201d Arciero says.\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to tell if resistant starch can help people weight. But the new evidence suggests that it may help control weight by altering body composition and increasing satiety. \u201cThe potential for a nutritional lifestyle intervention to counter obesity driven by high-carbohydrate food, though we don\u2019t know yet how significantly, is fascinating,\u201d Arciero says\u2014especially when it\u2019s as simple and delicious as reheating your pasta.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "There don\u2019t appear to be any conflicts of interest.

The research was announced Tuesday at a joint meeting of the European Cancer Organisation and the European Society for Medical Oncology in Berlin.\n\n\"What we can do with these results is to raise a flag with hormone treatments,\" said Mieke Van Hemelrijck, a cancer epidemiologist at King's College in London and the study's lead researcher.\n\nMore than 670,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer globally every year, making it the second-most common cancer in men, after lung cancer. In the U.S., about 600,000 men are being treated with endocrine therapies for prostate cancer.\n\nVan Hemelrijck and colleagues studied more than 30,000 men in Sweden with prostate cancer who got hormone therapy between 1997 and 2006, for about three years. They compared the rate of heart problems in those patients to the rate in the general Swedish population.\n\nProstate cancer patients had a 28 percent higher relative chance of having a fatal heart attack and a 21 percent increased chance of dying from heart disease. Still, these risks were low in absolute terms: researchers estimated the hormone therapies would cause an extra 10 heart problems \u2013 like chest pain or a heart attack \u2013 a year for every 1,000 prostate cancer patients.\n\n\"What patients should do is talk about this with their doctor,\" said Michael Thun, a vice president emeritus at the American Cancer Society, who was not connected to the research. \"It makes a lot of sense and could one day change treatment guidelines.\"\n\nPrevious studies have found hormone therapy given to prostate cancer patients with a history of heart disease increases their chances of dying.\n\nVan Hemelrijck hypothesized that hormone therapy disrupts the normal circulation of testosterone in the body.

But she cautioned that longer trials are needed to fully assess the drug.\n\nRegeneron and Sanofi said standard drugs are unable to control asthma in 10 to 20 percent of patients. They estimate that inflammation caused by Th2 cells - the type of inflammation among patients they tested - affects up to 2.5 million people in the United States and up to 30 million worldwide.\n\nDupilumab has also shown strong hints of safety and effectiveness in two early-stage trials that involved 67 patients with atopic dermatitis.

Based on published data, the efficacy and safety endpoints in these trials compared favorably to other formulations of cyclosporine A with the advantage of early onset.[1]\n\nAccording to Dilip Shanghvi, Managing Director, Sun Pharma, \"We are happy to see the early onset of action and strong efficacy results for Seciera\u2122. These results are highly encouraging for millions of Dry Eye patients[4]-[6] across the globe that have yet to find relief for their condition. We look forward to discussing these results with US FDA and agree on next steps for the program.\"\n\n\"I am very excited to see these strong results for Seciera\u2122,\" noted Dr. Joseph Tauber, Study Investigator and founder of the Tauber Eye Center, Kansas City, Missouri. \"As a clinician who specializes in diagnosing and treating dry eye, this novel formulation of cyclosporine A would be a unique and welcome addition to our armamentarium to treat these patients\".\n\nJerry St. Peter, Vice President and Head of Sun Ophthalmics, added: \"A key strategic imperative for our ophthalmic business is to participate in the rapidly growing, underserved, and dynamic Dry Eye market, which is expected to reach $5 billion by 2020.[7] Based on this successful confirmatory Phase 3 trial, Seciera\u2122 has the potential to strengthen our emerging ophthalmics pipeline, which includes the recent launch of BromSite\u2122 and late stage development programs for Xelpros\u2122 and DexaSite\u2122.\"\n\u2022 Sall K, Stevenson OD, Mundorf TK, Reis BL.

He is a professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\n\nRoughly 250,000 such infections occur in hospitals each year in the United States, costing about $250 million, the researchers pointed out.\n\nAlthough about 20 percent of hospitalized patients get a urinary catheter, one-third of the time they aren't needed, Saint said. He believes that patients can play a role in reducing catheter use.\n\n\"A lot of patients and families don't realize that there are problems with a urinary catheter, so they may request them because they think it will allow patients to stay in bed,\" Saint said.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there are side effects with a catheter. And I've seen patients who have gotten up in the middle of the night and they trip and fall on the tubing,\" he explained.\n\n\"Patients and families should request that a catheter not be put in, and if there is one there, the patient should ask every day whether it is still needed,\" Saint suggested.\n\nFor the study, Saint and his colleagues tried the new program in 600 hospitals.\n\nAfter 18 months of using the program, infection rates among hospital patients in general wards dropped by one-third, while catheter use had dropped about 1 percent.\n\nBut there was no drop in infections or catheter use in intensive care units (ICUs), the study findings showed.\n\nHospital-acquired urinary tract infection rates rose nationwide during the same time period, Saint noted.\n\nThe program Saint helped develop -- called the \"bladder bundle\" -- includes protocols, checklists, training and information-sharing that help doctors and nurses reduce catheter use and prevent infections.\n\nIncluded in the program are:\n\u2022 Daily checks to see if a catheter is still needed.\n\u2022 Using other options to collect urine, such as bedpans.\n\u2022 Use of infection-control techniques for catheter placement and maintenance.\n\u2022 Feedback to the medical team about catheter use and infection rates.\n\nThe researchers found that catheter infection rates in the new program dropped 14 percent overall in general wards (non-ICU).\n\nThe findings were published June 2 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nDr. Susan Huang, a professor of infectious disease at the University of California, Irvine, wrote an editorial accompanying the study. She said, \"While we've known the correct care processes for managing urinary catheters, we haven't been able to reliably reduce catheter-related infections.\"\n\nAn intervention that focuses on changing the culture in hospitals to make them more responsive to the problem of infection control -- one that involves \"rallying around a focused problem and ensuring team-based solutions -- is integral to improving infection control in hospitals,\" she said.\n\nAs for improving infection control in intensive care units, Huang said, \"further analysis may help us understand why this intervention didn't work.\"\n\n\"This program can reduce urinary infections in hospitals if a team is assembled to ensure adoption of best practices and to rapidly correct reasons for failing to comply with these processes,\" she added.\n\nVisit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more on urinary tract infections.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The writer included comments from Dr. Huang, an editorial writer in NEJM, which suffices as an independent source.\nBut, we\u2019re not told that Dr. Saint \u2014 the lead author \u2014 is a paid advisory board member for the health services companies Doximity and Jvion.\u00a0This was probably worth mentioning, since Jvion sells a data product to hospitals \u201cthat looks at the patient population and predicts the risk of an illness or condition before symptoms occur\u201d so that \u201cproviders are better able to stop hospital acquired conditions, prevent patient suffering and deterioration, target population health activities, and save resources.\u201d", "answer": 0}, {"article": "So imagine my enthusiasm when I learned last fall that the Food and Drug Administration had finally approved the first implantable sensor to continuously measure glucose, beeping or vibrating a warning whenever levels head too high or too low. On Monday, June 12, I took the train down to Washington to be hooked up while the annual meeting of the American Diabetes Association was in town.\n\nThe device, made by Medtronic MiniMed, is called the Paradigm Real-Time, a combination insulin pump and continuous glucose sensor. The sensor doesn\u2019t control the pump but allows a diabetic to make quicker, presumably better decisions. I\u2019d already been on a stand-alone MiniMed pump for a few years, but I found it only an incremental improvement over taking insulin by injection.\n\nLike the pump, the sensor requires injecting a tiny catheter (less than an inch long) into the midsection of the body, and changing it every three days to avoid infection. The sensor has a coated tip that measures the electrical conductivity of the interstitial fluid, the juice floating between fat cells right under the skin. As luck would have it, the conductivity is directly proportional to how much glucose is floating around in the juice.\n\nEven with the help of an expert trainer from MiniMed, I found that injecting the catheter took much more dexterity than injecting one for a pump. It has to be placed above the hip or the buttocks, which makes reaching it awkward, and then the wire leading from the sensor has to be connected to a transmitter that wirelessly sends the information to the pump.\n\nWhen everything was in, I had two catheters and the transmitter all taped to my body, plus the pump hanging on my belt. Kind of weird, but kind of cool, in a sci-fi way, and I remained thrilled at the prospect of seeing my first glucose reading.\n\nThen the waiting began. The sensor needs three hours to settle in before it can begin transmitting data. By late afternoon, when it was supposed to start, I got an error message instead. When I tried to recalibrate it a half-hour later, it still wasn\u2019t working right, so I had to remove it and inject a second one. It was after 9 p.m. before the second one finally began working.\n\nAt first, I was transfixed by the numbers as they were updated every five minutes. That night, however, the sensor kept beeping me awake, nearly every hour, warning that my glucose level was too high.\n\nI kept following the recommendations of the embedded calculator, taking only very small amounts of insulin to bring my sugar level down. But by morning, I was still high, so I followed my own usual guesstimate and took much more.\n\nTwo hours later, while attending a session at the diabetes association meetings, in which four experts talked about the new sensors, I heard mine beep again, this time warning me that my glucose level was plummeting. I quickly drank a juice box, and within minutes my numbers started leveling off. I had avoided my first low. All the hassles of the past 24 hours were forgiven. This bionic diabetic was in rapture.\n\nOver the next six weeks of testing, I came down to earth as I realized that while the sensor enabled me to drastically cut my usual number of lows, it did not eliminate them.\n\nThe main problem was that the sensor was simply not as accurate as a blood-glucose tester. MiniMed\u2019s studies show the sensor\u2019s accuracy can be off by as much as 18 percent. Another sensor, just approved by the F.D.A. and made by DexCom, is said by some researchers to be a bit more accurate, as is a third device, from Abbot, which has not yet been approved. But none are as accurate as a standard blood-sugar test.\n\nI also had three sensor catheters slip out and require early replacement, which would be especially annoying to anyone paying the $35 that each sensor costs; I wasn\u2019t, because MiniMed had supplied everything free for testing, but everybody else will, since the sensors are not yet covered by insurance. With each catheter intended to last just three days, the bill comes to $350 a month.\n\nBut the bottom line is that over the entire six weeks I had only a few lows that left me feeling woozy, the kind I used to put up with two or three times a week.\n\nOn July 24, my test period over, I felt like Mr. Magoo without his glasses. I made it through our annual Cape Cod vacation without incident, but Annie kept a wary eye on me. I think I owe it to her to start shelling out that $350 per month, at least until the insurance companies figure out what a lifesaver this transformative new technology can be.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "No independent sources of information were obtained.

But such talks, while encouraging, are still in the early stages, a Novartis spokesman said.\n\nTimothy Anderson, pharmaceutical analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said in a recent note that Entresto was \u201clikely to become a mega-brand over time\u201d but that the initial uptake was \u201clikely to be on the slower side given the entrenched nature of off-patent ACE inhibitors.\u201d He said it was highly unusual that there were no major competitors for Entresto on the way, giving it a \u201clong runway.\u201d\n\nIn a clinical trial with more than 8,400 participants, patients were randomly assigned to take either Entresto or enalapril, an ACE inhibitor. Patients in both groups of the study could also take other drugs, such as beta blockers, as their doctors saw fit.\n\nAfter about 27 months, 21.8 percent of those taking Entresto had either died from cardiovascular causes or had been hospitalized for worsening heart failure, compared with 26.5 percent for those taking enalapril. That represented a relative risk reduction of 20 percent using a measure known as the hazard ratio.\n\nNovartis said that about 2.2 million Americans would be eligible for the drug, which was approved for patients with so-called Class II to Class IV chronic heart failure with so-called reduced ejection fraction. Novartis is sponsoring another study to see if the drug is effective for those with preserved ejection fraction, which accounts for half of heart failure cases.\n\nThe F.D.A. said that the main side effects were low blood pressure, high blood potassium levels and kidney impairment. It said there were also cases of angioedema, an allergic reaction that usually results in swelling of the lips or face but can be life threatening if swelling interferes with breathing. Blacks and those with a previous history of the condition were at increased risk, it said.\n\nEntresto is a combination of two drugs, one of which is valsartan, the active ingredient in the blockbuster drug that Novartis sells as Diovan but which now faces generic competition.

The treatment, which has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, is covered by Medicare in five states, but few private insurers pay for it routinely.\n\nWhile rTMS has ardent supporters, its effectiveness is still debated, and there is little evidence showing how long the results last. The technique has been shown to work better than a placebo, but the proportion of patients who show complete relief ranges widely, from as few as 10 percent to as many as 57 percent, according to various studies.\n\nThe debate has huge implications, not just for many of the 14 million Americans who suffer from major depression every year but also for businesses eyeing a potentially lucrative market and insurers weighing whether to cover it.\n\nAbout half of those 14 million Americans seek relief through psychotherapy and prescription drug treatment, according to an evaluation by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. But studies show that antidepressants provide complete cessation of symptoms only about a third of the time. Magnetic stimulation is aimed at patients with such \u201ctreatment-resistant depression.\u201d\n\nSupporters say rTMS is worth the cost \u2014 between $6,000 and $12,000 for the four-to-six-week treatment \u2014 because it enables people such as Curtis to resume productive lives.\n\nSkeptics question the price tag in light of uncertain benefits.\n\n\u201cThe majority of studies that evaluated rTMS failed to find evidence of an enduring treatment effect after the initial response . . . and some . . . failed to find any significant treatment effect,\u201d concluded Health Plan of Nevada, a UnitedHealthcare insurer, which rejected coverage in March.\n\nWith the nation\u2019s health-care spending expected to top $2.7 trillion this year, the battle over paying for rTMS demonstrates why it is so difficult to rein in health-care costs. New technology is generally allowed into the market after studies show it is reasonably safe and more effective than placebos. But that\u2019s not the same as showing it works better than current approaches.\n\nExperts differ over whether it\u2019s smart to cover new techniques if they haven\u2019t proved superior to established methods. And they can also disagree over the medical research itself: Was a study done well? Were there enough patients enrolled? Did it ask the right questions? Insurers often call for more research, while doctors and patients \u2014 many desperate for help \u2014 warn against delay. And costs are rarely discussed publicly.\n\n\u2018What did I have to lose?\u2019\n\nIn December, when Curtis first had a magnetic coil placed on her scalp while a $70,000 machine sent pulses into part of her brain, she had already spent a decade trying seven different prescription medications in her battle with depression.\n\nGetting no relief but gaining weight and feeling sluggish and \u201cout of it\u201d because of the drugs\u2019 side effects, she eagerly agreed to the month-long series of five-day-a-week treatments. Most patients have between four and six weeks of near daily sessions.\n\nCurtis\u2019s psychiatrist, Niku Singh, who is also the medical director at TMS NeuroHealth, suggested that she try the procedure. \u201cI was all for it,\u201d said Curtis, whose insurance did not cover the treatment. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of nothing else had worked, so what did I have to lose?\u201d\n\nAs the very first patient treated at the Tysons Corner facility, which opened in December, Curtis paid only $3,000 because the center needed a test patient to meet the requirements of the device manufacturer. The fee is generally about $10,000, but officials say they work with patients who can't afford that. Founders of the center compare rTMS\u2019s potential to that of the now-ubiquitous laser eye clinics; they aim to open a chain of centers nationally that will take walk-ins and accept referrals from physicians. Walk-in patients without a doctor referral would be screened by the center\u2019s medical director to determine if they are in fact appropriate candidates for rTMS treatment.\n\n\u201cWe looked at the Lasik model and said, \u2018Can we do this with depression? Can we do this with TMS?\u2019\u201d said Bill Leonard, president of the company.\n\nDuring a treatment, a patient sits in a chair like one in a dentist\u2019s office while an electromagnetic coil is placed against her head. The machine sends four seconds of magnetic pulses into the brain in 26-second intervals, making a woodpecker-like tapping noise. The whole procedure takes about 40 minutes and is monitored by a technician. Patients say it does not hurt. Studies have shown that side effects are few and generally minor, such as headaches and scalp irritations.\n\nSingh said rTMS works by having the pulses stimulate a region of the brain that helps control mood; researchers say the pulses help depression by activating the release of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine. (Singh, who owns two psychiatry practices in the region, says he does not have an investment interest in TMS NeuroHealth.)\n\nThe use of rTMS for altering mood or affecting the brain has been studied since at least the early 1990s. After reviewing data from a study of 301 patients, the FDA cleared the device in 2008 for the treatment of major depression in adults who had failed to improve after at least one round of drug therapy.\n\nThat study was funded by the device\u2019s manufacturer, Neuronetics, a company based in Malvern, Pa. It found that up to 17 percent of patients treated with the device for six weeks became symptom-free, about twice as many as those treated with a sham rTMS machine.\n\nSubsequent studies have shown a range of results, with about a third of patients reporting complete relief. One 2010 study of 199 \u201cmoderately treatment resistent\u201d patients funded by the National Institute of Mental Health found that rTMS was four times as likely to get patients symptom-free as was a sham procedure. Patients in that study were treated five times a week for three to five weeks. One key measure \u2014 known as the \u201cnumber needed to treat\u201d \u2014 found that one patient became symptom-free for every 12 who were treated. Five percent of the patients in the sham group became symptom-free.\n\nSupporters such as those at TMS NeuroHealth say they are seeing better results than that among their patients, who can continue taking antidepressants along with their treatment. Curtis, for example, still takes a daily antidepressant four months after completing her treatment, but she has been able to sharply reduce the dosage.\n\nCurtis said she noticed no change in her depression at the very start of her rTMS treatment, but she began feeling better after about two weeks of treatment. \u201cI\u2019m not up and down anymore,\u201d she said.\n\nFor patients who don\u2019t respond to prescription drugs and talk therapy, the other major option is electroconvulsive therapy, or ECT, in which an electrical current is sent through the brain to deliberately cause a seizure. The procedure, which is more widely used than rTMS, requires two to three treatments a week for three to four weeks and is effective for many patients. But it requires anesthesia and sometimes causes memory loss or confusion. rTMS does not require anesthesia, and its side effects are generally mild. A few small studies have looked at its effects on cognitive function and found either no effect or slight improvement, according to the AHRQ analysis. The costs of ECT \u2014 typically about $3,300 for four weeks of thrice-weekly treatments, according to AHRQ data \u2014 are covered by most private insurers as well as by Medicare and Medicaid. The cost is higher, however, if a patient must be admitted to the hospital.\n\nLinda Carpenter, an associate professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University, who has conducted medical studies using rTMS for depressed patients, says the treatment is effective for some patients, possibly even better than simply trying another medication. But she says questions remain about how long the effects last and how often a patient should return for additional sessions.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the range of booster treatments people need?\u201d she asks. \u201cIs it once a week, or every couple of years? There\u2019s a huge range in my clinical experience.\u201d Carpenter, a physician, says research has not found any safety issues for patients returning for additional treatments, but cost is a factor.\n\nUncertainty about its long-term effectiveness is why most insurers do not routinely cover rTMS. Medicare also has mainly rejected coverage, though in January, the administrator of the program\u2019s New England region became the first to approve it, citing the AHRQ report and an assessment from an independent regional advisory board.\n\nThat 19-member panel voted 10 to 5 last year that studies of the treatment showed it to be as good as or better than usual care for depression. Six of the 10 said it represented a \u201creasonable\u201d value for its cost; four saw it as a low value. (The same panel voted 9 to 6 that rTMS\u2019s health benefit was equal to that of ECT.) A similar coverage decision proposal is being considered by the Medicare office serving the Washington region.\n\nEven with limited insurance coverage, about 8,000 patients have had the treatment, and the number of treatment centers has doubled to a total of about 400 nationwise since 2010, according to reports by the device\u2019s maker. Centers include some big names, such as Johns Hopkins in Baltimore and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.\n\nStill, some are not convinced. \u201cThe initial treatment with rTMS is $12,000: That\u2019s a lot of generic Prozac or Effexor,\u201d which are cost-effective antidepressants with long track records, said Joel Rubinstein, associate medical director of Harvard Pilgrim HealthCare, an insurer that does not cover rTMS. \u201cManaged care has an obligation to a population.

However, the study was small, and results from a larger trial aren't expected for several years, he added.\n\nDoctors often recommend a \"watch and wait\" period for men with low-grade, or less aggressive, prostate tumors. But many patients and their families aren't comfortable waiting and opt to have surgery before it's deemed medically necessary. These findings suggest that taking vitamin D might help reduce the need for such radical treatment.\n\nBut Dr. Anthony D'Amico, chief of radiation oncology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said that this study was too small to reach any definitive conclusion about the value of vitamin D in fighting prostate cancer.\n\n\"It's premature to make any conclusions,\" he said. The findings also need to be replicated in a much larger number of patients, D'Amico said.\n\nD'Amico stressed that men should not start taking vitamin D supplements in hopes of slowing or curing prostate cancer.\n\nVitamin D, known as the \"sunshine vitamin,\" is produced by the body when it's exposed to sun.

For one, teens need more sleep than adults: about eight or nine hours a night, compared with about the six or seven their parents require. Teens, biologically, really do crave sleep.\n\nWhich is a problem when it comes to education. Most high schools start before 8 am to help parents get to work by 9 am. Early school start times also give kids more time for after-school activities like sports or theater.\n\nBut that has consequences: Around 69 percent of high school students get less than eight hours of sleep on a school night, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which puts these teens at risk of negative impacts on health.\n\nThere may be a simple fix: Start schools at a later time.\n\nThis is a solution supported by both the America Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics. The AMA urges schools to start no earlier than 8:30 am. In 2014, the Academy of Pediatrics wrote that \u201cthe urgency and the magnitude of the problem of sleep loss in adolescents\u201d warranted big changes in school start times.\n\nBut it\u2019s not a foregone conclusion that later start times will ensure teens sleep more. Later start times could lead teens to go to bed even later. Or parents might still wake them up early. When it made its recommendation, the Academy of Pediatrics admitted \u201cit is clear that additional research is needed to further document the effects of changes in school start times over time.\u201d\n\nWell, there\u2019s some new (but still incomplete) evidence that later start times do help teens get more sleep.\n\nA new meta-analysis in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine analyzed 18 studies on start times. It finds that when school starts up to an hour later, students typically do get around 19 minutes more sleep, on average. When start times are delayed more than an hour, that average increases to 53 minutes of extra sleep.\n\nThe study also found some preliminary evidence that later school start times were associated with better mental health outcomes. Only five of the 18 studies included these measures, but in two of them, later start time was associated with better (self-reported) feelings of depression and irritability.\n\nMore work needs to be done to confirm these findings. But even if later school start times only improve sleep time, that\u2019s a positive step for public health. Because if later school start times can truly help students sleep better, the research suggests that better sleep would lead to major improvements to their health and well-being.\n\nTeens tend to be night owls, and forcing them to be early birds can mess with their health\n\nTeens tend to go to sleep a bit later and wake up a bit later than the average adult \u2014 something called a \u201cdelayed\u201d sleep phase. For most teens, it means their whole biological clock is shifted, and if they wake up too early, their body will be out of sync with the rest of the world. \u201cEvery neurotransmitter, hormone, and chemical in the body cycles with the daily rhythm,\" Philip Gehrman, a sleep researcher and clinician at the University of Pennsylvania, told me earlier in the year.\n\nWhen your body clock is off from society\u2019s, scientists call it \u201csocial jet lag.\u201d And like the jet lag from a long journey, it messes with your body.\n\nStudies of adults find that social jet lag is associated with higher BMI, insulin resistance, depression, and a higher likelihood to engage in dangerous behaviors like smoking. And the group of people most at risk for social jet lag? Teens.\n\nIn a tightly controlled lab study, 24 healthy adult participants* who had their sleep shifted by one hour each day (simulating jet lag) started to look prediabetic after a three-week trial. Their resting metabolic rates dropped 8 percent. \"Assuming no changes in activity or food intake,\" that \"would translate into ~12.5 pounds increase in weight over a single year,\" the study, published in Science Translational Medicine in 2012, concluded.\n\nPeople with a lot of social jet lag also tend to get fewer hours of sleep, which exacerbates these same health problems. On top of that, short sleep reduces powers of perception, concentration, and judgment. There\u2019s some evidence that when students sleep better, they perform better in school as well.\n\nDelaying school start times is easier said than done\n\nAs Vox\u2019s Libby Nelson has reported, very few schools have actually adopted this reform. This map, which reflects the most recent CDC data available, shows that across the country, schools still start very early.\n\nThere are some understandable reasons why. Nelson writes:\n\nAnd even though the evidence is mostly in favor of increasing school start times, it isn\u2019t a slam dunk quite yet.\n\nThere are some limitations to mention about the new meta-analysis. The studies mostly used self-reported measures of sleep duration. (More objective measures \u2014 like those obtained from Fitbit-like wristbands \u2014 are more accurate.) And many of the studies were short in duration, comparing sleep duration in snapshots before and after a school made a switch. More data would show whether the impact of school start time on sleep waned or improved over time.\n\n\u201cThe aggregated quality of the evidence,\u201d the study reports, \u201cis only moderate.\u201d The researchers also found no effect on academic performance. Furthermore, two of the studies found evidence that earlier start times were associated with increased vehicle accidents involving the teens. Being tired in the morning can be a dangerous distraction while on the road.\n\nIn all, the researchers call for more rigorous data on the topic. As schools change their start times, they write, researchers should sweep in to collect information on students\u2019 sleep in a standardized way.\n\nRegardless, it\u2019s a promising area for study. Because if later school start times can truly help students sleep better, the research suggests that better sleep would lead to major improvements to their health and well-being.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "No sources appear to have been interviewed for this story, though it contains a lot of citations to studies and quotes used in past stories.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "February 28, 2017 - For infants with congenital malformations of the ear, a treatment system called EarWell can gently reshape the ear--avoiding the pain and cost of later surgery, reports a study in the March issue of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery\u00ae, the official medical journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS).\n\nBut treatment must begin early--preferably within the first three weeks after birth, according to the study by ASPS Member Surgeon H. Steve Byrd, MD, and colleagues of Pediatric Plastic Surgery Institute, Dallas. Dr. Byrd comments, \"The EarWell system is effective in eliminating or reducing the need for surgery in all but the most severe congenital ear malformations.\"\n\nThe researchers review their experience with nonsurgical correction of congenital ear malformations in 175 infants. The EarWell system is a relatively simple technique for molding and reshaping the ear, taking advantage of the increased malleability of the ear cartilage in newborns. For best results, treatment should start within the first three weeks after birth, or correspondingly later in infants born prematurely.\n\nThe technique and length of EarWell treatment varies according to the type and severity of the infant's ear deformity. Dr. Byrd and colleagues present a classification system and technical details for plastic surgeons to follow in evaluating the best treatment for specific types of malformations.\n\nFor most infants in the study, both ears were treated, for a total of 303 ears. Ninety-eight percent of infants had relatively mild \"constricted\"-type ear deformities. EarWell treatment started at an average age of 12 days and continued for 37 days, including an average of six follow-up visits to the plastic surgeon's office.\n\nEarWell treatment was highly successful in correcting or reducing the severity of congenital ear malformations. Results were judged good to excellent in 97 percent of ears with one simple deformity and 88 percent with more complex \"mixed\" deformities. About 70 percent of ears with constricted malformations were graded as having no deformity after treatment.\n\nComplications consisted mainly of skin injuries that healed without further problems. In eight cases, treatment had to be stopped because of an allergic reaction to the adhesive tape used.\n\nWhile the EarWell system is not new, the report is the largest study of congenital ear malformations treated with this approach--including a standardized approach to treatment and assessment of the results. The results strongly support its use, especially in infants with deformities and less-severe malformations.\n\nBut lack of awareness of this nonsurgical alternative is a key limiting factor. \"The opportunity for early treatment can be hampered by a failure to convince pediatricians that the majority of misshapen newborn ears do not self-correct,\" Dr. Byrd and coauthors write. They also point out that EarWell is highly successful in the treatment of prominent ears--a condition that commonly goes unnoticed by parents and pediatricians, but is likely to get worse as the child grows.\n\n\"While we can operate on ears later in the patient's life, waiting not only increases the surgery's difficulty and expense, but may expose the child to teasing, bullying, and loss of self-esteem,\" comments Editor-in-Chief Rod J. Rohrich, MD, in a featured video on the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery website. \"If your baby has any type of ear deformity, plastic surgeons can help with or without surgery.

Someday, they will not be able to walk. They will not be able to stand. Eventually, they will not be able to live. The brothers, ages 6 through 11, suffer from a debilitating and deadly genetic condition called Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).\n\nYet on September 28, Max, Rowan and Charlie Vertin got dressed up. In dark suits and blue shirts, with serious expressions on their round faces, they walked to stand next to their mother in a very beige room outside Washington, D.C. The people in that room, they believed, could change the course of their lives.\n\nFor years, the Vertin brothers have been participating in a clinical trial for a new medication called ataluren, intended to keep the progression of their disease at bay. By October 24, they\u2019ll know if they will be able to keep taking that drug. That is the deadline for the Food and Drug Administration to make a choice. The agency could approve the drug, allowing the brothers and others like them to continue to take it. Or it could reject the drug for the third time and throw them into an uncertain future.\n\nAn FDA committee has already voted that data about the drug\u2019s effectiveness was inconclusive. The agency\u2019s final decision almost always echos the decisions of its committees. So, if this were any other kind of drug at any other time in FDA history, the FDA\u2019s final answer would be a very predictable no.\n\nIf they do say no, the Vertins could lose access to the drug that has stabilized their condition. But there\u2019s still a chance the FDA could approve the drug. Input from people affected by DMD may have convinced the agency once before to approve a drug for the condition despite iffy data. That is what the Vertins\u2014and the company that produces the drug\u2014are hoping will happen again.\n\n\u201cIt started out so innocent,\u201d his mother, Betty Vertin, told Newsweek. Max was a big infant, born 10 lbs, 3 oz and nearly two feet long. \u201cWhen he was missing milestones, I just thought it was because it was a big baby.\u201d Even doctors assumed that he would eventually catch up. But when he started preschool, the difference between Max and other children became more obvious. \u201cWhen other kids were running and jumping and climbing, Max wasn\u2019t doing those things. He was just behind, physically.\u201d\n\nWhen Max was 4, in 2010, a genetic test confirmed that he had DMD. Betty had never heard of it. \u201cBefore we started living this life, I was clueless,\u201d she said.\n\nDMD is one of a class of similar genetic disorders. About 15 boys out of every 100,000 in the United States under 24 years old have DMD or a milder form, called Becker muscular dystrophy. (Most of the children affected are boys.) The illness affects the way their legs, heart, and lungs work.\n\nMax\u2019s diagnosis was devastating for Betty. \u201cI feel like I walked into the room with a healthy four-year-old boy and I walked out with a child that was dying,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the family\u2019s struggles with DMD were just beginning. At the time, Rowan was 2, and Betty suspected that he also had the disease; she\u2019d seen how her son struggled to stand up onto a stepstool in the bathroom to brush his teeth. She was also ten weeks pregnant with Charlie.\n\nGenetic tests eventually confirmed both Rowan and Charlie also had DMD. Betty\u2019s two daughters, Lexi, 16, and Mary, 2, as well as a fourth son, Chance, 10, do not.\n\n\u201cI felt like we had a year and a half of the same horrible diagnosis over and over and over again,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the hardest 18 months I\u2019ve ever had and I hope I ever had.\u201d\n\nDMD always results in muscle weakness due to a lack of a protein called dystrophin. Some of the newest treatments for the condition try to fix that. One drug, which the FDA approved in 2016, works for people whose illness springs from a mutation in the gene that codes for dystrophin.\n\nThe drug, called Exondys 51 or eteplirsen, allows the genetic machinery that produces the protein to skip over the mutated part to make something that will work better. About 13 percent of people with DMD have this particular mutation, according to the FDA.\n\nThe Vertin brothers are not among them; the drug shouldn\u2019t help them at all. So they tried ataluren. (The drug\u2019s brand name is Translarna.) The company that produces ataluren, PTC Therapeutics, says that its drug forces cells to make the proteins in spite of a different kind of mutation called a nonsense mutation. Instead of having an error in the protein, the protein is accidentally cut short. This is the kind of mutation that three of Betty Vertin\u2019s children have.\n\nThe Vertins have received the drug free through the clinical trial, and expenses for their trip from Nebraska to Washington, D.C. were paid by PTC Therapeutics.\n\nAtaluren works by ordering a cell to use a slightly different piece to build the protein\u2014as if someone spray-painted the word \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d on the molecular version of a stop sign. Exactly how it does that is still mysterious. A paper published by the company\u2019s scientists in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science said it probably affected the ribosome, a key part of how proteins are put together in a cell. (Researchers not affiliated with the company did not find the same kind of activity.)\n\nRegardless of what mutation causes the illness, most people with DMD die in their 20s. Betty was told to expect her oldest son, Max, to be in a wheelchair full-time by the time he was 9 or 12.\n\nMax is 11 now. His 12th birthday is in early November. He uses an electric mobility scooter for long distances, but he can still walk. He rides a bike without training wheels and without any modifications. He has a part in a school play and goes up and down stairs to get to the stage. He even plays a trumpet in his school\u2019s band. \u201cHe\u2019s got the lung capacity to blow that thing, very loudly,\u201d Betty said.\n\nFor that, Betty credits ataluren, which Max started three years ago.\n\n\u201cHis life is\u2014it\u2019s not like his peers, but he\u2019s getting a lot of the experiences that his peers are having,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s living a sort of a typical sixth-grade life and that diagnosis\u2014I didn\u2019t know what it would look like for him. I didn\u2019t expect it to look like this.\u201d\n\nBut not everyone considers ataluren to be a miracle drug\u2014with good reason. The clinical trial results haven't been great. Most of the company\u2019s studies tested how fast a child could go about 30 feet or walk up and down stairs, or how far they could walk in six minutes. They did see some slight positive results, many of which came from a study done with the specific kind of patient the company discovered benefited most in a previous trial.\n\nThe FDA needs good data to make their decision, because when the agency approves a drug is sends a signal to the world. An approval is the FDA saying, \u201cthis drug is safe and effective. You could use it for your child, too.\u201d\n\nPTC Therapeutics has tried to get FDA approval for the drug twice before. Both times the agency refused to even consider the application. This time, the application for approval was filed over the FDA\u2019s protest. (The drug has been conditionally approved in Europe.)\n\nPart of the reason that the drug has struggled is because of this requirement: if the drug is effective, the data should show it. But that hasn't happened consistently with ataluren. Many of the clinical trials failed to satisfy the statistical requirement to prove a drug works\u2014at least not for the main outcome the company was looking at. Other, secondary measurements did seem to have good statistics. Certain groups of children seemed to have better results than others, too.\n\nPTC Therapeutics founder and CEO Stuart Peltz says the statistics aren't a reason to reject the drug. Just because a drug doesn\u2019t measure up in that way, he says, \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean the drug is not effective.\u201d\n\nBut even if the FDA agrees to overlook some of the negative data about ataluren, insurers may not. That could be a million-dollar issue for the families with affected children.\n\n\u201cIf the evidence isn\u2019t good, then insurance companies won\u2019t pay for [drugs],\u201d said National Center for Health Research (NCHR) president Diana Zuckerman. Two recently approved drugs have run into this problem: Spinraza, a drug for spinal muscular atrophy, and Exondys 51. Both drugs cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Pharmaceutical companies traditionally will not discuss prices before drugs are approved; that said, ataluren costs about \u00a3220,000 in Britain. During clinical trials, participants like the Vertins normally do not pay for the treatment.\n\nThe NCHR also presented at the FDA meeting in September to discuss ataluren, urging the agency to not approve the drug without more research. The organization\u2019s statement also raised concerns about side effects associated with the drug, specifically about the chance that it raises blood pressure and cholesterol levels in children. The company says these shifts are small and \"not clinically significant.\"\n\nIn an e-mailed statement, FDA spokesperson Sandy Walsh confirmed that the FDA\u2019s decisions are all \u201cbased on an assessment of the available data and whether the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks.\u201d That data can include the experience of patients like Max, Rowan and Charlie.\n\nTo Betty, the benefits are clear, even if they aren\u2019t easily quantified. Rowan\u2019s gait seems better. Max still doesn\u2019t need to use a wheelchair all the time, bucking the prediction she heard when he was first diagnosed.\n\nHowever, financial analysts who track the biotech sector are not optimistic about ataluren\u2019s immediate prospects. Matthew Eckler, a senior biotechnology analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said that analysts and investors are betting the FDA will not approve the drug.\n\nThe FDA hasn\u2019t said no yet. The agency still has nearly two more weeks to make a decision. Until then, Betty and her sons are living with a lot of uncertainty. \u201cI\u2019m really scared that my boys will have to go off [ataluren],\u201d she said.

Kazley and colleagues from the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston emphasize in a report released today.\n\n\u201cAnyone who thinks they are having a stroke should seek care at a hospital immediately. Individuals should not wait to seek care for stroke,\u201d Kazley told Reuters Health by email.\n\nThe current study, she added, shows that \u201chigh quality (stroke) care is available in hospitals on the weekends and weekdays.\u201d In fact, care might even be more aggressive on weekends.\n\nWhy? On weekends, even though hospitals have lower levels of staffing, stroke patients arriving at the hospital may have greater access to equipment and doctors who might be busier during the week than they are on weekends. Elective surgeries are not usually scheduled on weekends, leading perhaps to \u201cdecreased traffic and waiting times\u201d for diagnostic equipment, culminating in quicker and more efficient diagnosis and determination of treatment.\n\nWith less road traffic and job obligations on weekends, stroke patients may get to the hospital quicker \u2014 within the three hour window when guidelines recommend that clot-busting drugs for stroke be given.\n\nKazley and colleagues analyzed data on 78,657 patients admitted to Virginia hospitals between 1998 and 2006 with acute ischemic stroke \u2014 the most common type of stroke, which is caused by a blood clot in the vessels supplying the brain. Of these, 20,279 were admitted on weekends and 58,378 during the week.\n\nPatients admitted on the weekends were 20 percent more likely than those admitted during the week to get the clot-busting drug tissue plasminogen activator, or tPA \u2014 a drug that can improve patient outcomes following stroke. A total of 543 weekend stroke sufferers got the drug versus only 229 weekday stroke patients.\n\nYet stroke patients admitted on the weekends were no more likely to die than stroke patients admitted during the week: 1,420 patients admitted on the weekend died versus 3,993 patients admitted on a weekday, which worked out to roughly the same rate of death.\n\nPutting those figures together could suggest that the clot-buster tPA wasn\u2019t doing much good. In fact, that authors note that patients who received tPA were more likely to die in the hospital. Dr. Lawrence B. Goldstein, director of the Duke Stroke Center in Durham, North Carolina, and spokesperson for the American Heart Association said the results were not surprising, since \u201cno clinical trials ever showed that treatment with a (clot buster) improves survival.\u201d\n\nBut Kazley said that the additional deaths among patients who received tPA is likely because doctors are more likely to give the drug to those with severe strokes, who have a higher risk of death in any case.\n\nOverall, Kazley added, this study offers \u201cgood news that indicates that the quality of care is similar regardless of when patients present at the hospital for treatment. This is an indication of the standardization of hospital care regardless of the time/day that patients seek care.\u201d\n\nStudies on the potential for a \u201cweekender effect\u201d in care and outcome for urgent conditions such stroke and heart attack have yielded mixed results.\n\nFor example, in one study examining stroke outcomes in Canada, researchers found that patients with stroke admitted to the hospital on weekends were at greater risk of dying than those admitted on weekdays. \u201cEven in a country with universal health insurance coverage (such as Canada), disparities in resources, expertise, or the number of healthcare providers working during weekends\u201d may affect the stroke mortality rate, the researchers concluded. (See Reuters Health report, March 8, 2007).\n\nIn a prior US study, researchers found that people who were admitted to the hospital on a weekend for a heart attack were less likely to receive potentially life-saving procedures than their peers who were admitted on a weekday. In this study, weekend admissions for heart attack were associated with much higher death rates, leading the researchers to conclude that more appropriate hospital staffing or regionalized care of heart attack patients may prevent some of these deaths.

This rare genetic defect causes severe visual impairment beginning in infancy and can eventually lead to blindness. The company believes the total \"population in the US, Europe and select additional markets in the Americas and Asia/Pacific is up to approximately 6,000 individuals\" who have the mutation targeted by Luxturna, explained Monique da Silva, a spokeswoman for Spark Therapeutics.\n\nThe drug will be available in the United States in early spring, with an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 people in the US standing to benefit from this treatment, according to Spark.\n\nLuxturna is only the third gene therapy approved for use in the United States; two others were also approved in 2017. This is the first to correct an inherited genetic mutation.\n\nLuxturna is a liquid that is injected directly into the eye with a microscopic needle during a surgical procedure. The drug supplies a third gene -- a normal RPE65 gene -- to cells in the retina, a layer of tissue lining the back of the eye. This third version of the gene does not remove or replace the two mutated genes causing the disease, which remain inside the cells. However, the normal gene delivered by the treatment is able to function within the retinal cells and correct vision problems.\n\nIn the phase 3 clinical trial, 27 out of 29 participants -- 93% -- who received the gene therapy demonstrated a gain in functional vision as assessed by a mobility test performed in a maze, according to the company. Risks of the treatment include cataracts, elevated eye pressure, retinal tears and holes and inflammation.\n\nThe company's offer of unusual payer models, including rebates and installment payments, will \"help ensure patients' individual financial situation does not hinder access to treatment,\" da Silva said.\n\n\"New technologies such as gene and cell therapies hold out the potential to transform medicine,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a statement announcing the August approval of Kymriah, considered to be the first gene therapy to be approved for the US market.\n\nKymriah is a leukemia treatment made by pharmaceutical giant Novartis.

Half of the patients received an appendectomy, which is the standard of care, while the other half got an IV of antibiotics for three days followed by antibiotic pills for a week.\n\nThe researchers found that 73% of the patients who took antibiotics recovered from appendicitis and did not need surgery for at least a year afterward. The rest of the patients -- who went on to have another case of appendicitis and need an appendectomy -- did not have a higher rate of complications than the patients who initially received surgery.\n\n\"This is quite a radical change in the line of thinking, because appendectomy has served patients well for over 100 years,\" said Dr. Paulina Salminen, a surgeon at the Turku University Hospital in Finland and lead author of the study, which was published on Tuesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association . An editorial accompanying the study added, \"the time has come to consider abandoning routine appendectomy for patients with uncomplicated appendicitis.\"\n\nThe findings suggest that for patients with uncomplicated cases, who make up about 80% of the patients diagnosed with appendicitis, surgery may not be necessary, Salminen said. However, if the appendix has ruptured, emergency surgery must be done because patients can develop deadly infections in the abdomen and antibiotics alone are not strong enough to treat them, she added.\n\nSeveral previous studies have compared appendectomy with antibiotics , but most of them have relied on clinical examination to diagnose uncomplicated appendicitis. The current study relied on CT scans, which are a more accurate way to diagnose the disease and to make sure only patients with simple cases are studied, Salminen said. Still, in both the current study and a 2011 study that also used CT scans, more than a quarter of patients who were treated with antibiotics for their well-diagnosed cases of simple appendicitis had a recurrence of appendicitis and ended up needing surgery. In contrast, the failure rate was less than 1% in the group that initially got an appendectomy in the current study. (One patient died of heart disease in the week after surgery.) The high failure rate of antibiotic therapy suggests that it is not ready for the clinic, said Dr. Curtis Wray, an associate professor of surgery at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. \"I think we need to determine who are really the candidates for this type of nonoperative therapy,\" Wray said. Part of the reason for the 27% failure rate could be that the antibiotics did not clear up the obstruction in the appendix that was the root cause of the inflammation. More analyses need to be done to understand how this group differed from the other 73% -- maybe they had more advanced appendicitis -- and thus to be able to predict who might not make a full recovery with antibiotics alone, Wray said. If antibiotic therapy does become a viable alternative to appendectomy, it would probably lead to a big cost savings, Wray said. There are about 300,000 appendectomies performed every year in the U.S. About 200,000 of them are uncomplicated cases, many of which could be good candidates for antibiotics. However, as Wray pointed out, it may take a little while for this nonsurgical option to be accepted by patients, because appendectomy is considered the gold standard. In addition, laparoscopic appendectomy is minimally invasive and patients usually go home the same day, he added. Nevertheless, Salminen said that surgery can cause several days of pain and missed work, whereas patients would probably not experience pain following antibiotic therapy and would have a faster recovery. Because the study only looked at people between 18 and 60, it is not clear how effective antibiotic therapy would be in children, the group that accounts for most cases of appendicitis. Other researchers are planning to do a similar study in children, Salminen said. Salminen and her colleagues also did not include pregnant women in the study. \"You can't really do a CT scan on pregnant women, so you can't really have the precise diagnosis, so to be on the safe side those patients would probably have to undergo appendectomy,\" she said. The study gave patients in the antibiotic group an IV of ertapenem once a day for three days and then prescribed a week of oral antibiotics, levofloxacin and metronidazole. \"Every time you use antibiotics, you have to think about the risk of developing antibiotic resistance, (especially) because the antibiotics used here are very broad spectrum,\" Salminen said. She added that future studies should look at whether lower doses of antibiotics, and the use of more specific antibiotics that may be less likely to lead to resistance, could also be effective in treating appendicitis.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story provides comments from the senior author of the paper as well as the balanced comments of Dr. Wray.\nBut the story doesn\u2019t mention that the senior author (Dr. Salminen) disclosed speaking fees from Merck and Roche.

Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. But because vision damage often occurs gradually, most people with the eye disease do not realize they have it until a good deal of their sight has been lost. If caught early, though, there are medications and procedures that may help treat glaucoma. In the study, researchers were able to predict who was at increased risk of developing the eye disease with some accuracy by measuring blood vessel thickness in the retinas of study participants using a computer-based imaging tool. Those with the narrowest vessels at the beginning of the study were four times more likely to have developed glaucoma a decade later.\n\nAbout 3 million Americans and 60 million people worldwide have glaucoma, and the numbers are projected to rise over the next few decades as the population ages. The disease involves damage to the optic nerve, which relays images from the retina to the brain. Early detection is key, but without regular eye exams, most people don\u2019t know they have a problem, says ophthalmologist Andrew Iwach, MD.

The results showed no differences in IQ.\n\n\"There is growing evidence from a number of studies that all infants, those born at term and those born early, benefit from receiving extra blood from the placenta at birth,\" said Dr. Heike Rabe, a neonatologist at Brighton & Sussex Medical School in the United Kingdom. Rabe's editorial accompanied the study published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics.\n\nDelaying the clamping of the cord allows more blood to transfer from the placenta to the infant, sometimes increasing the infant's blood volume by up to a third. The iron in the blood increases infants' iron storage, and iron is essential for healthy brain development.\n\n\"The extra blood at birth helps the baby to cope better with the transition from life in the womb, where everything is provided for them by the placenta and the mother, to the outside world,\" Rabe said. \"Their lungs get more blood so that the exchange of oxygen into the blood can take place smoothly.\"\n\nPast studies have shown higher levels of iron and other positive effects later in infancy among babies whose cords were clamped after several minutes, but few studies have looked at results past infancy.\n\nIn this study, researchers randomly assigned half of 263 healthy Swedish full-term newborns to have their cords clamped more than three minutes after birth. The other half were clamped less than 10 seconds after birth.\n\nFour years later, the children underwent a series of assessments for IQ, motor skills, social skills, problem-solving, communication skills and behavior. Those with delayed cord clamping showed modestly higher scores in social skills and fine motor skills. When separated by sex, only the boys showed statistically significant improvement.\n\n\"We don't know exactly why, but speculate that girls receive extra protection through higher estrogen levels whilst being in the womb,\" Rabe said. \"The results in term infants are consistent with those of follow-up in preterm infants.\"\n\nDelayed cord clamping has garnered more attention in the past few years for its potential benefits to the newborn. Until recently, clinicians believed early clamping reduced the risk of hemorrhaging in the mother, but research hasn't borne that out.\n\nMuch of the research has focused on preterm infants, who appear to benefit most from delayed cord clamping, Rabe said. Preemies who have delayed cord clamping tend to have better blood pressure in the days immediately after birth, need fewer drugs to support blood pressure, need fewer blood transfusions, have less bleeding into the brain and have a lower risk of necrotizing enterocolitis, a life-threatening bowel injury, she said.\n\nThis study is among the few looking at healthy, full-term infants in a country high in resources, as opposed to developing countries where iron deficiency may be more likely.\n\nThe American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has not yet endorsed the practice, citing insufficient evidence for full-term infants. The World Health Organization recommends delayed cord clamping of not less than one minute.\n\nIt is unclear whether the practice could harm infants' health. Some studies have found a higher risk of jaundice, a buildup of bilirubin in the blood from the breakdown of red blood cells. Jaundice is treated with blue light therapy and rarely has serious complications.\n\nAnother potential risk is a condition called polycythemia, a very high red blood cell count, said Dr. Scott Lorch, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine and director of the Center for Perinatal and Pediatric Health Disparities Research at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\n\"Polycythemia can have medical consequences for the infant, including blood clots, respiratory distress and even strokes in the worst-case scenario,\" Lorch said. Some studies have found higher levels of red blood cells in babies with delayed cord clamping, but there were no complications.\n\nLorch also pointed out that this study involved a mostly homogenous population in a country outside the U.S.\n\n\"We should see whether similar effects are seen in higher-risk populations, such as the low socioeconomic population, racial and ethnic minorities and those at higher risk for neurodevelopmental delay,\" Lorch said.\n\nSo far, studies on delayed cord clamping have excluded infants born in distress, such as those with breathing difficulties or other problems. But Rabe said these infants may actually benefit most from the practice.\n\nThese babies often need more blood volume to help with blood pressure, breathing and circulation problems, Rabe said. \"Also, the placental blood is rich with stem cells, which could help to repair any brain damage the baby might have suffered during a difficult birth,\" she added. \"Milking of the cord would be the easiest way to get the extra blood into the baby quickly in an emergency situation.\"", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story made very good use of independent sources beyond the study authors.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A variety of detox diets claim to flush toxins out of the body, aid weight loss and even clear up skin.

But on Oct. 23, the F.D.A. granted authority for the drug to be used in emergencies for patients hospitalized with H1N1 flu who cannot take or do not benefit from Tamiflu or Relenza.\n\nBefore that, peramivir had been available only through a more cumbersome \u201ccompassionate use\u201d procedure. Of the 32 patients who received the drug that way, 29 were still alive, BioCryst said in late October.\n\nAlthough there are still questions about peramivir\u2019s true effectiveness, some critics say the government moved too slowly to make the drug available, and that even now, access is too restricted. For each patient, doctors must call an 800 number or fill out a form on a Web site run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The drug is then sent overnight from a central stockpile.\n\n\u201cIf you have a critically ill patient, to delay therapy, it\u2019s just incomprehensible to me,\u201d said Dr. Richard Whitley, a professor at the University of Alabama and the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. He said the drug should be distributed so that hospitals could have it in stock.\n\nBut Dr. Nicole Lurie, assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services, said the limited supplies made more general distribution impossible. Some doctors said they were satisfied with the existing system.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fairly accessible,\u201d said Dr. Thomas M. File Jr., chief of infectious diseases at Summa Health System in Akron, Ohio, who has treated a pregnant woman with peramivir. Some of the push to make the drug more widely available is coming from investors in BioCryst, including Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the prominent Silicon Valley venture capital firm. John Doerr, the company\u2019s technology guru, was in Washington this week making the case for greater availability of peramivir, according to a person who met with him there.\n\nOther investors \u2014 both supporters of BioCryst stock and those betting the price will fall \u2014 have commented at government meetings on flu preparations, often without revealing their financial interests.\n\nAnecdotes like Ms. Gurno\u2019s aside, the efficacy of peramivir is still in question, according to the government. While some clinical trials showed the drug had an effect in resolving flu symptoms, others did not show statistically significant differences between peramivir and either a placebo or Tamiflu.\n\nThe question for both investors and federal authorities is how much more of the drug BioCryst can sell. So far, the order has been far less than some investors had hoped, though the price of the order announced Thursday was higher than expected.\n\nDr. Lurie, the federal official, said there had been 237 requests to use the drug since the emergency use authorization was granted nearly two weeks ago. Many doctors want to provide the treatment for 10 days instead of the recommended 5, she said, so the 10,000 courses the government ordered might actually treat as few as 5,000 patients.\n\nThe government has the right to buy up to 30,000 more treatment courses at the same price.\n\nBioCryst says it will have perhaps 40,000 more treatment courses available within a few weeks, and a total of 120,000 by the end of the year. It also says it has signed up partners to try to win sales in Brazil, Mexico, Israel and China.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of interest from countries outside the United States,\u201d Jon P. Stonehouse, the company\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview Thursday.\n\nShionogi, a Japanese drug company with licensing rights from BioCryst, ran its own clinical trials and this week applied for approval to sell the drug in Japan as a treatment for everyday flu, in competition with Tamiflu.\n\nBut in the United States, BioCryst plans to try to win approval for treatment only of hospitalized patients. It is now beginning phase 3 trials \u2014 the last stage before seeking F.D.A. approval.\n\nVirtually all the money to develop the drug comes from $180 million in grants from the Department of Health and Human Services. Yet the company gets to keep as profit anything it makes from selling the drug to the federal government or to other governments. Mr. Stonehouse defended the price of the drug, saying it would save the health system money by getting patients out of intensive care earlier. \u201cThe cost of being in the I.C.U. and on a ventilator is extremely high,\u201d he said.\n\nBut peramivir will soon have competition. The federal government said late Thursday that it had also ordered 10,000 treatment courses each of intravenous versions of Tamiflu and Relenza, with options to buy 30,000 more courses of each.\n\nThose drugs could not be used, however, until they received emergency use authorizations from the F.D.A.\n\nThe government is paying an average of only $450 a course for those other drugs \u2014 only one-fifth of what it is paying for peramivir.\n\nRight now, Dr. Lurie said, peramivir is the only drug that can be used intravenously so the government had to pay a high price. \u201cI would say that one of the things that happens in the market when you have competition is that the price drops.\u201d", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "\n\n\n\nThe story did not point out that one of the supporters of faster and broader access to peramivir, Dr. Richard Whitley, has long been a booster of the drug, which is being commercially developed by a spin-off of the University of Alabama department he works in. \nSee Whitley comments in a 2005 article promoting the potential of peramivir: \nhttp://main.uab.edu/show.asp?durki=87834\nHere we also point out that the story profiled only one patient and includes a quote from the patient\u2019s father crediting peramivir with saving his daughter\u2019s life.

(Due dates are set at 40 weeks gestation, and infants are considered full term at 37 weeks.)\n\nThe findings offer important guidance to the growing number of women who face planned C-sections -- one in three babies in the United States, estimates the National Center for Health Statistics.\n\n\"We recognize that by the end of a long pregnancy there is a desire to see the baby and to move forward,\" said Dr. Brian Mercer, one of the study's authors and director of both the division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine and obstetrics at MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland.\n\n\"But mothers and families need to recognize the potential risk of moving forward before it's time,\" he said.\n\nThe findings from the study sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Maternal Fetal Medicine Units Network also underscore the importance of a woman seeking medical care as early into her pregnancy as possible, so that doctors can accurately gauge the gestational age with an ultrasound, Mercer said.\n\nResearchers at 19 medical centers studied more than 24,000 women who gave birth to a single child by C-section from 1999 to 2002. Of those, more than 13,000 had elective C-sections. All of the women had previously had C-sections.\n\nMore than one-third of the surgeries performed during that time happened at 37 or 38 weeks. Babies born at 37 weeks were twice as likely to have breathing problems, infections or to stay in intensive care than babies born a week later. Breathing problems -- already a high risk because labor helps clear the baby's lungs of fluid -- happened four times as often in babies born at 37 weeks than those born at 39 weeks.\n\nDr. Justin Lavin, director of theMaternal-Fetal Medicine Departmentat Akron Children's Hospital and a high-risk obstetrician, said he hopes the study's findings help people understand why doctors like him say nowhen it comes to scheduling unnecessary C-sections early.\n\n\"This happens to me every day,\" Lavin said. \"Sometimes [the mother] is a bit uncomfortable, or sometimes Dad has to go on a business trip or Grandma wants to fly in,\" Lavin said. \"It's human nature.\"\n\nThe standard practice has been that doctors planning repeat C-sections do so between 36 and 40 weeks, when most fetuses have developed enough to survive outside the womb.\n\nThe tests the doctors perform to determine the extent of the fetus's development are often not sophisticated enough to determine subtle milestones for breathing and processing food independently, said Dr. John Thorp, a University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill obstetrician and one of the authors of the study.\n\n\"I think there is something inherent in labor -- probably a signal from baby to mother that the baby is ready to make the transition -- that we choose to circumvent when we schedule an elective, repeat C-section,\" Thorp said.\n\n\"I think it points to a role for the baby in the initiation of labor and the baby's readiness to make the transition.\"\n\nThe Associated Press and McClatchy Newspapers contributed to this story.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story quotes multiple experts.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "(Reuters) - Details of a large heart safety study presented on Monday appear to give Merck and Co\u2019s diabetes drug Januvia a clean bill of health, possibly setting the stage for a return to sales growth for the drugmaker\u2019s biggest product.\n\nMerck in April said the study, called Tecos, of 14,724 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of heart disease demonstrated that adding Januvia to usual care did not increase major heart problems any more than adding a placebo, removing a cloud that has been holding back sales of the medicine and the company\u2019s share price.\n\nJanuvia, an oral medication known chemically as sitagliptin that helps lower blood sugar levels, had sales of about $4 billion in 2014, plus another $1.8 billion for the related combination product Janumet\n\nOn the study\u2019s main focus, after about three years 11.4 percent of Januvia patients had experienced cardiovascular death, non-fatal heart attack, non-fatal stroke or hospitalization for unstable angina versus 11.6 percent in the placebo group.\n\nThe detailed results also showed no increase in hospitalization for heart failure, which had been a particular concern with DPP-4 inhibitors, the class to which Januvia belongs.

The research team reports that the potential improvement in diagnostic accuracy will spare thousands of patients each year in the United States alone from having to undergo unnecessary surgery.\n\nIn a recent report on ongoing work to improve kidney tumor classification, published in the April issue of the journal Clinical Nuclear Medicine, the team reports that the sestamibi SPECT/CT test\u2014short for 99mTc-sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography(CT) \u2014 adds additional diagnostic information in conjunction with conventional CTs and MRI and improves physicians\u2019 ability to differentiate between benign and malignant kidney tumors.\n\n\u201cSestamibi SPECT/CT lets radiologists and urologists \u2018see\u2019 the most common benign kidney tumor, something CT and MRI have not succeeded in doing alone,\u201d says Mohamad E. Allaf, M.D., MEA Endowed Professor of Urology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \u201cThis noninvasive scan may prevent patients with a potentially benign kidney tumor from having to undergo a surgery to remove the tumor or potentially the entire kidney, along with its associated risks and high costs. At Johns Hopkins, use of this test has already spared a number of our patients from unnecessary surgery and unnecessary removal of a kidney that would require them to be on dialysis. These results are hugely encouraging, but we need to do more studies.\u201d\n\nFor this study, 48 patients who were diagnosed with a kidney tumor on conventional CT or MRI were imaged with sestamibi SPECT/CT at Johns Hopkins prior to surgery. Radiologists, who were not allowed to talk to each other or know the results of the surgeries, graded the conventional and sestamibi SPECT/CT images benign or malignant using a 5-point scale (1 = definitely benign, 5 = definitely cancerous).\n\nFollowing surgery, similarly \u2018blinded\u2019 pathologists analyzed the tumors without knowing the radiologists\u2019 imaging results. Pathology results of surgically removed tumors showed that 8 of the 48 were benign. The remaining 40 were classified as a variety of other tumor types, including malignant renal cell carcinomas.\n\nReviewing sestamibi SPECT/CT scan results in conjunction with CT or MRI changed the initial rating levels from cancerous (score 3, 4, 5) toward benign (score 1 and 2) in 9 cases, and changed reviewers\u2019 score from likely cancerous (score 4) to definitely cancerous (score 5) in 5 cases, or about 10 percent of all cases. The addition of sestamibi SPECT/CT increased the reviewers\u2019 diagnostic certainty in 14 of the 48 patients, or in nearly 30 percent of all cases.\n\nOverall, the investigators said, adding sestamibi SPECT/CT helped identify 7 of 9 benign tumors, and conventional imaging with added sestamibi SPECT/CT outperformed conventional imaging alone, as measured by a statistical analysis that measures tradeoffs between sensitivity and specificity. On this measure, a value of 0.50 indicates that a diagnostic test is no better than chance. Conventional imaging combined with sestamibi SPECT/CT had a value of 0.85, while conventional imaging alone had a value of 0.60.\n\nEven for patients whose tumors were not reclassified, the addition of sestamibi SPECT/CT increased physicians\u2019 ability to more confidently classify malignant tumors, which reduces the risk of misdiagnosis and unnecessary surgery for all patients, the researchers say.\n\nRadiologists and urologists have been frustrated for decades by the inability of conventional imaging tests, such as CT and MRI, to distinguish benign from malignant kidney tumors. At Johns Hopkins, multispecialty teams work together to determine the best care for patients and as partners on research innovations and quality improvement initiatives. \u201cThis collaborative venue enabled two then-residents [Drs. Michael Gorin and Steven Rowe] from different departments and specialties to design a clinical trial based on a few reports in the literature suggesting a potential role for sestamibi SPECT/CT in this diagnostic conundrum, and their hypothesis proved correct,\u201d says Mehrbod Som Javadi, MD, assistant professor of radiology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the senior author on the paper. Pamela T. Johnson, MD, associate professor of radiology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine notes, \u201cthese types of advances are critical to our precision medicine initiative, Hopkins inHealth, designed for individualized patient management, and to our mission of high-value health care, where the highest quality care is safely delivered at the lowest personal and financial cost to the patient.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs radiologists, we have struggled to find noninvasive ways to better classify patients and spare unnecessary surgery, but this has not been easy,\u201d says Steven P. Rowe, M.D., Ph.D., one of the two former residents who developed this approach, and now assistant professor of radiology and radiological science at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \u201cSestamibi SPECT/CT offers an inexpensive and widely available means of better characterizing kidney tumors, and the identical test is now being performed as part of a large trial in Sweden, for which the first results have just recently been published and appear to confirm our conclusions.\u201d\n\nAlthough further study is needed to validate the accuracy of sestamibi SPECT/CT, this test appears to be a less expensive, faster, noninvasive alternative to surgery, says Michael A. Gorin, M.D., the other resident involved in developing this approach and now chief resident with The James Buchanan Brady Urological Institute of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \u201cIn the absence of diagnostic certainty, surgeons tend to remove kidney tumors in an abundance of caution, leading to an estimated 5,600 surgically removed benign kidney tumors each year in the United States.\u201d\n\nOther authors on this paper include, Sara Sheikhbahaei, Christopher S.

The medicine, though never approved for use in the United States, led to birth defects in some 10,000 kids in Europe and Canada.\n\nIn the latest look at various treatments, the Cochrane group evaluated studies that examined both pharmaceutical and alternative techniques, including acupuncture, acupressure (a noninvasive variation of acupuncture), ginger, vitamin B-6 and conventional anti-vomiting drugs.\n\nThe studies in the review comprised more than 4,000 women who were up to 20 weeks pregnant.\n\nSounds impressive, right? But Matthews says reviewers found few high-quality studies about any treatment. Also, inconsistencies in methodology from study to study made it difficult to pool the results and draw firm conclusions.\n\nTake ginger. Matthews says different studies used different forms of ginger -- some tried ginger syrup and others used capsules -- at different doses. The comparison groups in the experiments varied as well.\n\nWhat's more, \"people tended to measure the outcomes very differently,\" Matthews says. Most focused on the symptoms of nausea and vomiting, but they measured the symptoms at different times, she says.\n\nAnd here's a biggie: There wasn't much information about adverse effects on women and babies, something everyone would certainly want to know. And there wasn't much hard data on psychological, social or economic outcomes, according to the report.\n\nAuthors of the review found some evidence that ginger, vitamin B-6 and anti-vomiting drugs relieved nausea. But Matthews says the evidence isn't strong enough to make a recommendation.\n\nAll too often, Matthews says, researchers in the field seem to forge ahead without paying enough attention to what's been done before. \"The onus is back to researchers to carry out studies that would stand up\" to rigorous review and that would build on what's already been tested.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The only source quoted in the article was an author of the study being covered.

It's a fantastic alternative to treat patients with these diseases, and this study will help doctors when they discuss [treatment options] with patients.\"\n\nBakkum-Gomez has also used the method in her practice and is conducting a study of the IUD, which was originally designed as a contraceptive device, for this purpose.\n\nAbout 3 percent to 5 percent of women who get endometrial cancer, which affects the womb lining, are under the age of 40 and will lose their fertility if they undergo a hysterectomy. The majority of these women have not yet had children, according to background information in the article.\n\nAlthough the IUD is not yet approved to treat endometrial cancer, it is approved and widely used to treat endometriosis and abnormal uterine bleeding.\n\nWhile hysterectomy or removal of the uterus is the accepted treatment for this kind of cancer, doctors have been using the hormone in oral form for the past 20 years, but only for \"well-selected groups of women,\" said Dr. Elizabeth Poynor, a gynecologic oncologist and pelvic surgeon with Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"Well selected,\" in this case, means those with early-stage disease who want to maintain their fertility, much like the group in this trial.\n\nOral hormone treatment to slow down the cancer's growth is a systemic therapy, however, and can have adverse side effects such as skin rashes, nausea and vomiting, headaches and abnormal uterine bleeding, according to background material accompanying the study.\n\nThe theoretical -- but still unproven -- advantage to this new IUD method, Poynor said, is that \"there is a lower risk of systemic side effects . . . and that you may be giving higher doses of the drug directly into the uterus.\"\n\nThe authors followed 20 Italian patients from January 1996 to June 2009 with atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH), which often precedes the cancer, and 14 women with early-stage endometrial cancer confined to the inner layer of the womb.\n\nParticipants -- all of whom were between ages 20 and 40 -- had an IUD known as Mirena, which released levonorgestrel, inserted for a year. They also received monthly injections of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which halts estrogen production, for six months.\n\nThe IUD was removed at the end of the year if there was no evidence of cancer.\n\nNinety-five percent of women with AEH initially saw their lesions disappear completely, while 57.1 percent of women with early-stage cancer also responded completely to the treatment. (The disease progressed in one of the women with AEH and four of the women with early-stage cancer.)\n\nOf the patients with AEH, four later relapsed and required further treatment; of the women with early-stage cancer, two who had an initial complete response relapsed. However, all the women were alive and seemingly cancer-free by the end of the study after further treatment (either the IUD and GnRH treatment or a hysterectomy), the study reported.\n\n\"They did show a higher recurrence or progression rate with endometrial cancer than with AEH and that is consistent with other data,\" said Bakkum-Gamez, who added that the IUD method would not be appropriate for later-stage cancers, which tend to be more aggressive.\n\nNo adverse effects from treatment were noted, according to the researchers, who declared no conflicts of interest.\n\nIn background material, the researchers stated the progestin-releasing IUD should be effective in treating AEH and also early endometrial cancer, as long as those patients were evaluated with laparoscopy, ultrasound and MRI to make sure their cancer had not spread and there was no simultaneous ovarian cancer.\n\nNine of the women in the study successfully delivered babies.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute has more on endometrial cancer.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story quotes several independent experts and notes that none had a conflict of interest.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Treating gum disease reduced symptoms of prostate inflammation, called prostatitis, report researchers from Case Western Reserve University School of Dental Medicine and the Departments of Urology and Pathology at University Hospitals Case Medical Center.\n\nPrevious studies have found a link between gum disease and prostatitis, a disease that inflames the gland that produces semen.

Current treatment options for psoriasis include topical treatments (like corticosteroids) phototherapy (using an ultraviolet light box or a laser) and systemic drugs\u2014delivered via a pill, an injection or an IV infusion\u2014that work throughout the body.\n\nSiliq is unique because it binds to the receptor of a protein called interleukin-17, a known contributor to inflammation. By blocking the receptor from being activated, it keeps the body from receiving signals that can fuel inflammatory responses and psoriasis progression. Two other psoriasis drugs currently on the market work similarly, but instead bind to the protein itself.\n\nThis small difference is significant, says Dr. Richard Fried, a member of the National Psoriasis Foundation medical board, since responses to drug treatments can vary dramatically from person to person. \u201cHaving another agent in our armamentarium that works by a different mechanism is a welcome addition and may prove beneficial to many psoriasis suffers,\u201d he says in an email. (Fried says he has no involvement with the drug or the drug company.)\n\nIn the three clinical trials considered for drug approval, more than 50% of patients who used Siliq achieved total skin clearance\u2014the ultimate goal of psoriasis treatments\u2014within a year. The most common side effects of the drug were joint and muscle pain, headache, fatigue, diarrhea, throat pain, nausea, flu, low white blood cell count, fungal infections and reactions at the injection site.\n\nThe drug also comes with a more serious warning, as well. In a total of six clinical trials totaling about 6,200 participants, six suicides were reported by people receiving Siliq. People with a history of suicide attempts or depression had an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior.\n\nBecause of these events, the labeling for Siliq will include a Boxed Warning, and the drug will only be available through a restricted REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program. In order to prescribe it, doctors must be certified with the program and must counsel patients about this risk. Patients must also agree to seek medical attention should they experience new or worsening mood changes, anxiety or suicidal thoughts.\n\nA causal association between Siliq and increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior has not been established. Fried, a dermatologist and clinical psychologist, points out that psoriasis itself can be associated with mental health problems.\n\n\u201cEffective treatment has consistently shown reduction in the incidence and severity of depression and reduced likelihood of suicide,\u201d says Fried. He adds that the data on Siliq suggests that it is not only effective in treating psoriasis, but that many patients experience improvement in anxiety and depression, as well.\n\nSiliq, like other psoriasis medications, also affects the immune system. It can raise patients\u2019 risk of infections and shouldn\u2019t be used by people with certain chronic conditions, such as Crohn\u2019s disease or active tuberculosis infections.

That was the conclusion of a new study published today in the journal Molecular Therapy Oncolytics by scientists from The Gene Editing Institute of the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute at Christiana Care Health System.\n\nThe study reports that in both tissue culture and in a mouse, tumor growth stopped and there was a dramatic decrease in the volume of existing tumors when chemotherapy was combined with CRIPSP-Cas9, which was used to disable a tumor gene known as NRF2. Previous studies have shown that the NRF2 gene controls cell functions in lung cancer tumors that helps them thwart the effect of chemotherapies that might otherwise reduce or eliminate them entirely.\n\n\"Our goal is to see if CRISPR can be used with chemotherapy to provide a safe, affordable way to give patients who are not responding to treatment at least a fighting chance against this very challenging cancer,\" said Eric Kmiec, Ph.D., the principal author of the study and the director of the Gene Editing Institute. \"We believe that finding ways to use CRISPR to improve existing treatments will lead to some of the first benefits for patients while we tackle the vital ethical issues around the use of CRISPR for edits that can be passed on through DNA. This is an exciting step in the journey of exploring the health benefits of gene editing.\"\n\nThe study was led by Pawel Bialk, research scientist at the Gene Editing Institute, the nation's only CRISPR-focused research initiative situated in a community health care system.\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Dr. Kmiec said there are chemotherapies that have helped patients achieve remission or at least live longer and enjoy a better quality of life by significantly slowing the progress of the disease. But he said some patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, the most common form of lung cancer, are resistant to chemotherapy agents used to treat the disease or develop resistance after being exposed to the drugs.\n\nDr. Kmiec said the lung cancer work reflects an approach adopted by the Gene Editing Institute to move cautiously in developing medical applications of gene editing. Based inside the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute at Christiana Care, his research team gains unique insight into the lives and needs of cancer patients and the health care professionals who care for them, which helps them to maintain a strong focus on doing what's right for patients.\n\nDr. Kmiec noted that while his team is working to move into human trials, the CRISPR application being developed for lung cancer does not involve directly editing a patient's genome --only the genes in the tumor.\n\nCRISPR stands for \"clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats.\" It was originally a defense mechanism found in bacteria that allows the bacteria to recognize and slice up the DNA of invading viruses. Scientists have learned how to manipulate this mechanism so that it essentially can be programmed to find and remove a specific sequence of DNA code--which acts like software for controlling biological activity in a cell. Cas9 is a reference to an enzyme, sometimes described as a form of \"molecular scissors,\" that is used by CRISPR to cut out a section of DNA code.\n\nDr. Kmiec said there are many efforts under way to modify CRISPR so that it can be used to not only remove or \"knock out\" a section DNA, but also to replace or \"knock in\" a new strand of code. But he said there continues to be significant safety concerns around this type of CRISPR application. He said for now, his team is focused on \"using CRISPR in its native form, which is to just cut out a section of DNA,\" and to start with applications that do not directly impact the patient's DNA. He said using CRISPR to do things like improving drug response represents the \"low-hanging fruit\" of CRISPR patient applications.\n\n\"We think it's best to start with CRISPR therapies that involve relatively conservative uses of this powerful tool,\" Dr. Kmiec said. \"This approach can also hopefully help contain costs and provide a level of safety and reliability that is reassuring for patients and increases the chance that insurance companies will provide coverage.\"\n\nDr. Kmiec said that as a CRISPR research program that treats patients from across the economic spectrum, his scientists are keenly aware of the challenges of making cutting edge medical treatments accessible and beneficial for all patients.\n\n\"This work is another significant step on the pathway to FDA approval,\" said Nicholas J. Petrelli, M.D., FACS, Bank of America endowed medical director of the Helen F.

But the technology and the dye itself were so new they had to be rigorously tested.\n\nAnd that is what brought Dr. Skovronsky, a thin and eager-looking 37-year-old, to his e-mail that recent day.\n\nFive years ago, Dr. Skovronsky, who named his company Avid in part because that is what he is, had taken a big personal and professional gamble. He left academia and formed Avid Radiopharmaceuticals, based in , to develop his radioactive dye and designed a study with patients to prove it worked.\n\nHospice patients were going to die soon and so, he reasoned, why not ask them to have scans and then brain autopsies afterward to see if the scans showed just what a pathologist would see. Some patients would be demented, others not.\n\nSome predicted his study would be impossible, if not unethical. But the F.D.A. said it wanted proof that the plaque on PET scans was the same as plaque in a brain autopsy.\n\nThe Avid study was designed to provide that proof. And the full results, contained in the e-mail message sent that day, May 14, were the moment of truth. When he saw them, Dr. Skovronsky said they were everything he had hoped for.\n\n\u201cThis is about as good as it gets,\u201d he said that day.\n\nHe went into a rotunda that serves as Avid\u2019s lunchroom to tell the company\u2019s 50 employees. \u201cThis is a big day for us,\u201d he continued. \u201cI thought about what I would say, but I have totally forgotten it.\u201d\n\nHis employees applauded. Then they had champagne in blue plastic cups.\n\nThe type of scans used in this study, PET scans, are expensive and patients have to go to a scanning center, get injected with a radioactive dye, wait for the dye to reach their brain and then have a scan.\n\nOther tests are being studied \u2014 ones that look for amyloid in cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the brain; scans that look for shrinkage of the brain in areas needed for memory and reasoning; PET scans that look for uptake of glucose, a cellular fuel, to show areas where the brain was active and where it was not. The tests, though, were not necessarily specific for Alzheimer\u2019s and none had been studied to see if they accurately predicted plaque on autopsy.\n\nEarlier this decade, two scientists at the developed an amyloid dye that while not practical for widespread use, stunned scientists by showing it seemed possible to see amyloid in a living brain.\n\nThe researchers, Chester Mathis and William Klunk, began their work two decades ago, persevering even though they had no research money. In the first 10 years, they tested more than 400 compounds. When they finally found one that seemed promising, they tested more than 300 variations.\n\n\u201cOn and on it went,\u201d Dr. Mathis said.\n\nFinally, in late 2001, they began working with collaborators in to test their dye in humans.\n\nOn 2002, the Swedish researchers injected the first Alzheimer\u2019s patient with the dye, known as Compound B, and scanned the patient\u2019s brain.\n\nIt worked, the Swedish doctors told Dr. Mathis in an excited phone call.\n\nA PET scan showed amyloid exactly where it would be expected. The Swedish doctors were convinced they were seeing actual plaque. They told Dr. Mathis it was time to celebrate.\n\nBut Dr. Mathis worried. What if the same pattern occurred in people without Alzheimer\u2019s?\n\nTwo weeks later, he got another call from Sweden. His colleagues had scanned a person without Alzheimer\u2019s. There was no sign of telltale plaques.\n\nHis sweet reward came in July 2002, when the scans were shown to an audience of 5,000 scientists at an international conference on Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThere was an audible gasp,\u201d Dr. Mathis said. \u201cThe field was taken aback.\u201d\n\nYet there was a problem. Pittsburgh Compound B used carbon 11 as its radioactive tracer. And its half-life is 20 minutes. Researchers have to make it in a cyclotron in the basement of a medical center, quickly attach it to the dye, dash over to a patient lying in a scanner, and inject it.\n\nAnd a critical question remained: Was a PET scan with the Pittsburgh dye really equivalent to a brain autopsy?\n\nMeanwhile, others, including Dr. Skovronsky, had another idea \u2014 use fluorine 18, with a half-life of about two hours. It could be made in the morning, and used that afternoon. And fluorine 18 is made routinely for two million PET scans each year.\n\nDr. Skovronsky, starting at the and then at Avid, worked with a University of Pennsylvania chemist, Hank Kung, for nine years to find and develop the radioactive dye. The university had the patent; Avid licensed it. Finally, on June 8, 2007, a patient at Johns Hopkins had a scan with their compound. Plaque lit up.\n\nMost of the time, the scans were as expected \u2014 those with Alzheimer\u2019s had lots of plaque, those with normal memories had little if any and those with mild memory impairment were in between.\n\nBut about 20 percent of people over 60 with normal memories had plaque.\n\n\u201cThen we looked more carefully,\u201d Dr. Skovronsky said. \u201cThe 20 percent who had amyloid, though they were still statistically in the normal range, did worse on every memory test than the control group.\u201d\n\nWhat, Dr. Skovronsky asked, did that mean? Were they starting to develop Alzheimer\u2019s? If so, could dementia be stalled if there were drugs to stop amyloid from accumulating?\n\nThe definition of Alzheimer\u2019s is plaque plus memory loss and other symptoms of mental decline. But what is not known because no one could follow the development of plaque before a person died, was whether people with plaque and normal memories were developing Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always assumed the pathology has been there, that the plaque has been there years before symptoms,\u201d said Dr. Steven T. DeKosky, an Alzheimer\u2019s researcher who is vice president and dean at the School of Medicine. \u201cBut we never had a way to detect plaque in living persons,\u201d he said. And so plaque in the brains of people with normal memories has been a puzzle.\n\n\u201cOver the next couple of years, we will find out what it means.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 23, 2008, Avid and two other companies, and , that are developing fluorine 18-based dyes for amyloid scans, got a pointed question from an advisory committee to the F.D.A.: How do you know that what you are seeing on scans is the same as the amyloid you see on autopsy?\n\nIt seemed impossible to answer. If researchers wait for their subjects to die before comparing scans with autopsies they can be waiting a long time.\n\nBut Avid had a plan, and the committee agreed in principle that it would work. Hospice patients would be study subjects, some with dementia, some without. All would have memory tests and brain scans. After death, their brains would be autopsied. Avid suggested that after the first 35 died, there should be enough data to know if the scans gave a true picture of the pathology. Then the F.D.A. could decide if the results were convincing enough to approve the dye for marketing.\n\nSome doctors had misgivings, wondering how they could ask people who were sick and dying to be scanned just to help Alzheimer\u2019s research. But, they found, most patients and their families agreed and said they were grateful to have been asked.\n\nThat was evident on May 19, when Dr. Skovronsky gave a lunch for patients\u2019 families in City, Ariz., to thank them for participating.\n\n\u201cIt really touched my heart to be in this,\u201d said Dorothy Wall, whose husband, Claude E. Wall, died of in Sun City on March 3.\n\n\u201cSomething bad happens, and now something good happens.\u201d\n\nLate last year, Avid saw the initial results of its hospice study \u2014 data from the first six patients. Then, as more patients were studied, the data from them were held by a company that would analyze it. Avid did not see the results until the study was completed. But those first six were encouraging.\n\nA man diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s and cancer had a scan showing no plaque. His autopsy did not show it, either. The diagnosis was wrong. Another man with and dementia had been diagnosed as having dementia solely due to Parkinson\u2019s. His scan showed amyloid. So did the autopsy. He had Alzheimer\u2019s. A woman with mild memory loss had a scan showing no amyloid. Her autopsy also found none. Three others had clinical diagnoses of Alzheimer\u2019s, confirmed by scans and autopsies.\n\nFinally, on May 14, 35 patients had been scanned and autopsied. The Avid study was complete, and the full data will be presented at the meeting next month. Other companies, still doing their studies, did not yet have data to examine.\n\nAnd Dr. Skovronsky got that e-mail message.\n\n\u201cThis is going to have a big impact on Alzheimer\u2019s disease, guys,\u201d he told his staff that day.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "There are outside sources, but they aren\u2019t used to good effect. The comment from \"Dr. Michael Weiner of the University of California, San Francisco, who is not part of the company\u2019s study and directs a federal project to study ways of diagnosing Alzheimer\u2019s\" is couched in such a way that it makes us think he could be commenting on any breakthrough that would lead to sharper detection of Alzheimer\u2019s, not necessarily this study. Did he actually review the study results? Has he seen the results of similar studies? Does this work perhaps advance his work in some way? None of that is clear. Dr. Mathis is really only used to create another eureka moment. A\u00a0good question for both Weiner and Mathis would have been, \"What is it exactly about this scan that makes you think it rises above all the other detection methods being studied? And how many years away from a clinical application are we in the best and worst case scenarios? Ten to 20 years? 20 to 30 years? Not in our lifetime?\" Nonetheless, we\u2019ll give the story the benefit of the doubt on at least approaching independent sources.

And Eliquis and Pradaxa require two pills a day, one in the morning and one in the evening, instead of the once-daily warfarin. The study included 18,201 people in 1,034 clinical sites in 39 countries and was consistent worldwide, the sponsors said. Although the study was financed by the drug makers, which raises the issue of bias, it met the gold standard for medical research as a randomized, double-blinded trial in which doctors and patients did not know who took which pill until the end. The drug acts on an enzyme that leads to blood clots.\n\nDr. Christopher B. Granger, the study\u2019s lead author and a professor of medicine at Duke University, said, \u201cI think this is a profound trial result that will have a major impact on the practice and management of patients with atrial fibrillation. It combines both greater efficacy in terms of prevention of stroke with a substantial reduction to bleeding risk, and that package is one that will be particularly compelling.\u201d\n\nWall Street has high expectations, too. The companies\u2019 stock soared after they released a brief statement about the stroke and bleeding benefits in June. Barclays Capital said the final results on Sunday were \u201cperhaps the most anticipated R.&D. event of the year.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf everything checks out,\u201d Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs said in an interview, \u201cthat will confirm in our minds that Eliquis has potential to take a majority share of the $10 billion anticoagulation market.\u201d\n\nMore than 2.6 million people have atrial fibrillation in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As many as 12 million people will have it by 2020 because of an aging population with longer life expectancy. The arrhythmia in the left upper chamber of the heart can cause slow blood flow and clots, raising the risk of stroke by four to six times on average, the government says.\n\nAs many as half of people with the condition, however, are untreated, by varying estimates. Warfarin, a cheap 60-year-old drug sold generically under the brand name Coumadin, requires frequent blood tests to monitor its active level and interacts with some other drugs and foods, including leafy greens. There is great appeal and demand for new drugs that do not vary so much and deliver the same stroke-preventing benefits.\n\nThe first new drug, Pradaxa, from the German drug maker Boehringer Ingelheim, was introduced in the United States last fall. In the first seven months on market, about four in five cardiologists and two in five primary care doctors had prescribed it to more than 250,000 people, Wa\u2019el Hashad, Boehringer\u2019s vice president for cardiovascular marketing, said in an interview last week.\n\nPradaxa inhibits thrombin, an enzyme in clot formation. Other emerging drugs block a related enzyme known as Factor Xa.\n\nXarelto, from Bayer and Johnson & Johnson, approved by the F.D.A. in July to prevent clots in hip and knee replacement surgeries, goes to an F.D.A. review panel for atrial fibrillation on Sept. 8.\n\nEliquis is scheduled to be submitted for F.D.A. review later this year. Its New York-based makers are marketing powerhouses with the top two best-selling drugs in the world, Lipitor from Pfizer and Plavix from Bristol-Myers Squibb.

When the tumors are then surgically removed, most people live five years or more, in striking contrast to patients whose cancers are found only after they experience symptoms.\n\nThe study of nearly 32,000 people in eight countries boosts hope that early detection by CAT scans may reduce the death toll of lung cancer, much as mammography has done for breast cancer. But while the research clearly shows that the interval between diagnosis and death was longer in screened patients, it does not definitively show they lived longer -- a subtle difference with significant public health consequences.\n\nLung cancer kills about 162,000 Americans a year and is the leading cause of cancer death in men and women. Only 15 percent of people with the disease survive five years from the time it is diagnosed.\n\nWhat it will take to prove that CAT scans are either useful or a waste of time and money is a matter of great controversy.\n\nSome people, including many treatment advocates, think there is enough evidence to urge all heavy smokers to have routine CAT scans. Others, including researchers and policymakers in the government, say it is a question that will not be settled for five or six years, when other studies are complete.\n\nThe new research, which appears in today's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, seems destined to heat up that argument.\n\n\"I think it provides valuable information on many things. What it doesn't do is prove that you can reduce the number of people who will die from lung cancer,\" said Gary J.

I think we have enough data to move forward and apply this to a high-risk population.\"\n\nIn 1994, the study, called the International Early Lung Cancer Action Program, began screening smokers and former smokers, as well as a few nonsmokers exposed to radon, beryllium and other cancer-causing substances.\n\nIn all, 31,567 people were screened. In the ensuing years, about 27,000 more scans were done, with some people having them annually. All were \"spiral\" or \"helical\" CAT scans in which the machine films the entire chest in the time that a person can hold a single breath.\n\nAbout 13 percent of the baseline scans and 5 percent of the later ones found abnormalities. Many of these lump-shaped masses were watched with further scans to see whether they grew; others were examined with other imaging devices. Ultimately, 535 were biopsied to see if they were lung cancer -- and 484 were.\n\nOf that group, 85 percent had small tumors that had not spread.

About 70 percent of smokers give up the daunting effort during the first week of trying.\n\nThe researchers, led by Caryn Lerman, a professort of psychiatry, divided 1,246 subjects into slow metabolizers of nicotine and normal metabolizers of the addictive chemical, based on the length of time it took for them to rid their bodies of the drug. The ratio of two metabolites, or byproducts, of the body's processing of nicotine allows easy identification of the two groups. The metabolite is found in blood and saliva.\n\nThe results of the comparison showed that slow metabolizers did just as well on a nicotine patch or the drug varenicline (marketed as Chantix), a drug that works on the nicotine receptors in the brain. But the patch costs less and has fewer side-effects than varenicline (including nausea, difficulty sleeping and abnormal dreams), so the researchers concluded that slow metabolizers should be put on the patch.\n\nNormal metabolizers of nicotine, meanwhile, had more success with varenicline because they tend to rid their systems of nicotine faster, limiting the effectiveness of the patch. Varenicline contains no nicotine.\n\n\"The slower metabolizers, they do very well with the patch.

Vad, a sports medicine specialist at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan, compares the problem to a thermostat in a cool room. \u201cIf it\u2019s 65 degrees in the house, but the thermostat thinks it\u2019s 50 degrees, the heat keeps running,\u201d Dr. Vad said.\n\nThe condition, complex regional pain syndrome, or C.R.P.S., typically develops after a medical procedure or an accident. But even minor injuries, like a sprain from a fall, can cause it. The syndrome may follow 5 percent of all injuries, according to the Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Association, an advocacy group for people with chronic pain.\n\nSpinal cord stimulation works by implanting an electrode near the spinal cord, inserted through the same place where epidural pain relief is injected for women in labor. Electrical pulses scramble or block the pain signals traveling through the nervous system, preventing them from reaching the brain.\n\nBut spinal cord stimulators offer significant relief to only about half the patients who try them. In September, the journal Pain published the largest-ever clinical trial of spinal cord stimulators, comparing their use with conventional pain therapies, including drugs, nerve blocks and physical therapy. The study, which was financed by the implant maker Medtronic, followed 100 patients who had undergone spinal surgery and had developed chronic pain in one or both legs.\n\nEvery patient received conventional pain treatment, but half were also given a spinal cord implant. Pain fell by half for 48 percent of the implant patients but only 9 percent of the others.\n\nThe implants cost about $20,000, and the procedure, hospital care and follow-up can bring the total bill to about $40,000. In August, the medical journal Neurosurgery showed that spinal cord implants were far cheaper than additional operations to treat pain.\n\nAnother concern is that patients who require high doses of stimulation drain the battery quickly, requiring surgery to replace the device. New rechargeable versions of the stimulators have helped resolve that concern.\n\nFor some patients, relief is only temporary, and the pain returns. Doctors say simple adjustments to the device may solve that problem.\n\n\u201cSometimes efficacy wanes over time, but I still believe in them,\u201d said Dr. Kaufman, also an assistant professor of anesthesiology at the New Jersey Medical School. \u201cWhen drugs don\u2019t work, what else is there?\u201d", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story provides a good mix of sources, including one patient and three pain experts (one of whom relates the story of a dissatisfied patient).

Using HIFU, doctors can focus on treating only the cancer cells on the prostate while causing minimal damage to the surrounding tissue. Unlike more common and invasive treatments such as radiotherapy and surgical removal of the prostate gland, HIFU may be able to avoid side effects like urine leakage and impotence.\n\nThe new study, designed as a proof-of-concept study, involved just 41 men. Doctors used MRI and mapping biopsies to locate the cancerous tissues. They then focused high-energy sound waves on the affected area, causing the cancer cells to heat up to around 80\u00b0C, which kills the cells. None of the patients reported urinary incontinence a year after treatment, and only 1 in 10 suffered from poor erections. Overall, about 95% of the men were cancer-free after a full year following the trial.\n\n\u201cThe signal from this study is quite strong,\u201d study author Hashim Ahmed, a urologist at the University College London, told Bloomberg. \u201cWhen you look at the current standard of care, there\u2019s a 1-in-3, or 1-in-2 chance of having the perfect outcome. In this study, after 12 months, it\u2019s a 9-in-10 chance.\u201d\n\nThe men in the study were aged 45 to 80 with medium- to high-risk cancer, and would likely have undergone surgery or radiotherapy down the line. Men who had already received chemotherapy, hormone treatment or radiation therapy were excluded from the study. The procedure was carried out under general anesthesia and most of the patients had hospital stays of less than 24 hours after the treatment.\n\n\u201cFocal therapy of individual prostate-cancer lesions, regardless of whether they are multifocal or unifocal, leads to a low rate of genitourinary side-effects and an encouraging rate of early freedom from clinically significant prostate cancer,\u201d the authors concluded in the study.\n\nProstate cancer is the most common cancer among men. The National Cancer Institute estimates 241,740 new cases of prostate cancer this year in the U.S. and 28,170 deaths.\n\nAhmed told Bloomberg that HIFU may also be cheaper than other standard treatments, noting that the cost of the MRI and mapping was an estimated $2,400, plus about $1,600 for HIFU; in comparison, removing the prostate costs about $7,100. Fewer side effects would also lower other health care costs, he said.\n\nThe researchers are now recruiting more patients and seeking funding for larger studies. While the initial results were promising, they need to be replicated; HIFU also needs to be studied long-term and compared with other therapies. If the technology holds up, it could also work for other cell-based cancers like breast, thyroid, pancreas and liver, Ahmed said.\n\nThe study was published Tuesday in the journal The Lancet Oncology.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "No independent sources were quoted \u2013 only the lead researcher.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "With the FDA's announcement, drugs like pembrolizumab have also begun to change the way that physicians, patients and government regulators think of cancer.

The group numbers about 7,500 patients a year in the United States.\n\nThe one-time infusion, known as CAR T-cell therapy, is made by Kite Pharma, which is based in Santa Monica, Calif., and recently was bought by Gilead Sciences for $11.9 billion. Kite announced Wednesday that the treatment's brand name will be Yescarta and its price will be $373,000.\n\nIn late August, the FDA cleared the first CAR T-cell therapy, which is designed for children and young adults whose leukemia doesn't respond to standard treatments. About 600 patients in the United States fall into that category every year. Kymriah, which costs $475,000, is manufactured by Novartis.\n\nBiotech analysts had expected the Kite price to be lower than Kymriah's, in part because the number of eligible patients is larger and the response rates are lower. Even so, Yescarta's cost is likely to stoke the ongoing debate about high drug prices.\n\nThe FDA approval is the latest step forward for the fast-moving field of immunotherapy, which aims to bolster the immune system to attack malignancies. CAR T-cell therapies are among several approaches, along with treatments called checkpoint inhibitors and cancer vaccines, but they have recently grabbed much of the attention. Dozens of other companies also are working on them.\n\n\u201cToday, marks another milestone in the development of a whole new scientific paradigm for the treatment of serious diseases,\u201d FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement, adding that the approval demonstrates \u201cthe continued momentum of this promising new area of medicine.\u201d\n\nA CAR T-cell therapy involves a complicated and customized procedure in which T cells \u2014 sometimes called the foot soldiers of the immune system \u2014 are removed from the patient. They are sent to a special lab and genetically modified to target a protein on the surface of the patient's cancer cells. Once the modified cells are returned to the patient, their numbers expand exponentially as they become an army of cancer fighters.\n\nIn 2015, Marie Miceli was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma at Siteman Cancer Center in St. Louis, which is jointly owned by Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine. She received chemo and underwent a bone-marrow transplant. Neither worked.\n\n\u201cThe doctors were saying, 'Go see an attorney and get your life in order,' \" the 64-year-old Realtor recalled. Then they offered her a slot in Kite's clinical trial, a last-resort effort. \u201cI could feel it when they put those T cells back in,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the craziest feeling in the world.\u201d When she was checked a month later, she said, her cancer was gone. It hasn't returned.\n\nKite's \u201cvein-to-vein\u201d turnaround period \u2014 from cell extraction to reinfusion \u2014 is about 17 days, according to Frederick Locke, an oncologist at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa and co-leader of the Kite trial.\n\nThe FDA said the safety and efficacy of Yescarta were established in a multi-center trial of more than 100 adults with large B-cell lymphoma. An independent review committee found that 72 percent of patients treated with a single infusion responded to therapy, including 51 percent who then showed no evidence of remaining cancer. Kite has said that at six months, 44 percent of patients were still responding, with 39 percent having no sign of cancer.\n\n\u201cThis is not just an incremental benefit,\u201d said David Chang, Kite's chief medical officer. \u201cIt raises the potential that a cure can be possible.\u201d Some of the first patients who underwent treatment now have been in remission for three to five years, he said, although he cautioned that it's still too early to know whether those patients are cured.\n\nLocke said about 13 percent of patients in the trial had a severe side effect known as cytokine release syndrome, which produces high fevers, low blood pressure and other flulike symptoms. Twenty-eight percent had neurological \u201cevents,\u201d such as severe confusion; three patients died of complications caused by the treatment.\n\n\u201cThese are patients who knew they were out of options,\u201d he said, noting that lymphoma patients who relapse or don't respond to treatment have just a 50 percent chance of surviving for six months.\n\nBecause of the side effects, the treatment will carry a boxed warning, the FDA's most serious. In addition, the agency is requiring hospitals and clinics that dispense Yescarta to be certified after undergoing special training.\n\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults. This type of cancer begins in the immune system and can be fast- or slow-growing, the FDA noted.\n\nKite's CAR T-cell product was developed years ago at the National Cancer Institute by pioneering scientist Steven Rosenberg and licensed to the company for commercialization.\n\nArmin Ghobadi, an oncologist at Siteman who was an investigator in the Kite trial, said the new treatment is \u201cjust the first step\u201d and that researchers are working to make it safer and more effective.

It\u2019s the weekly rock climbers and double spin class-takers schvitzing their Sunday away. These weekend warriors cram the recommended amount of exercise into one or two days, while the rest of us faithfully head to the gym multiple times a week for a half-hour hamster run on the treadmill.\n\nRelated: Americans keep getting fatter, new report shows\n\nA paper published January 9 in JAMA Internal Medicine suggests these warriors may be onto something. In a study based on nearly 64,000 adults, researchers in the U.K. found that weekend exercise appears to be just as effective at preventing heart disease and cancer as exercise done more frequently. This is great news for anyone who feels too busy on weekdays to work out but enjoys outdoor activity on the weekend.\n\n\u201cI think that the weekend warrior physical activity pattern is beneficial because they are actually doing a large proportion of vigorous intensity activity. And vigorous activity makes you fit, and fitness reduces your risk of disease and death,\u201d says Gary O\u2019Donovan, a researcher in physical activity and sedentary behavior at England\u2019s Loughborough University and lead author of the paper.\n\nO\u2019Donovan and fellow researchers looked at data on middle-aged adults who responded to a government-sponsored household survey conducted from 1994 to 2012. The survey included questions about health history and fitness habits. The researchers then cross-referenced this information with health department death records.\n\nThey found the risk of death from all causes was about 30 percent lower for weekend warriors, compared with adults who maintained a sedentary lifestyle. And the warriors had a 40 percent lower risk of cardiovascular death and an 18 percent lower risk for cancer-related death. The mortality rates of weekend warriors were roughly the same as those who claimed to exercise more than two days a week but for shorter durations.\n\nHowever, there are also some limitations to this study, the researchers say. More than 90 percent of the subjects were white. The information about physical activity was reported by the participants, and it\u2019s likely that many were too generous in their estimates of how much time they spent at the gym. Unfortunately, taking 20 minutes in locker room to put on your sneakers doesn\u2019t count as a workout.\n\nRelated: Severe childhood obesity is on the rise in the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s recommended that people get 150 minutes (or two and half hours) of exercise each week, based on guidelines from the American Heart Association, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other medical authorities. This could be something as simple as a brisk walk or other low-impact options for vigorous exercise about 20 minutes a day. (Experts often encourage recreational athletes to not exercise more than an hour a day.) \u201cIn theory, someone who did one bout of 150 minutes of moderate exercise is a weekend warrior,\u201d says O\u2019Donovan.\n\nThis study shows that it doesn\u2019t matter how you decide to split up the recommended weekly amount of exercise. You just need to do it.\n\nHowever, experts caution that it is possible to overdo it, and more exercise than two and a half hours a week can actually be unhelpful and even harmful. One study, published in 2014 in the journal Heart, suggests that in people with existing heart disease, the risk for cardiac arrest and stroke was the same for people who exercised more than an hour a day compared with those who didn\u2019t exercise at all. The coronary heart disease patients who stuck with the recommended 150 minutes a week had the lowest risk for heart attack and stroke.\n\nRelated: Post-workout cold immersion likely won\u2019t help you heal\n\nThere are risks that come with a weekend warrior exercise schedule, especially for people who aren\u2019t used to being active. \u201cI would be more concerned about what\u2019s happening at the point of exercise\u2014not the long-term benefits,\u201d says Dr. Howard Andrew Selinger, chair of family medicine at Quinnipiac University.

The presentation has taken place within the framework of the annual meeting of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) that has been held from the 29th of April to the 3rd of May in Honolulu, Hawaii.\n\nThe purpose if this meeting is to share the latest breakthroughs in research in the area of ophthalmology, to contribute to the progress in basic science and also in cutting-edge clinical research. In this context, Sylentis has participated at this event presenting the pre-clinical and clinical results of various compounds that are being developed for the treatment of ocular disorders. Among these, the abstract \"Tivanisiran a new treatment for Dry Eye Disease, that improved signs and symptoms in clinical trials\" (Posterboard number: 925 - B0103) is highlighted, the compound improving the ocular inflammatory parameters, tear quality and a reduction in ocular pain associated with dry eye disease is also underlined1.\n\nThe novel mechanism of action of tivanisiran, based on genetic silencing through RNA interference (RNAi), is targeted at the treatment of the signs and symptoms of this pathology, making it a firm candidate for the treatment of dry eye disease.\n\nAccording to Ana Isabel Jim\u00e9nez, Director of R&D at Sylentis, \"we trust in our technology, innovative in this field, and we hope that tivanisiran will soon become a real alternative for the treatment of millions of people that suffer dry eye disease around the world.\"\n\nIn this respect, Jim\u00e9nez points out that \"this is a significant step forward in the development of innovative drugs in different therapeutic areas through a novel technology of genetic silencing based on the RNA.\"\n\nSylentis is a pioneer in RNAi research, and is one of the few in Europe that applies this technology to the field of ophthalmology. It also continues with its research on new therapies for ophthalmological and inflammatory illnesses.\n\nIt must be empathized that this pathology affects more than 5 million in Spain, between 10% and 20% of the population, mostly women, and almost 100% of these being elderly , . In this context, the phase III \"Helix\" study is being carried out in more than 30 hospitals in Spain, Germany, Estonia, Portugal, Slovakia and Italy, in 300 patients to evaluate the efficacy of this compound in the treatment of the sign and symptoms of dry eye syndrome.\n\nTivanisiran is a drug based on RNAi that is administered as preservative-free eye drops; it selectively inhibits production of the transient receptor potential cation channel (TRPV1). These receptors are ion channels that mediate the transmission of ocular pain. Tivanisiran is a small synthetic double-stranded RNA oligonucleotide (siRNA) with a novel and highly selective mechanism of action. Non-clinical studies conducted by Sylentis with SYL1001 have demonstrated it has high ability to inhibit this specific target and block the perception of ocular pain in animals3.\n\nTivanisiran is a product under development for the treatment of signs and symptoms related to dry eye syndrome and has the potential to be developed for other pathologies that cause ocular pain (corneal lesions, refractive surgery, etc.) , , .\n\nRNA interference (RNAi) is a natural cellular process that regulates the expression of certain genes, providing a role in innate defense and development in animals and plants. This process is used to specifically silence genetic transcripts that encode protein-causing diseases. The therapeutic application of targeted siRNAs is booming given the specificity of gene silencing for a particular protein in a given tissue and the lack of side effects. This new approach to drug discovery is a promising technology that is rapidly moving in the translational research space , .\n\nDry eye syndrome is a multifactorial disease of the tear film and ocular surface that produces symptoms of ocular discomfort, eyesight disorders, and tear film instability with potential damage to the ocular surface. Dry eye syndrome is accompanied by such symptoms as ocular pain, itching, stinging, and irritation of the eye tissues. It is a characteristic disease of developed countries, associated with pollution, air conditioning, the use of contact lenses, refractive surgery and continued use of computers. Moreover, the amount and quality of tears decrease with age. Prevalence is between 10% and 20% among people aged 50 or over, and it is more frequent in womeni,ii.\n\nDry eye can be treated with cyclosporin drops or autologous serum, but there is as yet no specific product for chronic treatment of the ocular pain related to dry eye syndrome; oral analgesics or anaesthetics are used in general. However, the main treatment consists of artificial tears, in the form of drops, gel or creams. Preservative-free eye drops have generally been found to offer the best long-term response.\n\nSylentis, a company of PharmaMar (MSE:PHM), is a biotechnology company fully owned that develops innovative therapies harnessing the technology of post-transcriptional gene silencing or RNA interference (RNAi). Sylentis has developed an approach to efficiently design RNAi-based therapeutics that can be used to silence numerous disease-causing genes. We currently have a robust therapeutic program in ophthalmology with two candidates under development in Phase II and III studies for glaucoma (bamosiran) and ocular pain (SYL1001) , respectively.

Currently many women with a gene mutation choose surgical removal of their breast tissue and ovaries to reduce their chance of developing breast and ovarian cancer.\n\nBy pinpointing the cells that give rise to breast cancers in women who have inherited a faulty version of the BRCA1 gene, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute researchers have identified that the drug denosumab may have potential to prevent breast cancer from developing. If confirmed in clinical studies, this would provide a non-surgical option to prevent breast cancer in women with elevated genetic risk.\n\nUsing samples of breast tissue donated by women carrying a faulty BRCA1 gene, Ms Emma Nolan, Professor Jane Visvader and Professor Geoff Lindeman were able to pinpoint the cells that give rise to breast cancer. The research, which also involved researchers at the Australian familial cancer consortium kConFab and US biotechnology company Amgen was published today in Nature Medicine.\n\nCancer precursor cells in BRCA1-mutant breast tissue had many similarities to aggressive forms of breast cancer, said Ms Nolan, who is a PhD student at the institute enrolled through The University of Melbourne's Department of Medical Biology. \"These cells proliferated rapidly, and were susceptible to damage to their DNA - both factors that help them transition towards cancer,\" she said. \"We were excited to discover that these pre-cancerous cells could be identified by a marker protein called RANK.\"\n\nProfessor Lindeman, who is also a medical oncologist at The Royal Melbourne Hospital, said the discovery of RANK as a marker of cancer precursors was an important breakthrough, because inhibitors of the RANK signalling pathway were already in clinical use. \"An inhibitor called denosumab is already used in the clinic to treat osteoporosis and breast cancer that has spread to the bone,\" he said. \"We therefore investigated what effect RANK inhibition had on the cancer precursor cells in BRCA1-mutant breast tissue.\"\n\nThe research team showed that RANK inhibition switched off cell growth in breast tissue from women with a faulty BRCA1 gene and curtailed breast cancer development in laboratory models.\n\n\"We think this strategy could delay or prevent breast cancer in women with an inherited BRCA1 gene mutation,\" Professor Lindeman said. \"A clinical trial has already begun to investigate this further.\"\n\n\"This is potentially a very important discovery for women who carry a faulty BRCA1 gene, who have few other options. Current cancer prevention strategies for these women include surgical removal of the breasts and/or ovaries, which can have serious impacts on people's lives. To progress this work, denosumab would need to be formally tested in clinical trials in this setting as it is not approved for breast cancer prevention,\" Professor Lindeman said.\n\nProfessor Visvader said the discovery had its basis in more than a decade of investigations of breast stem cell function. \"By thoroughly dissecting how normal breast tissue develops, we have been able to pinpoint the precise cells that are the culprits in cancer formation,\" she said. \"It is very exciting to think that we may be on the path to the 'holy grail' of cancer research, devising a way to prevent this type of breast cancer in women at high genetic risk.\"\n\nThe research team worked closely with Mrs Avis Macphee, a patient advocate, through the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute's consumer-researcher buddy system.

She's a breast surgery fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.\n\nThe study also found a significant percentage of women would qualify for other breast screening methods, including breast MRI and genetic testing, Plichta said.\n\n\"We believe formal risk assessment is essential for women ages 40 to 44 in order to identify those who require screening mammography to start at the age of 40, and those who would qualify for screening MRIs and genetic testing,\" Plichta said.\n\nPlichta was to present her team's findings Thursday at the American Society of Breast Surgeons annual meeting in Dallas. Findings presented at meetings are generally viewed as preliminary until they've been published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nThe analysis was designed to look at new breast cancer screening guidelines from the American Cancer Society and the American Society of Breast Surgeons.\n\nThe cancer society updated its guidelines in 2015, recommending that women could wait until age 45 to start receiving annual mammograms. Previously, the cancer society had recommended yearly screenings starting at age 40.\n\nThe American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBS) subsequently changed its guidelines to mirror the new cancer society recommendation, Plichta said.

However, they also say that women should talk to their doctors about risk factors that could lead them to start breast cancer screening earlier.\n\nThe new study involved more than 900 women. None had been diagnosed with breast cancer.

One group was given 225mg of the drug twice a day for 12 weeks and the other participants were assigned to a placebo group. Fevipiprant and the placebo were added to the medications the participants were already taking.\n\nThe study was designed primarily to examine the effects on inflammation in the airway by measuring the sputum eosinophil count.\n\nThe sputum eosinophil is an inflammation measurement of a white blood cell that increases in asthma and is used to assess the severity of this condition.\n\nPeople who do not have asthma have a percentage of less than one and those with moderate-to-severe asthma typically have a reading of about five per cent.\n\nThe rate in people with moderate-to-severe asthma taking the medication was reduced from an average of 5.4 percent to 1.1 percent over 12 weeks, according to the study published today in the prestigious The Lancet Respiratory Medicine journal.\n\nProfessor Christopher Brightling, who is a NIHR Senior Research Fellow and Clinical Professor in Respiratory Medicine at the University of Leicester, led the study at the NIHR Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit, which is based at the Glenfield Hospital in Leicester.\n\nProfessor Brightling said: \"A unique feature of this study was how it included measurements of symptoms, lung function using breathing tests, sampling of the airway wall and CT scans of the chest to give a complete picture of how the new drug works.\n\n\"Most treatments might improve some of these features of disease, but with Fevipiprant improvements were seen with all of the types of tests.\n\n\"We already know that using treatments to target eosinophilic airway inflammation can substantially reduce asthma attacks.\n\n\"This new treatment, Fevipiprant, could likewise help to stop preventable asthma attacks, reduce hospital admissions and improve day-to-day symptoms- making it a 'game changer' for future treatment.\"\n\nGaye Stokes from Grantham in Lincolnshire has had severe asthma for 16 years.

When a person with asthma comes into contact with something that irritates their sensitive airways it causes the body to react in several ways which can include wheezing, coughing and can make breathing more difficult.\n\nThe NIHR Leicester Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit - a partnership between the University of Leicester and Leicester's Hospitals - focuses on promoting the development of new and effective therapies for the treatment of respiratory diseases including severe asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\nThis is the technical name for the five year Europe-wide, EU funded project, which aimed to produce computer and physical models of the whole human airway system for people with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\nAirPROM has demonstrated how an integrated approach, involving modelling, measurement and clinical validation, can accelerate the development of new therapies and improve existing methods.\n\nAirPROM is led by the University of Leicester and coordinated by Professor Brightling.\n\nIf media wish to link to the paper once it's published, they can use the following link, which will go live when the embargo lifts: http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(16)30179-5/abstract", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The release gets credit for including the funding sources of the study \u2014 Novartis Pharmaceuticals, the National Institute for Health Research in the UK, and the European Union \u2014 but it fails to point out any of the linkages among the study\u2019s authors to pharmaceutical firms.

He got cancer researchers so excited, some are already testing it out on laboratory animals.\n\nWhen 60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl first met Kanzius, he told us he didn't have a background in science or medicine; he didn't even have a college degree.\n\nWhat he did have was a deadly form of leukemia and a determination to use whatever time he had left to come up with a better way to treat the disease.\n\nUsing his wife's pie pans and what he knew best - radios - Kanzius, a former radio executive, built a machine in his garage that he hoped would zap cancer cells without the horrible side effects you get with chemotherapy and radiation.\n\n60 Minutes decided to keep track of Kanzius and his invention, so we followed him for over a year, as he pushed to speed up the research on his machine and fought to slow down his own cancer, which was killing him.\n\nWhen Stahl first met Kanzius in January 2008, he was finishing his 36th round of chemotherapy since being diagnosed with terminal leukemia. All that chemo had been keeping him alive, barely.\n\nApril 2008: The Kanzius Machine\n\nMD Cancer Center: Have questions about cancer?\n\nJohn Kanzius Research Foundation: Learn more about the research.\n\nHe said the leukemia was getting him mentally and physically. \"And I didn't think that one could feel this bad and still be alive as I did back in January.\"\n\nBut we were surprised by how healthy he seemed seven months later, in August 2008, when we visited with him and his wife Marianne at their home in Erie, Pa.\n\n\"I must say you look like a completely different person to me. You look energetic. And you've gained some weight, am I right?\" Stahl remarked.\n\n\"You're right about all of them,\" Kanzius replied.\n\nSo great, he had spent the summer outside doing things he hadn't been able to do since he'd been diagnosed with cancer six years earlier, like playing 18 holes of golf a day. What happened?\n\n\"I decided it was time to turn the switch on and try it\u2026Try treating myself,\" he explained. \"Got in the machine, adjusted it, and turned it on for a minute the first time. And [I] didn't feel anything strange.\"\n\nHe had turned himself into a human guinea pig.\n\n\"I've done it nine times,\" Kanzius told Stahl. \"Nine times and my blood work has improved all summer long. We're on vacation right now from cancer, I don't know whether it's a permanent leave but we're on vacation right now.\n\n\"Now that you feel so good, you feel great, you look good, do you have a constant worry that this is too good to be true kind of thing?\" Stahl asked.\n\n\"Sure. I mean, you wonder when the bubble's going to break,\" Kanzius admitted.\n\nSo even though he had been feeling good for awhile, he admitted there was always fear his disease could take a turn for the worse. \"The disease is relentless. It just keeps pushing and pushing and pushing.\"\n\nIt was that relentlessness of leukemia that had given Kanzius the idea to build his radio wave machine in the first place. When 60 Minutes met him back then, he showed Stahl how the radio waves - transmitted across a small field - created enough energy to light up a fluorescent bulb.\n\nWhen moving a fluorescent bulb into the force field, the bulb lit up.\n\nHe then wanted to show us that radio waves are harmless to humans, and even moved his hand back and forth into the force field. \"Nothing happens,\" he told Stahl.\n\nBut he knew that radio waves can heat up metal. So he wondered: if he injected a cancerous tumor with some kind of metal, would radio waves heat up the metal and cook the cancer cells to death, and only the cancer cells? He tried it out on a hot dog, injecting it with a metal solution.\n\nHe took a probe, and placed it into an injection site on the hot dog. When he turned the device on, the temperature went up in that one area where the metal was and nowhere else.\n\nKanzius thought he had discovered a way to attack cancer cells without the collateral damage caused by standard treatments like chemotherapy and radiation. \"I said 'Eureka, I've done it,'\" Kanzius remembered.\n\nHe managed to intrigue Dr. Steven Curley, a liver cancer surgeon at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.\n\nDr. Curley thought there was so much promise in Kanzius' invention, he began conducting his own research with the machine, using tiny bits of gold nano-particles that are so small, thousands of them can be injected into a single cancer cell. The radio waves then heat up the gold, which kills the cancer.

The proof-of-feasibility test lasted 90 days. \"At the end,\" said Bush, of Columbus, Ohio, \"I was walking down the hallway. To me, it was monumental.\" A video of him walking with and without the system can be found at: https:/ .\n\nMcGlynn, 69, of North Royalton, Ohio, could walk with a cane, but not easily. With the technology switched on, he covered far more ground and his pace was twice as fast during his 30-week study.\n\n\"It's helped with balance and confidence,\" said McGlynn, who used to tread a lot of stairs maintaining equipment at a steel plant. \"I'm confident now that I can walk without stumbling and falling.\" A video of him walking with and without aid of the system can be found here: https:/ .\n\nNathan Makowski, an investigator at the Cleveland FES Center, created by Case Western Reserve and the Cleveland VA, said that FES technology has been used primarily for therapy in stroke patients in the past. \"This, though, is a more long-term assistive system,\" he said.\n\nThe researchers hope these studies will lay the foundation for implanted systems that restore some independence to people with MS or who have suffered a stroke.\n\nTheir numbers are substantial. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society estimates that more than 2.3 million people have the disease worldwide. Surveys have found that 93 percent suffer gait impairment within 10 years of diagnosis and 13 percent report they are unable to walk twice a week. Other research has found that 6 million to 7 million people live with stroke nationally and nearly 30 percent require assistance to walk.\n\n\"In both cases, there is a disconnect between the brain and muscles,\" said Stephen Selkirk, MD, a neurologist at the VA's Spinal Cord Injury Division and assistant professor of neurology at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine. \"This system replaces the lost connection.\"\n\nThe system includes implanted electrodes that tie into nerves that control muscles collectively, called hip and knee flexors and ankle dorsoflexors. In healthy people, the muscles work in seamless coordination each step they take.\n\nWhen Bush or McGlynn walks, he pushes a button on an external controller, which sends signals to a pulse generator, which then sends electrical pulses to the electrodes. The pulses stimulate the nerves, which in turn stimulate the muscles in both of Bush's legs and McGlynn's left leg.\n\n\"Both guys were taking steps the first time we turned the systems on,\" said Ron Triolo, a professor of orthopaedics and biomedical engineering at Case Western Reserve and executive director of the Advanced Platform Technology (APT) Center. \"When Robert Bush took a step, it wasn't' pretty, but we saw the potential.\"\n\nIn each patient, \"the pulses are sent in a pattern that is close to how normal muscles work,\" said Rudi Kobetic, a principal investigator at the Stokes Cleveland VA and APT Center. \"We try to time the pattern to stimulation so that it's integrated with their ability. Similar to regular physical therapy, we can see results.\"\n\nBoth men gained strength and endurance through repeated use of the systems and fine-tuning by the researchers.\n\nBush went from the two steps to consistently walking more than 30 yards during the trial. In that time, he used a walker to help maintain his balance.\n\n\"When they turned it on the first time, I was surprised how well it worked,\" said Bush, who had to give up his construction career due to the disease. \"I lifted my knee like I was high-stepping. Once we got it fine-tuned and I got walking, I thought it was amazing. I still think it's amazing.\"\n\nMcGlynn's gait became noticeably more symmetrical and energetic, the researchers said. His gait without the system was about 19 yards per minute; with the system, 47 yards per minute. Training with the system improved McGlynn's speed when it was turned off to 23 yards per minute, indicating therapeutic benefit.\n\n\"Distance is a challenge,\" he said. Initially, he could walk 83 yards but improved to 1,550 yards--nearly a mile--at the faster gait. \"I work up a good sweat and that makes me feel good,\" he said.\n\nDue to his improvements, the research team is developing a system that McGlynn can use at home and outside.\n\n\"I'll be able to walk for exercise and hopefully be able to walk into church and into a restaurant,\" McGlynn said.\n\nWhen Bush's trial ended, surgeons removed his implanted electrodes. The researchers are seeking funding to fit him with a permanent FES system in a clinical trial.\n\nIn the meantime, Bush is now back to using a wheelchair but working to maintain his strength and flexibility, repeatedly standing and sitting while holding onto a rail or standing for long periods of time. \"I'm keeping things ready for when they get the green light,\" he said.\n\nOther researchers who contributed to the two studies are the APT Center's Lisa Lombardo, physical therapist; Kevin Foglyano, biomedical engineer; and Gilles Pinault, MD, a surgeon and co-director of the center.", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The release doesn\u2019t note the funders but they are listed on the sidebar of EurekAlert!, a host site for the news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "(Boston)--Despite the continued controversy surrounding the use of testosterone in men who have testosterone deficiency (hypogonadism), a new study has found that long-term use of testosterone therapy not only improves vigor and vitality, but may reduce the risk of death due to cardiovascular (CV) disease.\n\nThese findings appear online in the Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology and Therapeutics.\n\nTestosterone (T) is the primary male sex hormone. In men, T plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass and growth of body hair. In addition, T is essential for overall health and well-being and for the prevention of osteoporosis. Insufficient levels of circulating T in men, contributes to frailty and bone loss.\n\nIn the absence of large, prospective, placebo-controlled clinical trials of longer duration, substantial evidence regarding the safety and risk of testosterone therapy (TTh) with regard to cardiovascular outcomes can only be gleaned from observational studies. To date, there are limited studies comparing the effects of long-term TTh in hypogonadal men who were treated or remained untreated with T.\n\nResearchers at Boston University Schools of Medicine (BUSM) and Public Health (BUSPH), along with researchers in Germany, established a registry to assess long-term effectiveness and safety of T in men. For this study, they sought to compare its effects on a host of parameters (obesity, cholesterol levels, diabetes, liver function) considered to contribute to cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe researchers followed a group of men for eight years who had been on TTh and compared them with another group of men who remained untreated for the same time period. They found there were only two deaths in the TTh group and neither was related to CV events. In the non-treated control group, there were 21 deaths, 19 of which were related to CV events. Furthermore, there were 26 non-fatal myocardial infarctions and 30 non-fatal strokes in the control group but none in the T-treated group.\n\nAccording to the researchers, long-term TTh in men with hypogonadism appears to be an effective approach to achieve sustained improvements in cardiometabolic function and reduces the risk of CV events. \"The low CV events observed in the T-group compared to the untreated (control) group strongly suggest that TTh is protective. We believe that the protective effect of T on the CV system provides clinicians with the opportunity to utilize this approach for secondary prevention for hypogonadal men with a history of CV events,\" explained corresponding author Abdulmaged M.

But these \u201cextended criteria\u201d organs \u2013 those from older donors or from donors who have two or more risk factors - do not tolerate current \u201ccold storage\u201d methods for organ preservation well.\n\nThis can result in greater injury to the kidney, or in a \u201csleepy kidney\u201d which functions poorly at the beginning, requiring dialysis until it recovers days or weeks later. This early delayed function also impacts its longer-term survival.\n\nIn Ontario, about 20 per cent of all transplanted kidneys are expanded criteria donor kidneys. This means donors are on average older than 60 years, or younger than 60 years and likely have hypertension, higher BMI (body mass index), diabetes, or died due to stroke.\n\nEx vivo organ perfusion is an innovative organ preservation technique that seeks to overcome the limitations of current \u201ccold storage\u201d method of preservation.\n\nDeveloped in the laboratory of UHN transplant surgeon Dr. Markus Selzner, with the help of UHN transplant surgeons Drs. David Grant and Anand Ghanekar, as well as Drs. Lisa Robinson and Darius Bagli from The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), it took four years to perfect the solution for the donor kidney and to modify the heart-lung machine for use in the warm perfusion technique.\n\nThis technology has advantages over the usual cold storage method in which a deceased donor kidney is cooled on ice to about four degrees Celsius, with no oxygen, slowing down its metabolism, and inhibiting the repair process.\n\nThe kidney cannot survive longer than 30 hours in cold preservation. The new warm preservation technique avoids the damage of cold storage and instead allows the donor organ to improve and repair itself, potentially leading to better outcomes for patients.\n\nUsing a heart-lung bypass machine, with customized tubing adapted to the kidney\u2019s smaller blood vessels - and a specially blended preservation solution of blood, nutrients, minerals, amino acids, oxygen, glucose, antibiotics and drugs \u2013 surgeons, nurses and perfusionists at TG prepared a deceased donor kidney in a transplant operating room to be placed in a warm preservation solution before transplantation into a patient in late November, 2017.\n\nThe aim was to enhance kidney function, minimize injury and avoid a \u201csleepy kidney\u201d from an extended criteria kidney. About 30-40 per cent of deceased donor kidneys do not work immediately, requiring longer hospitals stays for the patients and dialysis.\n\nZhao Xiao, 53, received the deceased donor kidney, which was placed on the device for 3.5 hours at body temperature.\n\n\u201cI feel great,\u201d says Xiao, through an interpreter. He was able to get up and walk two day after his transplant. Xiao says he was happy to volunteer to become the first patient to receive a kidney that was improved by the new technology.\n\n\u201cThis can make a difference to other patients, so I am glad to be the first one helping them with my experience.\u201d\n\nAs soon as the donor kidney was reattached to the patient, it turned ruby-red and started to pour out urine, indicating that it was functioning well.\n\n\u201cIt is a champion!\u201d says an elated Dr. Selzner, who has done about 500 kidney transplants in the past 14 years. \u201cIt behaved like a normal kidney, despite it being an extended criteria donor kidney.\u201d\n\nHe points out blood tests within 48 hours showed that the kidney was removing wastes and excess fluid from the blood normally. Since the kidney did not \u201cstruggle\u201d after transplant, there is a greater likelihood that its long-term outcome will be better, he adds.\n\n\u201cThis technique will change the landscape of organ donation by improving organ preservation, allowing us to better assess and regenerate the donor organ on the device before we transplant it into a patient. We will know how healthy that organ is before the transplant operation,\u201d says Dr. Markus Selzner, co-investigator of the clinical trial.\n\nDr. Selzner, a clinician-scientist at the Toronto General Hospital Research Institute and Associate Professor of Surgery at the University of Toronto, previously modified the preservation solution and supervised the research on a successful warm perfusion technique for the deceased donor liver organ.\n\n\u201cWorking on this project has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my professional career,\u201d says Dr. Lisa Robinson, Division Head of Nephrology at SickKids. \u201cIt is exciting to see this work be transformed from an idea to experimental research, and now to directly impacting patients.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven with the shortage of donor organs, we have to decline some of our donor organs because of the damage they sustain in the retrieval process,\u201d says Dr. David Grant, Surgical Director of the Multi-Organ Transplant Program, UHN. He is also co-investigator of the clinical trial and transplanted the donor kidney, which was on the modified heart-lung bypass machine, into the recipient.\n\n\u201cThis new technology can help us answer the critical question, \u2018What\u2019s the best way to improve function and recover and repair the kidney before transplantation to get the best results for our patients?\u2019\u201d\n\nDr. Grant, who is also Professor of Surgery at the University of Toronto, emphasized that high-impact research projects such as this require strong collaborative teams \u2013 including researchers, surgical residents, nurses, Canadian Blood Services, perfusionists, colleagues at SickKids - working together on experimental and clinical trials.\n\n\u201cUHN is one of the few places in the world where you can have a good idea and then find the right people to make something like this happen.\u201d\n\nOther collaborators on the research and clinical trial at UHN include: Drs. Joseph Kim and Anand Ghanekar, co-leads of the kidney transplant program at UHN and transplant nephrologist Dr. Istvan Mucsi.\n\nDr. Grant also praised the strong support and efforts of Trillium Gift of Life, which co-ordinates organ and tissue donation across Ontario, in helping to ensure that the transplant team could begin their clinical trials with this new technique.\n\nThe technique of warm organ perfusion outside the body was pioneered by the Toronto Lung Transplant Program at TG in 2008 by Drs. Shaf Keshavjee and Marcelo Cypel to better treat, repair and assess high-risk donor lungs outside the body. The lungs are placed in a protective dome in which a system continuously pumps a bloodless solution of oxygen, proteins and nutrients into the injured donor lungs, mimicking normal physiological conditions.\n\nThis makes it possible for the injured cells to begin repairing themselves, and sets the stage for more sophisticated repair techniques to be applied to donor lungs. Since 2012, there has been an unprecedented 63 per cent increase in lung transplants at TG as a result of this system.\n\nAt any point in time, there are about 1,500 patients waiting for a transplant in Ontario. About 1,000 people wait for a kidney transplant across the province, usually about four years. About five per cent of people on kidney waiting lists die every year.\n\nResearch for the ex vivo kidney perfusion project was supported by the Canadian National Transplant Research Program (CNTRP), a national research network designed to increase organ and tissue donation in Canada and enhance the survival and quality of life of Canadians who receive transplants.\n\nGenerous philanthropic support, made through Toronto General & Western Hospital Foundation, has played and continues to play an integral role in the development of ex vivo technology and its impact on patients\u2019 lives.\n\nToronto General Hospital is a partner in University Health Network, along with Toronto Western, the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto Rehabilitation Institute and the Michener Institute of Education. The scope of research and complexity of cases at Toronto General Hospital have made it a national and international source for discovery, education and patient care. It has one of the largest hospital-based research programs in Canada, with major research in transplantation, surgical innovation, cardiology, infectious diseases, genomic medicine and liver disease.

These patients survived an average of 9.1 months with nivolumab and 4.4 months with chemotherapy.\n\nHPV-negative patients survived an average of 7.5 months with nivolumab and 5.8 with chemotherapy.\n\nImportantly, fewer patients experienced serious side-effects from taking nivolumab than with conventional treatment - only 13 per cent compared with 35 per cent of patients who received chemotherapy.\n\nPatients given chemotherapy reported feeling physically, socially and emotionally worse off, whereas those who were given nivolumab remained stable during the course of treatment.\n\nProfessor Harrington will be presenting some of the findings at the European Society for Medical Oncology 2016 Congress in Copenhagen, simultaneously with publication.\n\nNivolumab will still have to go through approval by the European Medicines Agency and NICE before it is available for head and neck cancer patients on the NHS.\n\nUK trial lead Professor Kevin Harrington, Professor of Biological Cancer Therapies at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and Consultant at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, said:\n\n\"Nivolumab could be a real game-changer for patients with advanced head and neck cancer. This trial found that it can greatly extend life among a group of patients who have no existing treatment options, without worsening quality of life.\n\n\"Once it has relapsed or spread, head and neck cancer is extremely difficult to treat. So it's great news that these results indicate we now have a new treatment that can significantly extend life, and I'm keen to see it enter the clinic as soon as possible.\"\n\nProfessor Paul Workman, Chief Executive of The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said:\n\n\"Nivolumab is one of a new wave of immunotherapies that are beginning to have an impact across cancer treatment. This phase III clinical trial expands the repertoire of nivolumab even further, showing that it is the first treatment to have significant benefits in relapsed head and neck cancer.\n\n\"We hope regulators can work with the manufacturer to avoid delays in getting this drug to patients who have no effective treatment options left to them.\"\n\nSome of the data was presented at 16:25 CEST today (Sunday) at the European Society for Medical Oncology 2016 Congress in Copenhagen.\n\nFor more information please contact Claire Hastings on 020 8722 5380 or claire.hastings@icr.ac.uk.

Some, like Dr. Dean Ornish, a longtime promoter of low-fat diets and president of the Preventive Medicine Research Institute in Sausalito, Calif., said that the women did not reduce their fat to low enough levels or eat enough fruits and vegetables, and that the study, even at eight years, did not give the diets enough time.\n\nOthers said that diet could still make a difference, at least with heart disease, if people were to eat the so-called Mediterranean diet, low in saturated fats like butter and high in oils like olive oil. The women in the study reduced all kinds of fat.\n\nThe diets studied \"had an antique patina,\" said Dr. Peter Libby, a cardiologist and professor at Harvard Medical School. These days, Dr. Libby said, most people have moved on from the idea of controlling total fat to the idea that people should eat different kinds of fat.\n\nBut the Mediterranean diet has not been subjected to a study of this scope, researchers said.\n\nAnd Barbara V. Howard, an epidemiologist at MedStar Research Institute, a nonprofit hospital group, and a principle investigator in the study, said people should realize that diet alone was not enough to stay healthy.\n\n\"We are not going to reverse any of the chronic diseases in this country by changing the composition of the diet,\" Dr. Howard said. \"People are always thinking it's what they ate. They are not looking at how much they ate or that they smoke or that they are sedentary.\"\n\nExcept for not smoking, the advice for a healthy lifestyle is based largely on indirect evidence, Dr. Howard said, but most medical researchers agree that it makes sense to eat well, control weight and get regular exercise.\n\nThat is also what the cancer society recommends. Dr. Thun, who described the study's results as \"completely null over the eight-year follow-up for both cancers and heart disease,\" said his group had no plans to suggest that low-fat diets were going to protect against cancer.\n\nOthers cautioned against being too certain that a particular diet would markedly improve health, and said that whether someone developed a chronic disease might not be entirely under their control -- genetics also plays a role.\n\nDavid A. Freedman, a statistician at the University of California, Berkeley, who is not connected with the study but has written books on the design and analysis of clinical trials, said the results should be taken seriously.\n\n\"The studies were well designed,\" Dr. Freedman said, \"and the investigators tried to confirm popular hypotheses about the protective effect of diet against three major diseases in women.\"\n\n\"But,\" he added, \"the diet studied here turned out not to be protective after all.\"\n\nThe study was part of the Women's Health Initiative of the National Institutes of Health, the same program that showed that hormone therapy after menopause might have more risks than benefits.\n\nIn this case, the study addressed a tricky problem. For decades, many scientists have said, and many members of the public have believed, that what people eat -- the composition of the diet -- determines how likely they are to get a chronic disease. But that has been hard to prove. Studies of dietary fiber and colon cancer failed to find that fiber was protective, and studies of vitamins thought to protect against cancer failed to show an effect.\n\nMany cancer researchers have questioned large parts of the diet-cancer hypothesis, but it has kept a hold on the public imagination. \"Nothing fascinates the American public so much as the notion that what you eat rather than how much you eat affects your health,\" said Dr. Libby, the Harvard professor.\n\nThe study found that women who were randomly assigned to follow a low-fat diet ate significantly less fat over the next eight years. But they had just as much breast and colon cancer and just as much heart disease. The women were not trying to lose weight, and their weights remained fairly steady. But their experiences with the diets allowed researchers to question some popular notions about diet and obesity.\n\nThere is a common belief that Americans get fat because they eat too many carbohydrates. The idea is that a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet leads to weight gain, higher insulin and blood glucose levels, and more diabetes, even if the calories are the same as in a higher-fat diet. That did not happen here.\n\nOthers have said the opposite: that low-fat diets enable people to lose weight naturally. But that belief was not supported by this study.\n\nAs for heart disease risk factors, the only one affected was LDL cholesterol, which increases heart disease risk. The levels were slightly higher in women eating the higher-fat diet, but not high enough to make a noticeable difference in their risk of heart disease.\n\nAlthough all the study participants were women, the colon cancer and heart disease results should also apply to men, said Dr. Jacques Rossouw, the project officer for the Women's Health Initiative.\n\nDr. Rossouw said the observational studies that led to the hypothesis about colon cancer and dietary fat included men and women. With heart disease, he said, researchers have found that women and men respond in the same way to dietary fat.\n\nThe most recent study follows a smaller one, reported last year, on low-fat diets for women who had breast cancer. That study hinted that eating less fat might help prevent a recurrence. But the current study, asking if a low-fat diet could protect women from breast cancer in the first place, had findings that fell short of statistical significance, meaning they could have occurred by chance.\n\nDr. Rossouw said he was still intrigued by the breast cancer data, even though it was not statistically significant. The women on low-fat diets had a 9 percent lower rate of breast cancer; the incidence was 42 per thousand per year in women in the low-fat diet group, compared with 45 per thousand per year in women consuming their regular diet.\n\nThat could mean that fat in the diet may have a small effect, Dr. Rossouw said, perhaps in some subgroups of women or over a longer period of time. He added that the study investigators would continue to follow the women to see if the effect became more pronounced.\n\nWhile cancer researchers said they were disappointed by the results, heart disease researchers said they were not surprised that simply reducing total fat had no effect, because they had moved on from that hypothesis.\n\nOf course, Dr. Libby acknowledged, the latest advice, to follow a Mediterranean diet and get regular exercise, has never been tested in a large randomized clinical trial. \"If they did a study like that and it was negative,\" he said, \"then I'd have to give up my cherished hypotheses for data.\"\n\nThe low-fat diet was not easy to follow, said Dr. Rowan T. Chlebowski, a medical oncologist at Harbor-U.C.L.A. Medical Center and one of the study's principal investigators. Women were told to aim for a diet that had just 20 percent of its calories as fat, and most fell short.\n\nThe diet they were told to follow \"is different than the way most people eat,\" Dr. Chlebowski said. It meant, for example, no butter on bread, no cream cheese on bagels, no oil in salad dressings.\n\n\"If a physician told a patient to eat less fat, that will do nothing,\" he said. \"If you send someone to a dietitian one time, that will do next to nothing.\" The women in the study had 18 sessions in small groups with a trained nutritionist in the first year and four sessions a year after that.\n\nIn the first year, the women on the low-fat diets reduced the percentage of fat in their diet to 24 percent of daily calories, and by the end of the study their diets had 29 percent of their calories as fat. In the first year, the women in the control group were eating 35 percent of their calories as fat, and by the end of the study their dietary fat content was 37 percent. The two groups consumed about the same number of calories.\n\nSome medical specialists emphasized that the study did not mean people should abandon low-fat diets.\n\n\"What we are saying is that a modest reduction of fat and a substitution with fruits and vegetables did not do anything for heart disease and stroke or breast cancer or colorectal cancer,\" said Dr. Nanette K. Wenger, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta. \"It doesn't say that this diet is not beneficial.\"\n\nBut Dr. Freedman, the Berkeley statistician, said the overall lesson was clear.\n\n\"We, in the scientific community, often give strong advice based on flimsy evidence,\" he said. \"That's why we have to do experiments.\"\n\nCorrection: February 16, 2006, Thursday A front-page article on Feb. 8 about a new study finding that low-fat diets have no effect on the risk of cancer or heart disease misstated the incidence of breast cancer among women in the study. It was 42 per 10,000 per year in women in the low-fat-diet group, compared with 45 per 10,000 in women consuming their regular diet -- not per 1,000. (The difference was deemed statistically insignificant.)", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Scientists with a variety of different perspectives and interests are quoted.

", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Since the 1980s, arthroscopic surgery has been a common solution for people suffering pain in the knee or shoulder, providing a minimally invasive way to repair such injuries as torn ACLs and rotator cuffs. But those experiencing hip pain or stiffness have had more-limited options.\n\n\"Most people, especially athletes, when they had hip symptoms, usually they just got diagnosed as a chronic groin pull,\" said J.W. Thomas Byrd, a Nashville orthopedist who specializes in sports medicine and hip injuries. Rest and physical therapy might be prescribed, but no other solutions were available. Byrd also noted that because it's difficult to get standard surgical instruments into the hip safely, it has been \"a bit more of a challenging joint to tackle\" than the knee or shoulder.\n\nBut that's changing. In the past 10 to 15 years, doctors have discovered one specific cause of hip pain: a tear in the acetabular labrum, a condition in which the cartilage that lines the hip socket is damaged. And they've found that it can be fixed using arthroscopic surgery, which uses narrow instruments inserted through smaller incisions than traditional surgery.\n\nNew York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez recently made headlines when he opted to have arthroscopy on such a tear in his right hip, a decision that has him sidelined from baseball for weeks.\n\nDerek Ochiai, a surgeon with the Nirschl Orthopaedic Center in Arlington, who began performing hip arthroscopy six years ago, estimates that he did only about a dozen of the procedures that year. Now, he performs more than 100 annually.\n\nOchiai also occasionally serves as an instructor at the Orthopaedic Learning Center, a surgeon's training lab in Rosemont, Ill., where he said three sessions are offered each year in hip arthroscopy and all are booked solid. This is a marked uptick from a decade ago, when Ochiai said the single course in hip arthroscopy was nearly canceled due to lack of interest.\n\nThe labrum is a thin ring of cartilage that lines the acetabulum, or hip socket. It acts as a cushion when the leg bends and provides stability to the joint. Left untreated, labrum tears can lead to arthritis. So, indirectly, \"hip arthroscopy may be a way of delaying or even possibly preventing hip arthritis,\" Ochiai said.\n\nThese tears are not detectable by X-ray, and though they usually can be seen by MRI, even those images can sometimes be inconclusive. Ochiai said many patients see three or four orthopedists before getting a proper diagnosis.\n\nThere are several causes for labrum tears, but rigorous physical activity or stress is almost always a factor. Also, doctors often find some structural flaw in the hip joint, most commonly femoral acetabular impingement, known as FAI. This means that a bone deformity causes the ball and socket to rub against each other in a way that pinches the labrum. Doctors say FAI is not something a patient is born with; rather, it develops in adolescence, for unknown reasons. Byrd said it is more common in men than in women.\n\nDuring arthroscopic surgeries on the labrum, doctors can fix the FAI by shaving down the bony defect.\n\nRecovery time varies. When minimal work is done, it can be four to six weeks; when FAI is corrected, it can be more like three to four months.\n\nWhy has it taken so long for hip arthroscopy to catch up to its shoulder and knee counterparts?\n\n\"The big difference is that with the knee, most of the things we're doing arthroscopically evolved from things we were doing in open surgery,\" Byrd said. With the hip, however, doctors using arthroscopes discovered a host of conditions, including labrum tears and FAI, that had not been recognized. As a result, surgeons are trying to find remedies for problems that, Byrd said, had received \"no treatment at all\" in the past.\n\nPlus, surgical techniques have improved. Byrd said that five to 10 years ago, the focus was on \"cleaning it up,\" meaning taking out problem-causing bits of cartilage. While that is still done, restorative techniques have been introduced that allow for the preservation of the labrum instead of its removal.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "\n\n\n \nThe story includes interviews with two surgeons who perform a substantial number of hip arthroscopies.

One leading expert described the benefit as \u201cmodest\u201d.\n\nPatients getting canakinumab also suffered significantly more deaths from infections than those on placebo - but, on the positive side, they appeared to be at lower risk of cancer.\n\nThere was no significant difference in the rate of deaths from all causes between the placebo group and those on canakinumab.\n\n\u201cThe modest absolute clinical benefit of canakinumab cannot justify its routine use in patients with previous myocardial infarction until we understand more about the efficacy and safety trade-offs and unless a price restructuring and formal cost-effectiveness evaluation supports it,\u201d wrote Dr. Robert Harrington, chair of the Stanford University School of Medicine, in an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nCanakinumab had stirred considerable scientific interest because it appears to finally deliver proof that fighting inflammation offers a promising new way to counter heart disease in patients who already get cholesterol-lowering treatment.\n\nSubsequently, some analysts boosted their revenue estimates for the Novartis medicine into the billions of dollars, while awaiting the data announced on Sunday.\n\nCanakinumab is already approved as Ilaris for rare autoimmune conditions.\n\nVas Narasimhan, Novartis\u2019s head of global drug development, said the drugmaker plans to go to regulators in the fourth quarter to seek approval for canakinumab to treat heart-attack victims with high levels of inflammation.\n\nHe downplayed critics who said the benefit was small, saying that one large subgroup in the so-called Cantos trial had shown a 27 percent reduction in cardiovascular risk.\n\nNovartis also plans to underscore canakinumab\u2019s potential cancer fighting properties with the European Medicines Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThat\u2019s after an analysis of Cantos data found total cancer mortality among patients getting canakinumab was significantly lower than in those receiving the placebo.\n\nNarasimhan, who said the company now plans to start separate cancer trials for canakinumab, said the drug could be particularly suitable for smokers with risks of both lung cancer and heart problems.\n\nWith the oncology findings promising but only preliminary, the company is planning additional studies in lung cancer starting next year, he said.\n\nIlaris now costs about $200,000 per patient annually for treating rare immune conditions and brings in some $400 million in yearly sales for the Swiss company, though its price is likely to be slashed should it win approval in the heart setting.\n\nNovartis initially struggled with the sluggish launch of its last heart drug, the $4,500-per-year Entresto, so it is understandably concerned about the reception for canakinumab.\n\nWhile Narasimhan said it was too early to discuss pricing, he argued so-called PCSK9 cholesterol drugs that cost about $14,000 annually should not be relied on as a yardstick.\n\n\u201cIn view of the additional oncology findings, we don\u2019t think you should just think about this as a cardiovascular drug,\u201d Narasimhan said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can necessarily just make comparisons to existing benchmarks, such as the PCSK9s.\u201d\n\nEven so, Tim Anderson, a Bernstein analyst, said the \u201cmarginal\u201d data are not compelling enough to dispel what for Novartis will remain a pricing conundrum, should canakinumab\u2019s approval be expanded for heart patients.\n\n\u201cIf the company cuts the price of the product in its current orphan indications, then it instantly sacrifices sales which currently total about $400 million per year with the hope that future sales in a new CV setting will more than offset this,\u201d Anderson said in a note.\n\n\u201cSome have wondered whether a particularly high-risk subgroup could be identified where canakinumab\u2019s current price can be justified,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not hopeful here.\u201d", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "This story, which is more of a \u201cbusiness of medicine\u201d story, uses a drug industry analyst source to good effect, and included commentary from the study\u2019s accompanying editorial.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Artist Lorie Novak in front of work from her Migraine Register project, which documents all the time she's lost to debilitating migraines.\n\nIt often starts with the aura.\n\nZig-zagging lines come into view, everyday light becomes searingly bright, and vision starts to slip. These are signals that a debilitating migraine is on its way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re possessed,\u201d said Lorie Novak, who has suffered from chronic migraines since childhood. \u201cI almost feel separate from my body, like it\u2019s just this painful shell around me that\u2019s not me.\u201d\n\nNovak, now in her 60s, is one of the roughly 35 million Americans who suffer from migraines. There are few effective treatments, and no new drugs have been developed since the early 1990s.\n\nBut that could soon change. A handful of drug companies are pressing ahead with novel injectable therapies for migraines, chasing a blockbuster market that Wall Street analysts say could reach $8 billion a year in worldwide sales.\n\nThe new drugs target a bodily protein called CGRP, which plays a role in the dilation of blood vessels in the brain. Scientists haven\u2019t nailed down just how the protein affects migraines, but they\u2019re sure about two things: CGRP levels rocket up when headaches attack and normalize when they go away.\n\nAnd thus four drug makers \u2014 Amgen, Eli Lilly, Teva Pharmaceuticals, and Alder Biopharmaceuticals \u2014 have fashioned antibodies that can bind to CGRP molecules and block their activity. The goal: to relieve the scourge of chronic migraines by stopping CGRP in its tracks.\n\nSo far, it seems to be working. In mid-stage clinical trials, each of the four treatments has eased symptoms for about half of study participants, cutting the number of days they\u2019re afflicted by migraines roughly in half. It\u2019s by no means a cure for migraines, but it should be enough to merit Food and Drug Administration approvals if the companies can replicate those results in larger trials, according to Eric Schmidt, a securities analyst at Cowen and Co.\n\nEach treatment is now in late-stage development, targeting the roughly 38 percent of migraine sufferers who, like Novak, have at least four headache days per month. The first therapy could hit the market in 2018, and, if everything works out, all four could available by the end of the decade.\n\nSo far, the four drugs have performed similarly in clinical trials, and analysts expect the contenders will have to compete on price to grab market share.\n\n\u201cThere will certainly be hypercompetition,\u201d said William Ratner, Lilly\u2019s senior director of global headache marketing. But the companies\u2019 fortunes are intertwined, he said, and \u201cthe class only wins if headache care in America improves.\u201d\n\nAiming to prevent migraines before they start\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of room for improvement. Existing therapies are plagued by inconsistent efficacy and troublesome side effects, and patients are often left to rely on a repurposed treatment for epilepsy. That medication, Topamax, has been dubbed dubbed \u201cSleepomax\u201d by doctors and patients because it\u2019s also a heavy sedative.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very enthusiastic, as I think everyone in the field is, about having another treatment option for people with migraines,\u201d said Dr. Elizabeth Loder, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and chief of the headache division in the department of neurology at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital.\n\nTargeting CGRP is not a particularly new idea. Researchers picked up on the protein\u2019s scent more than 30 years ago, and drug companies spent years trying to craft pills that might block its activity. Merck got all the way into late-stage trials with an anti-CGRP tablet, spending more than $1 billion only to find in 2011 that the drug had toxic effects on the liver and thus no future.\n\nWith the \u201cexquisite sensitivity\u201d of an antibody, however, scientists believe they can block CGRP without triggering dangerous side effects, Alder CEO Randy Schatzman said.\n\nBecause antibodies stay active in the body for weeks, the drug companies see their new products as preventative therapies, injected monthly or quarterly to keep headaches at bay. (Merck\u2019s failed pill, by contrast, was meant as an on-the-spot treatment after the pain started.)\n\n\u201cSo in some senses, it\u2019s a paradigm shift,\u201d Schatzman said.\n\nBut there are still hurdles to clear. Only about half of patients seem to respond to CGRP antibodies, and the companies have no way of predicting who they are ahead of time. A genetic test would be \u201cthe Holy Grail of personalized medicine,\u201d said Rob Lenz, Amgen\u2019s global development lead for neuroscience, but no one has made one yet.\n\nAnd long-term safety remains a major question mark. To date, none of the companies has reported serious side effects in clinical trials, but they\u2019ve only reported data from 12-week studies on about 1,500 total patients. It will take years to determine just what the new therapies do to the body over time, Loder said.\n\n\u2018I felt like my life was being stolen from me\u2019\n\nAny advance, even an incremental one, would be a major leap for the field, said Emily Bates, who studies the genetic causes of headaches at the University of Colorado and is not affiliated with any of the companies working on migraine treatment.\n\nBates struggled with chronic migraines in high school and college. Like many patients, she didn\u2019t respond to any of the preventative therapies available.\n\n\u201cThe pain is more than anything I\u2019ve ever experienced, and I\u2019ve run on broken legs before,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like my life was being stolen from me.\u201d\n\nCollectively, Americans miss about 113 million workdays each year because of migraine. That lost productivity costs society about $13 billion each year, according to the Migraine Research Foundation.\n\nYet scientific progress has been slow, in part because migraine was long considered a psychosomatic condition not worthy of serious research funding, Bates said.\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201csubjective symptom that predominantly affects women,\u201d said Loder, the Harvard neurologist. \u201cThat\u2019s a perfect combination of things that make people feel able to dismiss it.\u201d\n\nNovak, a professor of photography at New York University\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts, spent years trying to hide her migraines because of the stigma attached to the condition. But she decided to change all that in 2009 with a project called Migraine Register. She takes a photo of herself each day she has a migraine. Some years, that\u2019s more than 120 pictures.\n\nThe idea, in part, was to humanize chronic migraines. But the project also forced Novak to reckon with the toll of the disease, something she had tried to ignore for years.\n\n\u201cThat for me was like a concrete proof of how it really does affect my life,\u201d Novak said, \u201cof how much time I lose.\u201d", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story makes clear that four large drug companies are working to develop drugs, leading to an easy inference that the companies are funding the research.

It\u2019s better to avoid fatty food altogether.

They also looked at questionnaires completed by their mothers to see how much folic acid they were consuming in the month before they became pregnant and during the first eight weeks of pregnancy, a critical period of embryonic brain development. Health officials in Norway recommend that pregnant women (and women who are trying to get pregnant) take 400 micrograms of folic acid per day.\n\nMothers who took folic acid supplements around the time they became pregnant were less likely to have children with an autism spectrum disorder, a new study has found.\n\nBut not all mothers were equally likely to take folic acid supplements. Those who did were more likely to have attended college, to be nonsmokers, to be first-time mothers and to have planned their pregnancies. The researchers also found that the popularity of folic acid supplements rose as time went on. After the researchers controlled for factors like these, they calculated that taking the supplements was associated with a 39% lower risk of having a child with autistic disorder.\n\nThe raw numbers also showed that women who took extra folic acid were less likely to have kids with Asperger syndrome or PPD-NOS, but when other factors were taken into account, the association was no longer statistically significant and could have been due to chance, the researchers found.\n\nThe results were published in Wednesday\u2019s edition of the Journal of the American Medical Assn.\n\nThe study also looked at folic acid use later in pregnancy but found no correlation between that and the chances of a child developing an autism spectrum disorder.

Autism spectrum disorders are diagnosed much more frequently in the U.S. than in Norway.\n\nOn the other hand, pregnant women here are also far more likely to consume a healthy amount of the B vitamin because the Food and Drug Administration has required manufacturers of enriched breads, cereals and other grains to fortify them with folic acid since 1998. As a result, a cup of enriched white long-grain rice now contains 797 micrograms of folic acid, for example, and a cup of Cheerios has 493 mcg, according to this report from the Harvard Women\u2019s Health Watch.\n\nThe fact that autism cases have been on the rise in the U.S. even after folic acid supplementation became mandatory is a puzzle, according to three researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Division of Birth Defects and Developmental Disorders. In an editorial that accompanies the JAMA study, they write that the discrepancy \u201cmay be attributable to changes in diagnosis and surveillance but also may reflect a concurrent real increase in the risk of ASDs attributable to as-yet undescribed risk factors and exposures.\u201d They also note that data from the National Health Examination and Nutrition Survey published in 2009 show that the typical American consumes only 150 mcg of folic acid per day even with mandatory fortification.\n\nYou can read a summary of the study and the editorial on the JAMA website.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Unlike the Reuters Health story (which quoted two independent sources), this one does not include comments from an independent source, just a quote from a journal editorial (and that quote doesn\u2019t directly address the quality of the evidence).

On another night, the windows and door to the room were kept closed. In the meantime, Mishra and colleagues monitored carbon dioxide levels, temperature, background noise and humidity. The study participants were asked not to drink alcoholic beverages or caffeinated drinks, which could influence sleep. They each slept alone, and the bedroom layout with furniture arrangement was kept consistent.\n\nFor measuring sleep quality, participants wore an armband that measures skin temperature, heat flux, bed temperature and skin moisture levels.

Equally problematic are the decisions to stop play or activities, or when patients who have suffered a concussion can safely return to normal activities without risking further injury.\n\nIn the new study, researchers have demonstrated that a blood test can now accurately diagnose a concussion using a form of blood profiling known as metabolomics. Dr. Douglas Fraser, a physician in the Paediatric Critical Care Unit at Children's Hospital, London Health Sciences Centre and Lawson scientist, led the study with his co-investigator Mark Daley, a professor in the Departments of Computer Science, Biology and Statistics & Actuarial Sciences at Western University.\n\nIn the relatively inexpensive test, blood is drawn from an individual that may have suffered a concussion as the result of a sudden blow to the head (or from transmitted forces from a sudden blow to the body) within 72 hours of the incident. The scientists measure a panel of metabolites - small molecules that are the products of the body's metabolism - in the blood to search for distinct patterns that indicate a concussion has occurred.\n\n\"This novel approach, to use blood testing of metabolites as a diagnostic tool for concussions, was exploratory and we were extremely pleased with the robustness of our initial results,\" says Dr. Fraser, also an Associate Professor in Western's Departments of Paediatrics, Physiology & Pharmacology and Clinical Neurological Sciences at the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry. \"We looked at a host of patterns and it appears that those who suffered a concussion have a very different pattern than those who have not had a concussion.\"\n\nThis new method, fully funded by the Children's Health Foundation and conducted by the Western Concussion Study Group, is unique in that previous attempts have looked unsuccessfully for a single highly accurate protein biomarker that can distinguish concussed from non-concussed adolescent patients.\n\nIn this latest successful attempt, the researchers took a different approach and investigated a full spectrum of 174 metabolites.\n\n\"We looked at all of these metabolites in concussed male adolescent patients and in non-concussed male adolescent patients and it turns out that the spectrum is really different,\" explains Daley, who is also Western's Associate Vice-President (Research) and a principal investigator at Western's renowned Brain & Mind Institute. \"There is no one metabolite that we can put a finger on but when we looked at all of them, those profiles are different enough that we could easily distinguish concussed patients from non-concussed. In fact, with fine tuning we can now look at sets of as few as 20-40 specific metabolites and maintain the diagnostic accuracy level of the test over 90 per cent.\"\n\nConcussion is a major public health concern, often resulting in significant acute symptoms and in some individuals, long-term neurological dysfunction.\n\n\"The discovery of a blood test that can aid in concussion diagnosis is very important,\" says Dr. Fraser. \"With further research, we anticipate that our blood test will also aid clinicians in predicting concussion outcome, as well as aid rehabilitation after concussion.\"\n\nThe findings were recently published in the international journal Metabolomics.\n\nThe technology is subject to a patent application filed through WORLDiscoveries\u00ae, the joint technology transfer office of Lawson and Western.\n\n\"This relatively quick and inexpensive blood test for concussion is by far the most accurate reported with tremendous potential for clinical management and commercialization,\" says Kirk Brown, Manager of Business Development for Lawson.\n\nWestern delivers an academic experience second to none.

Petersen believes that the test they came up with could become a useful tool for any physician, even those without special training in the brain. \u201cWhat we are trying to do is give them some help so they can be as efficient as possible without ignoring these important cognitive issues,\u201d he says.\n\nIn the first phase of the test, his researchers simply collected information from 1,500 patients\u2019 medical charts\u2014their age, family history of Alzheimer\u2019s, factors such as diabetes or smoking that have been linked to Alzheimer\u2019s, and whether the patient had ever reported problems with memory.\n\nIn the next phase they studied the results of the patient\u2019s basic mental exam as well as of a psychiatric evaluation, because depression and anxiety have been connected to Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nAnd another factor that emerged as important in developing the disease\u2014how quickly the participant could walk a short distance. \u201cWe were a little surprised,\u201d says Petersen. \u201cBut what\u2019s nice about it is that it\u2019s a nice non-cognitive, motor factor so it\u2019s looking at another aspect of brain function.\u201d\n\nMORE: This Alzheimer\u2019s Breakthrough Could Be a Game Changer\n\nPetersen suggests that every physician should get this information on their patients at age 65; that way, they can have a baseline against which to compare any changes as their patients age. Only if they show such changes \u2014 a slower walk, for example, or worsening signs of depression or memory issues \u2014 should they move on to the third phase of the test, which is a blood analysis. That would look for known genetic factors linked to Alzheimer\u2019s, including the presence of certain versions of the ApoE gene.\n\nCurrently, the only way to truly separate out those on the road to Alzheimer\u2019s is to conduct expensive imaging tests of the brain, or to do a spinal tap, an invasive procedure that extracts spinal fluid for signs of the amyloid protein that builds up in the disease. \u201cWe have either expensive techniques or invasive techniques and it\u2019s not practical to do them from a public health screening standpoint,\u201d says Petersen.\n\nMORE: New Test May Predict Alzheimer\u2019s 10 Years Before Diagnosis\n\nWhile his test is a possible solution to that problem, he acknowledges that the results need be repeated before it\u2019s recommended on a wide scale to physicians across the country. But those who scored higher on the test of risk factors had a seven-fold higher chance of developing mild cognitive impairment than those with lower scores.\n\nFor now, even if doctors identify patients around age 65 who might be at higher risk of developing cognitive impairment, there isn\u2019t much they can do to interrupt the process.

And children who play sports are nearly three times more likely to suffer sudden cardiac death than their nonathletic counterparts.\n\n\"Few of the kids actually experience sudden death while they're in class or at home,\" says Thomas Debauche, a Houston cardiologist. \"It's pretty much while they're in training or while they're on the field performing, because that's when the adrenalin is flowing,\" and that's when they're calling on the heart for peak performance.\n\nThese surprise attacks are due to inherited problems that children are born with. Cardiologist Douglas Zipes, past president of the American Academy of Cardiology, says the problems kids suffer are typically electrical, like abnormal heart rhythms, or structural, like a thickening of the heart muscle. Both of these problems are exacerbated during exertion when kids play sports.\n\nAccording to Zipes, \"The adrenalin that is released when you're participating [in sports] can stimulate this abnormally thick heart muscle and cause a fatal heart rhythm problem, that is a very rapid heartbeat with no effective contraction, no blood being ejected to the brain and other organs.\" The result is sudden cardiac death.\n\nTypically, schools require kids to provide a family history and have a simple physical exam before participating in sports. But Zipes says more should be done.\n\nCardiologist Debauche agrees. He recently screened more than 2,000 high school athletes in the Houston area, using electrocardiogram, or EKG, to measure the electrical activity of the heart.\n\nAbout 10 percent of the students had an abnormal EKG. One of them was Louis Anthony, who suffered from asthma. In severe cases, asthma can cause the heart to thicken and put kids at risk of cardiomyopathy and sudden death. Anthony's asthma diminished over time, and he says he can still play soccer, run fast and breathe \"just fine.\"\n\nAfter the abnormal EKG result, however, Debauche told Anthony and his parents to closely monitor the asthma. They have.\n\nFor other students who had abnormal EKG results, some received medication for blood pressure and others were treated for abnormal heart rhythms. About 1 percent were told it was too dangerous for them to continue in sports.\n\nThree students had serious heart problems, including one who suffered from a rare disease in which the heart muscle is spongy and contracts poorly.\n\n\"He was literally running the stadium stairs at the time we found him,\" Debauche says. \"He was preparing for track season by running up and down the stadium stairs.\"\n\nDebauche says the heart screening turned out to be life-saving for this student athlete. The student now has an implantable defibrillator and is awaiting a heart transplant.\n\nThe severity of this and the other two problems that turned up as a result of the abnormal EKGs are reason enough, Debauche says, to screen all school athletes nationwide.\n\nSome health experts argue that would be too costly. There's no official policy from the American College of Cardiology, but officials say most members support screening student athletes.\n\nThe American Heart Association suggests that athletes who are identified as at risk for heart problems as a result of a family history or physical exam be referred for further cardiovascular examination, which could include an electrocardiogram.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "\n\n\n\nThe story quotes Thomas Debauche, a Houston cardiologist and author of the screening study, and Douglas Zipes, a former president of the American College of Cardiology (ACC), both of whom are supportive of screening.

He then lifted the small intestine out of the body to sift it through his fingers.\n\nAs he found tumors, he snipped them out. \u201cYou can see how this is coming off like wallpaper,\u201d Dr. Lowy said as he stripped out part of the lining of the man\u2019s abdominal cavity.\n\nAfter about two hours of poking and cutting, Dr. Lowy began the so-called shake and bake. The machine pumped heated chemotherapy directly into the abdominal cavity for 90 minutes while nurses gently jiggled the man\u2019s bloated belly to disperse the drug to every nook and cranny.\n\nThe treatment is formally called cytoreductive surgery followed by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, or Hipec.\n\nRecent converts include University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland, in the , and even Massachusetts General. The is looking at it, according to people in the field. Advocates predict that the number of procedures could grow to 10,000 a year from about 1,500 now.\n\nThe therapy has even been featured on an episode of the TV series \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy.\u201d\n\nBut Dr. Ryan, a gastrointestinal oncologist, suggested in an interview that the procedure was being extended to because \u201cyou can\u2019t make a living doing this procedure in appendix cancer patients.\u201d\n\nHe debated the procedure publicly at the recent annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. While some patients did seem to live much longer than expected, he said that they had been carefully selected and might have fared well even without the therapy.\n\nProponents say that if cancer has spread into the abdominal cavity but not elsewhere, then lives can be prolonged by removing all the visible and killing what\u2019s missed with Hipec.\n\nBy contrast, said Dr. Paul Sugarbaker, a surgeon at Washington Hospital Center and the leading proponent of Hipec, \u201cthere are no long-term survivors with systemic chemotherapy \u2014 zero.\u201d\n\nDr. Sugarbaker, who opposed Dr. Ryan in the debate, said that it has long been known that cancerous cells are unable to withstand as much heat as healthy cells. And putting the chemotherapy on top of tumors should be more effective than systematically delivering it through the bloodstream.\n\nOne randomized trial done more than a decade ago involving 105 patients in the did show a striking benefit. The median survival of those getting surgery and Hipec, plus intravenous chemotherapy, was 22.3 months, almost double the 12.6 months for those getting only the intravenous chemotherapy. But 8 percent who got the surgery and Hipec died from the treatment itself. And critics say that since that trial was conducted, new drugs have come to market that allow patients with metastatic colorectal cancer to live two years with intravenous chemotherapy alone.\n\nA new trial in the has been temporarily suspended so that researchers can find a way to recruit patients. After nearly a year only one patient had enrolled, because people were reluctant to chance winding up in the control group, according to one of the investigators.\n\nWhile proponents contend that the risk of dying from the surgery has been reduced since the Dutch trial, the procedure still lasts eight hours or more and full recovery can take three to six months. \u201cIt\u2019s maximally invasive,\u201d said Dr. Sugarbaker, who often removes the \u201cspare parts\u201d \u2014 organs a patient can live without, like the spleen, the gall bladder, the ovaries and the uterus.\n\nThe cost of the surgery and Hipec, including hospitalization, ranges from $20,000 to more than $100,000, doctors said. While and insurers generally pay for the operation, the heated treatment may not be covered. But doctors added it may be if it is described merely as chemotherapy. Some patients, like Ms. Borges, who is a fitness devotee, recover well and say the procedure staved off a death sentence.\n\nBut Dr. Alan Venook, a colon cancer specialist at the , said that a couple of patients referred by him had \u201cdied miserable deaths. One lost much of her abdominal wall to infection and just died in misery.\u201d\n\nAnother risk is that the surgery may be done unnecessarily. CT scans cannot pick up many of the small tumors, so it is often unclear how much cancer is inside until the patient is opened.\n\nIn June, Dr. Lowy sliced open a woman and saw, to his horror, that she had more tumors than he could remove. Taking out only some would not improve her chances of survival, so he closed the incision, and she is now starting intravenous chemotherapy.\n\nThings with the male patient, Andy S., went better. A 41-year-old father of two from near , Mr. S. agreed to let a reporter observe the surgery, but asked that his full name not be published because he did not want his cancer history to surface through searches.\n\nMr. S. had eventually diagnosed as . But the appendix was found to be cancerous. Such cancers typically spew mucus containing tumor cells into the abdominal cavity. So he signed up for surgery and Hipec with Dr. Lowy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to say my goodbyes to everybody,\u201d Mr. S. said the day before the operation. \u201cI had to talk to my priest. I had to do all these things I never thought I\u2019d have to do at 41. I wouldn\u2019t wish it on my worst enemy, but I have to go through with it.\u201d\n\nDr. Lowy explored the entire cavity from the diaphragm to the pelvis. He found mucus in several spots that he sopped up with a cloth and also tiny tumors the size of a pencil eraser that had implanted in several spots. He snipped those out and sewed up the wounds. He removed the right side of the man\u2019s colon and the omentum, a fatty structure.\n\nThen two Y-shaped tubes hooked to the Hipec machine were inserted into the abdominal cavity, one to deliver the chemotherapy and the other to bring the drug back to the machine to be reheated. The incision was sewn up around the tubes so the chemotherapy would not leak.\n\nThe man\u2019s belly was filled with three liters of saline fluid and the chemotherapy, a generic drug called mitomycin C, heated to 42 degrees Celsius, or nearly 108 degrees Fahrenheit.

Where a CT scan can cost $800 to $1,500, Nordhoff predicts that the new test would cost closer to $150. The test would be available to hospitals, Nordhoff said, and he hopes a handheld sideline device could be commercially available in the near future. The FDA approved the test as part of its breakthrough devices program after evaluating a clinical study of 1,900 blood samples from people thought to have concussion or mild traumatic brain injury. The clinical trials did not include any children, though Banyan plans to include them in future studies. When compared with a CT scan, the blood test was 97.5% as effective in detecting concussion and 99.6% effective in ruling out concussion. \"A blood test that accurately, reliably and consistently detects the presence of brain proteins that appear in the blood after a brain injury is a major advance,\" said Dr. David Dodick, a fellow of the American Academy of Neurology who specializes in sports medicine and neurology. He was not involved in the development of the test. Though Dodick was optimistic about the blood test, he said a lot of work still needs to be done in understanding and diagnosing brain injury. He pointed out that we need better measurements to understand when brains have fully healed from trauma, as well as a better understanding of how these biomarkers act which may actually affect prognosis. It's also unknown how this test can determine subconcussive hits, \"hits that don't cause symptoms but do cause a brain injury,\" he explained. \"These occur much more often than actual concussions, especially in certain collision and contact sports,.\" Subconcussive or repeated hits to the head are believed to be the root of the neurodegenerative disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. In fact, Banyan has partnered with another company, Quanterix, to help develop a test that could eventually detect the impact of repeated hits. Quanterix aims to combine the biomarkers with Banyan with digital technology that can look at the proteins at a super microscopic level and pinpoint low level concentrations of the proteins. \"The key now is to use this sensitivity to evolve in more brain health and to protect athletes and keep soldiers out of harms way,\" said Kevin Hrusovsky, president and CEO of Quanterix.

EDT on APRIL 14, 2015) \u2013 An injection of stem cells into the eye may soon slow or reverse the effects of early-stage age-related macular degeneration, according to new research from scientists at Cedars-Sinai. Currently, there is no treatment that slows the progression of the disease, which is the leading cause of vision loss in people over 65.\n\n\u201cThis is the first study to show preservation of vision after a single injection of adult-derived human cells into a rat model with age-related macular degeneration,\u201d said Shaomei Wang, MD, PhD, lead author of the study published in the journal STEM CELLS and a research scientist in the Eye Program at the Cedars-Sinai Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute.\n\nThe stem cell injection resulted in 130 days of preserved vision in laboratory rats, which roughly equates to 16 years in humans. Age-related macular degeneration affects upward of 15 million Americans. It occurs when the small central portion of the retina, known as the macula, deteriorates. The retina is the light-sensing nerve tissue at the back of the eye. Macular degeneration may also be caused by environmental factors, aging and a genetic predisposition.\n\nWhen animal models with macular degeneration were injected with induced neural progenitor stem cells, which derive from the more commonly known induced pluripotent stem cells, healthy cells began to migrate around the retina and formed a protective layer. This protective layer prevented ongoing degeneration of the vital retinal cells responsible for vision.\n\nCedars-Sinai researchers in the Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) Core, directed by Dhruv Sareen, PhD, with support from the David and Janet Polak Foundation Stem Cell Core Laboratory, first converted adult human skin cells into powerful induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), which can be expanded indefinitely and then made into any cell of the human body. In this study, these induced pluripotent stem cells were then directed toward a neural progenitor cell fate, known as induced neural progenitor stem cells, or iNPCs.\n\n\u201cThese induced neural progenitor stem cells are a novel source of adult-derived cells which should have powerful effects on slowing down vision loss associated with macular degeneration,\u201d said Clive Svendsen, PhD, director of the Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute and contributing author to the study. \u201cThough additional pre-clinical data is needed, our institute is close to a time when we can offer adult stem cells as a promising source for personalized therapies for this and other human diseases.\u201d\n\nNext steps include testing the efficacy and safety of the stem cell injection in preclinical animal studies to provide information for applying for an investigational new drug. From there, clinical trials will be designed to test potential benefit in patients with later-stage age-related macular degeneration.\n\nThis work was supported by the Simon and Beathrice Apple Stem Cell Fund for Eye Research, the David and Janet Polak Foundation Stem Cell Core Laboratory; National Institutes of Health (R01 EY020488), Department of Defense (W81XWH-12-1-0617), Foundation Fighting Blindness and the Knights Templar Eye Foundation Inc.", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The release includes at the end a listing of funding sources for this research and there is no information to suggest any conflict of interest.\u00a0 The original research paper specifically states there are no conflicts.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "TUESDAY, March 27, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- When taken as a supplement, unroasted -- or green -- coffee-bean extract can help people shed pounds, according to a small preliminary study.\n\nThe research, which is being presented this week at the national meeting of the American Chemical Society in San Diego, involved just 16 overweight and obese patients who were given daily doses of green coffee extract in capsule form.\n\nAll the patients were instructed to maintain their usual dietary habits, while the study team monitored them for weight loss over a period of nearly six months.\n\nThe apparent result: Daily consumption of a small amount of green coffee extract translated into a nearly 11 percent drop in body weight, on average.\n\nThe study was conducted in India and funded by Applied Food Sciences, the American manufacturer of two green-coffee-extract products.

In one section, study participants, who were all between the ages of 22 and 26, consumed a capsule filled with 700 milligrams of green coffee extract. In the second section, participants took a 1,050-milligram capsule. The third section had participants taking a placebo. Each patient ultimately cycled through each section.\n\nWhile maintaining their pre-study dietary and exercise regimens, the patients lost an average of 17 pounds by the study's close. On average, patients lost 10.5 percent and 16 percent of their body weight and body fat, respectively.\n\n\"Basically, there was steady weight loss, without side effects, while the active green coffee extract was being taken at either dose,\" Vinson said.\n\nA follow-up study involving 60 patients is now in the planning stages.\n\nLona Sandon, a registered dietitian and assistant professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern in Dallas, cautioned that the study is short on specifics, making it difficult to draw any conclusions.\n\n\"First of all, you need more than 16 people to have any statistical significance attached to these findings,\" Sandon said. \"And we really have no idea how this might be working. For example, the patients were allowed to continue with their regular diet. But did this extract in any way influence their hunger and what they wanted to eat, and then what they actually ate? We don't know. What we have here is basically just a hypothesis that there's something about this compound that could be helpful.\"\n\n\"Just because it might cause weight loss doesn't mean it's healthy,\" she warned. \"Because supplements are not regulated as drugs, they can be put on the market with no safety or efficacy testing. They don't even necessarily have to be tested for purity.\"\n\n\"That means that in the past, various weight-loss supplements have been found to contain weight-loss drugs or other drugs at higher doses than what would be allowed in a prescription dose,\" Sandon added. \"So while people might have this perception that it's all natural since it's coming from a coffee bean, with supplements in general it's still a buyer-beware market.\"\n\nFor more on dietary supplements, visit the Office of Dietary Supplements of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "An independent expert commented on the wisdom (or lack thereof) of basing this story on a 16-person study described only in a yet-to-be-presented meeting abstract.

They are often obtained through diet by eating fish. But, concerns about mercury contamination in fish have led to recommendations that advise pregnant women to limit their fish consumption. Pregnant women are also advised to avoid certain fish, such as swordfish, altogether.\n\nTherefore, the current study looked at DHA supplements derived from algae. Ramakrishnan said there are no concerns about mercury contamination in DHA from algae.\n\nMore than 800 Mexican women were included in the study. Half were randomly selected to be in the treatment group while the other half received a daily placebo pill. The treatment group received 400 milligrams of DHA each day, beginning when they were between 18 and 22 weeks pregnant. Treatment continued at least until the birth of the baby.\n\nRamakrishnan said Mexican women tend to be deficient in DHA, much like many American women are.\n\nThe babies were assessed at 1, 3 and 6 months of age, and the mothers completed questionnaires about their babies' health. To aid their recall, the mothers were also asked to keep a diary, recording any illness symptoms.\n\nBabies in the DHA group had a 24 percent drop in the odds of having a combination of cold symptoms at 1 month compared to babies whose mothers were given a placebo. Also at 1 month, babies whose mothers had gotten the DHA supplement had 26 percent shorter duration of cough, 15 percent less time with phlegm and 30 percent shorter duration of wheezing.\n\nAt 3 months, babies in the DHA group were also sick 14 percent less time. And, at 6 months, the babies whose mothers had DHA had shorter duration of fever, runny nose and breathing problems.\n\nAt times, however, babies in the DHA group experienced longer duration of rashes and vomiting, the study authors noted.\n\nRamakrishnan said that it's likely that DHA boosts infants' immune response.\n\nDr. Jennifer Wu, an obstetrician and gynecologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said, \"We've been recommending DHA intake in pregnant women for brain and nervous system development, and this study suggests another good reason to take DHA.\"\n\nWu recommended that women who are thinking about becoming pregnant should \"start prenatal vitamins and DHA supplements about three months before pregnancy and then continue them throughout the pregnancy.

But patients may be hesitant to accept this potentially life-saving treatment because there are feces involved. Previous research found that while every part of this treatment was unappealing to most people, being offered the treatment in a pill form made patients significantly more open to the idea. Other efforts to take the \u201cpoop\u201d out of the poop pills\u2014to just include the bacteria thought to be behind the benefits\u2014have failed.\n\nThe 116 patients used in this study may have been selected in part because they were ideal candidates for FMTs, Dr. Elizabeth Hohmann noted, but she said the paper is solid overall.

Two-thirds of the 57 patients who got the pills said their experiences were \u201cnot at all unpleasant,\u201d while just 44 percent of the 59 patients who received the FMT via a colonoscopy could say the same.\n\nBut most importantly, the study found no difference in effectiveness between the two therapies. There was a significant difference in cost. Though the procedures were done in a Canadian hospital, the FMTs delivered by colonoscopy cost nearly $500 USD more than the capsules, which cost about $300.\n\nFMTs are not yet common practice, though Kao noted that it is becoming the standard of care for C. difficile infections. \u201cFor this group of patients, nothing else really works,\u201d she said. However, the same cannot be said yet for other conditions. While the FDA said in 2013 that doctors can try fecal transplants in patients with C. difficile infections, the agency noted doctors should only use FMT for other conditions in clinical trials. Over 100 clinical trials are ongoing for various FMT therapies, including ones to treat ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease in children.

This disrupts the normal function of MLL by creating a new \u201cfusion protein\u201d that behaves wrongly, switching on genes that drive the development of leukemia.\n\nKouzarides\u2019s team found that in the disease, the MLL-fusion proteins are targeted to leukemia-causing genes by proteins from the BET family, which recognize certain chemical \u201ctags\u201d on chromatin, the scaffold on which DNA is arranged.\n\nUsing I-BET151 to treat leukaemias in mice and human cancer cells in a lab, the researchers found that the chemical could halt the disease, paving the way for more research to be done in first-stage, or so-called Phase I, human trials.\n\n\u201cWe urgently need better ways to treat children with more aggressive forms of leukemia, such as MLL,\u201d said Lesley Walker, CRUK\u2019s director of information.\n\n\u201cAlthough this research is only in the lab at the moment, we hope it will move quickly toward clinical trials in patients.\u201d\n\nLeukemia is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in children and accounts for a around a third of all cancers diagnosed in children.

In 2013 alone, according to the American Cancer Society, more than 230,000 were given that diagnosis. Each one very likely came as a devastating blow, both to the patient and to her family.\n\nBut what if some of these cases are preventable? What if there was a medication that could at least reduce a woman\u2019s risk of developing breast cancer?\n\nThe Breast Cancer Prevention Trial published results in 1998 indicating that women who took one of those drugs, tamoxifen, were half as likely to develop breast cancer as similar women who did not take the drug.\n\nOther medications, including raloxifene and a class of drugs called aromatese inhibitors, do much the same thing, though the Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved aromatese inhibitors for this use. Studies estimate that more than 2 million American women at high risk for breast cancer could benefit from taking a preventive drug.\n\nBut few women are opting for this protection, which goes by the name chemoprevention. A 2010 study found \u201cexceptionally low\u201d rates of usage.\n\nIn part this may be because many doctors are not even discussing this option with their patients. A small 2014 study in the Journal of Women\u2019s Health found that only 13 percent of internal medicine, family medicine and gynecology physicians reported having recommended or prescribed these medications to women who might benefit from them.\n\nThe \u201clow uptake of these medications is a missed opportunity,\u201d says Heidi Nelson, a professor of medical informatics and clinical epidemiology at the Oregon Health & Science University in Portland. \u201cMany high-risk women . . . could reduce their risks for invasive cancer by approximately 30 to 50 percent.\u201d On the other hand, these drugs don\u2019t suit everyone, and they are not without risks of their own. Because some of the side effects are serious \u2014 such as blood clots in the legs and in the lungs, and, in the case of tamoxifen, uterine cancer \u2014 only women who are deemed to be at high risk for the disease should consider them. But there are conflicting views on who meets that \u201chigh risk\u201d definition\n\nChemoprevention should not be confused with chemotherapy. Although both involve taking drugs, chemoprevention medications are taken with the goal of avoiding breast cancer altogether and the subsequent need for chemotherapy later.\n\nAnd they work on the body differently. Chemotherapy kills off cells, healthy ones as well as cancercous ones. The chemoprevention drugs, by contrast, work by blocking estrogen, a hormone known to promote the growth of cancer cells in breast tissue. Chemoprevention drugs are called SERMs, or selective estrogen receptor modulators, and two have been approved specifically for breast cancer prevention: tamoxifen, which was developed to treat breast cancer after its onset and only later was found to have a preventive benefit, and raloxifene, which was designed to treat osteoporosis.\n\nA 2013 study in the Lancet analyzed data for more than 80,000 women taking tamoxifen or other SERM drugs. The researchers found an overall 38 percent reduction in new cases of breast cancer 10 years after women took these drugs compared with women who took a placebo. The effect was even larger during the first five years of the study.\n\nInvestigators working for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent group of scientists and clinicians funded by the government, echoed these results. After looking at multiple trials of tamoxifen and raloxifene, the task force noted that these drugs reduced new cases of breast cancer significantly: from 23 cases per 1,000 women in the control groups to 16 cases per 1,000 women in the treatment groups.\n\nNelson, one of the lead authors of the analysis, is \u201cconfident\u201d that these results show a true benefit. Others are more cautious.\n\nKenneth Lin, a family physician at Georgetown University who worked on developing the task force\u2019s SERM guidelines, notes that while SERMs may have reduced new cases, they \u201chave not been shown to reduce breast cancer mortality in any study or meta-analysis.\u201d One possible explanation, he says, is that \u201cthese drugs are effective at preventing nonlethal cancers rather than the more serious ones.\u201d\n\nNot used enough?\n\nGiven that these drugs seem to offer some protection, why are they not in widespread use? Serious side effects is one reason. Beyond blood clots and uterine cancer, other known reactions to the drugs include strokes, cataracts, bone pain, hot flashes, nausea and vaginal dryness.\n\nFor some women, the risk of such side effects may be worth taking, depending on their particular odds of developing breast cancer. Those odds can be figured by using a commonly used calculator, often called the Gail model, that estimates a woman\u2019s chances of having breast cancer in a five-year period and over a lifetime.\n\nBut this is where it gets more complicated. While many experts agree that women at high risk should consider the medications, they do not agree on what Gail score should trigger that consideration.\n\nThe studies that served as the basis for the FDA approval of the drugs, along with recently released guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), set the threshold at a five-year Gail score of 1.67 percent.\n\nThe Preventive Services Task Force, however, recommended a threshold of 3 percent. At that point, the panel said, women \u201care likely to have more benefit than harm from using tamoxifen or raloxifene.\u201d\n\nASCO\u2019s lower cutoff worries some experts. \u201cAt the 1.67 percent high-risk threshold,\u201d Georgetown\u2019s Lin says, \u201cevery woman age 62 and older would be [considered] high-risk.\u201d That might lead to a situation in which millions of women would be encouraged, unnecessarily,to consider this therapy, along with its potential harmful effects.\n\nKala Visvanathan, the lead author of the ASCO recommendations and a faculty member at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, said the cutoffs provide only a rough estimate of risk.\n\nIt is important to realize, she adds, that \u201cas the risk increases, the benefits tend to be greater. This is an evolving field, and our goal is to better discern who is at high and low risk of breast cancer and develop a greater range of prevention strategies.\u201d\n\nAn individual risk analysis should prompt conversation between doctor and patient about the potential benefits and the risk of the therapy.\n\nBoth the ASCO and the task force guidelines recommend such a conversation. \u201cThe discussion should include the specific risks and benefits associated with each chemopreventive agent,\u201d according to ASCO.\n\nThe task force similarly recommends that \u201cclinicians engage in a shared, informed decision making\u201d with women and said that clinicians \u201cshould offer to prescribe\u201d these drugs. Many risk factors increase a woman\u2019s chances of having side effects. These factors include older age, obesity, having a history of a blood clot, history of any cancer, immobility, history of certain autoimmune conditions, history of using estrogen or oral contraceptives and history of some form of heart disease.\n\nInsured women with a high risk for breast cancer and a low risk for side effects who try this therapy will not incur out-of-pocket costs, because this treatment was included in the Affordable Care Act as mandated, no-charge preventive care.\n\nSo what should a woman do?\n\nMost important, become familiar with your family history, know your risk factors and discuss them with your primary-care physician. Age and family history cannot be controlled, but lifestyle changes \u2014 including eating a healthful diet, exercising, not smoking and not overconsuming alcohol \u2014 are eminently doable and can reduce your risk. These basic tenets of leading a healthy lifestyle have been shown to be important factors in breast cancer prevention.\n\nVisvanathan and her colleagues are hopeful that more women will be aware of this option.\n\n\u201cA discussion on the use of preventive agents needs to become part of routine care in women at high risk,\u201d she says. \u201cWe should begin to implement preventive strategies based on what we already know.\u201d\n\nMishori is an associate professor of family medicine at the Georgetown University School of Medicine and director of the Health & Media fellowship.

These include physiotherapy methods, such as the Alexander Technique and the Feldenkrais Method, and the work of anthropologist Noelle Perez-Christiaens.\n\nBack pain is a tricky beast. Most Americans will at some point have a problem with their backs. And for an unlucky third, treatments won't work, and the problem will become chronic.\n\nBelieve it or not, there are a few cultures in the world where back pain hardly exists. One indigenous tribe in central India reported essentially none. And the discs in their backs showed little signs of degeneration as people aged.\n\nAn acupuncturist in Palo Alto, Calif., thinks she has figured out why. She has traveled around the world studying cultures with low rates of back pain \u2014 how they stand, sit and walk. Now she's sharing their secrets with back pain sufferers across the U.S.\n\nAbout two decades ago, Esther Gokhale started to struggle with her own back after she had her first child. \"I had excruciating pain. I couldn't sleep at night,\" she says. \"I was walking around the block every two hours. I was just crippled.\"\n\nGokhale had a herniated disc. Eventually she had surgery to fix it. But a year later, it happened again. \"They wanted to do another back surgery. You don't want to make a habit out of back surgery,\" she says.\n\nThis time around, Gokhale wanted to find a permanent fix for her back. And she wasn't convinced Western medicine could do that. So Gokhale started to think outside the box. She had an idea: \"Go to populations where they don't have these huge problems and see what they're doing.\"\n\n[Added June 10] So Gokhale studied findings from anthropologists, such as Noelle Perez-Christiaens, who analyzed postures of indigenous populations. And she studied physiotherapy methods, such as the Alexander Technique and the Feldenkrais Method.\n\nThen over the next decade, Gokhale went to cultures around the world that live far away from modern life. She went to the mountains in Ecuador, tiny fishing towns in Portugal and remote villages of West Africa.\n\n\"I went to villages where every kid under age 4 was crying because they were frightened to see somebody with white skin \u2014 they'd never seen a white person before,\" she says.\n\nGokhale took photos and videos of people who walked with water buckets on their heads, collected firewood or sat on the ground weaving, for hours.\n\n\"I have a picture in my book of these two women who spend seven to nine hours everyday, bent over, gathering water chestnuts,\" Gokhale says. \"They're quite old. But the truth is they don't have a back pain.\"\n\nShe tried to figure out what all these different people had in common. The first thing that popped out was the shape of their spines. \"They have this regal posture, and it's very compelling.\"\n\nAnd it's quite different than American spines.\n\nIf you look at an American's spine from the side, or profile, it's shaped like the letter S. It curves at the top and then back again at the bottom.\n\nBut Gokhale didn't see those two big curves in people who don't have back pain. \"That S shape is actually not natural,\" she says. \"It's a J-shaped spine that you want.\"\n\nIn fact, if you look at drawings from Leonardo da Vinci \u2014 or a Gray's Anatomy book from 1901 \u2014 the spine isn't shaped like a sharp, curvy S. It's much flatter, all the way down the back. Then at the bottom, it curves to stick the buttocks out. So the spine looks more like the letter J.\n\n\"The J-shaped spine is what you see in Greek statues. It's what you see in young children. It's good design,\" Gokhale says.\n\nSo Gokhale worked to get her spine into the J shape. And gradually her back pain went away.\n\nThen Gokhale realized she could help others. She developed a set of exercises, wrote a book and set up a studio in downtown Palo Alto.\n\nNow her list of clients is impressive. She's helped YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki and Matt Drudge of the Drudge Report. She has given classes at Google, Facebook and companies across the country. In Silicon Valley, she's known as the \"posture guru.\"\n\nEach year, doctors in the Bay Area refer hundreds of patients to Gokhale. One of them is Dr. Neeta Jain, an internist at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation. She puts Gokhale's method in the same category as Pilates and yoga for back pain. And it doesn't bother her that the method hasn't been tested in a clinical trial.\n\n\"If people are finding things that are helpful, and it's not causing any harm, then why do we have to wait for a trial?\" Jain asked.\n\nBut there's still a big question looming here: Is Gokhale right? Have people in Western cultures somehow forgotten the right way to stand?\n\nScientists don't know yet, says Dr. Praveen Mummaneni, a neurosurgeon at the University of California, San Francisco's Spine Center. Nobody has done a study on traditional cultures to see why some have lower rates of back pain, he says. Nobody has even documented the shape of their spines.\n\n\"I'd like to go and take X-rays of indigenous populations and compare it to people in the Western world,\" Mummaneni says. \"I think that would be helpful.\"\n\nBut there's a whole bunch of reasons why Americans' postures \u2014 and the shape of their spines \u2014 may be different than those of indigenous populations, he says. For starters, Americans tend to be much heavier.\n\n\"If you have a lot of fat built up in the belly, that could pull your weight forward,\" Mummaneni says. \"That could curve the spine. And people who are thinner probably have less curvature\" \u2014 and thus a spine shaped more like J than than an S.\n\nAmericans are also much less active than people in traditional cultures, Mummaneni says. \"I think the sedentary lifestyle promotes a lack of muscle tone and a lack of postural stability because the muscles get weak.\"\n\nEveryone knows that weak abdominal muscles can cause back pain. In fact, Mummaneni says, stronger muscles might be the secret to Gokhale's success.\n\nIn other words, it's not that the J-shaped spine is the ideal one \u2014 or the healthiest. It's what goes into making the J-shaped spine that matters: \"You have to use muscle strength to get your spine to look like a J shape,\" he says.\n\nSo Gokhale has somehow figured out a way to teach people to build up their core muscles without them even knowing it. \"Yes, I think that's correct,\" Mummaneni says. \"You're not going to be able to go from the S- to the J-shaped spine without having good core muscle strength. And I think that's key here.\"\n\nSo indigenous people around the world don't have a magic bullet for stopping back pain. They've just got beefy abdominal muscles, and their lifestyle helps to keep them that way, even as they age.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "In addition to Esther Gokhale, the story cites two physicians.

We need to better understand the biology behind the treatment and follow patients for long-term side effects,\" Robert E. Ratner, MD, chief scientific and medical officer of the American Diabetes Association, tells WebMD.\n\nThis is the latest of several stem cell studies to show promising results for the treatment of type 1 diabetes, Ratner notes.\n\nIn the new study, 15 of 28 teens with type 1 diabetes who got an experimental treatment using their own stem cells went into remission and did not need insulin injections for an average of about 1.5 years.\n\nThe \"cocktail treatment\" combines stem cell therapy with drugs that suppress the body's immune system.

The task force's guidelines are important because insurers and government programs often follow the panel's recommendations in deciding whether to cover certain preventive services.\n\nThe task force's final recommendation is likely to be controversial because some other groups say the screening should start earlier. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, for example, recommends that regular screenings begin at age 40, while the American Cancer Society calls for women to start yearly screening at age 45 and then move to screening every two years starting at age 55.\n\nCongress has sided with proponents of earlier screening. Last month, in anticipation of Monday's release of the task force\u2019s final recommendation, lawmakers took preemptive action: It directed insurers to ignore the task force's latest guidelines and, instead, to rely on its 2002 recommendation. That called for annual mammograms to begin at 40. As a result of the congressional action, women in their 40s will continue to be able to get annual mammograms at no cost.\n\nThe differences over when to start regular screening reflect the growing concern that the benefits of mammograms may have been oversold, and that they don't outweigh the anxiety and potential harm caused by over-diagnosis and false positives from the tests.\n\n[In major shift, these guidelines scaled back breast cancer screening for women in their 40s]\n\nThe debate over when to start regular screening involves only women of \"average risk\" who don't have specific risk factors for breast cancer such as the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic mutations or a family history of the disease. They're also not aimed at diagnostic mammography, which takes place once a woman has a symptom such as a lump. The screening recommendations are not binding on doctors, hospitals or insurers.\n\nIn releasing its final recommendations, the task force confirmed an earlier guidance it issued that said screening mammography had the greatest benefit for women ages 50 to 74. For women in their 40s, the likelihood of benefit is less and the potential harms are proportionally greater, it said. The most serious potential harm is unneeded treatment for a type of cancer that would not have become a threat to a woman's health during her lifetime.\n\nThe congressional action, which was included in the recently enacted spending law, has drawn criticism from some experts.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Congress thinks it's perfectly acceptable, even preferred, for a scientific document from 14 years ago to guide coverage policy on screening for breast cancer in women,\u201d says Kenneth Lin, a Georgetown University family medicine doctor who teaches preventive and evidence-based medicine.\n\nPart of the problem is the common perception that women deserve free mammogram coverage and that the scientific community is basing its decision on cost or rationing, said Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University law professor and expert on public health.\n\nFran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, said the task force's guidelines for women in their 40s \u2014 that they should discuss whether to get mammograms with their doctors and make individual decisions \u2014 come closest to following the evidence accumulated over the past three decades. Women should trust that process, she said.\n\nDespite the decades of marketing of mammography to women, \"women are capable of understanding the complexities of the issue, evaluating the evidence and making their own health decisions,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\"At some point we will have to decide that we are not going to pay for interventions that lack a high level of medical evidence,\" she said. \"At this time, what does concern us very much are attempts by Congress to interfere with the makeup and process of the US Preventive Services Task Force.\"\n\nThe task force first suggested in 2009 that breast cancer screening begin at 50 instead of 40, touching off enormous criticism. In 2010, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, which required that certain preventive services be provided for free \u2014 if those services got a strong recommendation from the task force. But it included an amendment that effectively directed insurers to use the 2002 recommendations for mammograms. That meant that women who were 40 and older could get mammograms at no cost.\n\nIn April 2015, the task force came out with its latest draft guidance, basically reaffirming its 2009 recommendations that the greatest benefit of mammography screening is for women between 50 and 74.\n\nWorried that millions of women under 50 could lose their free annual mammogram coverage if the guidelines became final, several health-care groups, including ACOG, the American College of Radiology and the Susan G. Komen Foundation, lobbied Congress to block that from happening.\n\nLanguage was included in the spending bill that says any recommendations of the task force related to breast cancer screening, mammography and prevention refers to those \u201cissued before 2009.\u201d\n\nSen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) was among the lawmakers who pushed for the language to be included. In a statement, she said her number one priority was to ensure that women can get mammograms if they and their doctors decide it's the right thing to do. \"This means making sure that cost is not a deterrent to care,\" she said.\n\nSeveral groups that lobbied for congressional action said in a statement last month that the task force recommendations conflict with those of other organizations. This results in confusion and puts more than 22 million women at risk of losing of losing insurance coverage for mammograms.\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nThe simple way doctors can make patients feel understood\n\nHow cancer will affect Americans in 2016: in seven charts\n\nOmega 3 is still good for the brain.

Nearly all modern vaccines are given via injection, according to background information in a news release about the study, which is published in the Jan. 17 issue of Nature Medicine.\n\nIn a series of tests, the Brigham and Women's Hospital researchers also found that the memory of T-cells -- the cells that mount an immune response against invading viruses -- may be more important than the antibodies generated by injected vaccines. T-cells are located in lymph nodes and blood, as well as in peripheral tissues such as skin and lung.\n\n\"This research illustrates the remarkable capacity of the most superficial layer of skin to generate powerful protective immune responses after vaccination,\" study senior researcher Dr. Thomas Kupper, chairman of the dermatology department at the hospital, said in a news release from the hospital.\n\n\"The ability of vaccination through injured epidermis -- or scarification -- to generate such powerful tissue-resident protective T-cells is a completely novel observation that should make us reconsider the way we think about vaccine delivery for all infectious diseases, as well as cancer. After all, our immune system evolved over millions of years to respond to infections of injured skin, not vaccines delivered by hypodermic syringe into muscle,\" he noted.\n\nIn their experiments, Kupper and colleagues found that scarification with the vaccinia virus offered much greater protection against smallpox than injecting the vaccine. They also found that a melanoma vaccine delivered by scarification was much more effective than injected vaccines in protecting animals against melanoma tumor growth.\n\n\"The lessons we are learning from these studies of vaccination by scarification could help us develop new and more powerful vaccines for influenza, HIV, malaria and other infectious diseases,\" Kupper explained. \"We should also continue to explore the implications for developing powerful cancer vaccines, like the one demonstrated by melanoma vaccine results in this study.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has more about vaccines.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "There were no independent sources \u2013 only quotes from a lead investigator in a news release.

A patient can perform the inexpensive and simple test while a time-strapped primary-care physician tends to other patients. The 10-minute, non\u00adinvasive examination can detect subtle lapses in the brain\u2019s perceptual ability that may signal the early stages of mental decline caused by dementia.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s approval to market the device comes as Alzheimer\u2019s researchers everywhere step up the pursuit for easier and more inexpensive ways to identify dementia in its earliest stages.\n\n[Scientists are cautiously optimistic about progress toward finding treatments for Alzheimer\u2019s disease]\n\n\u201cLook, there is a late-life tsunami of late-life cognitive decline coming at us, and health-care providers are standing on the beach,\u201d said Charles J. Duffy, a neurology professor at the University of Rochester Medical Center who founded the company. \u201cWhat we are all about is making cognitive care part of primary care.\u201d\n\nMore than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the leading cause of dementia. That number is expected to reach 13.5 million by 2050, according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association. With the United States shifting toward an older society, the hope is that earlier detection can lead to earlier intervention to slow or arrest the disease, perhaps through medications working their way to the market or changes in lifestyle. In addition to Alzheimer\u2019s, a person\u2019s mental competency can be hindered by other conditions, such as untreated diabetes, thyroid conditions or toxic interactions among prescription medications.\n\nDuffy said his tool holds promise as a relatively inexpensive and easy way to test people\u2019s memory and ability to think.\n\nWith Cognivue, patients sit before a video screen that shows a series of images, such as a group of dots, that move around and fluctuate in clarity. Using a rotary-shaped mouse called a manipulandum, the patients try to follow the dots with a wedge-shaped cursor. The task becomes more difficult, especially for people with early stages of dementia, as the dots move around, changing their direction, speed and intensity.\n\n\u201cAll perception is interpretive, and so what we\u2019re doing is measuring that process,\u201d Duffy said. Other parts of the test challenge memory recall or the ability to recognize letters and shapes.\n\nCerebral Assessment Systems\u2019 device received de novo approval from the FDA, a streamlined process for reviewing medical devices that appear to be new enough to have no equivalent and pose little risk.\n\nThe Pittsford, N.Y.-based company\u2019s FDA application included data from a comparative study involving 401 people recruited from 13 communities for older adults. The subjects, ranging in age from 55 to 95, were classified in three groups based on cognitive abilities: normal, mild cognitive impairment and impaired. Their performance on the Cognivue device was compared to their scores on an existing cognitive assessment test known as the St. Louis University Mental Status Examination (SLUMS).\n\nThe device would be available only for use by medical professionals as part of a more comprehensive assessment of cognitive function. It is not intended to be a standalone diagnostic tool, and its effectiveness for people with less than 12 years of education is not proven.\n\nLinda M. Rice, a primary-care internist with about 1,200 patients in her Rochester practice, said that after a year of using the device in her clinic, she is convinced of its worth. About half of her patients are older than 65, and they often have questions about memory loss and their cognitive abilities.\n\nBut her options for rating their performance involve administering the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) , also known as the Folstein test, that uses a 30-point questionnaire. The test, which has been around since 1975, offers only a broad indication of cognitive abilities and fails to pick up borderline problems, she said.\n\n\u201cYou have to be pretty bad to do poorly on this exam,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the alternative involves referring patients for a battery of neuropsychiatric tests that can take hours to complete and cost $1,000 or more.

The report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Friday also came with good news: Testing of vaccines for swine flu show that they work with a single dose and take effect rapidly.\n\nSupplies of swine flu vaccine are expected to be available in mid-October. But the seasonal flu vaccine is available now, and officials are encouraging people to get it.\n\nDr. Anne Schuchat of the CDC says the swine flu broke out in the spring and \"never went away.\" Currently 98 percent of the flu viruses circulating are swine flu. Schuchat says cases are mainly in children and young adults.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2013 Fighting the swine flu may have gotten more manageable.\n\nAustralian and U.S. researchers said Thursday that one dose of the new swine flu vaccine looks strong enough to protect adults \u2013 and can begin protection within 10 days of the shot.\n\nAustralian drug maker CSL Ltd. published results of a study that found 75 percent to 96 percent of vaccinated people should be protected with a single dose \u2013 the same degree of effectiveness as the regular winter flu shot. That's remarkable considering scientists thought it would take two doses.\n\nU.S. data to be released Friday confirm those findings and show the protection starts rapidly, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health told The Associated Press.\n\n\"This is quite good news,\" Fauci said.\n\nThe dose question has an important ramification: It means people will have to line up for influenza vaccinations twice this year instead of three times \u2013 once for the regular winter flu shot and a second time to be inoculated against swine flu, what doctors call the 2009 H1N1 strain.\n\nThursday's swine flu vaccine reports center on adults; studies in children aren't finished yet.\n\nBut scientists had feared that people of all ages would need two shots about a month apart because the new H1N1 strain is so genetically different from normally circulating flu strains that most of the population has little if any immunity.\n\nChinese manufacturers gave the first hint a week ago that one dose could be enough. But different manufacturers make different formulations of the vaccine, so more evidence was needed.\n\nThus the CSL study, rushed out by the New England Journal of Medicine late Thursday, is welcome news. In a study of 240 adults, half younger than 50 and half over, one shot prompted the same kind of immune response indicating protection that is seen with regular flu vaccine. And a standard 15-microgram dose \u2013 not the double dose that also was tested \u2013 was enough.\n\nCSL, which is one U.S. vaccine supplier, found the same side effects in its study that people experience with regular flu vaccine, which is no surprise since this shot is merely a recipe change from the annual standby. About 45 percent of recipients had mild reactions such as a headache, sore arm or redness at the shot site.\n\nOn Friday, the NIH is set to release results of its own studies of hundreds of adults that confirm that one shot works, Fauci said. Plus, the U.S. work shows that people are protected eight to 10 days after that inoculation, he said.\n\nOne dose means tight supplies of H1N1 vaccine won't be stretched so thin after all. The U.S. has ordered 195 million doses, based on the hope that 15 micrograms was indeed the right dose. Had it taken twice that dosage, or two shots apiece, half as many people could have received the vaccine.\n\nThe winter flu vaccine is widely available now, and U.S. health authorities urged people to get it out of the way now before swine flu shots start arriving in mid-October.\n\nDespite all the headlines about swine flu, which has become the main influenza strain circulating in the world, doctors do expect some garden-variety flu to hit this fall too \u2013 the kind that every year kills 36,000 Americans and hospitalizes 200,000.\n\n\"Take some individual responsibility to stay healthy during the flu season,\" said Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who scheduled her own seasonal shot for Friday.

Now a study published in the journal Circulation confirms and quantifies that benefit; women who ate three or more servings of blueberries and strawberries per week reduced their risk of heart attack by up to one third.\n\nIn the study, researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health and the University of East Anglia in the U.K. analyzed data from 93,600 women ages 25 to 42 enrolled in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study II. For 18 years, the women filled out surveys detailing their diets at four-year intervals.\n\nDuring the study the women experienced 405 heart attacks. But women who consumed the most blueberries and strawberries had a 32% reduced risk of heart attack compared with the women who ate berries once a month or less. The women who ate more berries also tended to eat healthier overall, consuming more vegetables and fruits than those who didn\u2019t eat as many berries; but when the scientists broke down the women\u2019s diets, they found that the highest consumers of berries even had a lower risk of heart attack compared with women who still ate plenty of fruits and vegetables but fewer berries. The effect remained even after the researchers adjusted for other things that can influence heart-disease risk, such as obesity, high blood pressure, smoking, low levels of physical activity and a family history of heart disease.\n\n\u201cThese foods can be readily incorporated into diets, and simple dietary changes could have an impact in reducing risk of heart disease in younger women,\u201d says study author Aedin Cassidy from the University of East Anglia. \u201cThis supports growing lab data showing that these compounds can help keep arteries healthy and flexible.\u201d\n\nSo what is it about berries that help the heart? The researchers focused on blueberries and strawberries because these are the most widely consumed varieties in the U.S. Both berries contain high levels of anthocyanins, as well as other flavonoids, which fight the effects of stress and free-radical damage to cells as they age. They can also keep heart vessels more elastic and flexible, which helps combat the growth of plaques that can build up and rupture, causing heart attacks.\n\nThe results are particularly encouraging because they showed that a change in diet could affect heart-disease risk for relatively young women. That means that regular consumption of berries might be a relatively easy way to lower a woman\u2019s risk of having a heart attack later in life, possibly even insulating her from heart problems. \u201cAlthough we know about the effects of antioxidants and flavonoids, and their effects in wine and chocolate, it is interesting to look at their effects in such a large group of women over a long period of time,\u201d says Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, director of women and heart disease at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThe take-home lesson is that even if you are eating these early in life, you\u2019re getting benefits that last for life.

While current surgical options, such as the 'gold standard' surgery, Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP), can be very effective in relieving symptoms, they can also leave patients with permanent side effects such as urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction and retrograde ejaculation (dry orgasm).\n\nThe UroLift System provides an alternative to tissue removing surgery for the treatment of an enlarged prostate. Performed through the urethra, an urologist uses the UroLift System to push aside the obstructive prostate lobes and positions small, tailored permanent UroLift implants to hold the prostate lobes in the retracted position. This opens the urethra while leaving the prostate intact. Adverse reactions associated with UroLift System treatment were comparable to other minimally invasive surgical therapies as well as standard cystoscopy. The most common adverse events reported during the study included pain or burning with urination, blood in the urine, pelvic pain, urgent need to urinate, and the inability to control urine because of an urgent need to urinate. Most symptoms were mild to moderate in severity and resolved within two to four weeks after the procedure.\n\nRead more about urology care at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The release is silent on issues related to conflict of interest.

Even individuals with normal levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), known as the so-called \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol, but still at risk, seem to be identified, according to Mayo Clinic research being presented at the American College of Cardiology\u2019s 66th Annual Scientific Session.\n\nThe test, released commercially by Mayo Medical Laboratories in August 2016, measures blood concentrations of plasma ceramides, a class of lipids that are highly linked to cardiovascular disease processes. The study found that individuals with the highest levels of blood ceramides were found to have a 3- to 4-times greater risk of having a cardiovascular event compared with those with the lowest ceramide score, regardless of their LDL cholesterol level or the presence of a blockage in the heart\u2019s arteries.\n\n\u201cOur research suggests that evaluating ceramide levels in patients who are not at immediate risk for coronary artery disease events may help cardiologists decide who could benefit from proactive and preventive treatment, such as statins, or lifestyle changes to prevent a serious cardiac event down the road,\u201d says Jeff Meeusen, Ph.D., a clinical chemist, co-director of Cardiovascular Laboratory Medicine at Mayo Clinic and the study\u2019s lead author.\n\nAccording to Dr. Meeusen, ceramides are different than cholesterol, which gathers and causes a clog in the arteries. Ceramides are more active, attracting inflammatory cells and promoting clotting.\n\nIn the study, 499 Mayo Clinic patients who were referred for coronary angiography to check for possible artery blockages were included and followed prospectively for approximately eighteen years. Patients were similar in age and with regard to blood pressure, smoking status and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), the \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol; excluded were those who had diabetes or a previous heart attack, stroke or procedure to open narrowed coronary arteries. Researchers measured four different types of ceramides in the blood at baseline and combined the values into a 12-point scale. Patients were grouped into four risk categories according to their ceramide levels: low (0\u20132), intermediate (3\u20136), moderate (7\u20139) and high (10\u201312).\n\nOver the eighteen years, researchers recorded occurrences of heart attack, stroke, revascularization and death. Overall, 5.1 percent of patients had a major cardiovascular event each year. But the risk of having an event became higher as ceramide level increased; for each 1-point increase in the ceramide risk score, the risk rose by 9 percent. The rate of events was double among people with the highest ceramide score compared with those with the lowest (8.1 vs. 4.1 percent, respectively).\n\nIn patients without coronary artery disease following angiography, the rate of cardiovascular events was only 3.1 percent, lower than the average overall. But when researchers examined cardiovascular disease in this population by ceramide scores, people with the highest levels of ceramides were four times more likely to have an event compared with those with the lowest (7.8 vs. 2.2 percent, respectively). A similar trend was seen among people with low LDL levels (<100 mg/dL), typically considered a good LDL target. In this group, the rate of heart attack, stroke and revascularization and death was 3.7 percent among those with a low ceramide score, but 16.4 percent in people with the highest ceramide levels.\n\n\u201cThere is a need to identify patients at increased risk for cardiovascular events so that we can test strategies to prevent those events. This test seems to provide such information,\u201d says Allan S. Jaffe, M.D., senior author of the study, cardiologist at Mayo Clinic and chair of the Division of Clinical Core Laboratory Services.\n\nThe trial was funded by Mayo Clinic. The new test is available to health care providers worldwide through Mayo Medical Laboratories, which offers laboratory testing and pathology services to more than 4,000 health care organizations in more than 70 countries. Mayo Medical Laboratories collaborated with some of the original researchers who established the role of ceramides in cardiovascular disease and Zora Biosciences Oy, a diagnostics discovery company based in Finland, to develop and refine the test.

The result was a requirement that a hospital should be doing at least 50 surgical aortic valve replacements a year to have access to the technology.

Is this stuff working?\" said Stevens, 48, of La Jolla, Calif. \"Your whole life is in sort of a limbo.\"\n\nDoctors typically must wait weeks or months to see if a treatment is shrinking tumors or at least halting their growth. But researchers are exploring a new use for medical imaging that could shorten the stay in purgatory, possibly revealing within a few days whether chemo is working.\n\nThat speed could save both lives and money. It would allow doctors to switch more quickly from an ineffective drug to a different one, and save health care dollars by waving doctors off expensive but futile treatments.\n\nThe same approach may also prove useful for monitoring radiation therapy.\n\nThis experimental imaging relies on a familiar hospital workhorse: PET scans, typically used for things like detecting cancer or revealing the effects of a heart attack. Unlike CT scans or MRIs, PET scans can show a tumor's internal activity, not just its size.\n\nWhen used to assess the effects of cancer treatment, it can reveal inside information about what the therapy is doing to a tumor even when there's no outward sign.\n\nTo do a PET scan, doctors inject a patient with a radioactive substance that shows up on the scan in places where certain processes are happening \u2013 like hungry cancer cells gobbling up a lot of blood sugar. Think of it as looking around your neighborhood late at night for light in bedroom windows to see who is still awake.\n\nMany cancer patients get PET scans now to assess their disease before treatment, or to spot recurrences later on. But except for lymphoma, PET scans aren't routinely used to get a quicker answer on how cancers are responding to therapy.\n\nThe new research tests both standard PET scans and a newer approach that involves injecting a different tracer substance.\n\nThe standard scan, which looks for blood sugar usage, has gotten good results in tests with a variety of tumors including breast, prostate, colorectal and esophageal cancers, said Dr. Steven Larson of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.\n\n\"I think it's going to be extremely valuable for most tumors where there are effective treatments,\" he said. Some experiments have revealed chemo's effects within 10 days to two weeks.\n\nAs a practical matter, the goal of researchers is to convince federal regulators to cover the procedure under Medicare and Medicaid, which would open the door to routine use. That might take two or three years, he said.\n\nFarther out on the research horizon is a PET scan that uses injections of a different radioactive material and has revealed chemotherapy's impact even faster. Larson figures it will be especially useful for assessing newer drugs that aim to stop a patient's cancer from growing rather than killing the tumor.\n\nThis scan is called FLT PET, after radioactive fluorothymidine. These scans show whether cancer cells are dividing. Uncontrolled division is a hallmark of active cancer, and stopping that division should be an early effect of successful chemotherapy.\n\n\"Our hope ... is you might be able to give a single dose of a chemotherapy agent and within a day or two figure out whether the tumor is going to respond,\" says Dr. Michael Graham of the University of Iowa.\n\nIf the tumor doesn't respond, doctors would \"go on to Plan B,\" he said. \"This is really ... giving us the ability to tailor the therapy to the disease.\"\n\nResearch into FLT PET is still in the early stages. Graham said there are maybe a dozen published human studies so far, most involving too few patients to draw a firm conclusion.\n\nOne report that impressed him involved 28 patients in Korea who were treated for advanced lung cancer \u2013 just like Stevens, who had to wait six weeks to learn whether it was working. The researchers reported that just one week after treatment began, they could tell with 93 percent certainty which patients would eventually respond to the drug and which would not.\n\nIn a much smaller study at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, seven patients with acute myeloid leukemia were scanned at various times during a week of aggressive chemotherapy. Normally, doctors wait a month after chemo is stopped to see if it worked. But the FLT PET scans offered an answer as soon as a day after treatment started.\n\n\"It's always hard to get too excited about a study that just involves seven people,\" said Dr. Mark Juckett, one of the authors. But \"in these few patients, it looked like we could predict those who were going to respond well to chemotherapy and those who weren't.\"\n\nOther preliminary studies suggest the new PET technology might be useful in gauging treatment for breast and brain cancers as well as lymphoma.\n\nGraham figures there's a good chance FLT PET scans will become routine for assessing therapy in the next 10 years.\n\n\"It's a terrible waste of money to spend thousands and thousands of dollars on these patients when it doesn't do any good,\" he said.\n\nGraham, president-elect of the Society of Nuclear Medicine, has been involved in discussions between the society and drug companies about incorporating FLT PET in their studies of experimental cancer drugs.\n\nThe hope is that, over time, FLT PET would prove reliable for giving a faster answer on whether an experimental treatment is working. That would save companies a lot of money, because they could spot ineffective drugs more quickly and not waste further research on them. And the drug company research would produce data to help persuade federal regulators to approve FLT PET for use in tracking therapy.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Sources include: \nNo independent sources are consulted to provide context or less enthusiastic viewpoints.\nThe story did not report whether any of the sources has a financial conflict of interest. \u00a0 ", "answer": 0}, {"article": "An improved therapy to replace essential steroids in the body is a step closer thanks to new research.\n\nThe new treatment - expected to have fewer side effects than existing therapies - could help people with disorders of the adrenal gland whose bodies are unable to produce a class of steroids called corticosteroids.\n\nCorticosteroids are involved in a wide range of physiological processes in the body, including regulating metabolism, blood pressure and helping the body to cope with physical stress.\n\nThe therapy could help people with conditions such as Addison's disease and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, who need steroid treatment to avoid the risk of potentially fatal illness during physical stress.\n\nTreatment usually involves replacing one of the steroids they are unable to produce - called cortisol - with a medication.

Until now, there has been little research into its activity.\n\nIn a mouse study, the team showed that the effects of corticosterone on fat cells were reduced compared with cortisol.

He got every treatment offered by Veterans Affairs for post-traumatic stress disorder. But they didn\u2019t stop him from trying to kill himself \u2014 five times.\n\nFinally, he signed up for an experimental therapy and was given a little green capsule. The anguish stopped.\n\nInside that pill was the compound MDMA, better known by dealers and partygoers as ecstasy. That street drug is emerging as the most promising tool in years for the military\u2019s escalating PTSD epidemic.\n\nThe MDMA program was created by a small group of psychedelic researchers who had toiled for years in the face of ridicule, funding shortages and skepticism. But the results have been so positive that this month the Food and Drug Administration deemed it a \u201cbreakthrough therapy\u201d \u2014 setting it on a fast track for review and potential approval.\n\nThe prospect of a government-sanctioned psychedelic drug has generated both excitement and concern. And it has opened the door to scientists studying new uses for other illegal psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin (commonly known as magic mushrooms).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in this odd situation where one of the most promising therapies also happens to be a Schedule 1 substance banned by the [Drug Enforcement Administration],\u201d said retired Brig. Gen. Loree Sutton, who until 2010 was the highest-ranking psychiatrist in the U.S. Army.\n\nBecause of the stigma attached to psychedelics since the trippy 1960s, many military and government leaders still hesitate to embrace them. Some scientists are also wary of the nonprofit spearheading ecstasy therapy, a group with the stated goal of making the banned drugs part of mainstream culture.\n\nBut the scope and severity of PTSD makes it all irrelevant, said Sutton, who now works as New York City\u2019s commissioner of veteran services. \u201cIf this is something that could really save lives, we need to run and not walk toward it. We need to follow the data.\u201d\n\nPTSD has been a problem for the military for decades, but America\u2019s recent wars have pushed it to epidemic-level heights. Experts estimate that between 11 and 20 percent of soldiers who served in Iraq or Afghanistan suffer from PTSD.\n\nThe affliction is typically triggered after experiencing or witnessing violence, including assault and abuse. It has ravaged lives and broken up marriages. It often leaves its victims in sudden panic and prevents them from dealing with the original trauma.\n\nAnd that last symptom is what makes PTSD particularly hard to overcome with traditional talk therapy. Because patients can\u2019t talk about and process the trauma, experts say, it lingers like a poison in their mind.\n\nOnly two drugs are approved for treating PTSD: Zoloft and Paxil. Both have proved largely ineffective when it comes to veterans, whose cases are especially difficult to resolve because of their prolonged or repeated exposure to combat.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a combat veteran with multiple tours of duty, the chance of a good response to these drugs is 1 in 3, maybe lower,\u201d said John Krystal, chairman of psychiatry at Yale University and a director at the VA\u2019s National Center for PTSD. \u201cThat\u2019s why there\u2019s so much frustration and interest in finding something that works better.\u201d\n\nEcstasy has long been a favorite at trance parties and raves because of its unique ability to flood users with intense feelings of euphoria. But as a byproduct, it also reduces fear and imbues users with a deep sense of love and acceptance of themselves and others \u2014 the perfect conditions for trauma therapy.\n\nBy giving doses of MDMA at the beginning of three, eight-hour therapy sessions, researchers say they have helped chronic PTSD patients process and move past their traumas.\n\nIn clinical trials with 107 patients closely monitored by the FDA, 61 percent reported major reductions in symptoms \u2014 to the point where they no longer fit the criteria for PTSD. Follow-up studies a year later found 67 percent no longer had PTSD.\n\n\u201cIf you were to design the perfect drug to treat PTSD, MDMA would be it,\u201d said Rick Doblin, who three decades ago founded the California nonprofit behind the clinical trials.\n\nIt is no accident that the group \u2014 the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) \u2014 chose PTSD as its argument for ending the government\u2019s ban on psychedelics.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to help a population that would automatically win public sympathy,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to argue against the need to help them.\u201d\n\nDoblin, now 63, talks openly about his own history with drugs. He began tripping on LSD as a rebellious, long-haired college freshman in the 1970s. He says it helped him see the world and himself in new ways. He wanted to become a therapist and use psychedelics to help others achieve similar insights, but he couldn\u2019t because LSD was already banned.\n\n\u201cThe flaw of the early psychedelic movement was that they made it countercultural, a revolution,\u201d he said. \u201cCulture is dominant. Culture is always going to win.\u201d\n\nFor a decade, he worked in construction until he came across MDMA for the first time. When the DEA moved to criminalize it in 1984, Doblin created MAPS and sued the agency. The lawsuit failed, and Doblin realized that psychedelics were perceived as too fringe to win public support.\n\nTo succeed, he decided, both he and the issue had to go mainstream.\n\nDoblin talked his way into the public policy PhD program at Harvard University and learned to navigate the federal bureaucracy. He shaved off his mustache, cut his shaggy hair and learned to dress up.\n\n\u201cI used to laugh about how simple it was,\u201d he said. \u201cYou put on a suit, and suddenly everyone thinks you\u2019re fine.\u201d\n\nThe external switch reflected an internal one as well. Instead of fighting government officials, he began plotting to win them over, especially those at the FDA.\n\nAnd the key, he realized, was science.\n\nBefore the FDA would even talk about clinical trials for MDMA, the agency needed proof it wasn\u2019t dangerous. Previous studies suggesting its neurotoxicity had been limited to rats. So in 1986, Doblin scraped together money to buy monkeys for those same researchers, who found the risks to be much less at human-equivalent doses than previously thought.\n\nThe next step was investigating MDMA\u2019s effects on people. Doblin again raised money to fly psychedelic users he had befriended to Stanford University and Johns Hopkins University for spinal taps. The studies were approved by review boards at both institutions. Doblin also participated, undergoing two spinal taps.\n\nIn the two decades that followed, Doblin and MAPS inched toward progress.\n\nThe nonprofit grew from a one-man band to a staff of 25 with headquarters in Santa Cruz. It tapped into the scene in Silicon Valley \u2014 where many tech entrepreneurs have used psychedelics to spark creativity. (Steve Jobs famously praised LSD as \u201cone of the two or three most important things I have done in my life.\u201d)\n\nMAPS received a $5.5 million bequest from the founder of a software company. The hipster soap company Dr. Bronner\u2019s pledged $5 million. A professional poker player who attributed his wins to microdosing on LSD gave $25,000. Recently, an anonymous $21,000 bitcoin donation came in.\n\nMuch of that money funded small-scale clinical trials, which laid the groundwork for the last remaining hurdle: Large-scale \u201cphase 3\u201d trials that will begin next year, involving 200 to 300 patients in 14 locations.\n\nIf those future trials yield similar results, the FDA could approve the MDMA treatment for PTSD as soon as 2021, according to Doblin.\n\nYet his dream extends beyond that. He envisions a future where psychedelic treatment centers are in every city \u2014 places people can visit for enhanced couples therapy, spiritual experiences and personal growth. He believes psychedelics can help address the country\u2019s biggest problems, including homelessness, war and global warming.\n\n\u201cThese drugs are a tool that can make people more compassionate, tolerant, more connected with other humans and the planet itself,\u201d he said.\n\nThat kind of talk makes many in the medical community nervous.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to measure the exact dangers of ecstasy. Because it is not used as widely as marijuana or cocaine, for example, fewer statistics are available on overdoses or injuries. In 2011, a public health monitoring system identified 22,498 emergency department visits nationwide related to ecstasy.\n\nMDMA researchers point out that one key difference between MDMA and street ecstasy (along with another variant called \u201cmolly\u201d) is the street versions often contain other harmful drugs, experts say. Sometimes the pills don\u2019t even contain MDMA.\n\nBut even in its purest clinical form, MDMA can pose risks. At high doses, it can cause the body to overheat. It can cause anxiety and increase the stress hormone cortisol. Chronic use can also cause memory impairment.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a dangerous substance,\u201d said Andrew Parrott, a psychology professor at Swansea University in Wales who spent years researching the drug\u2019s harmful effects. He worries that FDA approval for the treatment of PTSD could lead many in the public to believe ecstasy is safe for recreational use.\n\nOther experts, however, have become increasingly intrigued by its promising results.\n\n\u201cAnytime you have an organization that is advocating for drugs that are illegal, it marginalizes them in the research field. MAPS still isn\u2019t seen as mainstream. But it\u2019s possible they have a point here,\u201d said Krystal, the Yale psychiatrist, who has not been involved with the group\u2019s research. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a single medication that doesn\u2019t carry some side effect. The question here is whether the benefits outweigh the risk.\u201d\n\nFor Lubecky, the drug can\u2019t be approved fast enough.\n\nThe Marine Corps and Army veteran recalls coming home from Iraq in 2006 to discover his wife had left him, sold his motorcycle and taken his dog.

A new at-home sperm-analysis test allows men to assess their babymaking abilities.\n\nWhen it comes to infertility, the burden seems to often fall on women. They\u2019re poked and prodded and scoped in an effort to figure out what\u2019s complicating conception.\n\nWhile it\u2019s just as likely that infertility is related to the male half of the couple, only 20% of men in duos struggling to make a baby get a sperm-count analysis early on or at all, according to data from SpermCheck Fertility, which earlier this month announced the availability of its at-home screening test for men. SpermCheck, which is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, assesses sperm count with 98% accuracy in 10 minutes and does away with the unpleasantness of conjuring up a sperm sample in a doctor\u2019s office. As SpermCheck\u2019s website puts it, a \u201ctrip to a fertility clinic for a semen analysis is not for everyone. These tests can be expensive (costing hundreds of dollars and not typically covered by insurance), inconvenient and are often embarrassing.\u201d\n\nMORE: \u2018Sonicated\u2019 Sperm: Could Ultrasound Be the Next Male Contraceptive?\n\nLow sperm count, or oligospermia, is a main cause of male infertility. By addressing the issue, SpermCheck will join a crowded infertility market that includes more than 20 types of female-fertility tests in Walgreen stores alone. For women who are having trouble getting pregnant, the test may very well be one they \u2014 and not their squeamish partners \u2014 snap up along with over-the-counter ovulation kits.\n\n\u201cIn our society, the woman carries the burden of trying to determine the issues surrounding infertility,\u201d Ray Lopez, CEO of SpermCheck, told Bloomberg News. \u201cMen don\u2019t say, \u2018Let me go to the urologist and give a semen sample.\u2019\u201d That reluctance has created a $440 million-a-year market for male fertility tests in the U.S., Lopez says.\n\nThe test reveals whether sperm count appears normal, at 20 million or more sperm per ml; lower than that indicates a trip to the doctor is pretty much unavoidable. Stores will begin stocking the $39.99 test in April; until then, men \u2014 or their partners \u2014 can find it online at www.Walgreens.com and www.CVS.com.\n\nMORE: The Sperm Bike: Cycling to Drum Up Sperm Donations\n\nIt relies on scrutiny of a particular protein found only in the head of mature sperm; the protein was discovered by John Herr, director of the Center of Cell Biology at the University of Virginia and the chairman of SpermCheck. \u201cThis at-home test was created to meet the needs of couples who are considering and just planning on starting a family, those currently having trouble conceiving,\u201d says Herr, and \u201ceven those men who are just curious about their sperm count.\u201d\n\nWould-be virile men \u201cjust curious\u201d about their sperm count? Hard to believe.

Girls who get the shots are less likely to have Pap tests with worrisome results that would lead to further treatment, saving themselves anxiety and discomfort and, in those cases, saving money. When it occurs, cervical cancer is a dreadful disease; genital warts, partly prevented by the Merck vaccine, can be a painful nuisance.\n\nBut some experts worry about the consequences of the rapid rollout of the new vaccines without more medical evidence about how best to deploy them. They say that because of the aggressive marketing, even parents of girls who are far from being sexually active may feel pressured into giving them a vaccine that is not yet needed and whose long-term impact is still unclear. Legislative efforts to require girls to have the vaccine only add to the pressure.\n\nIn the United States, hundreds of doctors have been recruited and trained to give talks about Gardasil \u2014 $4,500 for a lecture \u2014 and some have made hundreds of thousands of dollars. Politicians have been lobbied and invited to receptions urging them to legislate against a global killer. And former state officials have been recruited to lobby their former colleagues.\n\n\u201cThere was incredible pressure from industry and politics,\u201d said Dr. Jon Abramson, a professor of pediatrics at Wake Forest University who was chairman of the committee of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that recommended the vaccine for all girls once they reached 11 or 12.\n\n\u201cThis big push is making people crazy \u2014 thinking they\u2019re bad moms if they don\u2019t get their kids vaccinated,\u201d said Dr. Abby Lippman, a professor at McGill University in Montreal and policy director of the Canadian Women\u2019s Health Network. Canada will spend $300 million on a cervical cancer vaccine program.\n\nMerck\u2019s vaccine was studied in clinical trials for five years, and Glaxo\u2019s for nearly six and a half, so it is not clear how long the protection will last. Some data from the clinical trials indicate immune molecules may wane after three to five years. If a 12-year-old is vaccinated, will she still be protected in college, when her risk of infection is higher? Or will a booster vaccine be necessary?\n\nSome experts are concerned about possible side effects that become apparent only after a vaccine has been more widely tested over longer periods.\n\nAnd why the sudden alarm in developed countries about cervical cancer, some experts ask. A major killer in the developing world, particularly Africa, where the vaccines are too expensive for use, cervical cancer is classified as very rare in the West because it is almost always preventable through regular Pap smears, which detect precancerous cells early enough for effective treatment. Indeed, because the vaccines prevent only 70 percent of cervical cancers, Pap smear screening must continue anyway.\n\n\u201cMerck lobbied every opinion leader, women\u2019s group, medical society, politicians, and went directly to the people \u2014 it created a sense of panic that says you have to have this vaccine now,\u201d said Dr. Diane Harper, a professor of medicine at Dartmouth Medical School. Dr. Harper was a principal investigator on the clinical trials of both Gardasil and Cervarix, and she spent 2006-7 on sabbatical at the World Health Organization developing plans for cervical cancer vaccine programs around the world.\n\n\u201cBecause Merck was so aggressive, it went too fast,\u201d Dr. Harper said. \u201cI would have liked to see it go much slower.\u201d\n\nIn receiving expedited consideration from the Food and Drug Administration, Gardasil took six months from application to approval and was recommended by the C.D.C. weeks later for universal use among girls. Most vaccines take three years to get that sort of endorsement, Dr. Harper said, and then 5 to 10 more for universal acceptance.\n\n\u201cIn that time, you learn a lot about safety and side effects and how to use it,\u201d Dr. Harper said. \u201cThose getting it early should be the ones who really want it and willing to accept the risk.\u201d\n\nDr. Richard Haupt, medical director at Merck, said the vaccine had not been rushed into use, saying that five years in clinical trails was normal before applying for licensing. He said Merck educated physicians, politicians and the public about the new vaccine to \u201caccelerate and facilitate access.\u201d\n\nSpokesmen for Merck and Glaxo say all indications are that their vaccines are safe and effective, and there is no evidence that a booster shot will be needed. A Glaxo spokeswoman, Sarah Alspach, said its formulation produces a \u201cstronger and longer-lasting immune response\u201d than conventional vaccines.\n\n\u201cYou can only study a vaccine for so long before you license and use it in a population where it has enormous value,\u201d said Dr. Haupt at Merck. \u201cOur hope and belief is that this is a remarkable vaccine that will have huge impact on women.\u201d\n\nBut with their high price, the vaccines are straining national and state health budgets as well as family pocketbooks. These were among the first vaccines approved for universal use in any age group that clearly cost the health system money rather than saved it, in contrast to less expensive shots, against measles and tetanus, for example, that pay for themselves by preventing costly diseases.\n\nHealth economists estimate that depending on how they are used, the two cervical cancer vaccines will cost society $30,000 to $70,000, or higher, for each year of life they save in developed countries \u2014 a cost commonly seen in treating people already suffering from deadly cancers. That number will be far higher if a booster is needed.\n\nLooked at another way, countries that pay for the vaccines will have less money available for other health needs. \u201cThis kind of money could be better used to solve so many other problems in women\u2019s health,\u201d said Dr. Lippman at McGill. \u201cSome of our provinces are running out of money to provide primary care. I\u2019m not against vaccines, but in Canada and the U.S., women are not dying in the streets of cervical cancer.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, if the vaccine were to become cheap enough to be used in the developing world, particularly Africa, it would revolutionize women\u2019s health. Charities like the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunizations, backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, are trying to devise a solution.\n\nThe vaccines offer partial protection against infection from human papillomavirus, or HPV, a common and generally benign sexually transmitted virus that can in rare cases cause cancer after years of silent infection. The Merck vaccine also prevents some genital warts that are caused by other strains of the virus.\n\nIn Britain, \u201cthis initiative was seen as a good use of resources that fits with the government\u2019s health priorities and political priorities,\u201d said Professor David Salisbury, who heads the Department of Health\u2019s Vaccine and Immunization Committee.\n\nBut critics urge restraint. \u201cThere is no need to rush,\u201d said Angela Raffle, a specialist in cervical cancer screening with the National Health Service in Britain, where 400 people die of the cancer each year. \u201cIf we do this quickly and badly, we could cause more deaths,\u201d from side effects, for example, or from giving girls false security that they are protected for life and no longer need to be screened, Ms. Raffle said.\n\nStephanie Levi decided to give her two daughters the vaccine in late 2006 after receiving a newsletter from their physician. \u201cWhen you get a letter saying this is what you need to do to protect your girls, of course you do it,\u201d she said, adding that she was curious because she had not realized cervical cancer was a problem.\n\nThat week, she noticed articles and advertisements for the vaccine. \u201cI remember thinking I had better do this quickly,\u201d said Ms. Levi who lived in New York then and now lives in Rome.\n\nIt is not hard to hear about Gardasil.\n\nIn television advertisements, a cast of hip people in their 20s \u2014 artists, writers and professionals \u2014 describe why they got the shots, in the language of liberation, such as, \u201cI chose to get vaccinated because my dreams don\u2019t include cervical cancer.\u201d The advertisements direct viewers to gardasil.com, which includes patients\u2019 stories, buddy icons and downloads for holding an event at sororities.\n\nGirls of any age who have had one dose of the vaccine can ask for text-message \u201creminders\u201d from Merck to get the next two shots. The offers come with another reminder: \u201cI understand that the information I provide will be used by Merck or those working on behalf of Merck for market research purposes.\u201d\n\nFor such efforts, Merck last May swept the 2008 Pharmaceutical Advertising and Marketing Excellence awards, and Gardasil was named Brand of the Year by Pharmaceutical Executive magazine.\n\nThe marketing helped make Gardasil one of Merck\u2019s best sellers, with a projected sales of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion outside Europe this year, and more from sales in Europe, where Merck sells the vaccine through a joint venture with Sanofi Aventis.\n\nAggressive pharmaceutical advertising is nothing new, but the campaign was a revolution for a vaccine. Vaccines were traditionally the orphans of the pharmaceutical world because they were cheap and not particularly profitable. But the two for cervical cancer are the latest in a wave of high-priced vaccines that have come to market since 2001, opening a lucrative new field.\n\nGirls and their families are by no means the only marketing target.\n\nIn 2006, hundreds of doctors and nurses were signed up as unofficial spokesmen for Gardasil, trained by Merck, provided with a multimedia presentation and paid $4,500 for each 50-minute talk, delivered over Merck-sponsored meals. Many were paid for attending Merck \u201cadvisory board\u201d meetings to discuss the shots.\n\nMerck said it provided assistance to speakers \u201cto make sure they are providing accurate information in accordance with F.D.A.-approved labeling and to make sure dissemination of information is always appropriate,\u201d said Amy Rose, a company spokeswoman.\n\nPromotion and marketing for Cervarix, Glaxo\u2019s version of the vaccine, has been far less visible, in part because it has not been approved yet for use in the United States, and because consumer advertising of medicines is prohibited in much of Europe. Outstanding data from final clinical trials will probably be submitted to American drug regulators early next year, the company said.\n\nThere has also been a proliferation of cervical cancer awareness conferences and campaigns, sponsored by a host of new or newly energized scientific and patient groups financed with the help of Merck and Glaxo. In some cases the financial support has been indirect, so patients are unaware that expert advice has been at last partly paid for by the vaccine makers.\n\nGregory A. Poland, a vaccine expert at the Mayo Clinic, was a nonvoting member on the C.D.C. panel that recommended Gardasil in 2006 and has publicly defended the panel\u2019s decision. Records show he received at least $27,420 in expenses and consulting fees from Merck from 1999 to 2007. Both the C.D.C. and Dr. Michael Camilleri, chairman of the Mayo Clinic Conflict of Interest Review Board, speaking on Dr. Poland\u2019s behalf, said the payments complied with institutional requirements.\n\nTo encourage vaccination on campus, Merck provided the American College Health Association with an unrestricted grant to train its officers to speak about the new vaccine and to create kits to discuss cervical cancer and promote the vaccine for college health services. The association now recommends the shot for all female college-age students, even though many in that group already have HPV, rendering the vaccine less useful.\n\nDr. James Turner, president-elect of the association, said it accepted Merck\u2019s grant to undertake the campaign because \u201cHPV is a very important health issue for college students,\u201d adding that his group was \u201ca very small organization, and we don\u2019t have funds.\u201d\n\nSmall charities have also benefited from Merck\u2019s contributions.\n\nAt the second annual patient conference of the National Cervical Cancer Coalition, planned for Los Angeles this October, four of the seven scheduled speakers have received money for research or consulting from Merck, Glaxo or other companies involved in HPV screening or detection, though the conference organizers do not mention that. The coalition, which supports widespread use of the cervical cancer vaccines, is headed by a businessman, Alan Kaye, who owns a pathology lab that performs Pap smears and HPV tests, among other services. \u201cWe are a poor nonprofit, and I\u2019ve been working on this issue for years,\u201d said Mr. Kaye, who hopes to receive grants from the drug makers to help pay for the conference.\n\nIn country after country, Merck and Glaxo also appealed to politicians. Vaccines, unlike antibiotics, tend to be recommended or mandated by governments. \u201cWe support policy leaders and try to educate legislators,\u201d Dr. Haupt said.\n\nIn the United States, 41 states have passed or begun considering legislation on cervical cancer, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, and 24 have considered proposals to mandate the vaccine for girls, generally in middle school.\n\nMany bills, like ones passed in Colorado, New Jersey and New York, allocate more money for HPV and cervical cancer education or to promote the vaccine. Others, like proposals in Iowa and Louisiana, require insurers to cover it.\n\nThe only state to pass a bill requiring the vaccine for school entry is Virginia; it takes effect in October, after school begins, so will first apply in 2009.\n\nMerck has a growing economic interest in Virginia. In December 2006, Merck announced it would invest $57 million to expand its Elkton, Va., plant to make Gardasil, helped by a $700,000 grant from a state economic development agency that is part of the executive branch. Two months later, Gov. Tim Kaine, who has been mentioned as a possible Democratic vice presidential candidate, signed legislation requiring Gardasil for schoolgirls. Four months after that, Merck pledged to invest $193 million more in the plant to make drugs and vaccines, helped by a state grant of $1.5 million.\n\nDelacey Skinner, a spokeswoman for the governor, said the state\u2019s vaccination program included an unusually broad freedom to decline the shot. To exempt children from other vaccines, parents must provide a medical reason; for Gardasil, they do not. \u201cIt is a very easy step that we can take to prevent a sometimes deadly but certainly serious form of cancer,\u201d Ms. Skinner said.\n\n\u201cWithout hesitation or question,\u201d she added, the decisions about the plant and about the mandate legislation \u201cwere completely separate.\u201d\n\nBut, as in many states where cervical cancer legislation has been considered, there have been ties between drug makers and members of government. In 2006, one of Merck\u2019s newly hired Virginia lobbyists was Sandra D. Bowen, who had spent years as Virginia\u2019s secretary of administration. And Bill Bolling, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, became an outspoken participant in the \u201cEnding Cervical Cancer in Our Lifetime\u201d campaign, a program started in 2006 by the National Lieutenant Governors Association and financed largely by Merck and Glaxo.\n\n\u201cThis is an important public health issue,\u201d said Randy Marcus, Mr. Bolling\u2019s spokesman.\n\nIn Texas, Merck hired Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s former chief of staff as a lobbyist, and contributed $6,000 to the governor and $38,000 to other legislators. Last February, Mr. Perry ordered that all schoolgirls be inoculated with Gardasil, a pronouncement that was overturned by the Texas Legislature, 181 to 3, a few months after the financial conflicts were revealed.\n\nEarly last year, Merck announced that it would no longer actively lobby for state mandates. But Dr. Haupt defended the initial impulse, saying that historically such school requirements had been a successful way to increase access to and financing for vaccines.\n\nOther forms of lobbying continue: Merck and Glaxo have both paid into a program run by Cornerstone Government Affairs, a Washington firm, to lobby the C.D.C. and Congress for more federal money for vaccines.\n\nIn Britain, drug makers paid for breakfast meetings with politicians and visited the nurses and family practitioners who are the backbone of the National Health Service, urging them to offer the vaccine.\n\nIn Belgium, the health minister approved the vaccine before the country\u2019s health technology evaluation committee had finished deliberating.\n\nMany questions about the vaccines remain unanswered, including how long immunity will last. Even commercials for Gardasil say \u2014 in small print \u2014 that \u201cthe duration of protection has not been established.\u201d\n\nDr. Harper said that in the data from Merck\u2019s clinical trials, which she helped conduct, the vaccine was no longer protective after just three years in some girls. \u201cThe immunity of Gardasil will not last \u2014 that is dangerous to assume,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said she believed that at least one booster shot, and probably more, would be needed over a lifetime. Dr. Haupt of Merck said that the \u201cdurability of immunity\u201d would ultimately be defined through widespread use of the vaccine, but that the company\u2019s research strongly suggested that immunity would be long lasting \u2014 far more than five years.\n\nOther independent experts worry that eliminating the two cancer-causing HPV strains covered by Gardasil and Cervarix might allow the other cancer-causing strains of HPV to increase in frequency, reducing the vaccine\u2019s effect. But Dr. Haupt said such \u201ctheoretical possibilities\u201d should not deter rapid distribution of an important vaccine. \u201cWe\u2019ll worry about whether boosters are needed down the road,\u201d he said.\n\nThe question of side effects, however, has nagged the vaccine.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control asks health care centers to report side effects through its Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System; reporting is voluntary. There have been 9,749 reports, almost all from doctors and nurses, of patients experiencing adverse events after receiving the vaccine, the agency announced in a joint report with the Food and Drug Administration at the end of June. Ninety-four percent of them were not serious, ranging from arm pain to fainting, and 6 percent were classified as serious, including blood clots, paralysis and at least 20 deaths.\n\nBut 16 million doses of the drug have been distributed by Merck in the United States, and in a population so large, \u201cby chance alone some serious adverse effects and deaths\u201d will occur, the F.D.A. and C.D.C. said.\n\nThe agencies said there was no indication that the deaths or serious side effects were caused by the shot, concluding that \u201cGardasil continues to be safe and effective and its benefits continue to outweigh its risks.\u201d\n\nBoth the agencies and Merck acknowledge that there does appear to be a high rate of fainting, so doctors are now advised to observe patients for 15 minutes after receiving a shot.\n\nFor some couples, the vaccine has raised agonizing questions over how to safeguard their children\u2019s health. Phillip and Barbara Tetlock, both professors at the University of California at Berkeley, are asking whether Gardasil shots that their daughter, Jenny, received last year contributed to her illness, an extremely rare form of progressive paralysis that has left her bed bound and needing assistance to breathe at age 14.\n\nThe Tetlocks, who are not pursuing legal action, are appealing to the C.D.C. and Merck for more data and searching for other girls with similar conditions through their blog (www.jenjensfamily.blogspot.com). \u201cHer parents are scientists \u2014 they know better than to assume Gardasil caused her disease,\u201d said Terry Murray, a close friend speaking for the family. \u201cBut you have to explore the possibility.\u201d\n\nDr. Harper said she believed the vaccine was generally safe. She vaccinated her own children. But with Gardasil\u2019s use having grown so fast, she added, \u201cyou inevitably find adverse events that you wouldn\u2019t have suspected.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Tetlocks are right to ask these questions,\u201d she added.\n\nDr. Haupt of Merck said that the company knew of the case but saw no \u201ccausal association.\u201d\n\nCountries and consumers must decide whether it is worth preventing cervical cancer with a costly vaccine.\n\nCervical cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death in women, with 500,000 new cases worldwide each year. But more than 90 percent of them are in developing countries, according to the World Health Organization; 274,000 women died of this cancer in 2006, nearly 95 percent in developing countries.\n\nWhere there are Pap smear programs, few women die of cervical cancer. In the United States, it is responsible for 12,000 new cases a year and 3,600 deaths, most in women who did not get Pap smears, said Laurie Markowitz, head of the HPV working group at the C.D.C. (Women with H.I.V. are predisposed to the cancer.)\n\nPap smears work by detecting abnormal cells that are cancer precursors and that can be destroyed using techniques like lasers and cryotherapy or, rarely, surgery. As with any screening test, and most vaccines, the process is not 100 percent effective, and a small number of women with precancerous cells escape detection with false negative tests, for example. But because the transformation from abnormal cell to cancer normally takes a decade, and frequent Pap smears are recommended, it has been a successful strategy \u2014 though the vaccine, used properly, might well prove a useful adjunct.\n\nIndeed, cervical cancer does not even make the American Cancer Society\u2019s list of 10 deadliest cancers. Among American women, it causes well under a 10th of the number of deaths caused by lung cancer or breast cancer.\n\nThough classified as a sexually transmitted disease, HPV is nearly universal and generally benign. Eighty percent of people will contract it in their lifetime and most will clear it on their own.\n\nDr. Haupt of Merck said the vaccines\u2019 price was worth it for the deaths prevented and the tests avoided. \u201cMost of the old vaccines are undervalued,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Abramson said he thought his C.D.C. advisory committee did the right thing in recommending Gardasil. \u201cCervical cancer is a worthwhile disease to prevent in a country that has the resources,\u201d he said. He believes it should be available to those who want it.\n\nStill, he said he was shocked to hear of proposals to mandate the vaccine for students. \u201cAre you really going to say a girl can\u2019t start school because she hasn\u2019t had this vaccine?\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the vaccines\u2019 proponents are moving to the next frontier: older women and boys. Merck recently applied for approval to market the vaccine to women 26 to 45 and is conducting studies on vaccinating boys, who can get genital warts from HPV.\n\nOne rationale for inoculating boys is that entire populations should be vaccinated to achieve what is called herd immunity. But critics ask whether it is worth conducting a campaign on the scale of the one used against polio to eliminate a generally harmless virus.\n\nSaid Dr. Raffle, the British cervical cancer specialist: \u201cOh, dear. If we give it to boys, then all pretense of scientific worth and cost analysis goes out the window.\u201d", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "This story included quotes from a number of individuals whose perspectives ranged from that of a consumer, expert in vaccines, medical economists to company spokespersons. \u00a0These sources provided a well rounded perspective on the issues related to the use of the vaccines.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "MONDAY, Sept. 11, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- New research suggests that Opdivo -- a drug that works with the immune system to fight melanoma -- is more effective than the current standard of care for patients who've had surgery to remove advanced tumors.\n\nThe international study was funded by Opdivo's maker, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and included more than 900 patients with stage III and stage IV melanoma.\n\nPatients were treated at 130 medical centers across 25 countries. All underwent surgery for their cancer before they began treatment with either Opdivo (nivolumab) or Yervoy (ipilimumab), the drug that's the current standard of care.\n\nBoth drugs are \"immunotherapies,\" which work by boosting the immune system's ability to spot and destroy tumor cells.\n\nAfter a year of treatment, 71 percent of patients in the Opdivo group were alive without any recurrence of the disease, compared with 61 percent of those treated with Yervoy. And at 18 months, the rate was 66 percent for Opdivo and 53 percent for Yervoy, the findings showed.\n\nAccording to the Skin Cancer Foundation, metastatic melanoma accounts for only about 1 percent of skin cancer cases but causes the majority of skin cancer deaths.\n\n\"Our results demonstrate that [Opdivo] is more effective in treating patients with stage III and IV melanoma, cutting the risk of relapse by a third,\" lead researcher Dr. Jeffrey Weber, professor of medicine at NYU School of Medicine, said in a university news release.\n\n\"Results like this will change how we practice medicine.

He is a surgical oncologist at Northwell Health's Imbert Cancer Center in Bay Shore, N.Y.\n\n\"Not only did these patients have a better survival outcome at one year, but they had only one-third the side effects compared to Yervoy,\" Deutsch said.\n\nThe study found that patients taking Opdivo had fewer severe side effects than those taking Yervoy, at 14 percent versus 45 percent. Five percent of patients on Opdivo had to stop treatment due to side effects, compared with 31 percent of those on Yervoy. The most common side effects for both drugs were fatigue and diarrhea.\n\nWeber added that \"the safety of [Opdivo] is very promising.\"\n\nThe study is scheduled for presentation Monday in Madrid, Spain, at the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology. It was also published online Sept. 10 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nBoth Opdivo and Yervoy are already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat advanced (metastatic) melanoma. In some patients, the drugs are used in combination.\n\nDr. Michele Green is a dermatologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. She said any advance in the care of aggressive melanomas is welcome news for patients.\n\n\"It is amazing that there is now an alternative that is superior to conventional chemotherapy for advanced metastatic disease,\" Green said after reviewing the new study findings. \"With these advanced melanomas -- that have high risks of recurrences and have poor outcomes -- it is vital to look at alternative treatments.

Greenberg, chief of urologic oncology at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, who was not involved with the study.\n\n\"This is relatively early stage disease, and it shows what we would expect it to show: that those who have more years [to live] have better survival if treated aggressively,\" he said.\n\nMen with prostate cancer face a confusing maze of options today, including not only surgery but hormone therapy, different kinds of radiation therapy and even simply foregoing medical treatment while monitoring the cancer closely (\"watchful waiting,\" also known as \"active surveillance\").\n\n\"Watchful waiting\" is often recommended when a man is not expected to die of the cancer and would like to avoid the risk of the debilitating side effects associated with prostate cancer treatment. These may include: incontinence and erectile dysfunction (surgery); erectile dysfunction and secondary cancers (radiation therapy); nausea, breast growth, liver problems (hormonal therapy); and weakness, hair loss, fluid retention (chemotherapy).\n\nThe data presented in the May 5 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine is a 15-year follow-up of a study for which three-years of follow-up had previously been reported.\n\nThe earlier study also found that undergoing a radical prostatectomy lowered the risk of the cancer spreading, as well as the death rate from prostate cancer or any other cause.\n\nThe researchers, Drs. Anna Bill-Axelson and Lars Holmberg of University Hospital, Uppsala, and colleagues, enrolled nearly 700 men with early prostate cancer under the age of 75 who were randomly selected either to undergo a radical prostatectomy or to stay in \"watchful waiting\" mode.\n\nAfter an average follow-up of about 13 years, 14.6 percent of the men who had undergone surgery had died, versus 20.7 percent in the watchful waiting group, a 38 percent reduced risk.\n\nThe benefit was primarily seen among men younger than 65 and the authors estimated that seven men under the age of 65 and 8 over the age of 65 would need to be treated to save one life.\n\nThere was also a benefit in men whose tumors had low-risk characteristics.\n\nMen whose cancer had moved outside of the prostate gland and who underwent removal of the prostate had a seven times higher risk of dying than men whose tumors hadn't spread.\n\nRadical prostatectomy can come with a price -- including erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence and even bowel incontinence -- although these effects are not as common as techniques improve. A nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy, for example, may be able to prevent erectile dysfunction.\n\nAlso, the men in this study were diagnosed only after they had symptoms, unlike the majority of men in the United States, Greenberg said.\n\n\"The advantage of screening is that men are more likely to be cured of cancer but they also have a greater chance of not succumbing to the consequences of the surgical complications, whether [those] be erectile dysfunction or urinary incontinence,\" Greenberg said.\n\nAlso, he said, erectile dysfunction can also be a factor of aging and can be treated in most cases.\n\nBut much remains to be known about how best to treat different types of prostate cancer.\n\n\"The management of early stage prostate cancer continues to require further randomized controlled studies, which are underway, to determine the true benefit of treatment versus expectant management,\" said Dr. Marc Danziger, an attending urologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, who was not involved with the study.\n\n\"Currently, the potential benefit and side effects of treatment needs to be addressed on an individual basis in relation to the risk stratification of disease, patient desires, health status and risk tolerance,\" Danziger added.\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on prostate cancer treatments.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Two clinicians who were not involved in the study provided quotes which were used in the story.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Denver, CO.

In fact, a study of elementary school students demonstrated that students are not consuming the majority of vegetables offered to them in school lunches. However, plate waste for white potatoes was the lowest among any type of vegetables; thus, including potatoes in school meals is one important way to help ensure children receive those key nutrients of concern.\n\n\"It's important that consumption of all vegetables, particularly those that are good sources of potassium and dietary fiber, be encouraged in children,\" says Theresa A.

It usually starts as a rash on one side of the face or body, often causing pain, itching and tingling. About a million cases occur in the United States each year, and attacks can last two to four weeks.\n\n\"Even after the rash has healed, the pain can last for months or even years,\" said lead study author HungFu Tseng, a research scientist at the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research and Evaluation in Pasadena, Calif.\n\nZostavax, as the vaccine is called, was approved in 2006, based on the results of clinical trials. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the shot for eligible people aged 60 and older.\n\nTseng's team wanted to test the vaccine's real-world performance, so they compared 75,761 vaccinated members of the Kaiser Permanente health plan to 227,283 members who elected not to have the shot. Kaiser funded the study.\n\nIn vaccinated individuals, the rate of shingles was 6.4 cases per 1,000 people in a year while it was twice that -- 13 per 1,000 -- in the unvaccinated population, the investigators found.\n\nThe vaccine also reduced the risk of ophthalmic herpes zoster (infection that affects the eye) by 63 percent and hospitalization by 65 percent.\n\nThose who had been vaccinated were more likely to be white, female and in better overall health than the unvaccinated people, the researchers noted. Lack of awareness, concerns about effectiveness or safety, and cost may have kept some people from getting the shot, Tseng said.\n\n\"People 60 and over can consider talking to their physician about the possibility of receiving the vaccine to reduce their risk, and the doctor can evaluate if they are eligible,\" said Tseng.\n\nPatients with leukemia, lymphoma, HIV or an allergy to any ingredients in the vaccine are ineligible for the shot.\n\n\"It does bolster our confidence that it's effective in the real world,\" said Dr. Bruce Hirsch, an attending physician in infectious diseases at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., who was not involved with the study.\n\nBut the vaccine can cost a couple of hundred dollars, he said, perhaps making it out of reach for those with limited resources.\n\nBecause shingles is not contagious and doesn't present a risk of death, Hirsch said he would recommend the flu vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine over this one for uninsured patients who would have to pay out-of-pocket.\n\n\"This study helps me in terms of advising patients and prioritizing,\" Hirsch added.\n\nWhile less reliable than some childhood vaccines, which are usually 90 percent effective in preventing certain illnesses, the shingles vaccination is still worthwhile, said Dr. Ciro Sumaya, professor of health policy and management at Texas A&M Health Science Center School of Rural Public Health.\n\n\"I think it's a very good vaccine, and it's a safe vaccine, but obviously there needs to be continuing surveillance of usage of the vaccine to make sure there are no adverse effects that are seen in one in a 100 million cases versus one in five or 10,000 people,\" said Sumaya, also a member of CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.\n\nFor now, he advises getting it. \"It's protecting against a severe disease, particularly in elderly adults,\" he said, \"so the benefit, I think, is overwhelming that we should be using this because it's recommended.\"\n\nThe CDC has more on the shingles vaccine.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "\n\n\nThis story includes more than one independent source.

Yet Dr. Bertin has recently changed the way he talks about medication, offering parents a powerful argument. Recent research, he says, suggests the pills may \u201cnormalize\u201d the child\u2019s brain over time, rewiring neural connections so that a child would feel more focused and in control, long after the last pill was taken.\n\n\u201cThere might be quite a profound neurological benefit,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nA growing number of doctors who treat the estimated 6.4 million American children diagnosed with A.D.H.D. are hearing that stimulant medications not only help treat the disorder but may actually be good for their patients\u2019 brains. In an interview last spring with Psych Congress Network, an Internet news site for mental health professionals, Dr. Timothy Wilens, chief of child and adolescent psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital, said \u201cwe have enough data to say they\u2019re actually neuroprotective.\u201d The pills, he said, help \u201cnormalize\u201d the function and structure of brains in children with A.D.H.D., so that, \u201cover years, they turn out to look more like non-A.D.H.D. kids.\u201d\n\nMedication is already by far the most common treatment for A.D.H.D., with roughly 4 million American children taking the pills \u2014 mostly stimulants, such as amphetamines and methylphenidate. Yet the decision can be anguishing for parents who worry about both short-term and long-term side effects. If the pills can truly produce long-lasting benefits, more parents might be encouraged to start their children on these medications early and continue them for longer.\n\nLeading A.D.H.D. experts, however, warn the jury is still out.\n\n\u201cSometimes wishful thinking gives us hope that the impressive short-term relative benefits of medication over other treatments will persist beyond childhood, but I haven\u2019t seen it,\u201d said James Swanson, director of the Child Development Center at the University of California at Irvine. Dr. Swanson, a co-author of a landmark federally funded study, the Multimodal Treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, said that follow-up research found overall improvement but no greater long-term benefits after three years for children who were treated with medication compared to those who weren\u2019t. One possible reason, as the report noted, was that many children refuse to continue taking medication after a year or so, something most parentsof such children well know.\n\nResearch has shown that the brains of people with A.D.H.D. on average look and function differently than those who don\u2019t have the disorder, particularly when it comes to processing two important neurotransmitters: dopamine and norepinephrine. For most people with A.D.H.D., stimulants can temporarily boost focus, motivation and self-control by increasing the availability of these chemical messengers. The question is whether these effects can last once the drugs have left the bloodstream.\n\nIn arguing for \u201cnormalization,\u201d Dr. Wilens cited a major review in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry in late 2013, which looked at 29 brain-scan studies. Although the studies had different methods and goals, the authors said that, together, they suggested that stimulants \u201care associated with attenuation of abnormalities in brain structure, function, and biochemistry in subjects with A.D.H.D.\u201d\n\nBut other A.D.H.D. experts challenge this conclusion. Dr. F. Xavier Castellanos, director of research at the New York University Child Study Center, called assertions that stimulants are neuroprotective \u201cexaggerated,\u201d adding: \u201cThe best inference is that there is no evidence of harm from medications \u2013 normalization is a possibility, but far from demonstrated.\u201d\n\nA.D.H.D. is an exceptionally controversial diagnosis, with particular controversy zeroing in on researchers, including Dr. Wilens himself and some of the authors of the 2013 report he cited who have received financial support from pharmaceutical firms. In an email, Dr. Wilens said he had not received \u201cany personal income\u201d from the pharmaceutical industry since 2009.\n\nAs several experts noted, a major impediment to determining the long-term impacts of A.D.H.D. medication is that a \u201cgold-standard\u201d study would require researchers to assign children randomly to groups that either received medication or didn\u2019t. Such a practice has been deemed unethical due to the widespread belief that the medication can help struggling children, at least in the short-term.\n\nAnd other research has raised new concerns. One peer-reviewed 2013 study co-authored by Dr. Swanson suggested that the stimulants may change the brain over time so as to undermine the long-term response to the medication and even exacerbate symptoms when people aren\u2019t taking them.\n\nDr. Peter Jensen, the former associate director of child and adolescent research at the National Institute of Mental Health, cautioned that parents should not try to force children with A.D.H.D. to take medication when they don\u2019t want to, adding that \u201cmost kids don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\nDr. Jensen, who now heads the REACH Institute, a national nonprofit organization concerned with children\u2019s mental health, once surveyed 100 parents of sons and daughters in their 20s who had been diagnosed with A.D.H.D., asking what made the most difference.\n\n\u201cEighty percent of them said \u2018Love your child.

And in seven studies that examined tea drinking and diabetes risk, people who drank more than three or four cups daily were at 18 percent lower diabetes risk.\n\nThe current analysis could have overestimated the effect of these beverages on diabetes risk due to statistical issues with the smaller studies, Huxley and her colleagues note. It\u2019s also not possible to say from the current evidence that heavy coffee drinkers (and tea and decaf drinkers) don\u2019t have other characteristics that might protect them against developing diabetes, they add, such as eating a healthier diet.\n\nThe fact that the effects were seen with decaf as well as coffee and tea suggest that if the effects are real, they aren\u2019t just due to caffeine, but may be related to other substances found in these beverages, the researchers say, for example magnesium, lignans (estrogen-like chemicals found in plants), or chlorogenic acids, which are antioxidants that slow the release of sugar into the blood after a meal.\n\nClinical trials are needed to investigate whether these beverages do indeed help prevent diabetes, the researchers say. If the benefits turn out to be real, they add, health care providers might begin advising patients at risk for diabetes not only to exercise and lose weight, but to drink more tea and coffee, too.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "\u00a0No independent sources were quoted in the story.\u00a0 We especially feel that this was warranted given the inclusion of the researcher\u2019s bold claims of potential impact\u00a0 of the findings.

According to a study published in Nature today, researchers discovered that these drugs may activate stem cells in the brain to stimulate myelin producing cells and repair white matter, which is damaged in multiple sclerosis. The study was partially funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), part of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nSpecialized cells called oligodendrocytes lay down multiple layers of a fatty white substance known as myelin around axons, the long \u201cwires\u201d that connect brain cells. Myelin acts as an insulator and enables fast communication between brain cells. In multiple sclerosis there is breakdown of myelin and this deterioration leads to muscle weakness, numbness and problems with vision, coordination and balance.\n\n\u201cTo replace damaged cells, the scientific field has focused on direct transplantation of stem cell-derived tissues for regenerative medicine, and that approach is likely to provide enormous benefit down the road. We asked if we could find a faster and less invasive approach by using drugs to activate native nervous system stem cells and direct them to form new myelin. Our ultimate goal was to enhance the body\u2019s ability to repair itself,\u201d said Paul J. Tesar, Ph.D., associate professor at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine in Cleveland, and senior author of the study.\n\nIt is unknown how myelin-producing cells are damaged, but research suggests they may be targeted by malfunctioning immune cells and that multiple sclerosis may start as an autoimmune disorder. Current therapies for multiple sclerosis include anti-inflammatory drugs, which help prevent the episodic relapses common in multiple sclerosis, but are less effective at preventing long-term disability. Scientists believe that therapies that promote myelin repair might improve neurologic disability in people with multiple sclerosis.\n\nAdult brains contain oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), which are stem cells that generate myelin-producing cells. OPCs are found to multiply in the brains of multiple sclerosis patients as if to respond to myelin damage, but for unknown reasons they are not effective in restoring white matter. In the current study, Dr. Tesar wanted to see if drugs already approved for other uses were able to stimulate OPCs to increase myelination.\n\nOPCs have been difficult to isolate and study, but Dr. Tesar and his colleagues, in collaboration with Robert Miller, Ph.D., professor at George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C., developed a novel method to investigate these cells in a petri dish. Using this technique, they were able to quickly test the effects of hundreds of drugs on the stem cells.\n\nThe compounds screened in this study were obtained from a drug library maintained by NIH\u2019s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS). All are approved for use in humans. NCATS and Dr. Tesar have an ongoing collaboration and plan to expand the library of drugs screened against OPCs in the near future to identify other promising compounds.\n\nDr. Tesar\u2019s team found that two compounds in particular, miconazole (an antifungal) and clobetasol (a steroid), stimulated mouse and human OPCs into generating myelin-producing cells.\n\nNext, they examined whether the drugs, when injected into a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, could improve re-myelination. They found that both drugs were effective in activating OPCs to enhance myelination and reverse paralysis. As a result, almost all of the animals regained the use of their hind limbs. They also found that the drugs acted through two very different molecular mechanisms.\n\n\u201cThe ability to activate white matter cells in the brain, as shown in this study, opens up an exciting new avenue of therapy development for myelin disorders such as multiple sclerosis,\u201d said Ursula Utz, Ph.D., program director at the NINDS.\n\nDr. Tesar and his colleagues caution that more research is needed before miconazole and clobetasol can be tested in multiple sclerosis clinical trials. They are currently approved for use as creams or powders on the surfaces of the body but their safety administered in other forms, such as injections, in humans is unknown.\n\n\u201cOff-label use of the current forms of these drugs is more likely to increase other health concerns than alleviate multiple sclerosis symptoms. We are working tirelessly to ready a safe and effective drug for clinical use,\u201d Dr. Tesar said.\n\nThis work was supported by the NINDS (NS085246, NS030800, NS026543), the New York Stem Cell Foundation and the Myelin Repair Foundation, New York City.\n\nThe NINDS is the nation\u2019s leading funder of research on the brain and nervous system.

GTPS is the current term for what used to be called greater trochanteric or subgluteal bursitis. This study is the first to directly compare these two treatments for the syndrome.\n\nThe medical community once thought that a swollen hip bursa--a fluid-filled sac that acts as a gliding surface to reduce friction between moving tissues in this joint--was the source of this hip pain. This conclusion led to the use of steroid injections to the bursa to help decrease swelling and pain. However, evidence now indicates that injuries to the muscles and tendons around the hip are the actual cause of this pain, and that inflammation is often not involved, calling injecting the bursa with a steroid into question.\n\nGTPS is estimated to affect 10% to 25% of the general population. This kind of hip pain has been reported to be more common in women and in patients with coexisting low back pain, osteoarthritis, Iliotibial band tenderness, and obesity. The study demonstrates that patients with GTPS can get similar results from dry needling as from a steroid injection.\n\n\"Evidence for dry needling of the hip in lieu of steroid injection is in its infancy,\" acknowledges lead author Kindyle L. Brennan, PT, PhD, with Baylor Scott & White Health. However, \"this study suggests dry needling as an effective alternative to cortisone injection.\"\n\nDr. Brennan adds that, \"The potential detrimental side effects of steroid injection, particularly repeated injections, are of concern for patients and providers alike.\" As a result, \"the identification of a comparable treatment alternative with minimal side effects, such as dry needling, offers valuable clinical advantages,\" she says.\n\nDr. Brennan and her fellow researchers treated 43 patients with GPTS and a total of 50 painful hips. The patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: one group receiving cortisone injection and the other group, dry needling. Treatments were administered over six weeks, and clinical outcomes were collected at the start of the trial and at one, three, and six weeks. The researchers measured pain and function. They also collected information about medication intake for pain in the involved hip, as well as the sex, age, and body mass index of study participants.\n\nThe baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. The results showed that cortisone injection did not provide better outcomes than dry needling for either pain or function in patients with GTPS. Both groups experienced a decrease in pain and an improved ability to move and complete daily activities.\n\nDr. Brennan cautions that while this study uses a larger sample than most, further studies are warranted. In particular, participants were only followed for six weeks; additional studies over longer time periods will be important.\n\nThe study is titled \"Dry Needling Versus Cortisone Injection in the Treatment of Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome: A Noninferiority Randomized Clinical Trial.\" Co-authors on the paper are Bryce C.

Doctors can try to treat glioblastoma with surgery to remove the cancerous cells, and blast them with radiation and chemotherapy. However, as the disease spreads, it becomes difficult to differentiate healthy brain cells from cancerous glioblastoma stem cells, and the condition is therefore almost impossible to completely remove.\n\nRead more: New prostate cancer DNA spit test developed by scientists\n\nEach year, glioblastoma kills around 15,000 adults in the U.S. The condition recently made headlines as the disease that killed senator John McCain at the age of 81.

But if a pregnant woman becomes infected, the virus can target neural progenitor cells in her fetus, putting the infant at risk of being born with microcephaly. This is where the head develops smaller than normal.\n\nThe study showed that a live-attenuated Zika vaccine (containing a weakened version of the virus that does not cause disease in humans) could selectively infect and kill human glioblastoma stem cells, explained Shi. That\u2019s because glioblastoma stem cells have similar properties to neural stem cells.\n\nTo investigate whether ZIKV-LAV, a vaccine developed at the University of Texas shown to protect mice and non-human primates against the virus, could kill human glioblastoma stem cells, the scientists injected a combination of glioblastoma stem cells from two human donors and the vaccine into mice.\n\nThe animals dosed only with the stem cells developed tumors. But those injected with the combination lived to around 50 days, 20 days longer than the stem cell mice.\n\nWhen the team sequenced the RNA (a molecule that helps with gene expressions) of glioblastoma stem cells exposed to the vaccine and then those which weren\u2019t, they found the virus prompted an antiviral reaction in the exposed cells in what is known as an oncolytic response.\n\nBefore undergoing surgery, cancer patients could be given the Zika vaccine to \"let the viruses hunt down the GSCs [glioblastoma stem cells] and eliminate them,\u201d said virologist Dr. Cheng-Feng Qin of the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences in Beijing, who worked on the study.\n\nShi said: \u201cScientists may turn the 'bad' side of a devastating pathogen\u2014Zika virus\u2014for potential cancer therapy.\u201d\n\nHowever, he cautioned any potential treatment which could emerge from the study is far from being rolled out.\n\n\u201cWe still need to further improve the specificity of the cancer-killing ability, while retain the safety of the vaccine strain,\u201d Shi explained. \u201cFor example, we need to make sure that the therapeutic vaccine virus does not infect and kill normal neurons in humans.\u201d\n\nDr. Harry Bulstrode, brain tumor expert funded by the charity Cancer Research U.K. who is researching how Zika could be used to treat aggressive brain tumors, who was not involved in the study, told Newsweek: \"This study is another interesting piece in the jigsaw, but it is never going to demonstrate what we believe to be the really exciting properties of the virus.

So in theory, treating them early on might help stave off some the more than 1.2 million heart attacks \u2014 a third of them fatal \u2014 that occur every year in the U.S.\n\nYet there\u2019s no evidence that treating people based on heart scan results does any good, said Dr. John McEvoy, of Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease in Baltimore, who led the new study.\n\nBy contrast, it\u2019s well known that the scans expose patients to a high dose of X-rays, which can increase their likelihood of developing cancer. And the dyes used to enhance the images cause kidney damage in a significant portion of people.\n\n\u201cTesting might lead to more harm than good,\u201d McEvoy told Reuters Health, adding that heart scans may cost $600 or more.\n\nHis team looked at 1,000 Korean patients who chose to get a heart scan as part of a health screening program at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital.\n\nThe researchers compared those patients to closely matched individuals who opted to forgo the scans \u2014 not currently recommended by guidelines \u2014 and just get the standard health checkup.\n\nMore than a fifth of the patients who got scanned had cholesterol buildups in their arteries, also called atherosclerosis.\n\nThree months later, these individuals were using cholesterol-lowering statins 34 percent of the time and blood-thinning aspirin 40 percent of the time. In those who tested negative for atherosclerosis or didn\u2019t get scanned, less than 10 percent used the medications.\n\nPeople who got scans also had more additional tests and major heart procedures.\n\nThe researchers expected that if the extra drugs and procedures were actually helpful, the treated people would have a lower rate of serious heart problems in the future.\n\nBut after another 18 months, there was no such difference. There was just one event in the 1,000 people who had CCTA (one case of hospitalization for chest pain) and one in the 1,000 people who didn\u2019t (a heart-related death).\n\nCurrently, whether a patient gets statin or aspirin is based on risk factors such as their age, and how much cholesterol is in their blood. Both drugs have side effects, notably joint problems and bleeding ulcers.\n\nAlthough the study can\u2019t prove that getting a scan caused the extra medication use, the gap could not be explained by differences in risk factors for heart disease, such as cholesterol levels or smoking.\n\nIn an editorial, Dr. Michael S. Lauer of National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said the new study serves as a reminder of the downsides of screening.\n\n\u201cPhysicians cannot easily ignore diagnoses made with screening tests because it is impossible for them to determine whether their patients have real disease or pseudodisease,\u201d Lauer notes. \u201cTherefore, physicians prescribe tests, medications, procedures, or even surgical procedures, all of which carry inherent risks.\u201d\n\nMcEvoy agrees. \u201cWith these new imaging techniques, we are left with the dilemma of what to do with the results,\u201d he said.\n\nEven when screening helps predict health problems down the road, Lauer adds, that doesn\u2019t mean treatments are necessarily beneficial.\n\n\u201cOverdiagnosis is threatening to become an increasingly important public health problem because of the enthusiasm for and proliferation of unproven screening tests,\u201d Lauer writes.\n\nMcEvoy said there have been several reports of doctors doing CCTA heart scans in healthy patients, although the practice is currently discouraged by the American Heart Association.\n\nAccording to McEvoy, doctors should focus on patients\u2019 lifestyle and traditional risk factors such as smoking and obesity.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/lEEptL and bit.ly/kBzX6J Archives of Internal Medicine, online May 23, 2011.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "An author of the paper, and the author of an accompanying editorial were quoted.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "THURSDAY, Sept. 2, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental test that can diagnose tuberculosis in less than two hours, making only one doctor visit necessary before treatment starts, is being hailed as a potentially significant advance against a disease that kills nearly 2 million people annually, most of them in developing countries.\n\n\"This is a very important discovery,\" said infectious disease expert Dr. Marc Siegel, an associate professor of medicine at New York University. \"This could be an important tool worldwide, and even here in the United States.\"\n\nThe test, known as the \"Xpert MTB/RIF\" test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and resistance to rifampin (RIF), appears to be more than 97 percent accurate and is even able to diagnose drug-resistant TB, researchers said.\n\nA report on the researchers' work was published in the Sept. 2 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.

The third in a series of studies from the Andersen lab involving PD and low-dose lithium, the results add to mounting evidence that low-doses of the psychotropic drug could benefit patients suffering from the incurable, degenerative condition.\n\nThis study, published online in Brain Research, involved Parkinsonian mice that were given Carbidopa/Levodopa (sold as Sinemet\u00ae), a drug used to boost levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is lost in PD. While the medication remains the single most effective agent in the management of PD symptoms, long-term use causes its own side effects, among them abnormal involuntary movements or AIMS. Buck professor and senior scientist Julie Andersen, PhD, says AIMS become problematic for 30 percent of patients after four to six years of treatment with Sinemet, with 90 percent of patients suffering from the complication after nine years of chronic use. \"For patients these side effects are just as devastating as the freezing that is associated with PD.\" \"In our mice we saw significant behavioral improvement.\"\n\nIn this study, Andersen and her team dosed the mice with an amount of lithium equivalent to about a quarter of what humans receive for the treatment of psychiatric diseases. Researchers found that lithium boosted the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase which increases dopamine synthesis via the inhibition of calpain-1, an enzyme that normally reduces dopamine synthesis.\n\nIn earlier studies, Andersen's team found that low-dose lithium was protective in two different mouse models of PD. Treatment in mice with a human mutation for PD began when the animals reached late middle-age, the human equivalent of about 60, which is the average age of onset of Parkinson's in humans. \"We clearly saw a prevention of the motor difficulties we would expect to see in the animals,\" said Andersen. \"The treatment also protected the area of the brain that is normally damaged by Parkinson's.\"\n\nPlans for a clinical trial of low-dose lithium for PD patients are in early stages. \"This study suggests potential therapeutic benefit in PD,\" said David K.

Simon chairs the Scientific Review Committee for the Parkinson's Study Group, a not-for-profit network of Parkinson's Centers. \"One caveat is that other agents that have shown clear efficacy in this model of PD have subsequently failed to show benefit in clinical studies in PD (e.g. CoQ10, creatine, and pioglitazone). However, this study provides additional evidence on top of prior work from Dr. Andersen's lab and others that lithium may have therapeutic potential in PD, which is a hypothesis that should be tested in clinical trials,\" he said.\n\nLithium is a naturally occurring element, not a 'developed' molecule like most medications.

The older people tended to have more activity in several inflammation-related genes compared with the younger group \u2014 no surprise, since as people get older, inflammation throughout the body tends to rise. Chronic diseases of aging, like diabetes, hypertension, heart problems, cancer, joint disorders and Alzheimer\u2019s, are all believed to have inflammation in common. \u201cMost of the diseases of aging are not really diseases of aging, per se, but rather diseases of inflammation,\u201d Furman says. The more active these genes were, the more likely the person was to have high blood pressure and atherosclerosis.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, even among older people, those with lower levels of these factors were more protected against inflammation \u2014 and they had something else in common too. They all drank caffeine regularly. People who drank more than five cups of coffee a day showed extremely low levels of activity in the inflammatory gene pathway. Caffeine inhibits this circuit and turns the inflammatory pathway off, the researchers say.\n\nThe goal isn\u2019t to make every trace of inflammation disappear, the scientists stress.

After a two-week break, they moved, round-robin style, to another arm of the trial.\n\nSubjects did not change their calorie intake over the course of the trial. But the more extract they consumed, the more weight and fat they lost. Altogether, they reduced their body fat by 16%, on average.\n\nOf the 16 volunteers, six wound up with a body mass index in the healthful range.\n\nOne downside is that the extract is \"extremely bitter.\" It would be difficult to take without a lot of water, Vinson reported.\n\nAt roughly $20 per month, however, green coffee extract is much less expensive than any of the weight-loss medications available over the counter or by prescription.\n\nThe trial was conducted in India and paid for by Applied Food Sciences Inc. of Austin, Tex., a manufacturer of green coffee bean extract.\n\nThe pilot study drew strong cautions from several scientists who weren't involved in the research.\n\n\"This is certainly a provocative study,\" said Dr. Gerald Weissmann, a physician and biochemist at New York University. But he said nutrition experts would want assurances that green coffee beans do not cause \"malabsorption\" within the human gut \u2014 a condition that would lead to weight loss as well as malnutrition, heart arrhythmias and other problems because vitamins and minerals are not passing through the intestine.\n\nDr. Arthur Grollman, a pharmacologist at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, said coffee beans contain about 250 different chemicals \u2014 some with positive and others with negative effects on human health. Though Vinson identified polyphenols and chlorogenic acid as the agents that appear to promote weight loss, Grollman said that claim needed further study.

But the mechanisms underlying the effect were not well understood.\n\nResearchers in the lab of Jun Wu, research assistant professor at the LSI, wanted to better understand cinnamaldehyde's action and determine whether it might be protective in humans, too.\n\n\"Scientists were finding that this compound affected metabolism,\" said Wu, who also is an assistant professor of molecular and integrative physiology at the U-M Medical School. \"So we wanted to figure out how--what pathway might be involved, what it looked like in mice and what it looked like in human cells.\"\n\nTheir findings, which appear in the December issue of the journal Metabolism, indicated that cinnamaldehyde improves metabolic health by acting directly on fat cells, or adipocytes, inducing them to start burning energy through a process called thermogenesis.\n\nWu and her colleagues tested human adipocytes from volunteers representing a range of ages, ethnicities and body mass indices. When the cells were treated with cinnamaldehyde, the researchers noticed increased expression of several genes and enzymes that enhance lipid metabolism. They also observed an increase in Ucp1 and Fgf21, which are important metabolic regulatory proteins involved in thermogenesis.\n\nAdipocytes normally store energy in the form of lipids. This long-term storage was beneficial to our distant ancestors, who had much less access to high-fat foods and thus a much greater need to store fat. That fat could then be used by the body in times of scarcity or in cold temperatures, which induce adipocytes to convert stored energy into heat.\n\n\"It's only been relatively recently that energy surplus has become a problem,\" Wu said. \"Throughout evolution, the opposite--energy deficiency--has been the problem. So any energy-consuming process usually turns off the moment the body doesn't need it.\"\n\nWith the rising obesity epidemic, researchers like Wu have been looking for ways to prompt fat cells to activate thermogenesis, turning those fat-burning processes back on.\n\nWu believes that cinnamaldehyde may offer one such activation method. And because it is already used widely in the food industry, it might be easier to convince patients to stick to a cinnamon-based treatment than to a traditional drug regimen.\n\n\"Cinnamon has been part of our diets for thousands of years, and people generally enjoy it,\" Wu said. \"So if it can help protect against obesity, too, it may offer an approach to metabolic health that is easier for patients to adhere to.\"\n\nNow, before anyone goes dumping tons of extra cinnamon in their egg nog in hopes of keeping holiday-season pounds at bay, Wu cautioned that further study is needed to determine how best to harness cinnamaldehyde's metabolic benefits without causing adverse side effects.\n\nThe research was supported by the Human Frontier Science Program, Edward Mallinckrodt Jr. Foundation, National Institutes of Health and American Heart Association.\n\nOther study authors were: Juan Jiang, Margo Emont, Heejin Jun, Xiaona Qiao, Jiling Liao and Dong-il Kim, all of U-M.\n\nThe study is titled \"Cinnamaldehyde induces fat cell-autonomous thermogenesis and metabolic reprogramming,\" DOI: 10.1016/j.metabol.2017.08.006.", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The funding sources are clearly included in the news release.

But ketamine has not been tested in a large clinical trial, and all evidence of its antidepressant effects has come from anecdotes and small studies of fewer than 100 patients. Now, in the largest study of its kind, researchers at Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at University of California San Diego mined the FDA Adverse Effect Reporting System (FAERS) database for depression symptoms in patients taking ketamine for pain. They found that depression was reported half as often among the more than 41,000 patients who took ketamine, as compared to patients who took any other drug or drug combination for pain.\n\nThe study, published May 3 in Scientific Reports, also uncovered antidepressant effects for three other drugs typically used for other purposes -- Botox, the pain reliever diclofenac and the antibiotic minocycline.\n\n\"Current FDA-approved treatments for depression fail for millions of people because they don't work or don't work fast enough,\" said senior author Ruben Abagyan, PhD, professor of pharmacy. \"This study extends small-scale clinical evidence that ketamine can be used to alleviate depression, and provides needed solid statistical support for wider clinical applications and possibly larger scale clinical trials.\"\n\nAbagyan led the study with pharmacy students Isaac Cohen and Tigran Makunts, and Rabia Atayee, PharmD, associate professor of clinical pharmacy, all at Skaggs School of Pharmacy.\n\nThe FAERS database contains more than 8 million patient records. The research team focused on patients in the database who received ketamine, narrowing their study population down to approximately 41,000. They applied a mathematical algorithm to look for statistically significant differences in reported depression symptoms for each patient.\n\n\"While most researchers and regulators monitor the FAERS database for increased incidences of symptoms in order to spot potentially harmful drug side effects, we were looking for the opposite -- lack of a symptom,\" Cohen said.\n\nThe team found that the incidence of depression symptoms in patients who took ketamine in addition to other pain therapeutics dropped by 50 percent (with an error margin less than 2 percent) compared to the patients who took any other drug or drug combination for pain. Patients who took ketamine also less frequently reported pain and opioid-associated side effects, such as constipation, as compared to patients who received other pain medications.\n\nAccording to Abagyan, it is possible that another factor common to patients taking ketamine was driving the antidepressant effect, such as the fact that ketamine also relieves pain. That's why they compared ketamine patients with patients taking other pain medications. That control group eliminated the possibility that people who take ketamine have less depression because they have less pain. Abagyan says it's still possible, though unlikely, the effect could be due to a still unidentified confounding factor.\n\nThree other drugs with previously under-appreciated antidepressant effects also emerged from this analysis: Botox, used cosmetically to treat wrinkles and medically to treat migraines and other disorders; diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID); and minocycline, an antibiotic.\n\nAfter the diclofenac finding, Abagyan and team went back and looked at ketamine patients who did not also take NSAIDs and compared them to patients who took any other combination of drugs for pain except NSAIDs. Depression rates in patients taking ketamine remained low.\n\nThe researchers hypothesize that the antidepressant effects of diclofenac and minocycline may be due, at least in part, to their abilities to reduce inflammation. For Botox, the potential mechanism for reducing depression is less clear. The team is now working to separate Botox's beauty effects (which could indirectly make a person feel better emotionally) and its antidepressant effects. To do this, they are first using FAERS data to determine if collagen fillers and other cosmetic treatments similarly affect depression rates.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, more than 300 million people experience depression worldwide. If not effectively treated, depression can become a chronic disease that increases a person's risk of mortality from suicide, heart disease or other factors. Depression is currently treated with five classes of antidepressants, most commonly serotonin reuptake inhibitors.\n\nFor financial and ethical reasons, ketamine has never been tested for its safety and effectiveness in treating depression in a large-scale clinical trial, but it reportedly works much more rapidly than standard antidepressants. Ketamine is relatively inexpensive and is covered by most health insurance plans if three other antidepressants fail.\n\n\"The approach we used here could be applied to any number of other conditions, and may reveal new and important uses for thousands of already approved drugs, without large investments in additional clinical trials,\" Makunts said.", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The release names the funder, not in the release text itself but on the EurekaAlert! website which hosts the news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "After a 40-year virtual ban on research involving psychedelic drugs, scientists look anew at their potential in treating pain and anxiety Clarification: A story in yesterday's Health/Science section on potential medical uses of psychedelic drugs left the impression that David Murray, special assistant in the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, is a medical doctor. Murray holds a doctorate degree but is not a physician. Diane never smoked marijuana, and she disapproved of her mother's past drug experiments. But cancer made the 33-year-old teacher ready to try anything that might help: she hoped she would find a cure in herbs from a Tibetan doctor or in the hands of a faith healer deep in the Brazilian rain forest. Then, as the pain and fatigue of advanced colon cancer left Diane increasingly bedridden, she just wanted the strength to get out of bed. That's when she found ecstasy, the illegal drug people often take at all-night dance parties. Though ecstasy is addictive and can damage hearts and brain cells, some researchers say the hallucinogen can also inspire deep feelings of well-being and intimacy with others. For a few hours at a time as the ecstasy took hold, Diane would leave her disease behind and walk in the park, sing with her parents, or talk about death without fear, her mother said. Ecstasy ''was the only thing that controlled the pain and her breathing,\" said Diane's mother, a Boston-area resident who asked not to be identified because last year she helped provide the illegal drugs for her daughter, whose middle name was Diane. ''She was emotionally and spiritually uplifted\" when she was on ecstasy. ''She was her funny, witty self.\" Forty years after widespread abuse led to a virtual ban on medical research involving psychedelic drugs, experiences like Diane's are leading scientists to take a second look. Though ecstasy, LSD, and ''magic mushrooms\" are now known by their partying reputation, psychedelic drugs were once seen as a promising treatment for schizophrenia and other mental conditions. Already, researchers in Miami are giving heroin addicts a hallucinogen called ibogaine in an attempt to reduce withdrawal symptoms. Rape victims in South Carolina take ecstasy in a study designed to help them talk about their ordeals. And soon, Dr. John Halpern at McLean Hospital in Belmont will begin giving ecstasy to people with advanced cancer to help them cope with the pain and anxiety of dying. For advocates of psychedelic drug research, the study at McLean, an affiliate of Harvard University, represents a chance to reduce the stigma hanging over the field. Back in the 1960s, Harvard professor Timothy Leary helped spur the backlash against psychedelic drugs with ethically questionable experiments and by advocating recreational LSD use to ''turn on, tune in, drop out.\" Halpern, by contrast, is a respected researcher whose past studies have found no evidence of brain damage among Navajos who regularly ingested peyote, a psychedelic drug derived from cactus. ''This is not Leary saying to young people . . . ''Take LSD. Drop out, and we're going to change society,' \" said Rick Doblin, president of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, an advocacy group that has pushed for resumption of psychedelic studies for years. ''This is something that can be helpful to people who have never done drugs before, and after they are done, they are not going to go out and undermine the foundations of our society.\" But the research is politically loaded, coming at a time when the Bush administration is fighting efforts to offer marijuana as an anti-nausea medicine for cancer patients. Federal officials fear that research showing medical value for illegal drugs will only encourage drug abuse. Dr. David Murray, special assistant in the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, said that some psychedelic studies are fueled by an agenda to promote the use of these drugs. ''This might not be a dispassionate quest for truth,\" he said, noting that Doblin's group has sued the federal government in support of a University of Massachusetts professor who wants to grow marijuana for research. Initially Doblin's group also planned to pay $250,000 for the ecstasy study at McLean, though Doblin withdrew support in favor of a donation from Peter Lewis, chairman of the Progressive Group of Insurance Cos. in Ohio. Partly because of such skepticism, Halpern's research was held up for more than a year while he struggled to get federal permits. That was more time than Diane had when her mother first read an article last June in which Doblin suggested that ecstasy might help in ''facing directly life's great challenge, to die gracefully and in peace.\" So, after being turned away by Halpern, Diane's mother found her own ''psychedelic therapist\" who was willing to lead Diane on trips with ecstasy, also known by its chemical name, MDMA. ''Before her first session, Diane could only get out of bed for a few minutes at a time. Sitting or standing caused her pain to spike to unbearable levels,\" her mother wrote in an essay after Diane died last fall. ''During the first session with MDMA, Diane's pain receded, her spirits soared, and she was able to walk to a park near my house and hang out with a friend.\" The psychedelic therapist, who asked that he not be named because of fear of prosecution, admitted in an interview with the Globe that he was only guessing at what might help Diane -- and he was initially afraid that he might kill her. After all, she was on a dozen medications, including methadone, which had caused an irregular heart rhythm -- and ecstasy can make heart problems worse. After experimenting with various psychedelic drugs, he found a dose of ecstasy -- about twice the level to be used in the McLean study -- that seemed to bring Diane peace, allowing them to talk directly about her illness. Diane's mother recalled that ''on one occasion, the therapist asked Diane how she felt about her pain. She said it was like an unruly child in need of attention. She would send it love.\" On her final day, Diane slept peacefully for hours after taking ecstasy, her mother said, without moans and gasps. That night, ''she opened her eyes with an expression of absolute wonder, reached out to touch her dad, and died,\" according to Diane's mother. ''We are honored to have witnessed and shared a holy experience, my daughter's good death.\" But outside observers caution that psychedelic drug treatment is ethically risky: What begins as treatment for anxiety could become experiments in altering a dying person's consciousness. That, one analyst said, could take away from someone's ability to be fully engaged at the end of life. ''If we're altering their mental experience and their sense of . . . the dying process, then we're crossing some boundaries that need to be very highly considered,\" said Keith Meador, director of the theology and medicine program at Duke University Divinity School. For now, Halpern said, he just wants to do the research to better understand how the drugs affect people with cancer, 40 percent of whom say in surveys that they don't get enough treatment for pain. Working with an oncologist from the Lahey Clinic in Burlington, he is beginning to look for 12 advanced cancer patients to undergo ecstasy therapy as well as counseling. ''It's always been about doing good science,\" said Halpern. ''Is this helpful for people with cancer and their families?

Those who reported eating nearly three servings of fruit a day on average had a 25% lower risk of developing breast cancer than those who ate half a serving of fruit.\n\nMORE: With Early Breast Cancer Treatment, Less May be More: Studies\n\nCertain fruits seemed to confer the biggest protection against breast cancer \u2014 apples, bananas and grapes were associated with the greatest reduction in risk while kale and oranges in adulthood also contributed to reduced breast cancer risk.\n\nFarvid says that apples, bananas and grapes contain fiber, which could help to lower cancer risk; they are also high in flavonoids, which act as antioxidants to combat damage to cells that can trigger abnormal growth. Kale and oranges are high in vitamin C, another antioxidant.\n\nMORE: Mediterranean Diet With Olive Oil Linked to Lower Breast Cancer Risk\n\n\u201cThis study underscores the importance of what a young girl eats for her future health,\u201d says Farvid. \u201cThis study also has an important message for schools and the need to provide students with the opportunity to consume more fruits and vegetables as part of the school meal program.\u201d\n\nFarvid wasn\u2019t able to document a strong relationship between vegetables and lower breast cancer risk, but says that may be because the study wasn\u2019t powered enough to detect an effect.\n\nThe findings are among the first to look at how diet during adolescence can affect health later, and highlights the importance of establishing healthy habits from a young age, especially since many of the chronic diseases occur over many years and get rooted early in life.\n\nThe results also underscore the importance of eating whole fruit, rather than fruit juice. In the study, Farvid and her team could not find any significant relationship between fruit juice and breast cancer risk; that may be because fruit\u2019s anti-cancer effects may have to do with the fiber found in the whole fruit, which is stripped out of juice. In the latest Dietary Guidelines for Americans, however, government nutritionists equated servings of whole fruit with fruit juice. \u201cWe recommend whole fruit and not fruit juice,\u201d says Farvid, \u201cbecause maybe one of the most important ways that fruit decreases risk of breast cancer is through fiber, and even natural fruit juice often has no fiber in it.\u201d\n\nIn another study also published in the , a separate group of researchers found that among 22,000 Danish women, those who added two alcoholic drinks a day on average increased their risk of developing breast cancer by 30% over five years. The added risk of cancer, however, was counterbalanced by a lower risk of heart disease.\n\nTaken together, the results show how critical diet can be in modulating risk of breast cancer. While challenging, changing diet can be a relatively easy way to alter a woman\u2019s breast cancer risk equation, beginning even at a young age.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "No independent sources were included in the article, nor does it tell readers who funded the study.

Then, they isolated the white blood cells from each donor and studied inflammatory cell levels and the effect marijuana had on the cells.\n\n\u201cThe patients who didn\u2019t smoke marijuana had a very high level of inflammatory cells compared to those who did use,\u201d Kaminski said. \u201cIn fact, those who used marijuana had levels pretty close to a healthy person not infected with HIV.\u201d\n\nKaminski, director of MSU\u2019s Institute for Integrative Toxicology, has studied the effects of marijuana on the immune system since 1990. His lab was the first to identify the proteins that can bind marijuana compounds on the surface of immune cells. Up until then, it was unclear how these compounds, also known as cannabinoids, affected the immune system.\n\nHIV, which stands for human immunodeficiency virus, infects and can destroy or change the functions of immune cells that defend the body. With antiretroviral therapy \u2013 a standard form of treatment that includes a cocktail of drugs to ward off the virus \u2013 these cells have a better chance of staying intact.\n\nYet, even with this therapy, certain white blood cells can still be overly stimulated and eventually become inflammatory.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue investigating these cells and how they interact and cause inflammation specifically in the brain,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cWhat we learn from this could also have implications to other brain-related diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s since the same inflammatory cells have been found to be involved.\u201d\n\nKnowing more about this interaction could ultimately lead to new therapeutic agents that could help HIV patients specifically maintain their mental function.\n\n\u201cIt might not be people smoking marijuana,\u201d Kaminski said. \u201cIt might be people taking a pill that has some of the key compounds found in the marijuana plant that could help.\u201d\n\nMichigan State University has been working to advance the common good in uncommon ways for more than 150 years.

It has the potential to turn cancer into a chronic disease, because we can monitor patients individually and respond with treatment to the genetic makeup of their cancer.\"\n\nToner says the test is like a liquid biopsy and targets almost all solid cancers -- cancers found in \"solid\" organs like the breast or prostate. The cancer cells it finds would be analyzed and their genetic makeup determined, which would be useful in monitoring patients and targeting therapies to the individual.\n\nVeridex, a Johnson and Johnson company, announced the partnership in a statement, saying it involves Ortho Biotech Oncology Research and Development, a unit of Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development.\n\n\"This new technology has the potential to facilitate an easy-to-administer, noninvasive blood test that would allow us to count tumor cells, and to characterize the biology of the cells,\" said Robert McCormack, Veridex's head of technology innovation and strategy. \"Harnessing the information contained in these cells in an in-vitro clinical setting could enable tools to help select treatment and monitor how patients are responding.\"\n\nVeridex launched the first commercial test using circulating tumor cell technology in 2004, the company said.

These efficacy analyses evaluated patient subgroups based on the number of \u03b54 alleles of apolipoprotein E (APOE4), a major genetic risk factor in up to 65 percent of patients with AD. The published results showed a gene-dose effect at the high dose of tramiprosate (150 mg, twice daily), with patients with two APOE4 alleles (APOE4/4 homozygotes) showing the largest clinical benefit, those with one APOE4 allele (APOE4 heterozygotes) showing an intermediate benefit, while APOE4 non-carriers showed no benefit from tramiprosate. The results published in JPAD are the first evidence from a large clinical trial to associate efficacy of an amyloid-targeted agent with APOE4 status in AD patients.\n\nThe manuscript, titled \"Clinical Benefits of Tramiprosate in Alzheimer's Disease Are Associated with Higher Number of APOE4 Alleles: The 'APOE4 Gene-Dose Effect',\" is featured in the advanced online publication of The Journal of the Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease (JPAD) with lead authors from Alzheon, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company focused on treatments for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Based on the analyses in the publication, Alzheon is developing ALZ-801, an optimized oral prodrug of tramiprosate, and has refined the design of the pivotal clinical trial to evaluate ALZ-801 as a potential disease-modifying agent in symptomatic AD patients who are APOE4/4 homozygotes.\n\nAnton P. Porsteinsson, MD, Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry and Director of the Alzheimer's Disease Care, Research and Education Program at the University of Rochester in Rochester, NY, and an investigator in the North American Phase 3 clinical trial, commented: \"The genetically-defined population of APOE4 carriers has an 8-12 fold increased risk of developing AD and has more rapidly progressive disease, usually becoming symptomatic a decade earlier than non-carriers of the APOE4 genotype. These analyses with tramiprosate in the APOE4 subgroups are compelling, and suggest a meaningful clinical benefit, on top of the existing symptomatic AD treatments, in Alzheimer's patients who are in great need of new treatments. We can apply these insights about the therapeutic response of APOE4 carriers to refine patient selection and potentially improve the success rate of new Alzheimer's medicines.\"\n\nThe efficacy and safety analyses with tramiprosate published in JPAD reveal a therapeutic effect in patients who are carriers of APOE4 after segmenting them from the larger, non-genetically-defined study population in the Phase 3 clinical program, involving more than 2,000 AD patients in North America and Europe. In the overall Mild and Moderate AD study population with baseline MMSE of 16-26 (and any APOE genotype), the North American study did not demonstrate a significant benefit with either of two tramiprosate doses (100 mg BID and 150 mg BID), compared to placebo, during the 78-week study period. As a result, the European study was terminated before completion, and the results were not previously published.\n\n\"To our knowledge, this is the first time that the clinical benefits of an amyloid-targeted agent have been associated with the number of APOE4 alleles in Alzheimer's patients. This new insight shows how we can apply a precision medicine approach in AD and develop this drug for the right patients, namely patients with the APOE4 genotype, which carries the highest risk as well as the earliest onset and faster disease progression,\" said Martin Tolar, MD, PhD, Founder, President and CEO of Alzheon. \"These newly-published findings form the basis for the design of our Phase 3 program, and further support our company's commitment to advance ALZ-801 into pivotal studies in APOE4/4 homozygous AD patients who represent up to 15% of AD patients1. We are preparing to advance ALZ-801, a promising new treatment for Alzheimer's disease, into confirmatory clinical studies in 2017.\"\n\nThe observed gene-dose effects of tramiprosate in APOE4 carriers are consistent with the prevalence of amyloid pathology in AD patients. Amyloid imaging in AD clinical trials has shown the highest prevalence of positive amyloid scans in APOE4/4 homozygotes, and the lowest prevalence in APOE4 non-carriers. As one of the few orally-administered amyloid-targeted agents, tramiprosate blocks the aggregation of beta amyloid monomers into toxic oligomers, and was developed to show efficacy in patients with amyloid pathology and an accurate diagnosis of AD.\n\nEfficacy Results in APOE4/4 Homozygous Patients from the JPAD Phase 3 Analyses\n\nThe published results showed the largest clinical benefit in the Alzheimer's APOE4/4 homozygous AD patients, who represent approximately 15 percent of patients in the study.3 APOE4/4 homozygous patients who received the high dose of tramiprosate showed efficacy benefit compared to placebo on both cognitive and functional measures in the Phase 3 analyses. The effects on the ADAS-cog cognitive outcome were significant at Week 65 (LS means difference from placebo: 3.47, nominal p = 0.007) and Week 78 (2.60, nominal p = 0.043), and corresponded to 66 percent and 40 percent benefit from tramiprosate compared to placebo. These effects were supported by functional benefits on the CDR-SB that showed a positive trend at Week 65 (LS means difference from placebo: 0.79, nominal p = 0.063) and were numerically in favor of tramiprosate at Week 78 (0.54, nominal p = 0.21).\n\n\"APOE4/4 homozygous AD patients are especially challenging since they are known to have the highest burden of amyloid pathology in cerebral cortex and blood vessels, which explains their susceptibility to ARIA-E with some amyloid-targeted treatments. In these new subgroup analyses, the high dose of tramiprosate showed promising clinical effects in APOE4/4 homozygous AD patients already receiving maximal standard of care, and this dose was not associated with any events of vasogenic edema,\" said Susan Abushakra, MD, Chief Medical Officer of Alzheon and lead author on the JPAD publication. \"Replication of these findings in Alzheon's planned Phase 3 study would provide a meaningful therapeutic advance for AD patients with the APOE4/4 genotype, and we are now preparing to carry forward these results into the development of ALZ-801.\"\n\nThe safety profile of tramiprosate in 2,025 AD patients across the two studies was favorable and similar in the APOE4 carriers and non-carriers. The main adverse events were gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting and weight loss), which were mild or moderate in severity.\n\nNew ARIA-E safety analyses were reported in the JPAD publication. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluations in 426 patients were conducted during the Phase 3 studies and did not reveal any events of vasogenic brain edema (ARIA-E or amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema) on either dose of tramiprosate. Vasogenic edema (or brain swelling) is a side effect observed in clinical studies with some injectable anti-amyloid antibodies, which requires MRI monitoring and can occasionally be serious.\n\nAbout Tramiprosate and the New Prodrug ALZ-801\n\nIn 2013, Alzheon obtained the license to tramiprosate and the associated portfolio of drug compounds, along with the historical clinical dataset, and applied new insights to the existing data. This led to the development of an optimized oral, amyloid-targeted drug candidate, ALZ-801. Alzheon developed ALZ-801 as a novel oral prodrug of tramiprosate, designed to improve the pharmacokinetic and gastrointestinal tolerability profile, while retaining tramiprosate as the active agent in ALZ-801. Phase 1 studies in more than 170 subjects, including healthy elderly, showed that ALZ-801 provides consistent plasma levels of tramiprosate, with very low inter-subject variability. The rate of nausea and vomiting was also lower than with tramiprosate tablets. ALZ-801 at the dose of 265 mg provided equivalent systemic plasma exposures to tramiprosate 150 mg tablets. Alzheon is advancing ALZ-801 into pivotal Phase 3 studies in the genetically-defined APOE4/4 homozygous patients with Alzheimer's disease.\n\nApolipoprotein E, or APOE, is a gene that provides a predictive window into an individual's Alzheimer's disease prognosis. APOE encodes for a protein called apolipoprotein E, which combines with fats to form lipoproteins that can be moved throughout the body. In the brain, apolipoprotein E helps shuttle cholesterol to neurons to support their normal function. There are three forms, or alleles, of the APOE gene, called \u03b52, \u03b53 and \u03b54. The \u03b54 allele has been found to correlate with high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. People who inherit one copy of the \u03b54 allele, APOE4 heterozygotes, have an increased chance of developing the disease; those who inherit two copies of the allele, APOE4 homozygotes, are at even greater risk and tend to have more aggressive disease. The \u03b54 allele is significantly overrepresented in the Alzheimer's disease population compared to the general population: up to 65 percent of Alzheimer's patients carry one or two copies of the \u03b54 allele compared to about 25 percent of the general population.\n\nAlzheon, Inc. is committed to developing innovative medicines by directly addressing the underlying pathology of devastating neurodegenerative disorders. Our lead Alzheimer's clinical candidate, ALZ-801, is a Phase 3-ready, first-in-class, small molecule oral inhibitor of amyloid aggregation and neurotoxicity - hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. ALZ-801 is a novel prodrug that builds on the safety and efficacy profile of the active compound tramiprosate, which has been evaluated in clinical trials involving over 2,000 Alzheimer's patients. Our clinical expertise and technology platform is focused on developing drug candidates using a precision medicine approach based on individual genetic and biological information to advance therapies with the greatest impact for patients.\n\n1 Ward et al.

The authors, from Cleveland Clinic in the US, say considering radiosurgery earlier on could make a big difference to patients' lives.\n\nTrigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a very painful nerve disorder that causes an electrical shock feeling in the face, usually in older people. Some things can trigger it, like chewing or even the wind blowing, but attacks can be random. On a scale of 1-10, patients often describe the pain as 15 - off the scale. TN is commonly treated with anti-epileptic medications. While this can reduce the pain, it makes patients drowsy and tired, and they report feeling drunk. This has an impact on their quality of life and frequently causes depression, as it stops them from driving, working or even just leaving the house.\n\nAccording to the new study, radiosurgery, which is normally a second line treatment to be used following the medication, helps improve quality of life and reduce depression in patients with TN. By considering it earlier as a treatment option, doctors could help improve the lives of patients with TN more quickly.\n\n\"We knew radiosurgery results in pain relief, but we didn't know if the patients actually felt better,\" said Dr. Samuel Chao, corresponding author of the study. \"I think people go and see their neurologist and get the pain under control with medication, but they don't realize how lousy this can make them feel. Using radiosurgery earlier on allows patients to get off the medications, improving their quality of life by allowing them to return to activities they used to do.\"\n\nRadiosurgery is a method for physically treating the nerve using radiation - with stereotactic radiosurgery, doctors can focus 192 beams of radiation on a single point. It is non-invasive, so doesn't require the healing time of traditional surgery. Treatment takes less than an hour and requires no anesthetic. However, it is often overlooked or delayed as a treatment because there is a lack of capability and experience with the method. Research has shown that radiosurgery reduces pain for 80% of patients, but the broader impact on their lives remained unknown.\n\nIn the new study, Dr. Chao, Dr. Kotecha and his colleagues prospectively collected data from 50 patients they treated with radiosurgery using two questionnaires: EuroQOL 5-Dimension and Patient Health Questionnaire 9. They asked questions about the patients' pain and facial numbness, their health and their ability to take care of themselves. The researchers analyzed patients' answers before treatment and at each follow-up appointment, and found that patients reported an improved quality of life and lower rates of depression after radiosurgery. Importantly, the benefit of treatment was strongly driven by improvements in pain and discomfort as well as self-care.\n\n\"Pain and the medication to stop the pain make it difficult for people with TN to go outside and live life,\" explained Dr. Chao. \"With radiosurgery, we can reduce pain, improve quality of life and decrease depression - people can go out and enjoy life without worrying they will have a random attack. Giving options empowers the patient to be more aware of themselves and manage their own condition.\"\n\nThe team plans to analyze the impact of other treatment options and carry out a cost-based analysis to establish the best treatment options for TN.\n\nThe article is \"Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Trigeminal Neuralgia Improves Patient-Reported Quality-of-Life and Reduces Depression,\" by Rupesh Kotecha, Jacob A.

Growing up, he was \u201ca jumper and a rebounder,\u201d he said, scooping basketballs off the rim during Roxbury pickup games and later playing in high school and college.\n\n\u201cWe thought we\u2019d be young forever,\u201d said Francis, who co-anchors a radio news program in Washington, D.C. \u201cThe big wake-up call is when our bodies wear down.\u201d\n\nBaby boomers, determined to keep moving no matter what wear and tear and arthritis have wrought, are fueling a surge in joint replacements. Taking advantage of improved artificial joints and surgical methods, aging Americans are getting so many new hips, knees, shoulders, and ankles that orthopedic surgeons are having trouble meeting the demand.\n\nHip replacements in the United States more than doubled between 2000 and 2014 \u2014 from 160,282 to 371,605 a year \u2014 according to the most recent data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, which tracks hospital discharges. Knee replacements increased at an even faster clip in the same period, from 274,467 to 680,886.\n\nThe procedures can cost up to $50,000 for knees and $40,000 for hips, though the prices vary widely among Medicare and private insurers, which typically bear the bulk of the cost. The average age of patients listed in the American Joint Replacement Registry is about 66.\n\nWith millions more boomers still in their late 50s and early 60s, the trend will only continue.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re aging, they\u2019ve had some injuries, and they want to continue to be active into their 60s, 70s, and 80s. And they need a good joint to do that,\u201d said Dr. David Mattingly, surgeon in chief at New England Baptist Hospital in Boston, one of the nation\u2019s top orthopedics centers.\n\nThe surgical surge has created an expanding brigade of bionic baby boomers whose artificial parts are accompanied by sky-high expectations \u2014 something doctors struggle to manage. Despite steady improvement in technology and outcomes, replacement joints don\u2019t create superhumans. Still, many patients are lifelong fitness buffs who begin plotting their return to the gym, the golf course, or the cross-country skiing trails the moment they are discharged from the hospital.\n\nWinthrop retiree John Carver, 76, is already back at the fitness center after having replacement surgery on his right knee in February. \u201cMy goal is to get back to an hour \u2014 30 minutes on the elliptical and some back exercises,\u201d he said. A Marine veteran who ran the New York City Marathon the year he turned 40, Carver has scheduled a similar procedure on his left knee in May, early enough \u201cto be ready for golf season.\u201d\n\nFor those who are still working at physically demanding jobs, there are other considerations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m up and down the scaffolding all day,\u201d said David Smith, 62, of Arlington, a construction superintendent in Boston who had a hip replacement in January. \u201cMy first focus was to just get on my feet so I can work another 10 years. So I said, \u2018OK, let\u2019s get this done.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSmith, who played hockey in college and as an adult and spent years lifting heavy equipment on building sites, plans to return to his job this spring. But he has already resumed golfing \u2014 on a March trip to visit his son and his family in Atlanta. And, he promised, \u201cI will get on the skates again.\u201d\n\nLike Smith, many boomers endured months or years of pain before surgery, pain caused by \u201cbone-on-bone\u201d friction when cartilage deterioration eroded their bone cushioning. Some took multiple cortisone shots, hoping to avoid surgeries. But having had the procedures, many say they wish they\u2019d done it sooner.\n\nWest Newbury\u2019s town clerk, Mike McCarron,, 62, played high school and college football and once climbed Mount Washington in the winter. McCarron underwent two knee replacements simultaneously in 2011. \u201cI had a coupon,\u201d he joked. Now he runs on the treadmill at his Merrimack Valley gym and hikes in the Maine wilderness.\n\nSusan Nadworny, 61, of Melrose, owned an aerobics studio in Boston\u2019s North End during the 1980s and 1990s. There, she spent three or four hours a day leading high-impact exercise classes. Nadworny, who now works as a public policy advocate for people with disabilities, had knee replacement surgery last April. Nearly a year later, she pedals an indoor exercise bicycle and spends an hour a day walking dogs in the woods.\n\nThe vast majority of joint-surgery patients report much less pain and greater mobility afterward, with success rates topping 95 percent, according to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, a physicians organization. In patient-reported surveys, some still complain of pain and tissue inflammation after their procedures. Smaller numbers suffer serious complications, ranging from blood clotting to hospital-acquired infections.\n\nNew England Baptist expects to perform a record 7,000 knee and hip replacements at its Mission Hill campus this year, a nearly sixfold increase from the 1,200 annually it did in the mid-1980s. \u201cMost of the busy guys do 15 to 20 a week,\u201d Mattingly said.\n\nLast year, the average salary for joint-replacement specialists topped $575,000, reported the Dallas consulting firm Merritt Hawkins & Associates, compared with just over $230,000 for family doctors.\n\nBecause of improvements in materials and the way they\u2019re treated and sterilized, implants \u2014 which include polyethylene and titanium alloys \u2014 don\u2019t wear down as fast as they once did. Implants now have a 90 percent chance of lasting two decades, much longer than in the past, Mattingly said.\n\nWhile physical activity obviously plays a role in joint deterioration, genetics may be the biggest factor in determining who needs a replacement and when, he said. Knee replacements were first offered in the 1960s, and hip replacements began in the 1940s, so many boomers are facing the same surgeries their fathers and mothers underwent.\n\nBut boomers may have a tougher time coming to terms with the reality that a new body part doesn\u2019t mean they can resume all of the high-impact activities that were a major part of their lives.\n\n\u201cNobody will return to playing football,\u201d Mattingly said. \u201cThe person who struggles is the one who\u2019s done long-distance running for years and just doesn\u2019t want to give it up.\u201d\n\nTechnology could eventually change that. Joint implants have become more customized to suit individual patients, but a Billerica company is pushing the personalization trend further. ConforMIS Inc. uses 3-D printing and imaging software to more precisely tailor replacement joints. It sells between 17,000 and 20,000 personalized knee implants a year \u2014 still a small share of the market \u2014 and last year won US regulatory approval for its first hip implants.\n\n\u201cThe baby boomer explosion is a big deal in health care,\u201d said ConforMIS chief executive Mark Augusti. \u201cTechnology has to be part of the solution. Baby boomers expect to be more active as they get older and have higher expectations about quality of life in their later years.\u201d\n\nStephanie Donvan, 60, of Arlington, who received a ConforMIS knee replacement in May, recalled feeling like she was \u201ccarrying a dead tree trunk\u201d before the surgery.\n\nNow, she said, \u201cI\u2019m out walking my Lab about five miles a day, every day.

Instead, he chose cold.\n\nAs in 90 degrees below zero.\n\nWorking with tiny instruments that he helped design, Lee guided the devices into the Metairie man's midsection through an incision the size of a quarter. Then he used a concentrated combination of nitrogen and argon to freeze the tumors and kill the cancer cells. From that point on, the chemicals in Davis' body took over, breaking down and absorbing the deactivated tumors -- Lee calls them \"ice balls\" -- in a months-long process.\n\nThe big chill was so localized, and the area of attack was so small, that Davis, 65, said he didn't feel anything during or after the March 30 procedure, which lasted about an hour.\n\nAfter a brief hospital stay, Davis, a retired airline baggage handler, said he was up and about in two weeks, compared with months of recovery that conventional surgery requires. The recovery has been pain-free, and the cancer hasn't returned, he said.\n\nThis technique, which Lee helped develop and has been using for about a year, represents a big advance over conventional kidney-cancer surgery, which can require a foot-long incision and, sometimes, removal of a rib so the doctor can reach the malignancy, according to experts.\n\nIt even represents an advance over conventional laparoscopic surgery, which requires separate incisions for devices that can grasp and sever the cancer, as well as an endoscope that provides illumination and a view of the target area, said Marvin Guiles, director of engineering at Cambridge Endo, who worked on the instruments with Lee.\n\nOnly one incision is required because Lee and other doctors can use a device called a trocar, which has holes for each instrument and the endoscope. Besides providing an entry point, the trocar makes a seal at the incision point to prevent the leakage of carbon dioxide, which is pumped into the abdomen to give the surgeon more space in which to work.\n\nThe hook, grasper and scissors are on the ends of shafts less than one-fifth of an inch wide. Besides being tiny, Guiles said they offer the advantage of flexibility.\n\nWhile keeping an eye on his progress on an operating-room monitor, Lee was able to move the tools into position and administer two freezing blasts through a needle probe that had been inserted through Davis' skin and placed inside the tumor.\n\n\"The ice ball forms very rapidly, \" Lee said.\n\n\"I was amazed at what they could do through that opening with those tools . . . to manipulate the tools and not destroy you in the process, \" he said.\n\nTechnically known as single-port cryosurgery, the technique is used only for cancers no bigger than an inch and a half wide that haven't spread beyond the kidney, Lee said.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, the five-year survival rate for kidney cancer found at this stage is 96 percent. This form of cancer strikes about 57,760 Americans every year, according to the organization. About 12,980 die of the cancer each year.\n\nWhile kidney cancer can have symptoms such as back pain and bloody urine, it's difficult to detect early, said Lee, who said about half of these tumors are found when people undergo X-rays for other reasons.\n\nThat was what happened to Davis, who had gone to a hospital for a kidney stone. His doctor saw a suspicious growth on Davis' kidney and referred him to Lee.\n\nDavis said he chose single-port cryosurgery \"because I didn't want to be cut wide open any more than I had to be.\"\n\nWhile the procedure may look straightforward, it's extremely delicate, said Linda Cormier, a sales representative for Cambridge Endo, whose headquarters is in Framingham, Mass.\n\nIf a rare mishap occurs, the doctor will have to resort to conventional surgery, requiring a much bigger incision.\n\nDavis said he was aware of that possibility before he underwent the procedure. He also knew that the cancer happened to be a spot where the small instruments couldn't reach it, the operation might have to be much more extensive.\n\nThat was the first thought on Davis' mind as he returned to consciousness in the recovery room, he said. \"When I woke up and saw that I wasn't all bandaged up, I said, \"Aha! I'm OK!' \"\n\nJohn Pope can be reached at jpope@timespicayune.com or at 504.826.3317.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story quotes no sources other than the surgeon who developed the technique.

Winer, chief of women\u2019s cancers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said that even women who completed their five years of tamoxifen months or years ago might consider starting on the drug again.\n\nTamoxifen blocks the effect of the hormone estrogen, which fuels tumor growth in estrogen receptor-positive cancers that account for about 65 percent of cases in premenopausal women. Some small studies in the 1990s suggested that there was no benefit to using tamoxifen longer than five years, so that has been the standard.\n\nAbout 227,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year in the United States, and an estimated 30,000 of them are in premenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive cancer and prime candidates for tamoxifen. But postmenopausal women also take tamoxifen if they cannot tolerate the alternative drugs, known as aromatase inhibitors.\n\nThe new study, known as Atlas, included nearly 7,000 women with ER-positive disease who had completed five years of tamoxifen. They came from about three dozen countries. Half were chosen at random to take the drug another five years, while the others were told to stop.\n\nIn the group assigned to take tamoxifen for 10 years, 21.4 percent had a recurrence of breast cancer in the ensuing 10 years, meaning the period 5 to 14 years after their diagnoses. The recurrence rate for those who took only five years of tamoxifen was 25.1 percent.\n\nAbout 12.2 percent of those in the 10-year treatment group died from breast cancer, compared with 15 percent for those in the control group.\n\nThere was virtually no difference in death and recurrence between the two groups during the five years of extra tamoxifen. The difference came in later years, suggesting that tamoxifen has a carry-over effect that lasts long after women stop taking it.\n\nWhether these differences are big enough to cause women to take the drug for twice as long remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cThe treatment effect is real, but it\u2019s modest,\u201d said Dr. Paul E. Goss, director of breast cancer research at the Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nTamoxifen has side effects, including endometrial cancer, blood clots and hot flashes, which cause many women to stop taking the drug. In the Atlas trial, it appears that roughly 40 percent of the patients assigned to take tamoxifen for the additional five years stopped prematurely.\n\nSome 3.1 percent of those taking the extra five years of tamoxifen got endometrial cancer versus 1.6 percent in the control group. However, only 0.6 percent of those in the longer treatment group died from endometrial cancer or pulmonary blood clots, compared with 0.4 percent in the control group.\n\n\u201cOver all, the benefits of extended tamoxifen seemed to outweigh the risks substantially,\u201d Trevor J. Powles of the Cancer Center London, said in a commentary published by The Lancet.\n\nDr. Judy E. Garber, director of the Center for Cancer Genetics and Prevention at Dana-Farber, said many women have a love-hate relationship with hormone therapies.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t feel well on them, but it\u2019s their safety net,\u201d said Dr. Garber, who added that the news would be welcomed by many patients who would like to stay on the drug. \u201cI have patients who agonize about this, people who are coming to the end of their tamoxifen.\u201d\n\nEmily Behrend, who is a few months from finishing her five years on tamoxifen, said she would definitely consider another five years. \u201cIf it can keep the cancer away, I\u2019m all for it,\u201d said Ms. Behrend, 39, a single mother in Tomball, Tex. She is taking the antidepressant Effexor to help control the night sweats and hot flashes caused by tamoxifen.\n\nCost is not considered a huge barrier to taking tamoxifen longer because the drug can be obtained for less than $200 a year.\n\nThe results, while answering one question, raise many new ones, including whether even more than 10 years of treatment would be better still.\n\nPerhaps the most important question is what the results mean for postmenopausal women. Even many women who are premenopausal at the time of diagnosis will pass through menopause by the time they finish their first five years of tamoxifen, or will have been pushed into menopause by chemotherapy.\n\nPostmenopausal patients tend to take aromatase inhibitors like anastrozole or letrozole, which are more effective than tamoxifen at preventing breast cancer recurrence, though they do not work for premenopausal women.\n\nMr. Peto said he thought the results of the Atlas study would \u201capply to endocrine therapy in general,\u201d meaning that 10 years of an aromatase inhibitor would be better than five years.

In a new clinical trial, scientists show that a daily dose of probiotic Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium bacteria taken over a period of just 12 weeks is enough to yield a moderate but significant improvement in the score of elderly Alzheimer's patients on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scale, a standard measure of cognitive impairment.\n\nProbiotics are known to give partial protection against certain infectious diarrheas, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, eczema, allergies, colds, tooth decay, and periodontal disease. But scientists have long hypothesized that probiotics might also boost cognition, as there is continuous two-way communication between the intestinal microflora, the gastrointestinal tract, and the brain through the nervous system, the immune system, and hormones (along the so-called \"microbiota-gut-brain axis\"). In mice, probiotics have indeed been shown to improve learning and memory, and reduce anxiety and depression- and OCD-like symptoms. But prior to the present study there was very limited evidence of any cognitive benefits in humans.\n\nHere, the researchers, from Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, and Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran, present results from a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial on a total of 52 women and men with Alzheimer's between 60 and 95 years of age. Half of the patients daily received 200 ml milk enriched with four probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. casei, L. fermentum, and Bifidobacterium bifidum (approximately 400 billion bacteria per species), while the other half received untreated milk.\n\nAt the beginning and the end of the 12-week experimental period, the scientists took blood samples for biochemical analyses and tested the cognitive function of the subjects with the MMSE questionnaire, which includes tasks like giving the current date, counting backwards from 100 by sevens, naming objects, repeating a phrase, and copying a picture.\n\nOver the course of the study, the average score on the MMSE questionnaire significantly increased (from 8.7 to 10.6, out of a maximum of 30) in the group receiving probiotics, but not in the control group (from 8.5 to 8.0). Even though this increase is moderate, and all patients remained severely cognitively impaired, these results are important because they are the first to show that probiotics can improve human cognition. Future research, on more patients and over longer time-scales, is necessary to test if the beneficial effects of probiotics become stronger after longer treatment.\n\n\"In a previous study, we showed that probiotic treatment improves the impaired spatial learning and memory in diabetic rats, but this is the first time that probiotic supplementation has been shown to benefit cognition in cognitively impaired humans,\" says Professor Mahmoud Salami from Kashan University, the senior author of the study.\n\nTreatment with probiotics also resulted in lower levels of triglycerides, Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL), high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) in the blood of the Alzheimer patients, and likewise a reduction in two common measures (called \"Homeostatic Model Assessment\", HOMA-IR and HOMA-B) of insulin resistance and the activity of the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.\n\n\"These findings indicate that change in the metabolic adjustments might be a mechanism by which probiotics affect Alzheimer's and possibly other neurological disorders,\" says Salami. \"We plan to look at these mechanisms in greater detail in our next study.\"\n\nWalter Lukiw, Professor of Neurology, Neuroscience and Ophthalmology and Bollinger Professor of Alzheimer's disease at Louisiana State University, who reviewed the study but was not involved in the research, said: \"This early study is interesting and important because it provides evidence for gastrointestinal (GI) tract microbiome components playing a role in neurological function, and indicates that probiotics can in principle improve human cognition. This is in line with some of our recent studies which indicate that the GI tract microbiome in Alzheimer's is significantly altered in composition when compared to age-matched controls, and that both the GI tract and blood-brain barriersbecome significantly more leaky with aging, thus allowing GI tract microbial exudates (e.g. amyloids, lipopolysaccharides, endotoxins and small non-coding RNAs) to access Central Nervous System compartments.\"\n\nThe study is published in the open-access journal Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience.", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The news release states that the research was supported by a grant from the Deputy of Research of Kashan University of Medical Sciences, and that the probiotic supplements were produced and provided by Tak Gen Zist Pharmaceutical Company in Tehran, Iran.

Normally used for contraception, the intrauterine system is sold under the brand name Mirena.\n\n\"If women suffer with heavy periods and do not want to get pregnant -- as the levonorgestrel intrauterine system is a contraceptive -- then having the levonorgestrel intrauterine system is a very good first-line treatment option that does not require taking regular, daily oral medications,\" said the study's lead author, Dr. Janesh Gupta, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Birmingham and Birmingham Women's Hospital in England.\n\nFor women who do want to get pregnant, Gupta said, taking the blood-clotting drug tranexamic acid during periods is an alternate method of treating heavy periods.\n\nResults of the study, which was funded by the United Kingdom's National Institute of Health Research, appear in the Jan. 10 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nHeavy menstrual bleeding is a significant problem for many women. About 20 percent of gynecologist office visits in the United States and the United Kingdom are because of heavy bleeding. There are several nonhormonal and hormonal treatment options available to reduce blood loss.\n\nThe current study compared the use of traditional medical options -- tranexamic acid pills, mefenamic acid (Ponstel), combined estrogen-progestogen and progesterone alone -- to the use of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system.\n\nThe researchers randomly assigned nearly 600 women with heavy menstrual bleeding to receive either the IUD or standard medical care. They assessed improvement using a patient-reported score on a scale designed to measure severity of symptoms. The scale goes from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating more severe symptoms. The researchers also asked about quality of life and sexual activity, and noted whether a woman needed surgery for heavy periods.\n\nWomen in the IUD group reported much greater improvement -- 32.7 points on the symptom scale versus 21.4 points in the standard treatment group. They also reported greater improvements in quality of life.\n\nThere was no difference in the rates of surgery or sexual activity between the two groups.\n\nMore women were still using the intrauterine system after two years than were still taking standard medical treatments -- 64 percent compared to 38 percent.\n\nGupta said the main reason she believes the IUD group was more successful at reducing symptoms is that there is \"100 percent compliance with treatment as there is a continuous drug treatment effect.\" Women taking medications may forget to take them sometimes.\n\nSerious side effects were similar between the groups. Gupta said the main side effect from the intrauterine system is irregular periods for up to six months.\n\nAnother expert said the findings show promise for women bothered by heavy bleeding.\n\n\"This study really adds to the evidence that shows how useful this intrauterine system is for heavy menstrual bleeding,\" said Dr. Eve Espey, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine in Albuquerque.\n\nGetting an intrauterine system generally just requires one office visit, Espey said. Insertion of the device may be mildly uncomfortable for some women, she said.\n\nFor women who may be hesitant to use an IUD because of pelvic infections linked to an early version called the Dalkon Shield, Gupta said that as long as women are screened for sexually transmitted diseases before getting an intrauterine system, the risk of infection is low.\n\nEspey agreed. \"Today's intrauterine systems have a great side-effect profile,\" she said. \"They also have a high continuation and a high satisfaction rate.\"\n\nLearn more about intrauterine devices from the Association of Reproductive Healthcare Professionals.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "There is another doctor who does not appear to be affiliated with the study quoted in the story.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Oct. 8, 2012 -- Men who eat lots of tomatoes and tomato-based products may have a lower risk for stroke, a new study suggests.\n\nTomatoes are rich in the antioxidant lycopene.\n\nMen who had the highest levels of lycopene in their blood were 55% less likely to have a stroke, compared with men who had the lowest levels of the antioxidant in their blood.\n\nThe lowered risk was even greater for strokes caused by blood clots in the brain, called ischemic strokes.

DYRK1A is implicated in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (via tau hyperphosphorylation) and amyloid plaques, both of which are features of Alzheimer disease.\n\nTea catechins may also modulate the damaging effects of amyloid-beta. Several animal studies have found that EGCG and related compounds from tea suppress amyloid-beta-induced cognitive dysfunction and neurotoxicity.

Data from nearly 9,500 people on five continents shows that amyloid can appear 20 to 30 years before symptoms of dementia, that the vast majority of Alzheimer\u2019s patients have amyloid and that the ApoE4 gene, known to increase Alzheimer\u2019s risk, greatly accelerates amyloid accumulation.\n\nThe findings also confirm that amyloid screening, by PET scan or cerebral spinal fluid test, can help identify people for clinical trials of drugs to prevent Alzheimer\u2019s.

She had tried everything. Nothing worked.\n\n\"I had problems with my feet and ankles, and they were saying I was borderline diabetic,\" Wade says. \"I'm like, well, I gotta do something, you know. So, I needed, really did need to lose the weight.\"\n\nSo Wade volunteered to help test Qnexa, an experimental drug pending before the Food and Drug Administration. She quickly noticed a big difference.\n\n\"I didn't feel ravenous, and I didn't want to snack all day long,\" she says.\n\nOver the next year, Qnexa helped Wade slowly drop about 40 pounds, and keep it off for another year. \"It makes you feel so much better,\" Wade says. \"Your back don't hurt, your feet don't hurt.\"\n\nBut the FDA rejected Qnexa in 2010 because of concerns about side effects, especially possible heart problems and birth defects.\n\nQnexa's rejection came amid a flurry of failed attempts by drug companies to win approvals of new weight-loss drugs. The setbacks put a spotlight on how the FDA handles these drugs.\n\nEven though obesity is at epidemic levels, the FDA hasn't approved any new weight-loss medicines since 1999.\n\n\"We have two-thirds of all Americans who are overweight or obese, and the costs are nearing $150 billion a year,\" says Christine Ferguson, a health policy professor at George Washington University. \"The sheer magnitude of the problem really requires us to address it more aggressively and thoughtfully than we have.\"\n\nFerguson has been helping to organize a series of meetings involving public health experts, anti-obesity advocates, government officials and others to try to figure out what the FDA should do.\n\n\"We actually have this huge gap,\" says Joe Nadglowski of the Obesity Action Coalition, who has been participating in the meetings. \"We go from Weight Watchers to bariatric surgery. And the fact that there isn't ... medical treatments for obesity, including pharmaceuticals, really is a challenge, considering how big the problem is in this country.\"\n\nPart of what's going on is that the FDA has gotten a lot more cautious about approving new drugs in general after some serious drug-safety problems, such as heart problems linked to the painkiller Vioxx.\n\nThe FDA has been especially tough on weight-loss drugs because of previous problems with those drugs, such as the diet drug cocktail fen-phen.\n\n\"There's been a long history with obesity drugs that we've had to take off the market. You recall the fen-phen episode where a significant number of people got heart-valve defects,\" says Janet Woodcock, a top FDA official.\n\nWoodcock argues that the agency has to be extra-careful with weight-loss drugs, because chances are it won't just be obese people taking them.\n\n\"When you're talking about a drug where it could go into literally tens of millions of Americans, there has to be attention to safety,\" Woodcock says.\n\nWhat might look like a rare problem now could turn into another public health disaster, she says.\n\nBut some say the agency's aversion to accepting any risks is outdated. They say the FDA wrongly still tends to view weight-loss drugs as diet pills \u2014 something frivolous and used primarily for cosmetic purposes.\n\n\"We are not talking about medications to help someone lose five pounds to fit into their prom dress or wedding dress. We're talking about medications to help those who are struggling with the health impact of obesity,\" Nadglowski says.\n\nSo Nadglowski and others are pushing the FDA to take into consideration whether the risks of new drugs may be outweighed by their benefits beyond weight loss, such as reducing the risk for heart disease, diabetes and other complications of obesity.\n\nWoodcock says officials realize they may have to think about things differently.\n\nAs the FDA works through this, many are watching how the agency handles Qnexa. An FDA advisory panel is scheduled to review Qnexa again on Feb. 22.\n\nBarbara Troupin of Vivus, the company that is developing Qnexa, says the drug appears to do a lot more than just help people lose weight.\n\n\"We see decreases in blood pressure. We see decreased rates of progression to diabetes. We see improvements in sleep apnea. We see improvements in quality of life. Pretty much all of our data shows significant benefits,\" she says.\n\nVivus hopes the FDA will agree that those benefits will outweigh some of the risks, including the concerns about birth defects. The company is submitting new data it says show that the risk is lower than had been feared. Vivus also has a plan to minimize the chances that pregnant women will take it.\n\nSome see Qnexa as a test of the FDA trying to recalibrate how it weighs risks and benefits for weight-loss drugs.\n\nFor her part, Wade just wants to be able to start taking it again. She's gained back half of the weight she lost.\n\n\"I need to lose 20 more pounds again,\" she says. \"And I need the help.\"", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Several independent sources were cited.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Taking vitamin D could help overweight and obese children lose weight, scientists believe.\n\nVitamin D is most commonly associated with the development and maintenance of strong bones as the body needs it to absorb calcium. But recently emerging research suggests vitamin D deficiency could also be a contributing factor of obesity.\n\nThe World Health Organization describes childhood obesity as one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21st century, with an estimated 41 million children under the age of 5 falling into this category. Obesity puts children at greater risk of developing preventable conditions like heart disease and diabetes at a younger age, and suffering poor health later in life.\n\nRelated: Household cleaning products might be making your children fat\n\nIn what is believed to be the first study to investigate the links between vitamin D supplementation and the weight and health of obese children and adolescents, researchers from University of Athens Medical School and Aghia Sophia Children's Hospital, Athens, recruited 232 particpants.\n\nThe team measured participants' vitamin D levels, body fat percentage, as well as their markers of liver and heart function at the start of the study, and again 12 months later.\n\nThe researchers randomly assigned 117 children with supplements containing 50,000 IU vitamin D for six weeks, while the others acted as the control group.\n\nChildren who took vitamin D had a significantly lower BMI, the researchers found. They also had lower body fat, as well as healthier cholesterol levels.\n\nDr. Evangelia Charmandari, associate professor pediatric and adolescent endocrinology at at the Medical School of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and lead author of the study, said: \"These findings suggest that simple vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of overweight and obese children developing serious heart and metabolic complications in later life.\u201d\n\nThe findings are set to be presented at the 57th Annual European Society for Pediatric Endocrinology Meeting, and have therefore not yet been reviewed.\n\nIn their next investigation, the team will study whether vitamin D supplements can improve the health of obese children and adolescents who have been diagnosed with disorders linked to obesity, such as high cholesterol, high blood sugar levels, and high blood pressure.\n\n\"Although these initial findings indicate that vitamin D could be used in the treatment of obesity, there remains a lack of evidence on the safety and long-term effects of supplementation, particularly if there is no vitamin D deficiency,\u201d said Charmandari. \"However, if your child is overweight or obese I recommend that you consult your primary care physician for advice, and consider having their vitamin D levels tested.\"\n\nProfessor Mary Fewtrell, assistant officer for health promotion at the U.K.-based Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, told Newsweek: \"Although the effect sizes are not given, these outcomes are certainly positive.

Some European hospitals already rely on the method, called cell-free fetal DNA, although it\u2019s not available from doctors in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWhat they are finding in England is that many women are not going on to have the invasive tests,\u201d Bianchi told Reuters Health.\n\nIn those procedures, doctors either extract a small amount of the fluid that surrounds the fetus (amniocentesis) or they take a sample of the placenta (chorionic villus sampling). Between one in 100 and one in 600 mothers miscarry as a result, according to Bianchi.\n\nIn a fresh look at the medical evidence for the blood test, she and her colleagues analyzed 57 earlier studies that included more than 6,500 pregnancies.\n\nThey found parents could trust the test 98.8 percent of the time when it said they\u2019d have a boy, and 94.8 percent of the time when it indicated a girl.\n\nThat leaves some room for error, which could be important if parents are making medical decisions based on the results \u2014 such as whether or not to get an invasive procedure to look for genetic disorders.\n\nHowever, the current non-invasive alternative \u2014 an ultrasound done at the end of the first trimester \u2014 isn\u2019t always good at spotting a baby\u2019s sex, Bianchi\u2019s team reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nAnd the blood test is reliable as early as seven weeks into the pregnancy, whereas ultrasound is not.\n\nBianchi said one study had estimated the blood test costs about 255 pounds in the UK (about $413), all included.

It\u2019s an emotional decision that women often make quickly, considering that surgeries often take place within days of their cancer diagnosis.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about the women who are on the fence and make a very quick decision before really considering the other options or the fact that it is an irreversible procedure,\u201d said Dr. Todd Tuttle, the U\u2019s chief of surgical oncology and lead author of the study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\nWhen diagnosed with cancer in her right breast last year, Debra Elmore-Nesheim talked with her new husband and other relatives about the appropriate treatment. But the 43-year-old\u2019s instinct was to have both breasts removed.\n\n\u201cPart of it is emotional,\u201d said Elmore-Nesheim, a pediatric nurse who lives in St. Paul. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t do as much as possible to eliminate the cancer, I would feel like I was almost waiting for the other shoe to drop.\u201d\n\nWomen removing a single cancerous breast have a 1 percent chance per year of suffering cancer in the other breast. That makes removing both breasts a better option for younger women with longer life spans. Many oncologists also recommend it for women with genetic predispositions for breast cancer.\n\nFor other women, a double mastectomy might eliminate another breast cancer, but it won\u2019t stop cancer from resurfacing in vital organs, Tuttle said. He hopes women aren\u2019t making the choice believing it will result in longer life, because the evidence is sketchy at best.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then we have a problem on our hands, because we\u2019re not providing adequate information to our patients,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s happening because of fear or the common reason I hear \u2013 \u2018I just want to be done with it\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s a different situation.\u201d\n\nTuttle\u2019s study found 60 percent of women with breast cancer chose lumpectomies, which remove only the tumors, not the whole breasts. Research has found this procedure is equally effective, particularly with smaller tumors and often when used in combination with radiation.\n\nOf the women in Tuttle\u2019s study who received mastectomies in 2003, 11 percent chose to have both breasts removed. That is an increase from 4.2 percent in 1998.\n\nThe rising use of magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, is likely contributing to the increase in double mastectomies, said Dr. Joseph Leach, a medical oncologist with Park Nicollet Health Services. Such scans are becoming standard for women who appear to have cancer in one breast, and half the time they raise suspicions about the other breast.\n\nWhile these suspicions rarely end up as cancer, they do often result in follow-up tests such as biopsies and ultrasounds that can frighten patients, Leach said.\n\n\u201cOur own impression is that women in some ways are getting sort of scared into having prophylactic mastectomies because of having these uncertain tests,\u201d Leach said.\n\nBoth Leach and Tuttle are pursuing research studies to address the why question.\n\nWomen choosing to have both breasts removed face higher surgery costs and slightly higher risks of post-surgery complications and infections.\n\nMost women are satisfied after double mastectomies, but a Mayo Clinic survey showed that as many as 10 percent are unsatisfied because of their appearance or medical complications. The survey results came a decade ago, however, when the safety of breast implants was a major issue, said Mayo\u2019s Dr. Lynn Hartmann.\n\nThe safety concerns have been reduced and cosmetic procedures have improved, but some women still probably regret the decision, she said.\n\nHartmann said doctors could take pressure off women by performing lumpectomies first to eliminate their cancer tumors. Then the women can have genetic tests and assess their risks for follow-up cancers before deciding whether to have one or both breasts removed.\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019ve just put some time on the table for them rather than trying to have them make this major decision \u2026 in a brief period of time,\u201d she said.\n\nElmore-Nesheim, the nurse with breast cancer, said cosmetic concerns played a role. She wondered with age what she would look like with an implant on one side and a healthy breast on the other. But mostly, she was scared for her life. Even if removing both breasts only offered a small chance at a longer life, it seemed worthwhile to her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a survival thing,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re fighting for your life.

Not only did this show that the procedure was safe, it also showed that the cells can help reduce scarring and even cause new heart muscle to grow.\n\nWhen a person suffers a heart attack, he or she is often left with huge areas of scarring in the heart. Scarred heart muscle doesn't pump blood as well as it used to, putting stress on other parts of the heart to make up for the deficit. The damaged area also doesn't conduct electric current as well, leading to an abnormal heart rhythm, which can cause more problems. Heart attack patients often go on to develop heart failure.\n\n \n\n \"This is the first instance of therapeutic regeneration,\" says Dr. Eduardo Marb\u00e1n, director of the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute.\n\nHe says while nature abounds with examples of spontaneous regeneration of limbs or tissues - like a salamander's new tail or a human liver regrowing to full size if partially damaged - doctors have not been able to help patients regrow heart tissue. This could change in the future if larger clinical trials and longer patient outcomes confirm the results of this early research published Monday in the journal The Lancet.\n\nMarb\u00e1n and his colleagues first presented this research at an American Heart Association conference in November.\n\nTo qualify for this clinical trial, patients had to have suffered a recent heart attack and \"had to have a significant amount of damage to begin with and weren't squeezing [blood into the body] as well as they should have,\" says Dr. Peter Johnston, one of the study authors who injected the new heart cells into patients treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital.\n\nA total of 25 patients participated in the clinical trial, which was designed to determine if it was safe to have cells grown from one's own heart tissue injected back into the heart. Seventeen patients received the stem cell transplants, while the other eight patients were given conventional post-heart attack therapy.\n\nIn an outpatient procedure under local anesthesia, doctors funneled a catheter into the patient's heart and removed peppercorn-sized bits of tissue from the part of the patient's heart that was unaffected by the heart attack. Using a procedure invented by Marb\u00e1n, heart stem cells were isolated from the tissue and then millions of new cells were grown in a petri dish.\n\nAbout four to six weeks after having suffered the heart attack, the patients had either 12 million or 25 million heart-derived cells injected back into the their hearts.\n\nMarb\u00e1n says when the first patient data came in, he and his colleagues were relieved to see the procedure was safe. After 12 months, researchers report only one patient appeared to have a serious side effect that may have been connected to the experimental cells.\n\nSix months after the first patient was injected with his cells grown from his own heart tissue, Marb\u00e1n says there was dramatic shrinking of scar tissue and new tissue had grown. \"That was unprecedented\" he says. \"No one had demonstrated that before.\"\n\nAll patients were followed for six months and researchers have 12-month data for 21 patients. In patients who received the cell transplant, Marb\u00e1n says about half of their scar tissue dissolved and the reduction in scar size appears to get bigger after the first six months. He says that why this is happening is still unclear.\n\nMarb\u00e1n says the amount of new heart tissue that grew was not subtle. [On average] \"22 grams (about .78 ounces) of new heart tissue grew,\" which he says is quite remarkable considering this had never been done before and the average weight of the part of the heart that is responsible for pumping the blood through the body is about 150 grams (about 5.3 ounces).\n\nPatients in the control group, those who didn't get a cell transplant, did not regenerate any tissue and the amount of scar tissue they had remained the same.\n\nSonia Skarlatos, Ph.D and deputy director of the Division of Cardiovascular Sciences at the NIH\u2019s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute says this early research is very exciting and a move in the right direction. She cautions that this procedure has to be tested on many more patients and they have to be observed for longer periods than in the current study, but she says these results are all very positive. She is hopeful further studies will confirm these early results.\n\n\"By preventing the consequences of a heart attack you may be able to prevent further down the heart failure that happens in [many of these] patients.\" Skarlatos says.\n\nShe was not involved in the research but the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute did help fund it.\n\nSkarlatos also says it's still not clear exactly what is making the heart regenerate and scar tissue disappear. Is it the cells themselves or proteins and other factors produced by these newly introduced cells that help fix the heart? Further research will hopefully also help answer those questions, she says. The study authors say based on these results, further research is warranted.\n\nMarb\u00e1n, who began his research at Johns Hopkins, says \"we did see a glimmer [of regeneration] in animal testing,\" but the results in humans were much better. \"That doesn't usually happen this way in research.\"", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story could have sought a little wider circle of independent experts.

But most of the success so far has been with blood cancers like lymphomas and leukemias. Immunotherapy, as it\u2019s called, has yet to prove itself with solid tumors like breast, prostate, lung, colon and brain cancers.\n\nBut in a report published in the , researchers led by Dr. Behnam Badie from the City of Hope Beckman Research Institute and Medical Center say that the same immune-based therapy that is successful against blood cancers also helped a patient with advanced brain cancer.\n\nThe 50-year-old man with glioblastoma, a particularly aggressive type of brain tumor, had already been treated with surgery, radiation and anti-tumor drug therapies. Despite these treatments, his cancer had returned and also spread to other parts of his brain and spinal cord. Badie and his team extracted immune cells from him, then engineered them to express proteins on their surface that would recognize and destroy glioblastoma tumor cells. After surgery to remove the bulk of the brain tumor, Badie and his colleagues directly injected the site with the modified immune cells (called chimeric antigen receptor T cells, or CAR T cells) six times, and the remaining part of this tumor stopped growing.\n\nOther smaller growths in the brain continued to grow, however, so the patient received 10 more doses of the CAR T cells injected into the cavities in the brain, called the ventricles. This is the first time that immune cells have been injected into these brain regions, because introducing anything into the ventricles can cause dangerous and possibly deadly inflammation. The man did not develop such serious complications, however, and after about four months, these tumors too started to shrink. By six months, almost all had disappeared.\n\nIf the patient had not received the CAR T therapy, he likely would only have survived a few weeks after his cancer recurred, says Badie. But after being treated with the immune therapy, his cancer did not grow or recur for nearly eight months. \u201cIf we can do the same for other patients, that would be an amazing accomplishment that many decades of work and research on glioblastoma have never done,\u201d says Badie, whose own father passed away a decade ago from glioblastoma.\n\nThe patient is one of nine in the trial, and so far, many of the other people are having similar experiences on the therapy. Based on this man\u2019s case, his team is hoping to now inject not just the tumor site but also the ventricular space in the brain, since that may help control spread of the cancer.\n\nIt\u2019s also becoming clear that more than one type of modified immune cells may have to be enlisted. The tumors in the first patient remained under control for almost eight months, but the cancer returned after that in new parts of the brain. Badie says it\u2019s not obvious why, but his analysis showed that these tumors did not contain much of the protein targeted by the CAR T cells that were injected. It\u2019s possible that the immune cells had destroyed most of the cancer cells expressing the original protein, so other cancer cells with other proteins began to proliferate and survive.\n\nBadie is hoping to take advantage of this information and introduce immune cells with different tumor-targeting proteins. Eventually, these proteins would also be tailored to be specific to each patient\u2019s cancer \u2014 a precision medicine approach to controlling cancer.

The bottom line is that this shows for the first time that cardiac fibrosis is preventable.\"\n\n\"It offers hope to those who are living with heart failure,\" adds Luis Agellon, co-principal investigator and a professor at McGill University's School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition. \"Prevention of fibrosis will extend the ability of the heart to function, even if at a reduced capacity. Currently patients with heart failure have poor quality of life and a dismal prognosis. Improving their quality of life will do wonders for these individuals.\"\n\nFibrosis is an early step on the path to heart failure. According to the Heart and Stroke Foundation there are currently 1.3 million Canadians living with heart disease or heart failure--a condition that severely limits physical activity because the heart cannot pump enough oxygenated blood that the body needs. About 30 per cent of patients diagnosed with heart failure will die within the first year.\n\nCardiac fibrosis itself is caused by a variety of factors including high blood pressure, overwork of cardiac muscle and long-term consumption of a diet that is high in both saturated fat and sugar--all cause increased stress to heart cells. Individuals with diabetes, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and heart transplant recipients are also known to be at high risk.\n\n\"It's almost like building a scar,\" says Michalak. \"It's exactly the same type of biological activity but it's happening in the heart tissue. It destroys the ability of the heart to function normally.\"\n\nThe team is now pushing forward with additional studies to see if the same therapeutic effect can be achieved in humans. They also aim to gain a better understanding of exactly how bile acids can prevent cardiac fibrosis from occurring.\n\n\"We don't yet have a full understanding--nobody does--of how the bile acid actually does what it does in heart cells,\" explains Michalak. \"So, another phase of the work is to find out what actually happens within heart cells at the molecular level. How can this bile acid affect the heart in such a dramatic way?\"\n\nOnce that occurs, the team hopes to work with cardiologists to quickly move the research into clinical trials, involving chemotherapy and heart transplant patients.\n\n\"If cardiac fibrosis can be stopped, then that could substantially improve the outcome for people at risk,\" says Agellon. \"This would be a significant advance in the fight against heart disease.\"\n\nThis research was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.\n\n\"Inhibition of the Unfolded Protein Response Mechanism Prevents Cardiac Fibrosis,\" PLOS ONE, published online July 21, 2016.", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The release clearly notes the funding source, the Canadian Institute for Health Research.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "\"It would certainly be premature to suggest taking statins to prevent rheumatoid arthritis ,\" he tells WebMD. \"But one important message is that people who have been prescribed them should adhere to treatment.

Such fasting already shows benefits after only six weeks. This is according to a study by Kyoung-Han Kim and Yun Hye Kim in the journal Cell Research which is published by Springer Nature. Intermittent fasting in mice helped to kick-start the animals' metabolism and to burn fat by generating body heat. The research team was led by Hoon-Ki Sung of The Hospital for Sick Children in Ontario, Canada.\n\nResearch has shown that our unhealthy eating habits and sedentary lifestyles are playing a major role in the development of lifestyle-related metabolic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and obesity. For this reason, dietary interventions like intermittent fasting are gaining popularity to treat conditions such as obesity.\n\nThe research team in this study wanted to better understand the reactions that interventions such as fasting trigger on a molecular level in the body. They exposed groups of mice to sixteen weeks of intermittent fasting. The recurring regimen saw the animals being fed for two days, followed by one day without anything to eat. Their calorie intake was not adjusted otherwise. Four months later the mice in the fasting group weighed less than those in the control group who continued to eat the same volume of food. The lower body weight of the mice in the fasting group was not the only effect. The fasting regime helped lower fat build-up in the white fat by increasing the brown-like fat (involved in burning energy and producing body heat) of mice on the high fat diet. Their glucose and insulin systems also remained more stable. In a further experiment, similar benefits were already seen after only six weeks of intermittent fasting.\n\nThrough an analysis into the underlying biology involved, the researchers found that such intermittent fasting tempers an immune reaction in fat cells. There are changes in certain gene pathways involved in the immune system and the body's reaction to inflammation. A type of white blood cell known to play a role in fighting inflammation is triggered. Known as anti-inflammatory macrophages, these cells stimulate the fat cells to burn stored fats or lipids by generating heat. This happens during periods of intermittent fasting because there is an increase in vascular growth factor (VEGF) that help form blood vessels and activate anti-inflammatory macrophage.\n\n\"Intermittent fasting without a reduction in calorie intake can be a preventative and therapeutic approach against obesity and metabolic disorders,\" says Kyoung-Han Kim.\n\n\"Strikingly, these fasting-stimulated changes in the growth of vascular cells and subsequent immune alterations occur even after a single cycle of 24-hour fasting, and are completely reversed when mice start eating again,\" adds Yun Hye Kim.\n\nReference: Kim, K-H. et al (2017).

A new study finds that kids in the U.S. preschool program tend to have a healthier weight by kindergarten than similarly aged kids not in the program.\n\nIn their first year in Head Start, obese and overweight kids lost weight faster than two comparison groups of children who weren't in the program, researchers found. Similarly, underweight kids bulked up faster.\n\n\"Participating in Head Start may be an effective and broad-reaching strategy for preventing and treating obesity in United States preschoolers,\" said lead researcher Dr. Julie Lumeng, an associate professor at the University of Michigan Center for Human Growth and Development.\n\nFederally funded Head Start, which is free for 3- to 5-year-olds living in poverty, helps children prepare for kindergarten. The program is designed to build stable family relationships, improve children's physical and emotional well-being and develop strong learning skills.\n\nHealth benefits, including weight loss, seem to be a byproduct of the program, said Dr. David Katz, director of the Yale University Prevention Research Center.\n\n\"This paper importantly suggests that some of the best strategies for controlling weight and promoting health may have little directly to do with either,\" said Katz, who wasn't involved in the study.\n\nHead Start might provide a structured, supervised routine that's lacking in the home, Katz suggested. \"Perhaps the program fosters better mental health in the children, which in turn leads to better eating,\" he said.\n\n\"Whatever the exact mechanisms, by fostering well-being in one way, we tend to foster it in others, even unintended,\" Katz said. \"The essence of this study is the holistic nature of social, psychological and physical health.\"\n\nAlmost one-quarter of preschool-aged children in the United States are overweight or obese, and obesity rates within Head Start populations are higher than national estimates, the study authors noted. Because obesity in childhood tends to continue into adulthood, experts worry that these children are at risk of future health problems.\n\nFor the study, Lumeng's team collected data on more than 43,700 Michigan preschool-age children between 2005 and 2013. More than 19,000 were in Head Start. Information on the others -- 5,400 of whom were on Medicaid, the publicly financed insurance program for the poor -- came from two primary health care groups.

Patients with untreatable angina who received the injections of CD34+ stem cells in key areas of the heart had significantly fewer chest pain episodes and significantly better performance on exercise tests than patients who got placebo injections.\n\nDrugs, angioplasty, and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery are the main treatments for angina -- chest pain caused by blocked coronary arteries.

The discovery could greatly expand the window for diagnosing concussions, especially in patients who experience a delayed onset of symptoms.\n\n\"Symptoms of a concussion, or a mild to moderate traumatic brain injury, can be subtle and are often delayed, in many cases by several days,\" said Linda Papa, MD, MSC, an emergency medicine physician and NIH funded researcher at Orlando Health and lead author of the study. \"This could provide doctors with an important tool for simply and accurately diagnosing those patients, particularly children, and making sure they are treated properly.\"\n\nIt's estimated nearly a quarter of a million children are treated in hospitals each year for concussions from playing sports, an average of nearly 700 a day. Almost all concussions in children are diagnosed only by symptoms, which are either observed, like vomiting or loss of balance, or symptoms reported by the child, like blurred vision or headaches. Neither scenario gives doctors and objective way to determine the severity of the injury.\n\n\"If patients are not diagnosed properly and treated appropriately, it could lead to long-term problems,\" said Papa. Untreated, or under-treated traumatic brain injuries like concussions, can lead to prolonged bouts with headaches, dizziness, memory loss and depression.\n\n\"This test could take the guesswork out of making a diagnosis by allowing doctors to simply look for a specific biomarker in the blood.\"\n\nThe biomarker Papa analyzed is known as a glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). These proteins are found in glial cells, which surround neurons in the brain, and when an injury occurs, the GFAP are released. What makes them unique is that they pass the blood-brain barrier and enter the bloodstream, making them easy to detect with this particular test.\n\n\"Not only were they present in the bloodstream, we were able to detect measurable levels of GFAP up to a week after the injury,\" said Papa.\n\nResearchers analyzed nearly 600 patients for 3 years. When cross-checked with scans, the blood test was able to detect mild to moderate traumatic brain lesions with up to 97 percent accuracy in patients 18 years and older. The blood test also indicated which patients were in need of life-saving neurosurgery. This suggests that the blood test could be used by clinicians for up to a week after injury to detect brain injury. This is important because many patients with concussion may not seek medical attention for days after injury.\n\nThe blood test could also dramatically cut down on the need for computerized tomography (CT) scans. Currently, CT scans are the most precise way to diagnose brain lesions, but are expensive and are associated with radiation exposure. \"Physicians really want to minimize the amount of CTs in patients, especially children, who are a lot more sensitive to radiation and the side effects that can come with it. Fortunately, this simple blood test appears to give us nearly the same information as a CT scan.\"\n\nIn fact, in a previous study published last fall, Papa and her team at Orlando Health tested both. They analyzed 152 children within 6 hours of sustaining a concussion, or mild to moderate traumatic brain injury. The results showed that the blood test was able to detect brain injuries with 94 percent accuracy, nearly as effective as state-of-the art CT scans.\n\n\"This could ultimately change the way we diagnose concussions, not only in children, but in anyone who sustains a head injury,\" said Papa. \"We have so many diagnostic blood tests for different parts of the body, like the heart, liver and kidneys, but there's never been a reliable blood test to identify trauma in the brain.

It's necessary for strong bones, and Rosen is a leading bone specialist. So he was surprised recently when his wife's new physician thought she might be deficient in vitamin D.\n\n\"She's a runner. She's in great shape,\" Rosen says. \"She drinks dairy. She gets a lot of sun exposure.\" Sun exposure is key for vitamin D, known as the sunshine vitamin. When skin is exposed to sun, it makes vitamin D.\n\nStill, the doctor wanted to run a blood test to see if Rebecca Rosen had adequate vitamin D.\n\n\"So my wife said, 'Well, why do I need to have a vitamin D [test]?' And the physician said, 'Well, that's part of our measurement for wellness.' \"\n\nIt's not just Rebecca's doctor, and it's not just in Portland, Maine.

A decade ago, Medicare payments were only about $1 million. The figures for 2009 and this year are bound to be higher.\n\n\"There's overwhelming evidence ... that increasing your vitamin D intake can make substantial improvement in your overall health and welfare,\" says Dr. Michael Holick of Boston University. \"And there is no downside to increasing your vitamin D intake. As a result I think that most people are now getting on the bandwagon.\"\n\nHolick is leading the band. Forty years ago, he discovered the active form of the vitamin, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. He has written several popular books on the subject and has another one, The Vitamin D Solution, coming out next month. Its cover calls vitamin D deficiency \"our most common health problem.\"\n\n\"In my opinion, everybody should be taking either a vitamin D supplement, take a prescription that the doctor recommends,\" Holick says. \"All adults should be taking at least 1,000 to 1,500 international units a day.\" Dietary intake, mainly through sources such as vitamin D-fortified dairy products and juice, may add up to 200 to 400 units a day.\n\nHolick is convinced that if people boost their vitamin D levels, they'll be substantially less likely to develop not only osteoporosis but also many types of cancer, heart attack, diabetes (both types), autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's, autism, even tuberculosis and the flu.\n\nNot so fast, other experts say.\n\nDr. JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital, points out that nearly all of the proliferating studies involving vitamin D are what scientists call \"observational.\" That is, they compare people with high and low levels of vitamin D and correlate those levels with whether or not the person has a disease.\n\nBut these studies, she points out, are fraught with possible error. People with higher vitamin D levels may be healthier because they exercise more, have better diets, are out in the sun more. Those who are sick may have low levels because they don't have those healthy habits.\n\n\"We don't yet have the large-scale, randomized clinical trials showing benefits in terms of prevention of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, cognitive decline, depression, autoimmune disease,\" Manson says.\n\nManson and her colleagues are launching such a trial. The National Institutes of Health is devoting $22 million for a five-year study. Twenty-thousand people across the country will be randomly assigned to take daily doses of vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acid \u2014 also linked in many studies to lower levels of heart disease \u2014 together or alone. Others will be assigned to take inert placebo pills. Neither study subjects nor investigators will know until the end which regimen they are on.\n\n'Promising But Not Yet Proven'\n\nManson says she thinks there is promising evidence that vitamin D supplements may protect against heart disease and perhaps some cancers. The evidence is strongest for colorectal cancer, she says. The fact that the government is funding the study is an indicator that the idea has traction.\n\nUntil those results are in, Manson advises patients and doctors to view vitamin D claims as \"promising but not yet proven.\"\n\n\"We need to keep in mind the lessons of history,\" she says. \"It was believed that megadoses of vitamin E, beta-carotene, selenium, folic acid and the B vitamins would confer a large array of health benefits. And in fact, the trials were very disappointing for all those nutrients.\"\n\nIn the case of beta-carotene, scientists were surprised to find that when the results of randomized trials were in, those taking the supplement actually had a higher risk of lung cancer.\n\nHolick and others say there is little or no downside to ingesting even high levels of vitamin D.\n\n\"I've been treating patients with 50,000 units of vitamin D once a week for eight weeks followed by 50,00 every other week for over a decade, and I've not seen any untoward toxicity,\" Holick says.\n\nHe says he has seen dramatic results in patients he has treated with vitamin D supplements for disorders such as fibromyalgia, involving generalized muscular aches and pains, and multiple sclerosis. He is convinced that the vitamin D supplements lower patients' risk of cancer and heart disease, although he acknowledges that's harder to show.\n\nHow Much Is Enough?\n\nHolick himself takes 3,000 international units of vitamin D every day.\n\nSet by the National Institute of Medicine in 1997, the current recommended intake is 400 units a day for adults ages 50 to 70, and 200 units a day for younger adults. The American Academy of Pediatrics currently recommends 400 units a day for infants.\n\nThe recommendations may change soon. An Institute of Medicine panel is working on a vitamin D update, which may come out this summer. The panel may raise the Dietary Reference Intake, which has replaced the old Recommended Dietary Allowance. But the group is not expected to embrace the newer claims being made for vitamin D supplementation.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine panel has a difficult task. \"We don't know exactly where to draw the line in terms of calling someone deficient in vitamin D,\" says Manson, who is a member of the committee, as is Rosen, the Maine bone specialist.\n\nMeanwhile, an increasing number of patients are getting their vitamin D levels tested, and more are being told they need to take supplements.\n\n\"I've been surprised at the number of patients who are significantly vitamin D deficient,\" says Dr. Elizabeth Ross, a cardiologist in Washington, D.C., who has been testing patients routinely for the past year. \"Whether or not we'll affect the incidence of cardiovascular disease or other diseases remains to be seen.

He suddenly awoke with terrible abdominal pain. If fast-moving EMTs and a savvy surgeon at his community hospital had not realized that something terrible had happened, Ken would not have survived the night. Emergency surgery revealed a grapefruit-sized tumor attached to his small intestine. Some of the tumor cells had grown into his bowel, leaving a hole through which the contents of Ken's gut had poured into his abdomen, causing terrible inflammation and shock. Worse, the tumor cells scattered all over his belly. He was diagnosed with gastrointestinal stromal tumor, or GIST, and was doomed to have multiple cancers grow in his abdomen -- tumors that could not be removed by surgery and would be resistant to radiation or standard chemotherapy. Ken's subsequent willingness to participate in clinical trials and take experimental \"smart\" medications gave him almost three years of high-quality life after the diagnosis was made. It also made him part of the first wave of a radically new era in cancer therapy -- using drugs that are \"smart\" in that they precisely block the abnormal genetic pathways or mutations that cause and maintain cancer. These new compounds destroy cancer cells yet cause minimal damage to normal cells. Like most novel treatments, smart drugs developed from an amalgam of basic and clinical research that stretched over many decades before patients were successfully treated. The experiments that ultimately produced the first such drug, Gleevec, led to three Nobel prizes and ranged from research on nerve cells in the gut to studies of viruses that cause cancer in chickens and on to the cause of a fatal and relatively rare form of leukemia known as CML. Immediately after his surgery, Ken's wife, Peggy, went on the Internet and learned that Dr. George Demetri, an oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, where I was then president, was just a few months away from starting a clinical trial with Gleevec, the first smart drug treatment for GIST. Demetri and his colleagues had recently found that, like CML, GIST is caused by a unique tiny mutation in a single gene in one of the billions of cells that form the gastrointestinal tract. The mutated gene, named kit, alters a protein that figuratively shouts without end at GIST cells to divide constantly -- in other words, to be cancerous. Furthermore, though the altered kit protein becomes like drink to a confirmed alcoholic and GIST cancer cells cannot live without it, Demetri and his associates had found that Gleevec blocks the function of the altered protein and kills the GIST cancer cells. What's more, the drug did not appear to seriously damage any other system in the body. \"You're here at the perfect point in history,\" Demetri told Ken. \"You've got a cancer that we know a lot about genetically, and we're going to know a lot more about it as we go down the road together.\" When Ken first appeared in Demetri's clinic, he showed no signs of cancer. Demetri confirmed that with a PET (positron emission tomography) scan. The test is based on the well-known fact that living cancer cells are always hungry for sugar. When they eat sugar tagged with a radioactive isotope, the tumors \"light up\" with radioactivity in the PET scan and can be seen as living nodules. If the tumors are \"cold\" in the PET scan, they are dead. Several months after his emergency surgery, a follow-up CAT scan demonstrated several lumps in Ken's abdomen, and the PET scan showed that the lumps were avidly absorbing sugar. Clearly the thousands of GIST cells that had spread in Ken's abdomen had begun to grow into multiple tumors. Demetri started treating Ken with Gleevec, making Ken the second patient in the world to receive Gleevec for GIST. The first patient, a woman from Finland, had been treated by Demetri's team and a group of Finnish physicians, and her tumors had disappeared. Ken waited anxiously after he began to take Gleevec. A month later, Demetri ordered new scans. The CAT scan still showed tumors in the abdomen, but the PET scan was \"cold.\" The tumors were dead, and Ken felt entirely well. This was the first time in the United States that any solid tumor had ever been stopped in its tracks with no major side effects after a relatively short period of treatment. To Demetri's amazement and Peggy's and Ken's joy, the tumors shrank and remained invisible in Ken's abdomen for the next two years. Ken became a poster boy for advanced cancer clinical and basic research. He spoke widely about the importance of optimism and determination in dealing with cancer and for being on the cutting edge of cancer research. \"I don't believe in that old saw 'When life gives you lemons, make lemonade,' \" Ken told me. \"I believe when life gives you lemons, it's lemon season -- enjoy them.\" But Demetri knew that despite Ken's excellent response, there was a good chance he'd relapse because his cancer cells would mutate again and create a shouting kit protein that would be resistant to Gleevec. Though a substantial number of GIST patients have done very well on Gleevec for many years, resistance to the drug ultimately develops in most of them. Indeed, that is what happened. Two years almost to the day after Ken began Gleevec, a PET scan revealed living tumors avidly consuming sugar. Demetri gave him three different experimental Gleevec-like drugs but from that day on was unable to stop Ken's tumors. The resistance to Gleevec was not unexpected, because single agents eventually fail in the treatment of most highly aggressive cancers. Scientists are now exploring new and promising ways to inhibit kit protein. One drug, already in encouraging clinical trials, blocks a small protein that kit requires to traverse the GIST cell. Responses in GIST patients are dramatic. More Gleevec-like drugs and compounds that attack the growth-signaling pathways \"downstream\" from the sensitive proteins are also in the process of development. Used in combination, such drugs are likely to reduce the impact of Gleevec resistance. During his remission, Ken once told me that the main message he wanted other people to get from his story is the importance of pushing for the best treatment you can find, even if it's experimental. \"Demand that second opinion, get the experts, get the cutting-edge technology available to you,\" Ken said. \"My life will be worthwhile if I have helped someone else to do that.\"\n\nAll Globe stories since 2003 are now FREE", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The author of this article is a physician and former president of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute.

Meanwhile, the American Cancer Society continues to recommend that women get mammograms every year beginning at age 40.\n\nThe frequency of screening mammograms -- and the appropriate age to begin them -- has been debated since the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in 2009 recommended that women routinely get screening mammograms every other year starting at age 50.\n\nOct. 17, 2011 -- Getting screening mammograms every two years instead of annually reduces the chance of a false alarm, a new study shows.\n\nAfter 10 years of annual screening, more than half of women will be called back at least once for another mammogram.

Its main message, Hubbard says, is that call-backs (or recalls) for false-positive results are common, so women shouldn't panic when they occur.\n\n\"In most cases, a recall doesn't mean you have cancer,\" says Hubbard, a biostatistician at the Group Health Research Institute in Seattle. \"Hopefully, there will be less anxiety about getting a recall.\"\n\nWomen can halve their risk of a call-back for a false-positive if the interpreting radiologist has previous mammograms for comparison, the researchers found.\n\nIdeally, Hubbard says, primary care doctors should talk to women about what to expect from annual and biennial screening before they get their first mammogram.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "No independent experts were quoted.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "A long-awaited postmortem released this morning of Pfizer's (NYSE: PFE) failed heart drug held out hope for the discovery of a safe version of the revolutionary heart pill.\n\nThe study said there were still many unanswered questions about Pfizer's pill, torcetrapib, the first in a new class of heart medicines known as a CETP inhibitors, which raise HDL, or good cholesterol, and lower LDL, or bad cholesterol.\n\nPfizer suspended development of the tablet, its most important experimental drug, after it caused an increase in deaths and heart problems in clinical trial volunteers.

A new study, 'Fresh Pear Consumption is Associated with Better Nutrient Intake, Diet Quality, and Weight Parameters in Adults: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001-2010,' published in Nutrition and Food Science, revealed new information regarding the health benefits of pear consumption.1 Of particular interest given the high rates of obesity in the United States, the study found that adult pear consumers had a lower body weight than non-pear consumers and they were 35 percent less likely to be obese.\n\nThe epidemiologic study, led by Carol O'Neil of the Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, used a nationally representative analytic sample to examine the association of fresh pear consumption with nutrient intake, nutrient adequacy, diet quality, and cardiovascular risk factors in adults.\n\n\"The association between pears and lower body weight is very exciting,\" said Dr. Carol O'Neil. \"We believe fiber intake may have driven the lower body weights that were seen in this study because there was no difference in energy intake or level of physical activity found between the fresh pear consumers and non-consumers.\"\n\nIn addition to discovering a correlation between fresh pear consumers and lower body weight, the study found that pear consumption was associated with higher diet quality (as defined by the Healthy Eating Index). Moreover, the consumption of one medium fresh pear per day had a positive effect on nutrient intake since consumers had higher usual intakes of dietary fiber, vitamin C, magnesium, copper, and potassium, and higher mean intakes of total sugars; consumers of fresh pears also had lower intakes of total, monounsaturated fatty acids, saturated fatty acids, and added sugars.\n\nPears are an excellent source of fiber and a good source of vitamin C. One medium pear provides about 24 percent of daily fiber needs for only 100 calories. They are sodium-free, cholesterol-free, fat-free and contain 190 mg of potassium. The USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans state that people who eat more fruit as part of an overall healthy diet are likely to reduce their risk of some chronic diseases, although little is published on the health outcomes associated with individual fruits, including pears.\n\nThe USA Pear Bureau continues to collaborate with researchers to commission additional studies that show the relationship between pears and positive health outcomes. Visit http://www. for additional pear research, nutrition resources and recipes.\n\nThe Pear Bureau Northwest was established in 1931 as a nonprofit marketing organization to promote the fresh pears grown in Oregon and Washington. Today, the United States is the third largest pear-producing country in the world, and Oregon and Washington comprise the nation's largest pear growing region with 1,600 growers producing 84% of all fresh pears grown in the United States. Pears grown in these two Pacific Northwest states are distributed under the \"USA Pears\" brand. Pears are an excellent source of fiber (24% DV) and a good source of vitamin C (10% DV) for only 100 calories per medium sized pear.

All of the patients were on standard medications, and some had heart devices implanted.\n\nStem cells are primitive cells that mature into the various cells that make up the body's tissues. In the past 15 years or so, scientists have tried to use the cells to help repair some of the damage seen in heart failure.\n\nHeart failure is a progressive disease where the heart muscle is too damaged to efficiently pump blood throughout the body. It often arises after a heart attack.\n\nSymptoms of heart failure include fatigue, breathlessness and swelling in the limbs. The condition cannot be cured, although medications and implantable devices can treat the symptoms.\n\nIn the new study, the researchers used stem cells from the patients' own thigh muscle to create a patch they placed on the heart.\n\nThat's in contrast to many past studies, where researchers have injected stem cells -- often from patients' bone marrow -- into the heart.\n\nThe patch tactic could have some advantages, said senior researcher Dr. Yoshiki Sawa, of Osaka University.\n\nHe said animal research suggests that cells in sheet form survive for a longer period, compared to injections.\n\nTo test the safety of the approach, Sawa's team recruited 27 patients who had debilitating symptoms despite standard heart failure therapies. The scientists extracted stem cells from each patient's thigh muscle, then cultured the cells so that they formed a sheet.\n\nThe sheet was placed on each patient's heart.\n\nThe tactic appeared safe, the researchers said, and there were signs of symptom improvements over the next six months to a year.\n\nWhy would stem cells from the thigh muscle affect the heart? It's not clear, Sawa acknowledged.\n\nThe stem cells don't grow into new heart muscle cells. Instead, Sawa explained, they seem to produce chemicals called cytokines that can promote new blood vessel growth in damaged areas of the heart. The theory, he said, is that \"hibernating\" cells in the heart muscle can then function better.\n\nStill, it's too soon to know what the new findings mean, said Gorodeski.\n\nThis type of trial, called phase 1, is designed to look at the safety and feasibility of a therapy, Gorodeski said. It takes later-phase trials -- where some patients receive the treatment, and others do not -- to prove that a therapy actually works.\n\nThose trials are underway, Sawa said.\n\nOther studies are further along. Last year, researchers reported on a trial testing infusions of stem cells taken from the bone marrow of patients with severe heart failure.\n\nPatients who received the therapy were less likely to die or be hospitalized over the next year, versus those given standard treatment only. But the study was small, and the stem cells had only a minor impact on patients' heart function.\n\nSo it's not clear why the stem-cell patients fared better, Gorodeski said.\n\nFor now, he stressed, all stem-cell therapies for heart failure remain experimental.\n\n\"There's no cell therapy that we can offer patients right now,\" Gorodeski said.\n\nThe message for patients, he added, is that heart failure can be treated, and researchers are looking for \"innovative\" ways to improve that treatment.\n\nThe study was published April 5 in the Journal of the American Heart Association.\n\nThe American Heart Association has more on heart failure.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story uses an independent source to good effect, which we are always glad to see.

Their study, published in the June 30 issue of Breast Cancer Research, found that patients who have neoadjuvant radiation therapy have a significantly lower risk of developing a second primary tumor at any site.\n\nThe majority of patients who have early stage breast cancer have surgery to remove their tumor or a complete mastectomy. Surgery is commonly followed by radiation therapy, which has been shown to increase relapse-free survival. However, in some cases, patients may require neoadjuvant radiation therapy to decrease the size of the tumor before surgery. Currently, there are no studies that have analyzed the long-term effects of neoadjuvant radiation therapy on breast cancer patients.\n\nMoffitt researchers compared the overall survival and the time to diagnosis of a second tumor, if any, of 250,195 breast cancer patients who received either neoadjuvant or adjuvant radiation therapy. They analyzed patient outcomes from a National Cancer Institute (NCI) registry database of cancer incidence and survival rates in the United States. They included female patients in the analysis who were diagnosed between 1973 and 2011 with early-stage breast cancer. The analysis included 2,554 women who received localized neoadjuvant breast radiation therapy before surgery and 247,641 women who received localized adjuvant breast radiation therapy after surgery.\n\nThe researchers discovered that among the breast cancer patients who tested positive for the estrogen receptor (ER) biomarker, patients who had neoadjuvant radiation therapy had a significantly lower risk of developing a second primary tumor than patients who had adjuvant radiation therapy. This was true for patients who underwent both partial and complete mastectomies. The researchers found that delaying surgery due to neoadjuvant radiation therapy was not a detriment to survival.\n\nA number of recent studies have suggested that radiation therapy may re-educate and stimulate the immune system to target cancer cells. \"The observed benefit of neoadjuvant radiation therapy aligns with the growing body of literature of the immune activation effects of radiation, including shrinking of untreated metastases outside the radiation field,\" explained Heiko Enderling, Ph.D., associate member of Moffitt's Integrated Mathematical Oncology Department.\n\nThese data are promising, but randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the benefit of neoadjuvant radiation therapy. \"Historic data indicate that disease-free survival is significantly increased when radiation therapy is applied before surgery rather than after surgery, especially for ER-positive patients. These findings are worthy of a prospective clinical trial to confirm potential benefits of neoadjuvant vs. adjuvant radiation, and to identify the potential contribution of radiation-induced immunity to vaccinate against future disease,\" said Enderling.\n\nThe study was supported by funds received from the American Cancer Society and the DeBartolo Family Personalized Medicine Institute Pilot Research Awards in Personalized Medicine.\n\nMoffitt is dedicated to one lifesaving mission: to contribute to the prevention and cure of cancer.

Brown rice also has a lower glycemic index than white rice, which means it doesn\u2019t cause blood glucose levels to rise as rapidly.\n\nNow a new study from researchers at Harvard reports that Americans who eat two or more servings of brown rice a week reduce their risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by about 10 percent compared to people who eat it less than once a month. And those who eat white rice on a regular basis \u2014 five or more times a week \u2014 are almost 20 percent more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes than those who eat it less than once a month.\n\nJust replacing a third of a serving of white rice with brown each day could reduce one\u2019s risk of Type 2 diabetes by 16 percent, a statistical analysis showed. A serving is half a cup of cooked rice.\n\nThe study, which was published in The Archives of Internal Medicine and used data from two Harvard nurses\u2019 health studies and a separate study of health professionals, isn\u2019t the first to point a finger at foods like white rice as a culprit in Type 2 diabetes. A 2007 study of Chinese women in Shanghai found that middle-aged women who ate large amounts of white rice and other refined carbohydrates were also at increased risk for diabetes compared to their peers who ate less.\n\nBut the Harvard study is one of the first to distinguish between brown rice and white rice consumption in the United States, where rice is not a staple food and relatively little is eaten overall, said Dr. Qi Sun, an instructor in medicine at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, which is affiliated with Harvard Medical School. Many food studies simply lump brown and white rice together.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is we showed evidence that increased consumption of white rice \u2013 even at this low level of intake \u2014 is still associated with increased risk,\u201d said Dr. Sun, who was at the Harvard School of Public Health when the study was done. \u201cIt\u2019s really recommended to replace white rice with the same amount of brown rice or other whole grains.\u201d\n\nThe researchers who did the study analyzed rice consumption among 39,765 men and 57,463 women who participated in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and the Nurses\u2019 Health Study I and II; participants in the three groups ranged in age from 26 to 87.\n\nThey had filled out food frequency questionnaires when the studies started \u2014 in 1986, 1984 and 1991, respectively \u2014 and updated their diet information every four years subsequently, through 2005 and 2006. They were also asked about their medical histories. During the course of the studies, more than 10,000 participants developed Type 2 diabetes.\n\nSuch food studies can be unreliable, since they rely on self-reported surveys. And correlation does not necessarily mean a cause-and-effect relationship, since factors other than brown rice consumption may have accounted for the decreased diabetes risk that was observed. The researchers tried to control for the fact that Americans who eat brown rice tend to be more healthy overall \u2014 they eat more fruits and vegetables and less red meat and trans fats, and they also tend to be thinner, more active and less likely to smoke than those who don\u2019t eat brown rice.\n\nBut, Dr. Sun said, there were many possible explanations for why brown rice eaters are at lower risk for Type 2 diabetes. In addition to having a lower glycemic index than white rice, brown rice also contains important nutrients like magnesium that are stripped during the refining process; it also contains much more fiber. Earlier studies have found that having these nutrients in the diet protects against diabetes, Dr. Sun said.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misidentified the amount of cooked rice in a serving.

The research was an early-stage study, conducted to test the side effects and best dosage of a potential new combined therapy, and the findings were published today in the journal Cancer Discovery.\n\nPembrolizumab, which is marketed under the brand name Keytruda, works by blocking a protein called PD-1, which interferes with immune system function. Blocking PD-1 with pembrolizumab enables the immune system cells to better attack the cancer. While pembrolizumab has been a significant advancement for treating people with a variety of advanced or metastatic cancers, a majority of metastatic melanoma tumors are still resistant to the drug.\n\n\"We have found that the reason patients with metastatic melanoma do not initially respond to immunotherapy with an anti-PD-1 is that their immune system was not ready,\" said Dr. Antoni Ribas, the study's lead author, a professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and director of the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center Tumor Immunology Program. \"So we thought, 'What if we change that by injecting the therapy drug into the metastatic lesions and change the microenvironment of the cancer?'\n\n\"It's like having a pile of wood but not having a match to light it. With this new approach, SD-101 is the match that starts the fire.\"\n\nThe researchers found that SD-101 not only directs T cells to cancer cells, but it also makes the microenvironment more hospitable for the T cells, so that they can better kill the cancer cells.\n\nAll 22 people in the study had an advanced stage of inoperable or metastatic melanoma. Nine were receiving an immunotherapy treatment for the first time as part of the study. Seven of those nine had a positive response to the drug combination, including two for whom the tumors disappeared completely.\n\nThe other 13 people in the study had previously received a type of immunotherapy before the study. Of them, two had a partial response, meaning parts of the tumors shrank, but the tumors did not go away completely. Five more showed some reduction in the tumors, but the other participants did respond to the therapy.\n\nThe results of the study suggest that the combination of pembrolizumab and SD-101 could provide an alternative treatment for people with melanoma whose tumors have not responded or would be unlikely to respond to other therapies.\n\n\"For all patients with advanced cancer, immunotherapy using PD-1 inhibitors has really changed the face of cancer treatment. Unfortunately, this therapy still only works in a subset of patients,\" said Dr. Deborah Wong, assistant clinical professor of medicine at the Geffen School of Medicine and an oncologist at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, who was also an author of the paper.\n\n\"This particular combination has been especially gratifying because not only does the SD-101 therapy drug induce tumor shrinkage at the actual site where it's injected, but it's working in conjunction with pembrolizumab to shrink tumors outside of the ones we're directly injecting.\"\n\nThe study highlights the need for more research into combination therapies like this one, because many people with cancer do not respond to immunotherapy or experience a reoccurrence of their tumors after treatment.\n\n\"We are really starting to understand the science of how immunotherapies work in patients,\" said Ribas, who is also the director of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy Center at UCLA. \"By understanding that, we can find more ways to make that therapy more active. One way is by combining the therapy with another agent that can overcome the resistance that some cancers have to these therapies.\"\n\nThe study was funded by Dynavax Technologies Corp., which provided SD-101.

An approval for Crohn\u2019s would give the drug entry into an estimated $1.3 billion U.S. market and $2.7 billion market worldwide.\n\nThe intravenous biotech drug met the primary goal of the study as almost 40 percent of patients who received the 6 milligrams per kilogram of weight dose of Stelara achieved a clinical response \u2014 defined as a 100-point reduction in the Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) \u2014 after six weeks of treatment.\n\nThat compared with a response rate of 23.5 percent of patients who received a placebo.\n\nTwo lower doses of Stelara were also tested in the study of 526 patients with moderate to severe Crohn\u2019s disease who were not helped by, or could not tolerate, treatment with a widely used class of drugs known as TNF antagonists, such as Abbott Laboratories\u2019 Humira.\n\nThose who received 1 mg/kg had a 36.6 percent response rate and the 3 mg/kg dose led to a 34.1 percent response rate.\n\n\u201cTo see these kind of outcomes, where you have high response rates in the short term and then good remission rates out toward five or six months of therapy, it shows unequivocally that the drug is effective for treating Crohn\u2019s disease,\u201d said Dr. William Sandborn, the study\u2019s lead investigator, who presented the data at the Digestive Disease Week meeting in Chicago on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s effective in the patient population that has the greatest unmet need at this point in time,\u201d Sandborn said of patients who do not respond to anti-TNF drugs.\n\nHe said a 100-point drop in the CDAI was clinically meaningful to patients. \u201cThey\u2019ll feel measurably better.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe patient population was really quite ill and had very high disease activity, and despite that we saw nice response rates,\u201d Sandborn said.\n\nIn a second phase of the study, those who responded to Stelara after six weeks of treatment were given either a 90-mg injection of Stelara at week eight and week 16 or a placebo.\n\nAfter 22 weeks, 69.4 percent of the Stelara patients maintained a clinical response and 41.7 percent were deemed to be in clinical remission.

The study defined treatment-resistant as patients who had not responded to two or more currently available antidepressants of adequate dose and duration in the current episode of depression.\n\nData from a second study, in elderly patients aged 65 and older with treatment-resistant depression, which is the first study of its kind, showed treatment with flexibly dosed esketamine plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant demonstrated clinically meaningful effects compared to placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant. However, the study narrowly missed statistical significance for its primary efficacy endpoint.\n\nIf approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), esketamine would be one of the first new approaches to treat refractory major depressive disorder available to patients in the last 50 years.\n\n\"With about 30 percent of patients with major depression failing to respond to currently available antidepressants1, treatment-resistant depression represents a major public health need,\" said Husseini K. Manji, MD, Global Head, Neuroscience Therapeutic Area, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. \"The positive Phase 3 results for esketamine nasal spray in adults with treatment-resistant depression are exciting, particularly as they mark the first time an antidepressant has achieved superiority versus an active comparator in any clinical trial for major depressive disorder. What makes this even more significant is that the response was rapid and this milestone was achieved in patients deemed to be treatment-resistant. We are also pleased with the clinically meaningful outcomes for esketamine nasal spray in elderly patients, a population that often has greater disability and lower response rates.\"\n\n\"There's a critical need for new, rapidly acting and effective treatment options for people with major depressive disorder who do not respond to existing therapies,\" said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. \"Janssen is fully committed to exploring the newest science in the area of mood disorders and bringing these discoveries to patients in need.\"\n\nResults of the Study in Adults with Treatment-Resistant Depression \n\n In the Phase 3 study of adults with treatment-resistant depression, patients were randomized to flexibly dosed esketamine nasal spray (56 mg or 84 mg) added to a newly initiated oral antidepressant or placebo nasal spray added to a newly initiated oral antidepressant.\n\nPrimary Efficacy Endpoint\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint, change from baseline in the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score, demonstrated the statistically significant clinical improvement in patients' depressive symptoms for esketamine nasal spray plus an oral antidepressant at day 28 (Least Squares Mean Difference Standard Error from placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant: -4.0 [1.69], 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: -7.31, -0.64; one-sided p=0.010).\n\nSecondary and Other Efficacy Endpoints\n\nThe first key secondary endpoint (onset of clinical response by 24 hours post-dose that is maintained through day 28) numerically favored esketamine nasal spray plus an oral antidepressant vs. placebo nasal spray plus an oral antidepressant, but did not meet statistical significance (1-sided p=0.161). The other two key secondary endpoints (Sheehan Disability Scale [SDS], a subject-reported outcome measure widely used and accepted for assessment of functional impairment and associated disability, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9], a self-report scale assessing depressive symptoms) could not be formally evaluated since onset of clinical response was not statistically significant. Among other endpoints, response rate was notable with 69.3% responding in the esketamine group vs. 52% in the placebo group at 28 days (response \u2265 50% improvement in MADRS from baseline). Remission rate (MADRS total score \u226412) at day 28 was 52.5% and 31.0% for the esketamine and placebo groups, respectively.\n\nThe most common treatment-emergent adverse events (>10%) reported in the esketamine group were metallic taste, nausea, vertigo, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, dissociation, blurred vision, paraesthesia (tingling sensation) and anxiety. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (>10%) reported in the placebo group were metallic taste and headache.\n\nResults of the Study in Elderly Patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression \n\n Janssen conducted a separate Phase 3 study in elderly patients with treatment-resistant depression. Elderly populations with major depressive disorder are historically hard to treat and often have co-morbidities and long-standing depression. To improve tolerability, patients were given a lower starting dose (28 mg) of esketamine nasal spray (flexibly dosed at 28 mg, 56 mg or 84 mg) plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant or placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant.\n\nPrimary Efficacy Endpoint\n\nAlthough statistical significance for the primary endpoint for the overall patient population studied was narrowly missed, results favored the esketamine nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant group (median unbiased estimate of the difference from placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant: -3.6, 95% CI: -7.20, 0.07; one-sided p=0.029). To put this into context, an analysis of placebo-controlled data from three prior studies conducted by Duru and Fantino determined that a minimum change in MADRS of 1.9 was clinically meaningful.2 In addition, the average difference is between 2-3 points for currently approved antidepressants vs. placebo.3\n\nSafety results were consistent with previous studies of esketamine in younger adult populations. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (>10%) reported in the esketamine group were dizziness, nausea, headache, fatigue, increased blood pressure, vertigo and dissociation. There were no treatment-emergent adverse events reported in >10% of patients in the placebo group.\n\nEsketamine nasal spray has an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, based on the adverse event data from both Phase 3 studies. Adverse events and associated symptoms were seen predominately on the day of dosing and were generally transient and resolved on the day of dosing.\n\nThese findings represent two of the five Phase 3 studies that comprise Janssen's treatment-resistant depression program with esketamine nasal spray. The results from these studies will inform regulatory filings for esketamine nasal spray in treatment-resistant depression, for which Janssen has received Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the U.S. FDA. Data from other Phase 3 studies will be presented later in 2018.\n\nIn both Phase 3 studies, esketamine or placebo was provided in disposable nasal spray devices containing 200 \u03bcl of solution (i.e., two sprays), and administered under the supervision of a health care professional. A bittering agent was added to placebo to simulate the taste of esketamine, to help mask the treatment assignment.\n\nThe study in adults with treatment-resistant depression was a Phase 3, double-blind, active-control, flexibly dosed, multi-center study using blinded raters, conducted at 39 sites in Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, Spain and the United States from August 2015 to November 2017. The study enrolled adults with moderate-to-severe, non-psychotic, recurrent or persistent depression, and history of non-response to \u22652 antidepressants in the current episode of depression, with one of them assessed prospectively.

Patients \u2265 65 years of age were randomized 1:1 to either esketamine nasal spray plus a new oral antidepressant (N=72) or placebo nasal spray plus a new oral antidepressant (N=66). The primary endpoint was the change in the MADRS total score from day 1 (baseline) to day 28.

As an outpatient treatment, GAE does not require open surgery or physical therapy, and takes 45-90 minutes to perform.\n\nThis prospective, multicenter clinical trial evaluated 13 patients with severe osteoarthritis pain. Each patient's pain and disability were measured along two scales, with evaluations before and after the treatment. The treatment was successfully completed in all 13 patients, with no adverse events. One month later, researchers followed the progress of eight patients and found that GAE significantly decreased pain (-58 mm on the Visual Analog Scale), reduced stiffness and increased physical function (-36.3 on the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index). Together the scales represent an 80 percent improvement in function compared with pre-procedure conditions.\n\n\"This procedure could have a significant impact in the treatment of osteoarthritis pain as a whole,\" said Bagla. \"The current mainstay of treatment in patients who have arthritis are pain medications, which come with significant side effects and risks. But GAE provides another option for patients struggling with pain and may even allow patients to avoid the painful recovery of knee surgery and the need for the kind of opioid pain medications associated with the dangerous epidemic in the United States.\"\n\nThis study builds on the growing international research around GAE and osteoarthritis. While preliminary data shows that the treatment does work and is feasible, it has only been used in a clinical trial setting. The study has completed enrollment of 20 patients and final results are expected in summer 2018. A second randomized controlled clinical trial began in February 2018 and will provide further data on what types of patients are the best candidates for this treatment and how it could move toward clinical practice.\n\nAbstract 210: Geniculate Artery Embolization (GAE) for Osteoarthritis (OA)-related Knee Pain: Interim Results from a Multicenter US Trial.

As rates of sugar-related disorders such as diabetes, obesity and heart disease climb, many experts believe that when Americans rid themselves of fat, they simply replaced it with sugar in all its forms.\n\nBut that the rise of the chronic diseases was actually linked to higher sugar consumption is a challenge. Dr. Robert Lustig, from the department of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco, who has made a name for himself publishing books and research addressing the question of sugar\u2019s effects on the body, wanted clearer answers. Now, in a paper published Tuesday, he and his colleagues believe they have come up with the definitive evidence that sugar, as Lustig says, \u201cis toxic.\u201d\n\nIn most lab studies, the doses of sugar that scientists test are quite high; they want to see what the effect is quickly and, depending on the research, they may not have time to wait to study the more gradual effects that might emerge. And in studies where people reduce the amount of sugar they eat, for instance, those people end up eating fewer calories overall, so it\u2019s difficult to know whether any changes are due to the removal of sugar or to the drop in calories.\n\nLustig and his colleagues think they\u2019ve produced the \u201chard and fast data that sugar is toxic irrespective of its calories and irrespective of weight.\u201d\n\nMORE: FDA Wants Nutrition Labels to Include More Detail on Added Sugars\n\nLustig\u2019s confidence comes from the unique study, described in , of 43 Hispanic or African-American children aged eight to 18 years old. He collected detailed food questionnaires from each of the adolescents to get an idea of the average amount of calories they ate per day, then designed a special menu for each of them for nine days that matched the total numbers of calories they would normally eat. The only difference in the nine-day diet was that most of the sugar the children ate was replaced by starch \u2014 the overall number of calories remained the same. The children weighed themselves daily, and if they were losing weight, they were told to eat more of the provided food in order to keep their weight the same throughout the study.\n\n\u201cEverything got better,\u201d says Lustig. Some of the children went from being insulin resistant, a precursor state to developing diabetes, in which the body\u2019s insulin levels can no longer keep up with the pace of breaking down sugar that\u2019s coming in from the diet, to insulin sensitive.\n\nMORE: Artificial Sweeteners Aren\u2019t the Answer to Obesity: Here\u2019s Why\n\n\u201cWe took chicken teriyaki out, and put turkey hot dogs in. We took sweetened yogurt out, and put baked potato chips in. We took pastries out and put bagels in,\u201d says Lustig. \u201cSo there was no change in [the children\u2019s] weight and no change in calories.\u201d\n\nAfter nine days of having their total dietary sugar reduced to 10% of their daily calories, however, they showed improvements in all of these measures. Overall, their fasting blood sugar levels dropped by 53%, along with the amount of insulin their bodies produced since insulin is normally needed to break down carbohydrates and sugars. Their triglyceride and LDL levels also declined and, most importantly, they showed less fat in their liver.\n\nMORE: 7 Amazing Things That Happen to Your Body When You Give Up Soda\n\nBecause some of the children lost weight, to convince themselves that the effects weren\u2019t due to the small amount of weight that some of the children lost, Lustig and his team compared those who lost weight to those who didn\u2019t during the study, and found similar improvements in both groups.\n\n\u201cUp until now, there have been a lot of correlation studies linking sugar and metabolic syndrome,\u201d says Lustig. \u201cThis is causation.\u201d\n\nThe diet he provided the children isn\u2019t considered ideal from a health perspective \u2014 starches are still a considerable source of calories and can contribute to weight gain. But Lustig relied on the starches to prove a point in a scientific study \u2014 that the effect sugar has on the body goes beyond anything connected to its calories and to weight. \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting in any way, shape or form that we gave them healthy food,\u201d he says. \u201cWe gave them crappy food, shitty food, processed food \u2014 and they still got better. Imagine how much even better they would have gotten if we didn\u2019t substitute and took the sugar out. Then they would have gotten even better yet. That\u2019s the point.\u201d\n\nMORE: The Trouble With Sugar Free Kids\n\nNot everyone is convinced that the results definitely prove sugar, and not weight loss, is the culprit, however. Susan Roberts, professor of Nutrition, USDA Nutrition Center at Tufts University notes that because some of the children lost weight, it\u2019s still possible that shedding the pounds helped their metabolic measures to improve. She also points out that the children self-reported their initial diet, which can often be inaccurate. \u201cWe know that a healthy diet and weight loss cause good metabolic changes, and although this study tries to attribute its effects to low fructose, in fact it is impossible to do that because of the study design.\u201d\n\nSome experts are concerned for other reasons. They\u2019re worried that the findings may shift attention away from what they consider to be the more fundamental issue \u2014 that overall, we\u2019re eating too much. \u201cToo much calorie intake is still the biggest problem,\u201d says Dr. Mark Corkins, professor of pediatrics at University of Tennessee Health Science Center and member of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on nutrition. He notes that the study involved children who were obese already and consuming too many calories. \u201cIt\u2019s an important study, and the facts coming out of it are very important. It means we need to look at sugars, and at the type of sugars and sugar intake. But I worry that people are going to hang everything on this when we still need to reduce consumption.\u201d\n\nLustig hopes that won\u2019t happen as more data emerges that details how sugar is altering the body in unhealthy ways outside of its caloric contribution. That wasn\u2019t the subject of the current paper, but he promises follow up studies based on this work that will address that. This study does hint however, at what might be happening. While there has been a lot of attention on the presence of belly fat and its connection to metabolic syndrome, the fact that the children saw improvements in the amount of fat in their liver suggests that might be an important way that sugar is contributing to chronic disease. Obese children and those with diabetes often suffer from fatty liver, a condition normally associated with alcohol abuse but increasingly common among non-drinkers who gain excessive amounts of weight.\n\nThis new view of sugar could change the advice that doctors and government health officials give about eating the sweet stuff. Lustig\u2019s hope is that the information is considered as the U.S. Department of Agriculture finalizes its latest Dietary Guidelines, expected by the end of the year, which delineate recommendations for what, and how much of different types of foods and nutrients Americans should eat.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story includes restraining comments from two independent experts, although those comments come far down in the story and should have been placed higher. The story perhaps also could have mentioned that Dr. Lustig is author of a 2012 book called \u201cFat chance:\u00a0Beating the Odds Against Sugar, Processed Food, Obesity, and Disease,\u201d and so may have an intellectual and financial conflict of interest when it comes to sugar. \u00a0The study was funded by\u00a0the NIH and Touro University, as well as UCSF \u2014 another aspect that could have been mentioned for context.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "TrueTear\u2122 is a handheld stimulator with daily disposable tips that is inserted into the nasal cavity to induce the production of tears.

Paul Amminger of The University of Melbourne in Australia, a researcher on the study, told Reuters Health. But while psychiatrists now know how to identify these individuals, he added, they don\u2019t know what to do with them. \u201cAt the moment there\u2019s no state-of-the-art guideline (on) how to treat those people.\u201d\n\nPrescribing antipsychotic medications may be helpful, Amminger added, but these medications have serious side effects, and can also be stigmatizing. \u201cFor young people they don\u2019t want to commit themselves to a treatment which they might need to take for the next five to ten years,\u201d he said. Furthermore, only about a third of people at high risk for psychotic disorders will go on to develop full-fledged mental illness in a given year.\n\nThere\u2019s considerable evidence that abnormal fatty acid metabolism may contribute to the development of schizophrenia, Amminger and his team note in the Archives of General Psychiatry. To investigate whether omega-3 fatty acids might help prevent psychotic illness, they randomly assigned 81 at-risk individuals, 13 to 25 years old, to take 1.2 grams a day of omega-3s in fish oil capsule form or a placebo for 12 weeks and then followed them for another 40 weeks.\n\nThe researchers included people who met at least one of the following three criteria: having low-level psychotic symptoms; having transient psychotic symptoms; or having a schizophrenia-like personality disorder or a close relative with schizophrenia, along with a sharp decline in mental function within the past year.\n\nSeventy-six of the 81 study participants, or 94 percent, completed the trial, Amminger noted, which underscores the safety and tolerability of fish oil.\n\nAt one year, 5 percent of the study participants taking omega-3s had developed a psychotic disorder (2 of 41 people), compared to 28 percent of those on placebo (11 of 40). People taking fish oil also showed significant reductions in their psychotic symptoms and improvements in function, while they were at no greater risk of adverse effects than people taking placebo capsules.\n\nThe effect of fish oil capsules, Amminger noted, was similar to that seen in two trials of antipsychotic drugs in at-risk individuals.\n\nThere are a number of mechanisms through which omega-3s could protect the brain, Amminger said; they are a major component of brain cells. They are also key to the proper function of two brain chemical signaling systems, dopamine and serotonin, which have been implicated in schizophrenia. Fish oil also boosts levels of glutathione, an antioxidant that protects the brain against oxidative stress.\n\nTrials of medications for treating mental illness typically don\u2019t include people younger than 18, Amminger noted, while starting minors on these medications is \u201calways very difficult, and always quite controversial.\u201d\n\nBut if future research bears out the current findings, he added, fish oil promises to offer a safe way to help prevent psychosis in at-risk people, and could also potentially be used to prevent or delay the onset of chronic depression, bipolar illness, and substance abuse disorder \u2014 all of which are far more common than psychotic illness.\n\nHe and his colleagues are now planning a multicenter trial of fish oil for the prevention of psychotic illness in 320 at-risk people.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The main limitation of this story is that it did not provide insights from any independent experts.\u00a0 It only\u00a0interviewed the principal investigator who conducted the research on which the story was based.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Independent experts\u00a0could have highlighted the limitations of the research which would have been important to present.\u00a0 ", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Still, the new recommendations for Pap tests are likely to feed a political debate in Washington over health care overhaul proposals. The mammogram advice led some Republicans to predict that such recommendations would lead to rationing.\n\nSenator Tom Coburn, a Republican from Oklahoma who is also a physician, said in an interview that he would continue to offer Pap smears to sexually active young women. Democratic proposals to involve the government more deeply in the nation\u2019s health care system, he said, would lead the new mammography, Pap smear and other guidelines to be adopted without regard to patient differences, hurting many people.\n\n\u201cThese are going to be set in stone,\u201d Mr. Coburn said.\n\nSenator Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Democrat and longtime advocate for cancer screening, said in an interview: \u201cAnd this Pap smear guideline is yet another cut back in screening? That is curious.\u201d Mr. Specter, who was treated for Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma in 2005 and 2008, said Congress was committed to increasing cancer screenings, not limiting them.\n\nRepresentative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, said that the new guidelines would have no effect on federal policy and that \u201cRepublicans are using these new recommendations as a distraction.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaking such arguments, especially at this critical point in the debate, merely clouds the very simple issue that our health reform bill would increase access to care for millions of women across the country,\u201d she said.\n\nThere are 11,270 new cases of cervical cancer and 4,070 deaths per year in the United States. One to 2 cases occur per 1,000,000 girls ages 15 to 19 \u2014 a low incidence that convinces many doctors that it is safe to wait until 21 to screen.\n\nThe doctors\u2019 group also felt it was safe to test women less often because cervical cancer grows slowly, so there is time to catch precancerous growths. Cervical cancer is caused by a sexually transmitted virus, human papillomavirus, or HPV, that is practically ubiquitous. Only some people who are exposed to it develop cancer; in most, the immune system fights off the virus. If cancer does develop, it can take 10 to 20 years after exposure to the virus.\n\nThe new guidelines say women 30 and older who have three consecutive Pap tests that were normal, and who have no history of seriously abnormal findings, can stretch the interval between screenings to three years.\n\nIn addition, women who have a total hysterectomy (which removes the uterus and cervix) for a noncancerous condition, and who had no severe abnormalities on previous Pap tests, can quit having the tests entirely.\n\nThe guidelines also say that women can stop having Pap tests between 65 and 70 if they have three or more negative tests in a row and no abnormal test results in the last 10 years.\n\nThe changes do not apply to women with certain health problems that could make them more prone to aggressive cervical cancer, including H.I.V. infection or having an organ transplant or other condition that would lead to a suppressed immune system.\n\nIt is by no means clear that doctors or patients will follow the new guidelines. Medical groups, including the American Cancer Society, have been suggesting for years that women with repeated normal Pap tests could begin to have the test less frequently, but many have gone on to have them year after year anyway.\n\nDebbie Saslow, director of breast and gynecologic cancer for the American Cancer Society, said professional groups were particularly concerned because many teenagers and young women were being tested and then needlessly subjected to invasive procedures.\n\nIn addition, Dr. Saslow said, doctors in this country have been performing 15 million Pap tests a year to look for cervical cancer in women who have no cervix, because they have had hysterectomies.\n\nDr. Carol L. Brown, a gynecologic oncologist and surgeon at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, said the new guidelines should probably not be applied to all women, because there are some girls who begin having sex at 12 or 13 and may be prone to develop cervical cancer at an early age.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned that whenever you send a message out to the public to do less, the most vulnerable people at highest risk might take the message and not get screened at all,\u201d Dr. Brown said.\n\nDr. Kevin M. Holcomb, an associate professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital, said that when he heard the advice to delay Pap testing until 21, \u201cMy emotional response is \u2018Wow, that seems dangerous,\u2019 and yet I know the chances of an adolescent getting cervical cancer are really low.\u201d\n\nAs with the new mammogram recommendations, women may not readily give up a yearly cancer test.\n\n\u201cFor people who\u2019ve been having the testing regularly every year, it\u2019s a big emotional change to test less frequently and there\u2019s this fear of \u2018Oh my gosh, I might be missing something,\u2019 \u201d said Ivy Guetta, 49, of Westport, Conn., who plans to continue with annual Pap tests.

They measure cholesterol, blood pressure and heart rate, they test the electrical signals that keep the heart beating and they may also run imaging tests to check for clogged arteries.\n\nBut by the time a narrowed artery shows up on a standard scan, \u201cit's likely to be already too late to intervene and reverse the narrowing in the artery that has already occurred over many years,\u201d Channon said.\n\n\u201cBy detecting those individuals who don't have narrowing in their heart arteries, but they are in the process in developing them because the arteries are inflamed, we may be able to intervene early enough to prevent heart disease.\u201d\n\nThat's why surgeons do heart bypasses. They graft in a vein to bypass blood flow around the clogged part.\n\nRelated: Why Young Women are Having Heart Attacks\n\nThe team studied more than 450 people having heart bypass surgery, removing some of the fat clogging their arteries. They compared them to 270 more having angiograms to look for evidence of clogged arteries.\n\nThey found a way to identify which layers of fat were inflamed and unstable by looking at the size and shape of the cells using computed tomography (CT) scans.\n\n\u201cWe are now further validating our method in larger numbers of patients in large prospective clinical studies to document and confirm the predictive value of this method for future heart attacks,\u201d Antoniades said.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The article appears to quote only those who conducted the study.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "The most common sexually transmitted disease is often silent and invisible: human papillomavirus (also called HPV).

Men up to age 26 are also eligible for Gardasil to protect against HPV. But there are a lot of people out there who still have HPV, and nothing protects against all 130 strains of the virus. At least half of all sexually active males and females have had HPV, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nA Pennsylvania start-up company called Inovio Pharmaceuticals has developed an experimental vaccine for people who already have HPV and precancerous lesions that are associated with it. A new study demonstrating the vaccine's safety and potential effectiveness was published this week in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\n \n\n The experimental vaccine does not use the live HPV virus; it is formulated in synthetic DNA and pure water. It uses the immune system of the treated women to fight off cancer, said Joseph Kim, president and CEO of Inovio Pharmaceuticals and study co-author.\n\nWorldwide, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer after breast cancer, with about 493,000 new cases and 274,000 deaths annually, the study said. HPV causes about 5% of cancers globally.\n\nSome women, because of their particular genetic makeup, can clear precancerous lesions on their own and would not need this vaccine. This happens in anywhere from 10% to 25% of women infected with HPV, Kim said.\n\nNo one knows why some women have this capability and others do not, but for those who lack it the Inovio vaccine is \"giving our immune system a little boost,\" Kim said.\n\nEighteen women with high-grade precancerous cervical lesions participated in the phase 1 study.\n\nStudy authors say the vaccine is formulated to work against all cancers caused by HPV types 16 and 18, including cervical, anogenital (anal and genital), and head and neck cancers. The researchers did not observe any side effects.\n\nIn the next phase of this research 150 women worldwide are participating, but they are not included in these published results, Kim said.\n\nThe phase 1 results are very early in the experimentation of this vaccine. The study was not done as a randomized controlled trial, the gold standard for determining whether a drug works better than chance. Also, 18 people is a small number for examining the effects of a medication.\n\nGiven those drawbacks, it\u2019s not appropriate to draw too many conclusions from this study, says Dr. Diane Harper, a prominent HPV researcher at the University of Missouri \u2013 Kansas City\u2019s School of Medicine.

(For weeks, participants wore a cumbersome bra-like tissue expander at night that was created by Dr. Khouri to create a scaffolding for their fat.) The study, which Dr. Khouri plans to publish in a peer-reviewed journal, found that the procedure does not impede the reading of mammograms and that on average, 85 percent of transplanted fat survived to give patients natural-feeling larger breasts.\n\nThis kind of is a two-fer: trim fat where you don\u2019t want it and put it where you do. Another advantage is not having to worry about an implant breaking or hardening.\n\nBut the disadvantages cannot be discounted. It\u2019s usually more expensive than implants, it takes a year to see how much fat survived, and breast volume can fluctuate with weight. Dr. Scott L. Spear, the chairman of the plastic surgery department at Hospital, has enlarged a patient\u2019s breasts only to have the patient undo his handiwork by losing weight. \u201cThey decide to run a marathon and their breasts go away,\u201d he said.\n\nBut a far worse scenario is that a doctor\u2019s technique is so wanting that much of the transplanted fat dies and complications ensue. \u201cAnyone can take fat and inject it into the breast, and the patient will look good immediately afterwards,\u201d Dr. Khouri said, but a few months later, the fat injected by a doctor with sub-par skills may result in \u201coil cysts, masses, and scarring.\u201d\n\nTo some, this kind of fat recycling seems simple.

The phase II trial, conducted by researchers at the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, demonstrated a host of benefits from the regimen.\n\nThe diet reduced cardiovascular risk factors including blood pressure, signs of inflammation (measured by C-reactive protein levels), as well as fasting glucose and reduced levels of IGF-1, a hormone that affects metabolism. It also shrank waistlines and resulted in weight loss, both in total body fat and trunk fat, but not in muscle mass.\n\nIn effect, the diet reduced the study participants' risks for cancer, diabetes, heart disease and other age-related diseases, according to the findings published Feb. 15 in Science Translational Medicine.\n\n\"This study provides evidence that people can experience significant health benefits through a periodic, fasting-mimicking diet that is designed to act on the aging process,\" said Valter Longo, director of the USC Longevity Institute and a professor of biological sciences for USC Davis and Dornsife. \"Prior studies have indicated a range of health benefits in mice, but this is the first randomized clinical trial with enough participants to demonstrate that the diet is feasible, effective and safe for humans.\n\n\"Larger FDA studies are necessary to confirm its effects on disease prevention and treatment,\" he added.\n\nOne hundred people participated in the trial from April 2013 to July 2015. The participants, ages 20 to 70 and all generally healthy, were divided into two groups for the randomized trial.\n\nParticipants in the first group, the control group, were asked to continue their normal eating habits for three months. People in the second group were placed on a three-month test of the fasting-mimicking diet.\n\nThose on the special diet were required to eat food products supplied by the nutrition company L-Nutra during the fasting periods of five days each month. The diet, which was designed to mimic the results of a water-only fast, allowed for participants to consume between 750 and 1,100 calories per day. The meals for the fast-mimicking diet contained precise proportions of proteins, fats and carbohydrates.\n\nAfter three months, participants in the control group were moved onto the special diet.\n\nThe researchers found that participants on the fasting-mimicking diet lost an average of about 6 pounds. Their waistlines shrank by 1 to 2 inches. Their systolic blood pressure, which was in the normal range when the study began, dropped by 4.5 mmHG, while their diastolic blood pressure dropped by 3.1 mmHg. Also, their levels of IGF-1 dropped to between 21.7 ng/mL and 46.2 ng/mL, reaching a range associated with lower cancer risk.\n\n\"After the first group completed their three months on the fasting diet, we moved over participants in the control group to see if they also would experience similar results,\" Longo said. \"We saw similar outcomes, which provides further evidence that a fasting-mimicking diet has effects on many metabolic and disease markers. Our mouse studies using a similar fasting-mimicking diet indicate that these beneficial effects are caused by multi-system regeneration and rejuvenation in the body at the cellular and organ levels.\n\n\"Our participants retained those effects, even when they returned to their normal daily eating habits,\" he added.\n\nThe researchers also noted that participants considered \"at risk\" because they had risk factors such as high IGF-1, cholesterol, blood pressure or blood sugar levels, made significant progress toward better health.\n\nFor example, baseline fasting glucose levels for participants with high blood sugar levels (putting them at risk for diabetes) dropped into the healthy range, below 99 mg/dl -- but these levels didn't drop among participants who already had healthy levels at the beginning of the study. Cholesterol was reduced by 20 mg/dl in those with high cholesterol levels, and by about 5 mg/dl in all participants.\n\n\"Fasting seems to be the most beneficial for patients who have the great risk factors for disease, such as those who have high blood pressure or pre-diabetes or who are obese,\" Longo said.\n\nThe researchers had invited participants in the study for one last set of tests three months later, at the end of the diet. The research team found that the beneficial effects -- from weight loss, smaller waistlines and lower glucose, blood pressure and IGF-1 levels -- were sustained.\n\nThe next step for researchers is a large, FDA phase III clinical trial to test the FMD on patients diagnosed with age-related diseases or at high risk for them.

Experts attribute the pelvic pain to prostaglandins, a hormone-like substance that contributes to the contraction and relaxation of muscles and blood vessels.\n\nVitamin D3 apparently helped hamper prostaglandin production in study participants, easing their pain, said Dr. Jill Rabin, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y. The vitamin is also known to have anti-inflammatory effects, Rabin added.\n\n\"The bottom line is, it looked like it worked,\" said Rabin, also head of urogynecology at the hospital. \"It was a very well-done study, but my comment is, it was one study. It asks more questions than it answers, which is the sign of a good trial.\"\n\nThe 300,000 IU dose of vitamin D3 given in the study also far exceeds the daily intake of 600 IUs recommended for American women of reproductive age, both Graham and Rabin said. And since the study period lasted only two months, there was no way to tell whether such a high dose produced any toxic long-term effects.\n\nCurrently used methods of controlling menstrual cramps include NSAIDs and -- among those with severe pain -- birth control pills. But both have potential risks: NSAID users can experience stomach or kidney troubles, for example, while birth control pills are linked to blood clots in certain women. The cost of vitamin D supplements would be roughly comparable with both of these remedies.\n\nVitamin D use has also been widely studied as a possible preventive for many other conditions, including heart disease, certain cancers and autoimmune disorders.\n\nThe Italian study participants all had blood levels of vitamin D measuring in the lowest 25 percent of normal at the study's outset, although the researchers didn't report the womens' blood levels afterward. Experts wondered if women with higher blood levels would experience such dramatic cramp relief as observed in the study.\n\nGraham and Rabin agreed that much larger trials should be done before they would recommend vitamin D3 use to any of their patients for cramp relief.\n\n\"From a symptomatic standpoint, it's something to be considered, but more studies are needed to see the risks and benefits,\" Graham said. \"Studies like this are starting to show that vitamin D is ubiquitous in receptors in our bodies . . . but it needs further explanation.\"\n\nTo find out more about painful menstrual periods, head to the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story included interviews with other doctors not associated with the study and reported their viewpoints regarding the study findings.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Newswise \u2014 HOUSTON \u2015 For the first time, transplanting gut bacteria from healthy donors was used to successfully treat patients suffering from severe colitis caused by treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). The study from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, which includes two patients, suggests fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is worth investigating in clinical trials as a therapy for this common side effect of immunotherapy.\n\nThe research, led by Yinghong Wang, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of Gastroenterology, Hepatology & Nutrition and director of Medication Induced Colitis and Enteritis, was published today in Nature Medicine.\n\n\u201cThe resolution of colitis in these patients can be confirmed clinically and endoscopically after FMT treatment,\u201d said Wang. \u201cBased on these results, this should be evaluated even as a first-line therapy for ICI-associated colitis because it\u2019s safe, quick, and the effect is durable - from one treatment.\u201d\n\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors, which release a block on the immune system to attack cancer, have been successful in providing durable responses for patients with several cancer types. However, these treatments are often associated with significant immune-related toxicities.\n\nColitis, inflammation of the colon, is the second most common side effect from ICIs, occurring in up to 40 percent of patients, explained Wang. When ICI-associated colitis is severe, guidelines require a patient to stop ICI treatment until the colitis is in remission.\n\n\u201cIf the patient is a good responder to immunotherapy, that means you\u2019ve taken their effective treatment away,\u201d said Wang. \u201cWe have a limited amount of time to fix the problem so they can resume ICI treatment, but I feel that we\u2019ve made great progress in this area.\u201d\n\nThe researchers chose to investigate the potential for FMT as an alternative, compassionate-use therapy for patients suffering from refractory, or unresponsive, ICI-associated colitis. The two patients included in the study were treated at MD Anderson between June 2017 and January 2018.\n\nFMT has shown promise in treating other types of gastrointestinal diseases, such as recurrent Clostridium difficile infection and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which shares many clinical and molecular characteristics with ICI-associated colitis. These conditions typically are treated with steroids and targeted immunosuppressive agents, which result in additional severe side effects and can counteract the effects of immunotherapy.\n\nBoth patients in the study had a complete resolution of their colitis following treatment with FMT. The first patient\u2019s colitis resolved within two weeks following a single FMT treatment; the second patient experienced a partial recovery after the first treatment, followed by complete recovery after a second FMT. With endoscopic evaluation before and after treatment, both patients displayed significant improvements in inflammation and ulcerations, including a reduction of inflammatory immune cells.\n\nPre- and post-treatment stool analyses revealed patients\u2019 gut microbiomes to be most similar to the donor immediately after treatment, with less resemblance to the donor over time. Still, post-treatment gut bacteria remained distinct from their own pre-treatment microbiome. Additionally, distinct new populations of bacterial species were evident in these patients following FMT compared to pre-treatment samples, including several species known to be protective or reduce inflammation.\n\nThe authors acknowledge significant limitations to this study based on the very small cohort, and they plan to pursue clinical trials to investigate the effectiveness of FMT in treating ICI-associated colitis as compared with standard immunosuppressive therapy. FMT continues to be offered to MD Anderson patients on a compassionate-use basis.\n\nPrevious MD Anderson research showed that bacteria in the gut influence patient response to ICI therapy, and other evidence suggests modifying the microbiome in mice can alter their response to immunotherapy. The current data further suggests there is the potential for many molecular studies to better understand the role of the microbiome in driving ICI-colitis and immunotherapy response more broadly.\n\nThe study was supported by the Andrew Sabin Family Fellowship Program; the American Association for Cancer Research \u2013 Stand Up to Cancer; the National Institutes of Health (CA219896-01A1, HL124112); the Cancer Prevention & Research Institute of Texas; and the Melanoma Moon Shot\u2122, part of MD Anderson\u2019s Moon Shots Program\u2122, a collaborative effort to accelerate the development of scientific discoveries into clinical advances that save patients\u2019 lives\n\nIn addition to Wang, other MD Anderson authors include: Diana Wiesnoski, Christopher Sanchez, and Chia-Chi Chang, Ph.D., all of Genomic Medicine; Beth Helmink, M.D., Ph.D., and Vancheswaran Gopalakrishnan, Ph.D., both of Surgical Oncology; Hamzah Abu-Sbeih, M.D., Gottumukkala Raju, M.D., and John Stroehlein, M.D., all of Gastroenterology, Hepatology & Nutrition; Edwin Parra, M.D., Ph.D., and Alejandro Francisco-Cruz, Ph.D., both of Translational Molecular Pathology; Matthew Campbell, M.D., Jianjun Gao, M.D., Ph.D., and Sumit Subudhi, M.D., Ph.D., all of Genitourinary Medical Oncology; Dipen Maru, M.D., of Pathology; Jorge Blando, DVM, and James Allison, Ph.D., both of Immunology; Padmanee Sharma, M.D., Ph.D., of Genitourinary Medical Oncology and Immunology; Michael Tetzlaff, M.D., Ph.D., of Translational Molecular Pathology and Pathology; Jennifer Wargo, M.D., of Genomic Medicine and Surgical Oncology; and Robert Jenq, M.D., of Genomic Medicine and Stem Cell Transplantation.

Though most patients eventually walk again without pain or the aid of a cane, recovery and rehabilitation can be rigorous, painful and lengthy.\n\nThe surgery is extensive: As its name suggests, it involves removing the joint \u2014 the damaged bone and cartilage \u2014 and replacing it with prosthetic parts made of metal, plastic or ceramics. Typically, surgeons enter the joint from the rear, which requires cutting through muscle and cartilage. But with a relatively new procedure, surgeons enter from the front and only stretch the muscles aside, avoiding the cutting and minimizing pain and recovery time. According to those who use this anterior technique, the benefits are substantial.\n\nAnthony Unger, medical director at the Institute of Bone and Joint Health at Sibley Memorial Hospital and a clinical professor of orthopedic surgery at George Washington University Hospital, says the anterior approach is \u201ctruly minimally invasive.\u201d Unger, who has done about 4,000 hip replacements over 26 years and has used the anterior technique for the past eight years, says \u201cpatients have better overall functionality, can sleep on their sides and be confident the new hip won\u2019t dislocate.\u201d\n\nBut, as with many transitions in medical techniques, some surgeons have been reluctant to change. Although agencies and hospitals don\u2019t track hip replacements by the type of procedure used, Unger says that, based on statistics from the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons, only 20 percent of its members choose the anterior approach.\n\nJoshua Jacobs, a vice president of the American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons and chairman of orthopedic surgery at Rush University in Chicago, says the AAOS doesn\u2019t \u201cendorse or promote one specific technique or procedure over another.\u201d Jacobs prefers the posterior approach, which he says has been reliable for him.\n\nHe says that while he\u2019s heard about the benefits of the anterior approach, he\u2019s \u201cnot aware of a randomized, controlled trial comparing the posterior and anterior approach that shows a definite superiority of one over the other.\u201d What\u2019s key is that \u201csurgeons need to do the approach they\u2019re most comfortable with to get the best outcomes.\u201d\n\nA study by Unger in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery in 2011 found that with the anterior procedure, there was less muscle damage and inflammation both in the immediate postoperative period and two days later than with the posterior approach.\n\nOthers surgeons who prefer the anterior procedure say it preserves more of the normal anatomy, which also means fewer medications and shorter hospital stays. Michael Bollinger, who operates at Palm Drive Hospital in Sebastopol, Calif., switched methods a few years ago.\n\nWith the anterior approach, Bollinger says, \u201cwe can take\n\nX-rays during the operation, to see if the new hip is placed correctly and adjust it, when necessary.\u201d Many surgeons use a special operating table that makes this possible.\n\nAlthough surgeons can also take X-rays during the posterior procedure, it is much more difficult, and they wait until patients are in the recovery room, where, Bollinger says, \u201cthere\u2019s not much that can be done.\u201d He explains that while the body \u201ctolerates an imperfect alignment pretty well, if a new hip gets dislocated, it\u2019s often because it\u2019s not in perfectly.\u201d\n\nRobert Saunders, a nurse at Alta Bates Summit Medical Center in Berkeley, Calif., sees about 200 hip replacement patients a year. He says that \u201cnurses love the anterior approach\u201d because there\u2019s less worry about dislocating the joint. \u201cWith the posterior approach, we have to spread patients\u2019 legs apart and strap them to a pillow to keep the new joint in place. If they want to move or roll over, they can\u2019t,\u201d he says.\n\nSaunders says the anterior patients also have an easier time with physical therapy, which can start the same day as the surgery. \u201cThose who\u2019ve had the posterior procedure have a lot of pain, since, when they sit up, they\u2019re right on top the incision,\u201d he explains.\n\nPatrick Kennelly, a physical therapist with Smartherapy in Chevy Chase, says people who have the anterior procedure \u201cdon\u2019t feel so weak, because their hip muscles haven\u2019t been cut. If they\u2019ve had the posterior procedure, even if they don\u2019t consciously feel weak, they tend to shift their weight onto one foot and teeter like [Charlie] Chaplin.\u201d\n\nGiven benefits such as these, why haven\u2019t more surgeons switched methods? Unger says that most surgeons have used the posterior approach for years, have fine results, and see no need to switch. Also, he says, they work in a \u201cvery high-stress, high-liability environment. For this reason, new techniques are adapted slowly with extreme care, and in some cases, not at all.\u201d\n\nUnger adds that surgeons are naturally cautious and typically wait to see results from many studies before they switch methods. Besides his study, there have only been a few others. One, a prospective, randomized study by William Barrett, an orthopedic surgeon in the Seattle area, compared the two approaches in a peer-reviewed paper he presented at the 2012 annual AAOS meeting and found benefits with the anterior approach.\n\nAnother obstacle to the widespread use of the newer approach is that if established surgeons want to switch, they face time and cost constraints. They must get training in classes and cadaver labs, and the learning curve can be steep. Unger says his was relatively short \u2014 about 20 cases. Others say it took about 50 cases.\n\nAnd this creates economic issues. \u201cIf you\u2019re a busy surgeon, you have a volume to maintain,\u201d Bollinger says, \u201cand it\u2019s hard to go from doing three a day to one during the learning period.\u201d\n\nChristopher Chen, a surgeon who uses the anterior approach at Alta Bates Summit, adds that most doctors \u201cstill use the posterior approach because it\u2019s the one they were taught.\u201d And, he says, the majority of younger surgeons learn the older approach because established surgeons are typically the ones who staff the residency training programs and demonstrate the method they know best.\n\nMost surgeons don\u2019t profit from choosing one approach over another, Chen says. \u201cIf there is a financial incentive\u201d for promoting the newer technique, he says, \u201cit is that more patients will want the anterior approach, so that the surgeon does more surgeries, and therefore collects more professional fees for that.\u201d\n\nWilliam Hamilton, who operates at the Anderson Orthopaedic Clinic at Inova Mt. Vernon Hospital, trains young surgeons to do the anterior approach in a year-long hip and knee replacement fellowship program. Hamilton says that \u201cduring this time, they\u2019re taught both approaches.\u201d But he adds that \u201csince 2009, of the 13 fellows he trained, 12 use the anterior procedure as their primary approach in their practices.\u201d\n\nHamilton says that \u201ca decade ago, very few residencies and fellowships taught the anterior approach. Now, several institutions around the country have at least one surgeon teaching it. So when students leave and begin their practices, it\u2019s no longer foreign to them.\u201d\n\nHamilton, who has performed 1,100 anterior procedures and strongly supports the method, says that despite growing interest, \u201cit will take a generation of new surgeons\u201d before use of the anterior approach is widespread.\n\nMany patients aren\u2019t aware of the option. The case of Daniel Ellsberg \u2014 who in 1971 released the Pentagon Papers, a secret study about U.S. involvement in Vietnam \u2014 is instructive. His hip had been hurting for about a year, and when he decided to have surgery, his primary-care physician recommended a respected surgeon. Just days before the operation last July, a friend told him about the anterior approach.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never heard of it, and neither my doctor nor surgeon mentioned it. I called the surgeon\u2019s office, learned he did the posterior procedure, asked for and got a recommendation for one who performs the anterior one, and my experience was amazing. The same day as the operation, I walked down the hall with a walker. I was home in three days, and a week later, [I] walked one or two blocks without pain or a cane. In a month, I bodysurfed at the beach,\u201d says Ellsberg, who is 81 .\n\nMargot Machol, who is two decades younger and lives in Washington, had both hips replaced \u2014 the first with the posterior procedure several years ago, the second with the anterior procedure last October. Unger performed both surgeries.\n\n\u201cAfter the first, I needed pain medicine when I came home from the hospital. Also, I had a long list of restrictions of what I could and couldn\u2019t do so the hip wouldn\u2019t pop out. For six weeks, I had to sleep on my back, couldn\u2019t cross my legs and wasn\u2019t able to drive.\n\n\u201cAfter the second, I didn\u2019t take any pain pills once I was home, slept on my side soon after the surgery, had almost no rules and drove my car in two weeks. I even wanted to ski over Christmas, because I felt fine,\u201d Machol says.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story quotes a wide variety of sources.

For decades, the standard treatment has been \u201ccontinuous positive airway pressure.\u201d A mask worn at night pushes air into the nasal passages, enabling easier breathing. C.P.A.P. reduces and in some cases completely prevents episodes of apnea.\n\nBut the mask is like something from a bad science fiction movie: big, bulky and obtrusive. Many patients simply refuse to wear it or rip it off while asleep. Studies show that about half of all people prescribed C.P.A.P. machines stop using them in one to three weeks.\n\n\u201cFor a lot of people out there, the C.P.A.P. machine turns into a doorstop,\u201d said Dr. Joseph Golish, the former chief of sleep medicine at the Cleveland Clinic and now a professor with the MetroHealth System in Cleveland. \u201cC.P.A.P. is very effective in the sleep lab. But when people go home, there\u2019s a good chance they won\u2019t use it, and the success rate of an unused C.P.A.P. machine is absolutely zero.\u201d\n\nNow an alternative form of C.P.A.P. is gaining popularity: a patch that fits over the nostrils. Called Provent, the patch holds two small plugs, one for each nostril, that create just enough air pressure to keep the airways open at night. It is far less intrusive than the traditional C.P.A.P. machine. It is also more expensive, and it doesn\u2019t work for every patient.\n\nApproved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2008, Provent has spread mostly by word of mouth. But it has caught on fast. Its manufacturer, Ventus Medical, says it has shipped one million of the devices in the past 12 months, up from a half million total in the two years prior. Doctors say it has given them a new weapon in the battle against sleep apnea, and many patients who struggled with C.P.A.P. call it a godsend.\n\nBob Bleck, who owns a computer networking firm in Ohio, struggled with poor sleep and chronic fatigue for decades. But it was only a year and a half ago that he finally went to a sleep clinic, prodded by his wife, who worried about his heavy snoring.\n\nThe diagnosis was severe sleep apnea. Tests showed that in a typical night, Mr. Bleck, 47, awoke or stopped breathing 42 times an hour.\n\nHis doctor prescribed a C.P.A.P. machine, and Mr. Bleck hated it.\n\n\u201cI had this constricted feeling,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be incorporated into these dreams where I was tied up, like in the movie \u2018Alien.\u2019 It was more difficult to sleep with that thing on than to just get through the night with the apnea.\u201d\n\nMr. Bleck got rid of the machine after he discovered Provent. \u201cAfter I started using it, I noticed a difference right away,\u201d he said. \u201cMy symptoms subsided dramatically.\u201d\n\nProvent works like a traditional C.P.A.P. machine but is only a fraction of the size. When people with apnea fall asleep, their throat muscles collapse, constricting the airway and causing the body to fight for air. C.P.A.P. machines use mild air pressure to keep the airway from constricting.\n\nProvent does too, but in a different way. The device contains two pinhole-size valves, one over each nostril. The valves let air in easily \u2014 most people breathe through their nostrils while asleep \u2014 but there is resistance as the user exhales. That resistance creates a backpressure in the airways, dilating the muscles that would otherwise collapse in the middle of the night. In the morning, the patch is removed; a new one is used every night.\n\nLast year, in a large study of 250 apnea sufferers published in the medical journal Sleep and subsidized by Ventus, researchers found that those who used Provent devices over a three-month period saw their apnea episodes fall sharply, compared with people who were given a sham, or placebo, device. A follow-up study tracked people over the course of a year and had similar results.\n\nBut not everyone finds that Provent alleviates their apnea. In interviews, sleep specialists said that a third or more of patients do not end up using it.\n\n\u201cIt works like a champ in some people and doesn\u2019t work on other people,\u201d said Dr. Nancy Appelblatt, an ear, nose and throat surgeon in Sacramento who has prescribed it to about 100 patients. \u201cAll sleep apnea is not created equal.\u201d\n\nSome people, for example, breathe through the mouth at night, not the nostrils. In those people, Provent typically doesn\u2019t work. Nor will it work very well in someone who has severe nasal allergies and has a blocked nose at night, said one of the leaders of the Provent studies, Dr. Meir H. Kryger, a professor at Yale Medical School and founder of the National Sleep Foundation.\n\nUnlike C.P.A.P., Provent is not covered by Medicare and most major insurers, though some doctors say they expect that will change in the near future. In the meantime, a 30-day supply of the patches costs $65 to $80.\n\nDr. Lee A. Surkin, a cardiologist and sleep medicine specialist in Greenville, N.C., said patients typically start with a 10-day trial pack that costs $27.50. He has prescribed Provent to about 300 of his patients.\n\n\u201cThe No. 1 reason people don\u2019t continue it is the out-of-pocket expense,\u201d he said.\n\nFor now, Dr. Kryger and others say that C.P.A.P. will continue to be the gold standard, and certainly the first option for patients with severe apnea. But for the roughly 50 percent of patients in whom C.P.A.P. fails, Provent may be a reliable alternative.\n\nDr. Surkin said some patients use C.P.A.P. at home, but take their pocket-size Provent patches with them when they travel to avoid the hassle of lugging a machine through airports.\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s a miracle,\u201d said Joyce Nemoga, 64. Ms. Nemoga, who lives in Baldwin Harbor, N.Y., has moderate apnea that caused her to snore and gasp in her sleep. She tried C.P.A.P. but could not sleep comfortably with the device.\n\n\u201cEvery time you turn over, you have to take the hose with you,\u201d she said. \u201cI tried it for six months, and I don\u2019t think I had one full night of sleep the whole time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just so happy that I found it,\u201d she said.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story quotes from a range of sources, and we give it high marks for that.

The study is available online in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology \u25cf Biology \u25cf Physics, the flagship journal of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO).\n\nWith brachytherapy, also known as internal radiation therapy (RT), implants are surgically inserted in or near cancerous tissue to deliver a curative radiation dose directly to the tumor while limiting exposure for surrounding healthy tissue. Reducing this exposure is of particular concern for treating tumors in the prostate, which is surrounded by multiple critical structures. In contrast to low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy, where radioactive seed implants are placed permanently in the body and gradually deposit low levels of radiation over a period of months, HDR treatments deposit the dose in one treatment, after which the radioactive implant is removed from the patient.\n\nTypically, HDR brachytherapy is administered in four to as many as nine treatment sessions, which generally requires multiple invasive procedures to insert the implants. While the number of sessions can be streamlined by increasing the dose given in each session, data on the safety and tolerability of highly escalated brachytherapy doses are still relatively new and therefore limited. In this study, researchers found that patients who received a single fraction of 19 Gy HDR brachytherapy experienced similar clinical outcomes as with LDR brachytherapy, but with the convenience of a single visit.\n\n\u201cIt is becoming apparent that patients may be treated definitively for their prostate cancer in as little as a single day with a minimally invasive outpatient procedure,\u201d said lead study author Daniel J. Krauss, MD, a radiation oncologist at Oakland University\u2019s William Beaumont School of Medicine in Royal Oak, Michigan. \u201cWe found that patients generally can resume normal activities the following day with typical side effects.\u201d\n\nThe study, which appeared in the Red Journal\u2019s January 2017 issue, presented the results of a nonrandomized, prospective clinical trial of 58 patients with low- or intermediate-risk (non-metastatic) prostate cancer, with a median follow-up period of 2.9 years. All patients received a single, 19 Gy fraction of HDR brachytherapy. The median patient age was 63 years (range 43-73), and 91 percent of the patients presented with stage T1 disease.\n\nAt an average of nearly three years following treatment, cancer control rates were favorable and the toxicity profile was highly favorable. Three patients experienced recurrence or progression, yielding an estimated three-year cumulative biochemical control rate of 93 percent. Within the six months following HDR therapy, seven patients (12.1%) experienced grade 2 urinary side effects, most commonly frequency/urgency (6.9%). No patients experienced short-term grade 3+ urinary toxicity or grade 2+ gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Rates were similarly modest for long-term side effects. Six patients (10.3%) experienced chronic grade 2 urinary toxicity and one patient (1.7%) experienced grade 3 chronic GI toxicity that subsequently resolved. No patients experienced long-term grade 3+ urinary toxicity or grade 4 GI toxicity.\n\n\u201cThis study illustrates that a potentially curative dose of radiation may be delivered safely to the prostate entirely in a single administration,\u201d said Dr. Krauss. \u201cGiving the entire dose in a single treatment theoretically could have had a greater negative impact on the normal tissues in close proximity to the prostate\u2014meaning the bladder, urethra and rectum\u2014but this was not found to be the case. Toxicity rates were extremely low, with essentially no major complications encountered in this initial group of 58 patients.\u201d\n\nWhile findings highlight the potential tolerability of a single fraction of HDR brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer, the article also emphasizes the need for additional follow-up to compare long-term cancer control rates with conventional treatment approaches, which generally administer larger cumulative doses than the 19 Gy dose used in this trial.\n\n\u201cAs the follow-up interval lengthens, 19 Gy dosing in a single fraction may or may not be sufficient to result in cure rates comparable to historical standards. One thing that this study has made clear, however, is that the extremely low toxicity and complication rates leave room to escalate the single fraction dose in subsequent trials,\u201d said Dr. Krauss. \u201cWhile additional study and longer follow-up are necessary to confirm the optimal dose for single-fraction HDR brachytherapy, we are optimistic that the single-treatment approach can eventually become a standard practice for prostate cancer treatment.\u201d\n\nFor more information or a copy of the full study, contact ASTRO\u2019s media relations team at press@astro.org.

How you live your life... has a real impact on how quickly your condition can decline.\"\n\nIf the findings are confirmed by larger studies, they could vastly improve the ability to detect dementia in middle age.\n\nAnd the scans would be \"well set up for routine testing,\" according to Chiesa. \"It's very easy to do, and it's very quick to do.\"\n\nWhen healthy, arteries around the heart can regulate the blood being pumped from the organ, ensuring that it flows smoothly and at a constant rate to the brain.\n\nBut damage to the arteries means blood flows more aggressively and irregularly through vessels and into the brain, which can damage its network of blood vessels and cells. Over time, the researchers believe this led more frequently to cognitive decline in participants in the study.\n\n\"What we do know is that the blood supply in the brain is incredibly important, and that maintaining a healthy heart and blood pressure is associated with a lower risk of developing dementia,\" said Carol Routledge, Director of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK, who was not involved in the research.\n\nVascular dementia is directly caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, and this can also play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease, studies have found. Those two conditions make up the vast majority of cases of dementia.\n\nDementia is an umbrella term used to describe symptoms related to the loss of brain function. Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia make up the vast majority of cases.\n\nIn the United States, the condition is the sixth biggest cause of death among all adults, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while in the UK it has overtaken heart disease as the leading cause of death, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nThe study's findings have been met with cautious optimism by dementia organizations.\n\n\"Getting a diagnosis of dementia can be time consuming and quite frustrating for many people, so it's promising that earlier indicators of cognitive decline are in development,\" said Paul Edwards, Director of Clinical Services at Dementia UK.\n\nBut he added that focus should also be paid to dementia sufferers after their diagnosis, saying: \"The elephant in the room is the lack of support for people and their families once they get a diagnosis of dementia.\"\n\nThere is currently no cure for dementia, though medication can be used to temporarily treat its symptoms.\n\n\"Often, a diagnosis is made and then people are sent home with no information, no follow-up appointments and no clue about what is going to happen next.\"\n\nMore research is needed to determine whether neck scans should become a part of routine testing for dementia.\n\n\"While these findings are interesting, as the full data from this research is yet to be published it is difficult to assess how useful this kind of scan could be,\" said Routledge.\n\nRoutledge added that current evidence shows that not smoking, only consuming alcohol within recommended limits, staying active, monitoring cholesterol levels and eating a balanced diet can all help with the health of the heart and brain.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story does not address conflicts of interest.

Maybe we were brainwashed by the industry paying people to tell us that in medical school.\"\n\nNow, other drugs have come into use for hot flashes, but not much is known about their effectiveness or long-term safety. Until recently, there was little interest in studying them rigorously, because hormones worked so well for most women.\n\n\"There's a lot of hype around trying things that we haven't proven effective and, sadly, we haven't proven they're safe,\" said Dr. Heidi D. Nelson, the first author of the journal article and an internist and professor at the Oregon Health and Science University.\n\nThe report is based on a review of 43 studies of various nonhormonal drugs being used for hot flashes. Most were originally approved for other purposes. The drugs include the antidepressants Paxil (paroxetine), Effexor (venlafaxine), Prozac (fluoxetine) and Celexa (citalopram), the blood pressure drug Catapres (clonidine), and the seizure drug Neurontin (gabapentin). Some came into use for menopause because women taking them for other reasons told doctors the drugs seemed to diminish their hot flashes.\n\nThe researchers also examined studies of nonprescription extracts from soy and red clover, which contain plant estrogens called isoflavones and are marketed as a \"natural\" treatment for hot flashes.\n\nNone of the drugs or extracts are approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat hot flashes \u2014 only hormones are approved for that purpose \u2014 but doctors are free to prescribe medicines for any use they see fit, and many recommend the drugs or plant products for hot flashes, based on study findings and their patients' experiences.\n\nThe researchers found that on average, antidepressants and Catapres each appeared to reduce hot flashes by about one per day, and Neurontin by about two per day. For women with a lot of hot flashes, that is not a very impressive performance, Dr. Nelson said, but she added that the drugs may also lessen their severity.\n\nEstrogen, by comparison, gets rid of two to three flashes a day, and also makes them milder, Dr. Nelson said. Though hormones cause small increases in the risks for breast cancer and heart disease, a short course may still be the best choice for women with very severe symptoms, she said, though she added that women who have had breast cancer should definitely not take hormones.\n\nAll the nonhormonal drugs have side effects. The antidepressants can cause headache, nausea, dry mouth, dizziness and insomnia or sleepiness. Catapres can cause some of the same symptoms and also constipation. Neurontin causes sleepiness, and soy extracts can produce gastrointestinal troubles.\n\nAmong the antidepressants, Paxil seemed to have the strongest evidence of benefit. There were only two studies for Effexor, just one of which suggested it might help.\n\nFor the other antidepressants, Prozac and Celexa, and for the plant extracts, there was no statistically significant evidence that they worked for hot flashes.\n\n\"But I wouldn't want any drug company to get an edge,\" Dr. Nelson said. \"It's just where we are today. It's not the end of the story.\"\n\nShe took a cautious view because she and her colleagues found that there was relatively little reliable data on using the drugs for hot flashes. Of 10 studies on antidepressants, for instance, the researchers judged only two of the studies to be good, and the rest fair or poor. The poor rating often meant a study, even though well conducted, was too small or too short to be conclusive.\n\n\"If there were only 20 women in the study, how do we say it's appropriate for all the women in the country?\" Dr. Nelson said.\n\n\"Now we know what we need,\" she said. \"More bigger studies on more things.\"\n\nIn the meantime, both Dr. Tice and Dr. Nelson said that for women who find their symptoms intolerable and want treatment, they would favor antidepressants over hormones. But Dr. Tice warned that the drugs should not be used long term.\n\n\"I wouldn't encourage the mindset of putting women on these drugs thinking they're going to be on them for life,\" he said, adding that patients should try the drugs for a few months and then try to stop.\n\n\"We hate to medicalize a natural process,\" Dr. Nelson said, but she added that severe symptoms should not be dismissed. \"We want to take it seriously, but not everybody needs to be on prescription drugs for it.\"", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The study was not funded by any of the drug manufacturers with medications under study in the review.

Plaque in these arteries is a red flag for a potential heart attack. (Agatston does not make any money from the coronary calcium scan.)\n\nThe other imaging test Agatston recommends is an ultrasound of the carotid artery, looking at plaque in the main blood vessel leading to the brain. Plaque in the carotid artery is a sign of increased risk for a heart attack and stroke.\n\nBoth tests are non-invasive and outpatient, although the calcium scan does expose the patient to the equivalent of several months of normal background radiation.\n\nOne large federally funded study found the coronary calcium score a better predictor of coronary events like a heart attack than the traditional Framingham Risk Score, which considers age, cigarette smoking, blood pressure, total cholesterol and HDL, the \"good\" cholesterol.\n\nAgatston thinks the coronary calcium scan should be routinely scheduled at age 50, like a colonoscopy, or earlier for people with family histories of heart disease.\n\nMost hospitals now offer the imaging tests, some at less than $100 for both, and they are often covered by insurance.\n\nCardiologists now generally use the calcium scan only for patients considered at intermediate risk for heart disease, determined by traditional measures such as cholesterol, blood pressure, lifestyle and family history.\n\nHigh-risk patients already receive such aggressive treatment as cholesterol-lowering statin medication, but many doctors don't think low-risk patients need to incur the expense or small dose of radiation that comes with a coronary calcium scan.\n\n\"There is a large group in the middle called intermediate risk, which may be as much as 50% of the population,\" said Dr. Erin Michos, a cardiologist at the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at Johns Hopkins University\n\nA good candidate for a coronary calcium scan, she says, would be a 50-year-old man with slightly elevated cholesterol and a father who had a heart attack.\n\n\"Do you put this 50-year-old who has this family history on a statin medication with potential expense (and) side effects for the next four decades of his life, or do you further refine how far at risk he is?\" she asked.\n\nA calcium score would answer that question, she says.\n\nThere's a third test Agatston likes: a $65 blood test that looks at a patient's LDL, or bad cholesterol. LDL particles come in different sizes, and patients with a lot of small-particle LDL are more likely to build up plaque in their blood vessels, Agatston says. Alternately, patients with large LDL particles do not tend to accumulate plaque.\n\n\"There are a lot of little old ladies in their 80s with very high cholesterol who have squeaky clean vessels. They have very large particles, and they don't get into the vessel wall,\" Agatston says.\n\nThese new tests give patients a chance to make major changes in their diet and lifestyle, and give doctors an opportunity to treat them with medication.\n\n\"One of the best-kept secrets in the country in medicine is the doctors who are practicing aggressive prevention are really seeing heart attacks and strokes disappear from their practices. It's doable,\" Agatston says.\n\nWatch Sanjay Gupta MD Saturday at 4:30pm and Sunday at 7:30am ET.

Migraine symptoms, which can be debilitating for many people, are the sixth leading cause of disability, according to the World Health Organization.

It's safe, easy to use and noninvasive.\n\nMULTIMEDIA ALERT: Video and audio are avaiable for download on the Mayo Clinic News Network.\n\nResearchers at Mayo Clinic and other major academic headache centers across the U.S. recently conducted the study that examined the effectiveness of using a single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation device to prevent migraine attacks.

Both analyze multiple genes in a biopsy sample and give a score for aggressiveness, similar to tests used now for certain breast and colon cancers.\n\nDoctors say tests like these have the potential to curb a major problem in cancer care \u2014 overtreatment. Prostate tumors usually grow so slowly they will never threaten a man's life, but some prove fatal and there is no reliable way now to tell which ones will. Treatment with surgery, radiation or hormone blockers isn't needed in most cases and can cause impotence or incontinence, yet most men are afraid to skip it.\n\n\"We're not giving patients enough information to make their decision,\" said Dr. Peter Carroll, chairman of urology at the University of California, San Francisco. \"You can shop for a toaster\" better than for prostate treatment, he said.\n\nA study he led of the newest test \u2014 the Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score \u2014 is set for discussion Wednesday at an American Urological Association meeting in San Diego.\n\nThe results suggest the test could triple the number of men thought to be at such low risk for aggressive disease that monitoring is a clearly safe option. Conversely, the test also suggested some tumors were more aggressive than doctors had believed.\n\nIndependent experts say such a test is desperately needed but that it's unclear how much information this one adds or whether it will be enough to persuade men with low-risk tumors to forgo treatment, and treat it only if it gets worse. Only 10 percent who are candidates for monitoring choose it now.\n\n\"The question is, what's the magnitude of difference that would change the patient's mind?\" said Dr. Bruce Roth, a cancer specialist at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nOne man may view a 15 percent chance that his tumor is aggressive as low risk \"but someone else might say, 'Oh my God, let's set the surgery up tomorrow,'\" he said. \"I don't think it's a slam dunk.\"\n\nAlso unknown: Will insurers pay for the expensive test without evidence it leads to better care or saves lives?\n\nThe newest test was developed by Genomic Health Inc., which has sold a similar one for breast cancer since 2004. Doctors at first were leery of it until studies in more groups of women proved its value, and the same may happen with the prostate test, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, the American Cancer Society's deputy chief medical officer.\n\nThe company will charge $3,820 for the prostate test and says it can save money by avoiding costlier, unnecessary treatment. Another test for assessing prostate cancer risk that came out last summer \u2014 Prolaris by Myriad Genetics Inc. \u2014 sells for $3,400.\n\nBoth companies can sell the tests without Food and Drug Administration approval under separate rules that govern lab diagnostics. Myriad Genetics has published nine studies on Prolaris involving more than 3,000 patients. Genomic Health has not published any results on the prostate test, another thing that makes doctors wary. Yet it has a track record from its breast cancer test.\n\nAbout 240,000 men in the U.S. are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year, and about half are classified as low risk using current methods. Doctors now base risk estimates on factors such as a man's age and how aggressive cells look from biopsies that give 12 to 14 tissue samples. But tumors often are spread out and vary from one spot to the other.\n\n\"Unless you can be sure your biopsy has hit the most aggressive part that's in the prostate, you can't be sure\" how accurate your risk estimate is, explained Dr. Eric Klein, chief of urology at the Cleveland Clinic, who led early development of the Oncotype prostate cancer test.\n\nFor one study, researchers used prostates removed from 440 men. They measured the activity of hundreds of genes thought to be involved in whether the cancer spread beyond the prostate or proved fatal. A second study of biopsies from 167 patients narrowed it down to 81 genes, and researchers picked 17 that seemed to predict aggressiveness no matter the location in the tumor.\n\nA third study used single needle-biopsy samples from 395 UCSF patients scheduled to have their prostates removed. The gene test accurately predicted the aggressiveness of their cancer once doctors were able to see the whole prostate after surgery.\n\nUsing one current method, 37 of the 395 men would have been called very low risk and good candidates for monitoring. Adding the gene test put 100 men into that category, said another study leader, Dr. Matthew Cooperberg of UCSF. The gene test shifted about half of the men into either a lower or a higher risk category.\n\n\"It went both ways \u2014 that was the remarkable thing. In any category of risk it added independent information compared to the standard criteria we use today,\" Carroll said. \"More work needs to be done, but, in my opinion, this is a very good start.\"\n\nHowever, Dr. Kevin McVary, chairman of urology at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine and a spokesman for the Urological Association, said the test must be validated in more men before it can be widely used.\n\n\"It's not there yet,\" he said.\n\nUCSF just got a federal grant to see how men choose treatments and whether this test might sway them.\n\n\"We throw all these numbers at them. Are they really going to make a better decision?\" Cooperberg said.\n\nDean Smith, 60, a retired marketing executive from Mill Valley, Calif., is following his doctor's advice to monitor the cancer he was diagnosed with in March. He said a gene test may have made him more comfortable with that decision.\n\nAt least six of his friends suffered side effects ranging from urinary leakage to inability to have sex after having their prostates removed.\n\n\"I would suspect that having cancer and having to live with it would be very difficult for them,\" but it doesn't bother him, Smith said. \"I will die from something other than prostate cancer, I guarantee you.\"\n\nCopyright 2013 The Associated Press.

The risk of death overall was 7% lower for women and 11% for men who took aspirin regularly, compared with those who did not. The risk of dying from cancer was 7% lower for women and 15% lower for men who took aspirin regularly, compared with those who didn't take a regular dose.\n\nThe strongest connection was with colorectal cancer: There was a 31% lower risk for women and 30% for men who were among regular aspirin takers, as other studies have showed. But it also lowered women's risk of dying from breast cancer by 11% and men's risk of dying from prostate cancer by 23%.

But the new finding indicates it could also be a valuable add-on treatment to surgery if the cancer returns.\n\nAndrogens, including testosterone, are thought to contribute to the growth and development of prostate cancer. Among men whose cancer showed signs of coming back after their prostate was surgically removed, adding a drug that blocks androgen receptors to radiation treatments halved their death rate from prostate cancer over the subsequent 12 years.\n\nThe findings should trickle down to clinical settings \u201cpretty quickly,\u201d said Dr. William Shipley, chair of the genitourinary oncology unit at Massachusetts General Hospital and one of the researchers behind the study, which was published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nProstate cancer recurrence happens in about 30 percent of patients after surgery. In these cases, radiation therapy is usually used.\n\nThe specific ADT drug used in the study, bicalutamide, has since been largely replaced by another kind of drug that decreases the amount of testosterone the body produces. The effect of the newer-generation medications, gonadotropin-releasing hormones, is similar to bicalutamide, according to other trials.\n\nAstraZeneca, which is one of the makers of bicalutamide, was a sponsor of the study, and one of Shipley\u2019s coauthors has received honoraria and grants from the company.\n\nBecause prostate cancer can progress relatively slowly, the study \u2014 which ran from 1998 to 2003 \u2014 needed an extended follow-up period to be sure of the effects, Shipley said.

The results were especially dramatic for men who had prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels above .07 ng/ml when they started the trial. (While that is a relatively low level for most men, PSA levels should be close to zero after a prostatectomy.) Men with medium-grade tumors and those who may not have had their entire cancer removed during surgery also survived significantly longer if they received the drug.\n\nHowever, See and Shipley both noted that looking at those subsets of patients was not what the study was initially designed to do, which limits the statistical power of those conclusions.

Hot flashes, one of the most common symptoms of menopause, affect an estimated 75 percent of women, most of them in their forties and fifties.\n\nIt is unclear what causes hot flashes, which range in severity from barely noticeable to embarrassingly obvious and can leave some sufferers red-faced and wrung out. In most cases they are transitory, lasting only a few months or years, but in some cases they can last a decade or more. Hot flashes typically begin in the year or so before menopause and tend to abate in the years afterward.\n\nExperts in women's health say they are one of the most common ailments for which women use alternative medicine and that interest in non-hormonal treatments has increased as a result of the WHI findings.\n\nThe study of acupuncture as a remedy for hot flashes was sparked by reports from women who had undergone the ancient Chinese therapy for other problems and reported that their hot flashes seemed to moderate.\n\nAcupuncture involves the use of hair-thin disposable metallic needles inserted into various parts of the body; treatments are supposed to be painless and are designed to correct energy imbalances.\n\nThe 2,000-year-old treatment is widely used around the world, according to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nA 1997 NIH consensus statement on acupuncture found that its success has been mixed, but some studies have found that it might be effective in blunting postoperative pain and in reducing the vomiting and nausea that often follows chemotherapy.\n\nTo prove it is effective in reducing hot flashes, the Mayo team needed to demonstrate that it was superior to sham, or placebo, treatment. That requirement has hobbled other alternative treatments, including the herb red clover and vitamin E supplements. That's because hot flashes have a high placebo-response rate: Symptoms often improve, at least temporarily, with a dummy treatment. Researchers believe this may result from the perception of patients that they are being treated with something that is likely to be effective.\n\nVincent's group recruited 103 women between the ages of 45 and 59 who reported that they had at least five hot flashes per day and were not using any other treatments for them. Half were randomly assigned to receive a series of 10 standardized acupuncture treatments -- needles were placed at the same spots in the arms, legs and lower belly; the other half received sham treatments in which needles were placed superficially near the same locations but away from so-called pressure points.\n\nResearchers knew who was receiving sham treatment, but the women, who completed questionnaires detailing the extent of their hot flashes, did not.\n\nBy the end of six weeks, there was no difference between the groups: 61 percent of the sham group was experiencing hot flashes, while 62 percent who got actual acupuncture reported them.\n\nThat doesn't surprise Adriane Fugh-Berman, associate professor in the complementary medicine program at Georgetown University School of Medicine.\n\n\"Hot flashes are one of the most placebo-responsive conditions,\" she said. Some herbs and supplements seem to work, she added, but improvement has proven to be temporary. ?", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Article cites an author of the study, another expert, and a National Institutes of Health consensus document.

But only about 1 percent of the population has an autoimmune response to gluten. Somewhere in that gap, a diet fad is thriving.\n\nThere are two groups of people who should definitely avoid gluten: those diagnosed with wheat allergies and those who have celiac disease. The latter is more common, affecting about 1 percent of the population. The former affects perhaps 0.1 percent of people and is more common in children, who often grow out of it.\n\nWhat is less clear is whether there is another group of individuals whose digestive systems have some \u201cgluten sensitivity\u201d and who would, therefore, benefit from avoiding gluten. The people who think they\u2019re sensitive to gluten are filling the gap between those who should avoid gluten and those who are doing it anyway. But how many people really are sensitive?\n\nGluten, for those of you who have not kept up with dietary fads, is a component of wheat. You eat it in bread, pasta, pizza and so on. Gluten-avoiders are helped by an increasing array of gluten-free breads, pastas and other products. Entire aisles of Whole Foods Market stores appear to be devoted to this trend.\n\nDespite the growing availability of alternative products, avoiding gluten can be a challenge. The satisfying, slightly chewy texture of bread requires gluten. For those of us who care about our health but, let\u2019s face it, like a nice baguette, it seems worth asking: Is there any actual health benefit to gluten avoidance?\n\nThe earliest report on whether gluten could muck with some digestive tracts comes from the late 1970s. Two authors reported on a woman in her early 40s who was experiencing significant \u201cgastrointestinal distress\u201d (bloating, gas, diarrhea, constipation, etc.) and did not have celiac disease or a wheat allergy. After being put on a gluten-free diet, she improved immediately. When gluten was reintroduced to her diet as a test, the symptoms returned, only to disappear when the gluten was again removed. The authors diagnosed the woman with what they termed \u201cnon-celiac gluten sensitivity\u201d (NCGS).\n\nGluten sensitivity fell off the radar for many years, but researchers have returned to it and adopted the same term. In contrast to celiac disease or a wheat allergy, NCGS is not diagnosed through direct testing. Rather, it refers to a condition in which someone experiences some problematic gastrointestinal symptoms that resolve when gluten is avoided. Gastrointestinal symptoms are the hallmark of NCGS \u2014 although some people also complain of fatigue or a foggy head.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s difficult to distinguish between someone who is sensitive to gluten and someone who is sensitive to the placebo effect. Since there is no test for gluten sensitivity, \u201cdiagnoses\u201d are based on whether people say they feel better when they avoid gluten. But the mind is a powerful thing. If you think avoiding gluten will make you feel better, there is a reasonable chance that it will \u2014 even if gluten is irrelevant.\n\nThis effect makes it hard to test for gluten sensitivities even in a randomized controlled trial. If a researcher enrolls people in a standard randomized controlled trial and has some participants eat bread and some not, those who avoid bread may feel better simply because they think they should. The placebo effect may lead a researcher to falsely conclude that avoiding bread is beneficial.\n\nBut that\u2019s not enough. To really get a sense of whether gluten sensitivity is a thing, researchers need to conduct a double-blind randomized controlled trial in which one group eats gluten, another does not, and no one knows which group they are in. That means putting everyone on a gluten-free diet and then directly supplementing some people with gluten protein and others with something that seems similar but has no gluten.\n\nThere have been two small studies like this. They were run by the same team. And, unfortunately for our ability to draw conclusions, they find different results. The first of these, published in 2011, followed 34 people for up to six weeks. The study population was made up of people who complained of gastrointestinal symptoms consistent with NCGS.\n\nEveryone participating in the study was on a gluten-free diet. Half had their diet supplemented with a regular muffin and regular bread; the other half received a gluten-free muffin and gluten-free bread. The authors found that 40 percent of patients on the entirely gluten-free diet reported a continuation of symptoms, compared with 68 percent of those who had consumed gluten. The groups also differed on such measures as \u201csatisfaction with stool consistency,\u201d a phrase that I honestly never thought I would write.\n\nThe second study, published in 2013, had a similar set up \u2014 37 people complaining of gastrointestinal problems, randomized into high-gluten, low-gluten and no-gluten groups. This time, rather than using bread and muffins, the authors used gluten and whey protein supplements. They found no difference in symptoms among the groups.\n\nWhy the results of these studies differ is unclear. One possibility is that some participants in the first study guessed which group they were in based on the muffin and bread and therefore the placebo effect became pronounced. Another possibility is simply that given how small the studies were, the differences occurred by chance. Regardless of the reason, we are left with little convincing evidence that gluten avoidance matters.\n\nBut let\u2019s say you take heart in the first of these studies and now believe that avoiding gluten will make some people feel better even though they don\u2019t have an allergy or celiac disease. How many people? Estimates of prevalence of NCGS are based, more or less, on information on gluten avoidance. In the 2009-10 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, about 0.6 percent of people without celiac disease or an allergy say their diet is gluten-free.

It is estimated that about one in every 100 people in the UK has ASD, with more boys diagnosed with the condition than girls.\n\nScientists said their research found a link between ASD and damage to proteins in blood plasma. They found the most reliable of the tests they developed was examining protein in blood plasma, which found children with ASD had higher levels of the oxidation marker dityrosine (DT) and certain sugar-modified compounds called advanced glycation end-products (AGEs).\n\nGenetic causes are thought to be responsible for about a third of cases of ASD, while the rest are believed to be caused by a combination of environmental factors, mutations, and rare genetic variants. However, researchers believe their new tests could reveal yet-to-be-identified causes of ASD.\n\nThey also confirmed the previously held belief that mutations of amino acid transporters are a genetic variant associated with ASD.\n\nThe Warwick team worked with collaborators at the University of Bologna in Italy, who recruited 38 children who had been diagnosed with ASD along with a control group of 31 other children between the ages of five and 12. Blood and urine samples were taken from the children for analysis.\n\nThe Warwick team discovered there were chemical differences between the two groups. Working with a further collaborator at the University of Birmingham, the changes in multiple compounds were combined using artificial intelligence algorithm techniques to develop a mathematical equation to distinguish between ASD and healthy controls. The outcome was a diagnostic test better than any existing method.\n\nThey said the next steps were to repeat the study with further groups of children to confirm the good diagnostic performance and to assess if the test could identify ASD at very early stages, indicate how the ASD is likely to develop further to more severe disease, and assess if treatments were working.\n\nThe research was led by Naila Rabbani, reader of experimental systems biology at the University of Warwick, who said: \u201cOur discovery could lead to earlier diagnosis and intervention. We hope the tests will also reveal new causative factors.\n\n\u201cWith further testing we may reveal specific plasma and urinary profiles \u2013 or \u2018fingerprints\u2019 \u2013 of compounds with damaging modifications. This may help us improve the diagnosis of ASD and point the way to new causes of ASD.\u201d\n\nThe research has been published in the journal Molecular Autism.\n\u2022 Note added 27 February 2018: The UK autism research charity, Autistica, provided the following comment to the Guardian: \u201cThis is a small, early-stage study which may explain one biological difference in autism. At this stage, the results presented are not strong enough to suggest that this method could be used for the diagnosis of autism. For example, we don\u2019t know whether this technique can distinguish autism from ADHD, anxiety or other similar conditions. There have been many previous attempts to develop a biological test for autism.

There are no drugs to treat the condition, which typically sets in around the age of two, and many families have tried intensive training of their children by therapists, with mixed results. Pact instead trained the parents to help their children.\n\nProf Jonathan Green at the University of Manchester, who led the study published in the Lancet medical journal, said they had not found the cure for autism, but he and his team believed it had great potential and hoped it would be widely adopted.\n\n\u201cThe advantage of this approach over a direct therapist-child intervention is that it has potential to affect the everyday life of the child,\u201d he said. \u201cOur findings are encouraging, as they represent an improvement in the core symptoms of autism previously thought very resistant to change.\n\n\u201cThis is not a cure, in the sense that the children who demonstrated improvements will still show remaining symptoms to a variable extent, but it does suggest that working with parents to interact with their children in this way can lead to improvements in symptoms over the long term.\u201d\n\nThe trial involved 152 children aged two to four. The families visited a clinic twice a week for six months, where parents were videoed with their children and a box of toys. Autistic children might not interact with their parents at all, but when eventually a child did offer a toy or made a noise that could be interpreted as a request, the incident was rerun on video and the parent encouraged to respond. If the child offered a toy, the parent reciprocated. If the child said a word, the parent repeated it and added something. The practice was repeated at home every day.\n\nThe therapy continued with the parents for the next six months with less intensity. At the end of the first year, the researchers could see the children had improved, but the most dramatic development was seen at the follow-up six years later. At the start of the trial, 50% of those in the control group who did not get the therapy and 55% of those who did were assessed as severely autistic. The children in the intervention group, though, got better. The proportion assessed as severe in the control group was 63% by the end of six years, compared with 46% in the intervention group.\n\nOther experts applauded the work. \u201cI can see why these researchers are excited,\u201d said Dorothy Bishop, professor of developmental neuropsychology at the University of Oxford. \u201cThese results at follow-up are pretty consistent in showing the benefit of this early intervention for autism across a range of measures. My impression is that this is an intervention that reduces the severity of autistic symptoms, rather than curing autism. Nevertheless, for parents of children with autism, even a modest reduction would be worthwhile.\u201d\n\nDr Max Davie, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said it offered \u201ca hugely cheering message for families\u201d, while Uta Frith, emeritus professor of cognitive development at University College London, called it \u201ca remarkably positive story, because the intervention itself was neither intensive nor invasive\u201d.\n\nThe absence of any hope, as well as the very sudden regression in children\u2019s behaviour, led many parents to believe in the discredited theory of Andrew Wakefield that the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine was the cause of autism.\n\n\u201cParents commonly tell us that they fight for a diagnosis but when they finally get it the cupboard is bare, with little information or tailored support available to them,\u201d said Dr James Cusack, director of science at the charity Autistica. \u201cToo often, parents fall victim to the false claims of charlatans who prey on desperate families. These results look promising for the many thousands of parents who want to find early interventions for their children based on solid science.\u201d\n\nThe researchers said children\u2019s communication with their parents was improved at the end of the six years. The parents said there were also improvements in relations with other children, in social communication and in repetitive behaviours. But there was no change in child anxiety, challenging behaviours or depression in the autistic children and they would still need a lot of support while growing up.\n\nAbout 1% of children and young people are affected by autistic spectrum disorder, which ranges from mild to severe.

Radical therapy, which involves surgically removing or irradiating the whole prostate, has significant long-term side effects so is only used to treat high-risk cancers.\n\nWhile radical therapy causes lifelong erectile problems and incontinence, VTP only caused short-term urinary and erectile problems which resolved within three months, the researchers said. No significant side-effects remained after two years.\n\nIn the trial, only 6 percent of patients treated with VTP needed radical therapy compared with 30 percent of patients in the control arm who were under active surveillance.\n\nThe trial involved 47 treatment sites in 10 European countries, most of which were performing VTP for the first time.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the treatment was performed so successfully by non-specialist centers in various health systems is really remarkable,\u201d Emberton said.\n\nThe VTP treatment is now being reviewed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for possible license, but it likely to be several years before it can be offered to patients more widely.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story misses the mark on two counts.

Although there is ongoing debate regarding the safety and effectiveness of vaginal laser surgery, a new study suggests that it may be effective, especially after multiple treatments. Study results are published online in Menopause, the journal of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS).\n\nCollectively known as the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), the various genital and urinary problems associated with menopause have created a market for new therapies and treatments to help women regain sexual function and bladder control. Vaginal laser surgery represents one of the newer and more hotly contested approaches.\n\nIn the case of microablative fractional CO2 laser surgery, a series of microscopic laser beams using fractionated energy penetrate the skin to remove old and damaged skin cells, intended to rebuild the vaginal pathway. In this new study, GSM symptoms were evaluated up to12 months after the last laser surgery and compared based on the number of total therapies applied (up to a total of five).\n\nThe results of this small, retrospective, non-sham-controlled study demonstrated that this type of laser surgery was particularly effective in reducing the intensity of dyspareunia (painful sex) and dryness. It further demonstrated that four or five laser therapies may be superior in lowering the intensity of GSM symptoms compared with three laser therapies in both short- and long-term follow-up. Study results are published in the article \"Microablative fractional CO2 laser for the genitourinary syndrome of menopause: up to 12-month results.\"\n\n\"This study adds to the literature on vaginal laser therapy for GSM.

Medications and psychotherapy are the primary treatments. Many older adults prefer psychotherapy to medication for the treatment of anxiety. However, older adults who live in rural areas can face a number of barriers, including living in an area where psychotherapy is not available, so alternate methods of providing treatment could increase utilization, according to the study background.\n\nGretchen A. Brenes, Ph.D., of the Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, N.C., and coauthors compared telephone-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with telephone-delivered nondirective supportive therapy (NST) in a randomized clinical trial of 141 adults 60 or older with generalized anxiety disorder. The participants (70 were assigned to telephone CBT and 71 to telephone NST) were followed up at two months and four months.\n\nTelephone CBT consisted of up to 11 sessions (nine required) and focused on, among other things, anxiety symptom recognition, cognitive restructuring, relaxation, coping statements and problem solving. Telephone NST was 10 sessions where participants discussed their feelings but no direct suggestions for coping were provided.\n\nThe clinical trial demonstrated both treatments reduced symptoms of worry, depression and GAD, but telephone CBT was superior to telephone NST and resulted in a greater reduction of symptoms.\n\nAt four month\u2019s follow-up there was greater decline in worry severity among telephone CBT participants but no significant differences in general anxiety symptoms. At four months\u2019 follow-up there also was greater decline in self-reported GAD symptoms and depressive symptoms among participants in the telephone CBT, according to the results.\n\n\u201cTelephone-delivered psychotherapy is one way to overcome some barriers to mental health treatment that rural older adults face,\u201d the study concludes.\n\nThis work was funded by a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health.

It is also the first clinical trial investigating the efficacy, tolerability and safety of intranasal-administered oxytocin in young children with autism.\n\nAutism is a group of complex brain developmental disorders characterized by impairments in social interaction, communication, and stereotypical and repetitive behaviours. The diagnosed incidence is estimated to be one in 68 children and effective interventions remain limited.\n\nBehavioural therapies can improve social, emotional and behavioural impairments but these are typically time consuming (40 hours per week), remain costly and show mixed outcomes.

The next step in the research is to understand exactly how oxytocin changes brain circuitry to improve social behavior, and to document how related treatments might be used to boost established social learning interventions.\n\nThe researchers are seeking to further develop the potential of oxytocin-based interventions within the context of good multi-disciplinary care for autism.", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The funders of the study aren\u2019t named in the release.

It\u2019s a miniature telescope implanted directly into the eye that magnifies images to more than twice their size.\n\nFindings from the clinical trials show that the telescope does improve vision for the majority of patients. Still, there are some concerns about corneal damage, since the telescope is relatively large inside the eye. And the population who might benefit from the new device is somewhat limited. The treatment doesn't work for those who have had cataract surgery. And for those who catch the disease early on, there may be better options.\n\nBut for 80-year-old Marian Orr, the implanted telescope was just what she needed. Orr has a big family: five children, eight grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. That means lots of graduations, weddings and school events. In other words, lots to see. So when Orr's vision began to decline in her mid 70s, she got worried. Both her father and uncle went blind in their 60s, and she knew macular degeneration was often inherited.\n\nOrr says her sight gradually diminished. It got to the point \"where I couldn't see. If I looked at you straight on, I couldn't see your face, could only see your head,\" she says. \"I couldn't see the eyes and the nose. I could just see the round head that was all, sort of like a halo was all over it.\"\n\nThis blurred vision is pretty typical of macular degeneration.\n\nOrr couldn't see things in a store. Her daughter took her grocery shopping. Orr couldn't identify pots, pans and dishes in her kitchen. And the outdoors became an unfamiliar, startling place.\n\nSo when Orr's cousin read about an experimental treatment for macular degeneration, Orr quickly got in touch with one of the researchers, had some basic tests, and before she knew it, she was one of more than 200 patients to have an experimental miniature telescope implanted in her eye.\n\nDr. Kathryn A. Colby, ophthalmic surgeon at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston and assistant professor of ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School, calls the pea-sized technology a true \"breakthrough\" that could help millions of patients who, until now, have had no treatment options. Colby was one of the principal investigators in the clinical trials of the miniature telescopes. They were conducted at 28 leading ophthalmic centers and included 219 patients with end-stage, age-related macular degeneration. She was not Orr's doctor.\n\nWhat happens with age-related macular degeneration is that the center of the retina deteriorates, and people gradually lose sight. Colby says if you think of the eye as an old-style camera with film, then the retina is the film. Over years of wear and tear, it degenerates and weakens and no longer transmits full images to the brain. That's why Orr saw blank spots where people's noses and eyes should be in their faces, sort of like \"holes in the film,\" says Colby.\n\nColby says that by magnifying the image, the telescope allows the part of the vision that's missing to become smaller. And so the \"blanks\" in the image appear to fill up, presenting the individual with a nearly complete image.\n\nBut, like all telescopes, when vision is narrowly focused, the peripheral view gets lost. This is why the telescope is implanted in only one eye. The other eye is used for peripheral vision.\n\nColby says that's also why patients need to learn to use the implanted telescope eye for near activities. For example, if they're looking to see what time it is on a clock, they use the eye with the implanted telescope. But if they're scanning the room to see exactly where the clock is, they use the other eye, which also has end-stage macular degeneration.\n\nAfter surgery, patients do a variety of eye exercises to train their eyes to work together. It wasn't hard for Orr, who was used to wearing contacts, one for distance and one for close-up. For her, the tiny new eye telescope has put the \"bustle\" back into her life.\n\n\"I'm very active in my church. And I am a lunch buddy at one of the schools nearby,\" she says. Orr has lunch every week with the children in the first and second grades. She reads a lot, even books with regular-sized print, which her daughter gives her. She can read the newspaper and watch TV. \"I'm busy,\" she says. \"That's for sure!\"\n\nPractically all the patients in the telescope study with Orr had their vision improve. And 75 percent of them, like Orr, had major improvement. But because the telescope is relatively large, patients risk damage to the cornea. In the study, 10 out of 219 patients had corneal problems. Five required a corneal transplant. As a result, the Food and Drug Administration plans to monitor safety for at least five years for the next set of patients who receive the telescope.\n\nDespite its terrific potential, the new eye telescope isn't for everyone. Dr. George Williams is an ophthalmologist and retinal surgeon associated with the American Academy of Ophthalmology. He sees lots of patients who might qualify for the eye telescope.\n\nBut he also sees a lot of patients who cannot be candidates. For one, the treatment doesn't work for those who have had cataract surgery.\n\n\"In order to implant this device, we need to remove the natural lens, or the cataract, and then use a portion of the natural lens to position and support the telescope,\" says Williams.\n\nCataract surgery removes the natural lens and, in most cases, replaces it with an artificial lens, which means there is no foundation for the telescope.\n\nAnd for patients who are in the early stages of macular degeneration, Williams says that medications approved just six years ago are effective and a lot less invasive than the telescope. The drugs are injected directly into the eye on a monthly basis. And with this treatment, doctors are able to prevent severe visual loss in over 90 percent of patients. In nearly half of all patients, visual improvement is significant.\n\nSo the take-home message: If you're over 60 and you begin to experience visual loss, get yourself to an eye specialist as soon as possible to see if you can be treated with medication to stabilize and even reverse the vision loss you've experienced. If that happens, Williams says, then patients may never get to the point where they need a telescope in their eye.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The bottom third of the story relies heavily, perhaps too much so, on Dr. George Williams, a retinal surgeon given the vague title of \"associated with the American Academy of Ophthalmology.\" Those quibbles aside, Williams provides some great insight and counterbalancing information.

But until now, information on the prognostic value of grip strength was limited, and mainly obtained from select high-income countries.\n\nThe current study followed 139691 adults aged between 35 and 70 years living in 17 countries from The Prospective Urban-Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study for an average (median) of four years. Grip strength was assessed using a handgrip dynamometer.\n\nThe findings show that every 5kg decline in grip strength [2] was associated with a 16% increased risk of death from any cause; a 17% greater risk of cardiovascular death; a 17% higher risk of non-cardiovascular mortality; and more modest increases in the risk of having a heart attack (7%) or a stroke (9%).\n\nThese associations persisted even after taking into account differences in other factors that can affect mortality or heart disease such as age, education level, employment status, physical activity level, and tobacco and alcohol use.\n\nA low grip strength was linked with higher death rates in people who develop cardiovascular (eg, heart attack or stroke) and non-cardiovascular diseases (eg, cancer), suggesting that muscle strength can predict the risk of death in people who develop a major illness.\n\nAccording to lead author Dr Darryl Leong from the Population Health Research Institute, Hamilton Health Sciences and McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada, \"Grip strength could be an easy and inexpensive test to assess an individual's risk of death and cardiovascular disease. Further research is needed to establish whether efforts to improve muscle strength are likely to reduce an individual's risk of death and cardiovascular disease.\" [3]\n\nWriting in a linked Comment, Professor Avan Aihie Sayer from the University of Southampton, Southampton, UK, and Professor Thomas Kirkwood from Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK discuss whether grip strength could be a new biomarker of ageing, writing that, \"This is not a new idea, but findings from PURE add support.

In this study, patients were given the drugs within 4.5 hours after the onset of a stroke, Campbell said.\n\nAlthough tenecteplase appears to be more effective for stroke patients, it's not approved for that use in the United States, according to Dr. Rohan Arora, director of stroke at Long Island Jewish Hospital in Forest Hills, N.Y.\n\nIn 2000, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved tenecteplase for use after a heart attack, Arora said.\n\n\"Tenecteplase is being widely used in developing countries, such as India,\" he said. \"One reason is it's cheaper than alteplase.\"\n\nIn the United States, tenecteplase costs about $5,800, versus alteplase, which costs $8,000, Arora said.\n\nIn addition, tenecteplase is easier to give, requiring only a single injection, while alteplase requires an injection and an IV drip, he added.\n\nArora explained that tenecteplase is not widely used in the United States for heart attack patients because these patients are typically treated with angioplasty or heart bypass surgery.\n\nFor the new study, which did not receive drug company funding, Campbell and his colleagues randomly assigned 202 stroke patients to either alteplase or tenecteplase before surgery to remove clots.\n\nThe researchers specifically looked to see which drug was better at restoring blood flow to clot-blocked blood vessels in the brain, and which drug resulted in patients having better outcomes.\n\nThe investigators found that 22 percent of the patients treated with tenecteplase had more than 50 percent of blood flow return to the brain, compared with 10 percent of those treated with alteplase.\n\nPatients treated with tenecteplase also had better functional outcomes after 90 days than those given alteplase, the findings showed.\n\nBleeding into the brain, the most serious side effect of either drug, occurred in 1 percent of patients, regardless of which drug they received, Campbell said.\n\nThe report was published April 26 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nFor more on stroke, visit the National Stroke Association.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story has one independent source.\nIt also says the study didn\u2019t receive drug company funding, which is good to know.\nHowever, some of the researchers or their institutions have accepted financial support from companies that make stroke drugs and devices as well as Stryker, a company that makes vehicles designed to quickly deliver thrombotic therapies to stroke patients.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "NICOSIA/LONDON (Reuters) - Pregnant women may soon be able to have a blood test to predict whether their babies are likely to have Down\u2019s Syndrome instead of undergoing risky, invasive tests, scientists said on Sunday.\n\nIn a study in the Nature Medicine journal researchers from Cyprus said a trial on 40 pregnancies using the test, which involves analyzing the woman\u2019s blood to detect DNA differences between the mother and the fetus, showed it accurately predicted which fetuses were at risk of developing the syndrome.\n\nPhilippos Patsalis, medical director of the Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics, who led the study, said the results were \u201cvery exciting\u201d and the test now needed to be trialed in a larger study of about 1,000 pregnancies, but could lead to changes in clinical practice within two years.\n\n\u201cWe believe we can modify this test and make it much easier and simple...

The pooch bothers me. And it turns out it has been causing back pain.\n\nSo when I hear that a fitness coach and doctor have come up with a technique that can flatten the pooch quickly and easily, I think, \"Why not?\"\n\nA few weeks later, I'm rolling out a yoga mat with a dozen other moms and pregnant women in San Francisco.\n\n\"We will see a dramatic change,\" says Leah Keller, who leads the class.\n\n\"You can easily expect to see 2 inches off your waist in three weeks of time,\" Keller says. \"That's not an unrealistic expectation.\"\n\nDecked out in purple yoga pants and leather cowboy boots, Keller is a personal trainer from New York City. She has developed an exercise that allegedly shrinks the mommy pooch.\n\nThere is science to back up the method, she says.\n\n\"A doctor at Weill Cornell and I did a study on the exact same program we're going to do,\" Keller says. \"And we found 100 percent of women achieved full resolution.\"\n\nOK! Wait a second. Two inches off my belly in three weeks? That sounds too good to be true. I decide to do a little digging into the science of mummy tummy and Keller's claim.\n\nIt turns out the jelly belly actually has a medical name: diastasis recti, which refers to a separation of the abdominal muscles.\n\nAnd it's quite common. Last year, a study from Norway reported about a third of moms end up with diastasis recti a year after giving birth.\n\n\"This is such a ubiquitous issue,\" says Dr. Geeta Sharma, an OB-GYN at Weill Cornell Medical Center-New York Presbyterian Hospital.\n\nAnd it's not just a cosmetic problem. Diastasis recti can cause another problem for new moms: lower back pain.\n\n\"People can start feeling some back pain because the core is weakened,\" Sharma says.\n\nIn rare occasions, the tissue in the abdomen isn't just stretched, but it is also torn a bit. This can cause a hernia, Sharma says.\n\n\"If there's a defect in a layer of tissue called the linea alba, then the bowel can poke through,\" Sharma says. \"That's going to be more dangerous.\"\n\nA hernia may require surgery. \"So I will refer patients to a general surgeon to have a CT scan if there's really a true concern about a hernia,\" Sharma says.\n\nDiastasis recti arises during pregnancy because the growing fetus pushes the abdominal muscles apart \u2014 specifically the rectus abdominal muscles.\n\n\"These are the muscles that give you a 'six pack,' \" says Dr. Linda Brubaker, an OB-GYN at the University of California, San Diego. \"People think these muscles go horizontal across the belly. But they actually go vertical from head to toe.\"\n\nThe rectus abdominal muscles should be right next to each other, on either side of the belly button, Brubaker says. \"There shouldn't be much of gap between them.\"\n\nBut during pregnancy, a gap opens up between the muscles, right around the belly button. Sometimes that gap closes on its own, but other times, it stays open.\n\nThat leaves a spot in the belly where there is very little muscle to hold in your stomach and other organs, a spot that can be 1 to 2 inches wide. That lets the organs and overlying tissue bulge out \u2014 and cause mommy pooch.\n\nTo flatten the area, women have to get those abdominal muscles to realign. And that is where the exercises come into play.\n\nIf you search online for ways to fix diastasis recti, you'll turn up a deluge of exercise routines, all claiming to help coax the abdominal muscles back together.\n\nBut the quality of much of that information isn't good, Brubaker says. \"Some of it is actually potentially harmful.\"\n\nEven some exercises aimed at strengthening the abdomen can exacerbate diastasis recti, says Keller, including simple crunches.\n\n\"You have to be very careful,\" she says. \"For example, please don't ever again in your life do crossover crunches or bicycle crunches. They splay your abs apart in so many ways.\"\n\nThat said, there are a few exercise programs for diastasis recti that many doctors and physical therapists support. These include the Tupler Technique, Keller's Dia Method and the MuTu System in the U.K.\n\nMost such courses, taught once a week for an hour in New York, San Francisco and at least a few other places, tend to run about four to 12 weeks and cost around $100 to $300. Some places offer online classes and videos, which are much less expensive.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also recommends abdominal exercises for the perinatal period. But the organization's guidelines don't provide details \u2014 such as which exercises work best or how often women should do them and for how long.\n\nPlus, ACOG focuses more on preventing diastasis than on fixing the problem; it recommends strengthening the abdomen before and during pregnancy.\n\n\"The best way is prevention,\" says Dr. Raul Artal, an OB-GYN at St. Louis University, who helped ACOG write its exercise guidelines for the perinatal period. \"The best way to do that is to exercise during pregnancy.\"\n\nBut, as Sharma, the Cornell OB-GYN, points out, no one has really vigorously studied these various exercises to see whether they actually fix diastasis recti.\n\n\"There's a general knowledge that exercise is going to help,\" Sharma says. \"But no one has really tested them in a standardized way.\"\n\nIn fact, the few studies that have been done haven't been high enough quality to draw conclusions, researchers in Australia said a few years ago.\n\nSharma hopes to change that. A few years ago, she teamed up with Keller to start to gather some evidence on her technique.\n\n\"We did a pilot study to see if the method is helpful for women,\" Sharma says.\n\nThe study was small \u2014 just 63 women. But the results were quite promising. After 12 weeks of doing Keller's exercise \u2014 10 minutes a day \u2014 all the women had fixed their diastasis recti, Sharma and Keller reported at ACOG's annual meeting few years ago.\n\n\"We had patients that were even one year out from giving birth, and they still had such great benefit from the exercises,\" Sharma says. \"We love to see that there is something we can do to help women.\"\n\nNow Sharma says she is working to put together a larger study to really nail down when the exercise works and how well.\n\nBack at the class in San Francisco, Keller is taking us moms through the key exercise. It's surprisingly simple to do.\n\n\"The exercise is a very small, very intense movement that's almost imperceptible,\" Keller says. \"OK. We're going to do another set.\"\n\nSitting on the floor cross-legged, with our hands on our bellies, we all take a big breath. \"Let the belly fully expand,\" Keller says.\n\nAnd then as we exhale, we suck in our belly muscles \u2014 as far back as they'll go, toward the spine. \"Now we're going to stay here near the spine. Hold this position,\" she says.\n\nThen we take tiny breaths. With each exhale, we push our stomachs back further and further.\n\nYou can do the exercise in several different positions, Keller says: sitting crossed-legged, sitting on your knees, standing with knees slightly bent, on all fours or laying on your side in the fetal position.\n\nThe key is to be sure your back is flat, and that you do the exercise 10 minutes each day, changing positions every two minutes or so. For the rest of the time, your belly is pulled all the way back into the spine.\n\n\"The fingertips on the bellybutton are really important for this reason,\" she says. \"So you know that you're squeezing tight, tighter with the belly, and you're never bulging the bellybutton forward.\"\n\nThis is our fourth week of class, and we've been doing this same exercise on our own every day for at least 10 minutes. So it's judgment day. Time to see whether we've flattened our bellies and resolved the diastasis recti.\n\nKeller pulls out a measuring tape and starts wrapping it around women's middles. She also has us lie down on the floor, so she can measure the separation in our abdominal muscles.\n\nOne by one, there is success after success. Several moms completely closed up their abdominal separations. Many lost inches from their bellies.\n\nOne woman had amazing results. \"Oh my goodness, you lost nearly four inches from your belly circumference,\" Keller exclaims. \"That's amazing!\"\n\nHow did I fare? Well, after three weeks, I didn't completely close up the abdominal separation. My separation decreased from 1.2 inches to 0.8 inches.* But I did drop more than an inch from my belly circumference.\n\nAnd I am quite happy with the results. My abs are definitely firmer. And regularly doing this exercise brought a bonus benefit: My lower back pain has almost completely gone away.\n\n*I continued to do the exercises after the class had finished. I checked with in Keller three weeks later to have her measure my diastasis recti. At that point, the separation had dropped down to 0.6 inches, which meant technically I no longer have diastasis recti.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story includes interviews with several independent experts, and we did not detect any undisclosed conflicts of interest with industry.\nHowever, the story leans heavily on the testimony of the trainer whose method is profiled and who stands to benefit from positive publicity.

As an alternative, many experts suggest something as simple as a spoonful of honey or even a small cup of flavored water, which have few side effects and seem to be effective.\n\nThe thinking is that sweet substances of any kind help soothe the back of the throat and break up mucus in the airways. Honey is also known to have antioxidant and antimicrobial properties.\n\nIn one double-blind study published in The Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, researchers recruited 105 children and teenagers who had coughs from upper-respiratory infections. The subjects were randomly divided into three groups: one that received no treatment, another that received one or two teaspoons of buckwheat honey, and a third that received a dose of honey-flavored dextromethorphan. Ultimately, the honey produced the greatest improvements when it came to better sleep and reduced cough frequency and severity.\n\nThe study was carried out by pediatricians at the Pennsylvania State University medical school and supported by a grant from the National Honey Board, an industry-backed agency of the Department of Agriculture.\n\nIn a similar study published in the journal Pediatrics in 2004, researchers recruited 100 children with upper respiratory tract infections who had been coughing for an average of over three days. The children were given a cough syrup with dextromethorphan, a cough syrup containing an antihistamine, or a placebo, which was essentially flavored water. Although children in all three groups experienced a reduction in coughing, those who received the flavored water fared the best.\n\nThe Risks: According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, honey may be useful in relieving coughing, but it should never be given to children under a year of age because in rare cases it can cause infantile botulism.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "This is such a brief summation of various studies that we don\u2019t feel this category applies.

It's a mind-controlled robotic arm that has pressure sensors in each fingertip that send signals directly to Copeland's brain.\n\nThe scientists published details of their work online Thursday in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\n\"It's a really weird sensation,\" Copeland, now 30, says in a video made shortly after he first tried the system. \"Sometimes it feels, kind of, like electrical and sometimes it's more of a pressure.\" But he also describes many of the sensations coming from his robotic hand as \"natural.\"\n\nWhen Copeland touches an object with the robotic hand, he can tell which finger the sensation is coming from and whether an object feels hard or soft, says Robert Gaunt, a bioengineer and assistant professor in the Department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\n\"But we're really not at the point where we could, say, get him to feel the difference between silk and burlap,\" Gaunt says.\n\nThe success represents an advance that is \"absolutely critical in terms of making prosthetics useful,\" says Mike McLoughlin, an engineer at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.\n\nMcLoughlin is part of a team at Hopkins that developed the Modular Prosthetic Limb that Copeland is using. The research at both Hopkins and in Pittsburgh is supported by the government's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.\n\nFor several years now, people have been able to control robotic arms using thoughts alone. But they have relied entirely on vision to know whether the arm is going in the right direction or grasping an object with the proper amount of force.\n\nThat makes it very challenging to perform simple tasks like grasping a foam coffee cup without crushing it, McLoughlin says.\n\n\"Without sensory feedback, somebody would have to actually have to look at the prosthetic, look at the cup, start to close the hand, (and) visually see the cup is starting to deform,\" he says.\n\nRestoring Copeland's sense of touch was a painstaking process, but the Pittsburgh team knew it was possible.\n\n\"His hand has been disconnected from his brain because of his spinal cord injury,\" Gaunt says. \"But the brain hasn't lost its ability to feel.\"\n\nSo the team began looking for a way to send touch sensations directly to Copeland's brain. The first step was to monitor his brain activity using a technique called magnetoencephalography.\n\n\"We were able to see the parts of his brain that became active when he was watching videos of a hand being touched,\" Gaunt says.\n\nNext, the researchers placed tiny electrodes in Copeland's brain that could stimulate the areas corresponding to each finger. Then they waited for the brain to heal, as it adjusted to the presence of the electrodes.\n\nIt was several weeks before the team was able to send the first tiny pulse of electricity to Copeland's brain. \"When it finally happened, he just very calmly said, 'Yep, I felt it on my index finger,' \" Gaunt recalls. \"But in the background I was breathing a sigh of relief and other people were cheering.\"\n\nOf course, mind-controlled robots are still years away from consumer applications, McLoughlin says. At the moment, they are still too expensive, too bulky and too finicky to be used outside a laboratory setting. And there's no good way to control them without implanting electrodes in the brain.\n\nStill, the ability to receive touch sensation from a robotic arm has the potential to help not only thousands of people who are paralyzed, but also people with a wide range of physical disabilities, McLoughlin says. For example, robots that provide sensory feedback could eventually help a disabled person cook a meal or clean up things at home.\n\n\"We're on the verge of something here that's going to transform lives,\" he says.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story did not quote anyone outside the Pittsburgh team that collaborated on this project.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Researchers at the Kennedy Institute and Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford, working with clinicians at NHS Lothian, have found that injection of the anti-TNF drug adalimumab into Dupuytren's disease nodules results in the reduction of the cell characteristics responsible for progression of Dupuytren's disease.\n\nBased on their laboratory data that tumour necrosis factor (TNF) drives the development of myofibroblasts, the cell type that causes Dupuytren's disease, the research team explored the effect of an anti-TNF drug injected directly into the Dupuytren's nodule tissue. The results so far are very promising.\n\n\"Our data have shown that a concentrated formulation of adalimumab injected directly into the diseased tissue may be effective in targeting the cells responsible for Dupuytren's disease,\" said Jagdeep Nanchahal, MD, PhD, University of Oxford Professor of Hand, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, who led the study.\n\n\"This brings new hope to people who suffer from this disabling condition, who currently have to wait for their situation to be deteriorate, watching their hand lose function until it is bad enough for surgery. And then there's the lengthy recovery ahead, a less than ideal situation to find yourself in.\"\n\nThis randomised trial (phase 2a) recruited 28 patients with Dupuytren's disease who were scheduled to have surgery in Edinburgh to remove diseased tissue in their hand. Two weeks prior to surgery they received a single injection of varying doses of the anti-TNF drug, or placebo. The tissue removed during surgery, which is usually discarded, was then analysed in the laboratory. The team found that adalimumab (at a dose of 40mg formulated in 0.4ml) reduces expression of the fibrotic markers, -smooth muscle actin (-SMA) and type I procollagen, at 2 weeks post injection, suggesting this drug could be used to stop the growth of disease causing myofibroblast cells. They also found the drug to be safe and well tolerated.\n\nThe findings are published on line in the journal EBioMedicine, published by The Lancet.\n\nDupuytren's disease is a common condition of the hand that affects 4% of the UK population and causes the fingers to curl irreversibly into the palm. There is currently no NICE approved treatment for early disease and typically people are told to return to their GP once their fingers become so bent that their hand function is impaired.\n\nThe anti-TNF drug adalimumab (Humira) is currently licensed in the EU for the treatment of a number of conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and overall has an excellent safety profile.\n\n\"We are delighted to have received further funding from the Wellcome Trust and Department of Health to test whether adalimumab will work for patients with early stage Dupuytren's disease,\" said Professor Sir Marc Feldmann, co-author and former director of the Kennedy Institute.

And not every failure is deadly.\n\nImplantable defibrillators can be as small as a half dollar and are placed surgically under the skin of the upper chest.

WSJ's health columnist Melinda Beck discusses with Kelsey Hubbard.\n\nJoint-replacement patients these days are younger and more active than ever before. More than half of all hip-replacement surgeries performed this year are expected to be on people under 65, with the same percentage projected for knee replacements by 2016. The fastest-growing group is patients 46 to 64, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgery.\n\nMany active middle-agers are wearing out their joints with marathons, triathlons, basketball and tennis and suffering osteoarthritis years earlier than previous generations. They're also determined to stay active for many more years and not let pain or disability make them sedentary.\n\nTo accommodate them, implant makers are working to build joints with longer-wearing materials, and surgeons are offering more options like partial knee replacements, hip resurfacing and minimally invasive procedures.\n\nMore younger people also need joint-replacement surgery due to obesity, and some orthopedists refer them for weight-loss surgery first to reduce complications later.\n\nEven the most fit patients face a long period of rehabilitation after surgery and may not be able to resume high-impact activities.\n\n\"There is, to be honest, some irrational exuberance out there,\" says Daniel Berry, chief of orthopedic surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and president of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. \"People may be overly optimistic about what joint replacement can do for them.\"\n\nOne big unknown: How long will the replacement joints last? In the past, many doctors assumed implants would wear out in about 10 or 15 years, and they urged young patients to put off surgery as long as possible to minimize the risk of needing a costly and difficult revision surgery\u2014or even two. (A total knee replacement typically costs $15,000 to $22,000. A revision can be $45,000 or more, with a higher risk of complications.)\n\nSteven Haas, chief of the knee service at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City, says he frequently sees young patients who are in too much pain to play with their kids, take walks, work or enjoy traveling. \"To them, the idea of being miserable in their 50s so they might not need another surgery in their 70s doesn't make much sense,\" he says.\n\nSeveral studies of hips and knees implanted in patients long ago have found that 85% to 90% are still functioning well after 20 years. Advances in wear-resistant materials may make implants being used today last even longer.\n\nFor example, many hips and knees use a combination of metal and polyethylene parts, and continuous motion can wear away small polyethylene particles. Scientists have found that irradiating the polyethylene removes free oxygen radicals that contribute to degradation, so the polyethylene components are expected to wear much longer.\n\n\"Metal-on-metal\" hip parts were supposed to wear better than plastic, but their use is declining due to concerns that they can release metal ions into patients' bloodstreams and cause soft-tissue damage. Hip implants made with \"ceramic-on-ceramic\" components have a disconcerting tendency to squeak.\n\nLast year, one manufacturer, Smith & Nephew , won clearance from the Food and Drug Administration to market its latest technology as a \"30-year knee\" based on tests mimicking 30 years of wear.\n\nStill, there are no long-term data on how any of the latest implants will fare in actual patients. \"We have to install them and see,\" says Robert Namba, an orthopedic surgeon with Kaiser Permanente in Irvine, Calif.\n\nThe biggest variable is patients themselves. As a rule, the more active they are, the faster their joints will wear out, loosen or require revision.\n\nMost orthopedic surgeons encourage patients with hip and knee implants to walk, swim and cycle as much as possible. Golf and doubles tennis are acceptable. But jogging, running, jumping and singles tennis are out. \"If your goal is a 30-year knee, you need to avoid high-impact sports,\" says John Wright, an orthopedic surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.\n\nThat said, some patients are determined to push the envelope, and some doctors give their blessing.\n\n\"If you have a brand new sports car and leave it in the garage, it will last forever and you won't have any fun,\" says Thomas Schmalzried, an orthopedic surgeon at St. Vincent Medical Center in Los Angeles. A former college basketball player, Dr. Schmalzried has patients who play competitive sports and run marathons with artificial joints. \"I know that the technology is capable of this level of athletic function. What I don't know\u2014what nobody knows\u2014is where the lines are for the average patient.\"\n\nSome doctors compromise and tell patients they can ski and surf if they were good at it before surgery, (and as long as they avoid skiing moguls).\n\n\"There's a happy medium, and it's not necessarily the same for every patient,\" says Dr. Berry. \"One might say, 'I'm willing to take a risk because that activity is important to me,' and another might not.\"\n\nPersonal quality of life issues are also important in deciding whether\u2014and when\u2014a patient is ready for joint-replacement surgery.\n\n\"It got to the point where I couldn't get on my motorcycle anymore,\" says Paul Canter, a picture framer from Los Angeles who had a double hip replacement at 63 last year.\n\nChris Schubert was kicked by a horse when she was 25, then suffered a near-fatal staph infection from a cortisone shot. Mounting pain and inflammation over the next 14 years forced her to quit recreational horseback riding, interrupted her sleep and interfered with her work as a building contractor. She had minimally invasive knee replacement surgery with Dr. Haas last year, at age 38, and her pain and limitations are gone. \"I thought my path in life was set and I'd just be miserable,\" she says. \"I never imagined my life could be this wonderful.\"\n\nPatients say that regaining function after surgery requires enormous mental and physical effort. \"Pre-hab\"\u2014building up strength before the surgery\u2014is just as important as re-hab afterward, they say.\n\n\"I was in the best shape of my life before I went in for the surgery,\" says Mr. Jeffries, the money manager, who trained twice a day for six months before his hip-resurfacing surgery in 2008.\n\nAnd staying as fit and strong as possible is also critical to joint preservation. \"I made up my mind. If I was going to go through all this surgery and rehab, I wanted to make these hips last as long as they possibly can,\" says Carol Espel, 55, an executive of Equinox Fitness who damaged both hips dancing professionally and teaching fitness for years.

In both studies, the ring lowered HIV cases by about 30%, though its effectiveness appears to be much better for women who used the ring consistently.\n\nThe ring contains an antiretroviral medication called dapivirine, which prevents HIV from making copies of itself. In the ring, the drug is used as \u201cpre-exposure prophylaxis,\u201d or PrEP, slowly leaching out in the vagina and preventing the virus from taking hold in nearby cells.\n\nOne of the new studies, published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, tested the ring in more than 2,600 women in four countries \u2014 Malawi, SouthAfrica, Uganda, and Zimbabwe \u2014 over nearly two years. At the end of the study, the group of volunteers who had used the dapivirine ring had 27% fewer HIV infections than a control group who had a placebo ring with no drug, the study found.\n\nLooking by age, the researchers saw that the ring did not seem to help women younger than 21. But among women over the age of 21 who used it, new HIV cases went down by 61%.\n\nThe other study, which has not yet been published but was presented on Monday at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections meeting in Boston, studied 2,000 women in South Africa and Uganda. Like the other study, in this one the ring had no visible effect in women younger than 21, whereas new HIV cases dropped by 37% in women over 21.\n\nThese age differences are probably due in part to how the women used the drug, the researchers say. Much like the contraceptive NuvaRing, the dapivirine ring should be kept in every day and replaced once a month for maximum effectiveness.\n\n\u201cIf used perfectly, how much HIV protection could there be? We don\u2019t know that yet,\u201d Jared Baeten, professor of global health, medicine, and epidemiology at the University of Washington and lead author on the study, told BuzzFeed News.\n\nAdherence is also a big issue for the only other PrEP on the market, a once-a-day pill called Truvada. Initial trials for the pill showed it led to a 44% decrease in HIV infection rates overall. But it\u2019s now known that, when taken properly, Truvada cuts new cases of HIV by at least 92%. Because of its high effectiveness, the CDC has since recommended that 1 in 4 gay and bisexual men should be prescribed the drug to prevent the spread of HIV.\n\nThe ring adds a new HIV prevention tool, which some experts say will be particularly useful in African countries where women are at highest risk for HIV infection. More than half of the 35 million people living with HIV worldwide are women, and the vast majority live in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\u201cA prevention tool like a ring could be used discreetly, a woman would have control over it, and it could allow her to keep herself safe from HIV without having to ask a male partner to take on prevention strategies,\u201d Baeten said. \u201cThat individual control of prevention is so powerful.\u201d\n\nThe dapivirine ring has been in development for more than a decade, and the the new studies are the first to show that it prevents HIV transmission. Still, experts caution that the ring should not be a woman\u2019s sole source of protection.\n\n\u201cThere is absolute reason to celebrate.

Antidepressant medications are one treatment option, but there are safety concerns.\n\nOne recent study, for example, found that pregnant women who started taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the second or third trimester had a higher risk of preterm delivery than other women. SSRIs include drugs like sertraline (Zoloft), paroxetine\n\nBecause of the potential for harm from medications, many pregnant women with depression may prefer psychotherapy or other non-drug options.\n\nAcupuncture has been used for more than 2,000 years in Chinese medicine to treat a wide variety of ailments. According to traditional medicine, specific acupuncture points on the skin are connected to internal pathways that conduct energy, or qi (\u201cchee\u201d), and stimulating these points with a fine needle promotes the healthy flow of qi.\n\nModern research has most often focused on the effects of acupuncture on painful conditions, like chronic back pain and migraines. Researchers speculate that it may help ease pain by altering signals among nerve cells or affecting the release of various chemicals of the central nervous system.\n\nIt is unclear, Manber said, why acupuncture might help lessen the severity of depression.\n\nFor their study, she and her colleagues randomly assigned 52 women to receive depression-specific acupuncture twice a week for four weeks, then weekly for another four weeks. Another 49 women received control acupuncture and 49 received massage. All completed a standard measure of depression severity at the outset and again after four and eight weeks of treatment.\n\nAfter eight weeks, patients in the depression-specific acupuncture group had a higher rate of response to treatment. They were not, however, more likely to see a complete remission in their depression; about 35 percent had a remission, versus 29.5 percent in the other two groups combined - a statistically insignificant difference.\n\nFourteen women who received depression-specific acupuncture reported pain during the needling, as did seven in the control-acupuncture group.\n\nOverall, Manber\u2019s team notes, the response to acupuncture in this study was comparable to what has been seen in studies of psychotherapy for depression during pregnancy.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "No independent experts were quoted in this story.\u00a0\u00a0 ", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Autism spectrum disorders , marked by impaired language, repetitive behaviors, and social difficulties, now affect up to one in 110 children, according to the CDC.\n\nThe research needs to be duplicated, Hertz-Picciotto tells WebMD.

University of Pennsylvania researchers Rebecca Ashare and Heath Schmidt saw potential for a permanent cessation solution in a class of FDA-approved medications used to improve cognitive impairments from Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn a study consisting of a rat trial and a human trial, Ashare and Schmidt studied the effects of two acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, or AChEIs, called galantamine and donepezil on overall nicotine intake. The rat component showed that pretreating the rodents with an AChEI decreased their nicotine consumption. Consistent with these effects, clinical trial participants taking the AChEI, not the placebo, smoked 2.3 fewer cigarettes daily, a 12 percent decrease, and noted feeling less satisfied with the cigarettes they did smoke.\n\n\"We're very interested in screening potential efficacy of anti-addiction medications in our models,\" said Schmidt, a professor in Penn's School of Nursing and Perelman School of Medicine. \"For this study, we looked at potential smoking-cessation medications.\"\n\nThe research itself took a translational approach, what Ashare, a professor in Penn Medicine's psychiatry department, calls bi-directional. In other words, the preclinical data informed the clinical study and vice versa.\n\nAt Penn's Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Nicotine Addiction, work on smoking cessation has been ongoing since 2001. Specifically, research from Caryn Lerman, CIRNA's director and the Mary W. Calkins Professor in Psychiatry, concluded that people who quit smoking often report a decrease in what's commonly called their executive functions.\n\n\"They feel fuzzy. They're forgetful,\" Ashare said. \"Those deficits are related to their ability to quit smoking. It was this clinical aspect of smoking cessation we thought would be useful to take further.\"\n\nThat's when they turned to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.\n\nIn the brain, the neurotransmitter called acetylcholine is important to cognitive functions like learning and short-term memory. When nicotine enters the body, it binds to the same receptors in the brain that acetylcholine binds to, resulting in smoking's rewarding and reinforcement effects. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors increase acetylcholine levels in the brain and, in effect, substitute nicotine's effects.\n\nSchmidt had successfully employed such a model with other addictive substances like cocaine. He divided a group of rats into galantamine and donepezil cohorts. To mirror voluntary drug taking in humans, the rats self-administered nicotine using a lever pushed at will. Once nicotine-taking stabilized, the rats were pretreated with one of the two AChEIs.\n\nFor both drugs, \"we were able to show a reduction in total nicotine self-administered,\" Schmidt said; however, there was a caveat.\n\n\"We know from the literature that upward of 30 percent of patients will report nausea and vomiting [when taking these drugs], and this will limit their compliance,\" he said. \"We had seen that these drugs reduced nicotine self-administration, but we wanted to make sure it wasn't because the rats were sick.\"\n\nUnlike humans who can verbally report when they don't feel well and whose bodies react to nausea, rats lack the reflex to vomit. In previous research, Matthew Hayes, who has appointments in Penn Medicine and Penn Nursing, had shown that in rats kaolin clay consumption coats the stomach like an antacid and quells any ill effects. Collaborating with Hayes, Schmidt offered the animals kaolin clay, then compared how much they ate normally and with the addition of the AChEIs.\n\n\"At the doses shown to reduce nicotine self-administration, the AChEIs did not make our animals sick,\" Schmidt said. The findings sparked the CIRNA clinical trial, which has to date studied 33 smokers ages 18 to 60.\n\nPeople who were interested in quitting smoking signed on for 23 days. For the first two weeks, they continued to smoke but also took either galantamine or a placebo. Before the trial began, researchers assessed the smokers' cognitive function to get a baseline. Participants followed the regimen for two weeks and then were asked to not smoke for one full day. Two more assessments took place: after the two weeks on the cigarette-drug combination and again after that initial smoke-free day. Finally, the researchers asked the study subjects to do their best to not smoke for seven straight days, a time during which the participants still took either galantamine or a placebo.\n\n\"That week-long period is a proxy for longer-term cessation. The ability to quit smoking the first week after you make a quit attempt is highly predictive of long-term success,\" Ashare said.\n\nShe's still actively recruiting for the trial, with an aim of 80 people total. Once the trial reaches that number, she'll dig into overall quit data. What she's learned so far -- that smokers who used the FDA-approved galantamine smoked fewer cigarettes per day and enjoyed them less -- is promising, particularly given that those who don't smoke during that first crucial week are 32 times more likely to quit smoking permanently.\n\n\"Our goal in investigating these different repurposed medications is not to replace the medications that are already available,\" she said. \"We know that they're effective. Our goal is to target different populations of smokers who may be more likely to experience these cognitive deficits.\"\n\nThere's no data to suggest that a clinician treating a smoker should prescribe one of these AChEIs now. But Ashare and Schmidt are forging a path, and, if it leads where they think it might, it could provide smokers yet another option to help them quit.\n\nAshare and Schmidt published their work in the Nature journal Translational Psychiatry.", "question": "Does the news release identify funding sources & disclose conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The release doesn\u2019t explicitly state who funded the study or if there were any conflicts of interest.

He has a great job as the creative director of an advertising firm in New York City. He enjoys spending time with his wife and kids.\n\nAnd it has all been possible, he says, because for the past six years he has been taking a drug called ketamine.\n\nBefore ketamine, James was unable to work or focus his thoughts. His mind was filled with violent images. And his mood could go from ebullient to dark in a matter of minutes.\n\nKetamine \"helped me get my life back,\" says James, who asked that we not use his last name to protect his career.\n\nKetamine was developed as a human and animal anesthetic in the 1960s. And almost from the time it reached the market it has also been used as a mind-bending party drug.\n\nBut ketamine's story took a surprising turn in 2006, when researchers at the National Institutes of Health showed that an intravenous dose could relieve severe depression in a matter of hours. Since then, doctors have prescribed ketamine \"off label\" to thousands of depressed patients who don't respond to other drugs.\n\nAnd pharmaceutical companies are testing several new ketamine-related drugs to treat depression. Johnson & Johnson expects to seek approval for its nasal spray esketamine later this year, though the approval would be limited to use in a clinical setting.\n\nMeanwhile, doctors have begun trying ketamine on patients with a wide range of psychiatric disorders other than depression. And there is now growing evidence it can help people with anxiety, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and perhaps even obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\n\"I think it's actually one of the biggest advances in psychiatry in a very long time,\" says Dr. Martin Teicher, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the Developmental Biopsychiatry Research Program at McLean Hospital.\n\nKetamine may also offer new hope for people like James who have symptoms of several different psychiatric disorders.\n\nJames had a happy childhood, he says. But his thoughts were out of control. \"I always felt like I was crossing a freeway and my thoughts were just racing past me,\" he says.\n\nHe spent much of his childhood terrified of \"an unknown, an ambiguous force out there.\" The fear was \"overwhelming,\" he says. \"I literally slept with the cover over my head with just room to breathe through my mouth until I went to college.\"\n\nAnd there was something else about James: his body temperature.\n\n\"I overheated constantly,\" he says. \"I would wear shorts all year long. In my 20s in my apartment I would sleep with the windows open in the middle of the winter.\"\n\nIn his late 20s, James saw a doctor who told him he had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. So he started taking stimulants.\n\nAt first, the pills helped him focus. Then they didn't, no matter how many he took.\n\nHe'd done well as an idea guy in the advertising industry. But now James was trying to work at home, and it wasn't going well.\n\n\"ADHD pills will make you interested in anything,\" he says. \"So I was putting the desk together and taking the desk apart. I was putting a laptop stand together and taking it apart. I was going in a massive downward spiral.\"\n\nJames had always suffered from mood swings. But now they were rapid and extreme. And he couldn't stop thinking about gruesome scenarios, like a murderer coming for his family.\n\n\"My wife took a summer off to be with me because she was scared of what was going to happen to me,\" he says. \"She would go to work for a few hours, then rush home. There would be times I'd call her just screaming, 'Please come home. I can't get through another minute.' \"\n\nEventually, James found his way to Dr. Demitri Papolos, an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.\n\n\"He was like a whirling dervish when he came into my office,\" Papolos says. \"He was extremely fearful and scanning the environment all the time and he overheated at the drop of a hat.\"\n\nPapolos diagnosed James with a variant of bipolar disorder he calls the \"fear of harm phenotype.\" It typically appears in childhood and often doesn't respond to traditional psychiatric drugs.\n\nBut Papolos has found that the condition does respond to ketamine. \"It's been transformational,\" he says.\n\nIn January, Papolos published a study of 45 children with the problem. They inhaled a nasal mist containing ketamine about twice a week. Nearly all got dramatically better.\n\nScientists still aren't sure why ketamine works, but there's evidence that it encourages the brain to rewire, to alter the connections between cells. That process has been linked to recovery from depression. And it may also explain why ketamine helps people who have symptoms associated with several different psychiatric disorders.\n\n\"I think it's having multiple effects, and that means it's probably useful for multiple different disorders,\" Teicher says.\n\nOne of those effects involves a part of the brain involved in temperature regulation. And that could explain why patients like James usually stop overheating once they are taking ketamine.\n\nJames started taking a ketamine nasal spray every other day. He says his response was dramatic.\n\n\"One day I turn to my wife and I'm like, 'I feel calm today. I don't know if it's the sun coming in, I don't know if it's just the way we're sitting here, but I feel like I could go and sit at the computer and work.' \"\n\nThe next day, James did sit down at his computer.

These compounds minimize one of the risk factors for cancer, inflammation within the body. People who have chronic inflammation because of chronic infection, autoimmune disease or conditions such as obesity have a higher cancer risk because of damage to normal cells.\n\nThe researchers first tested 142 natural compounds on mouse and human cell lines to see which inhibited prostate cancer cell growth when administered alone or in combination with another nutrient. The most promising active ingredients were then tested on model animals: ursolic acid, a waxy natural chemical found in apple peels and rosemary; curcumin, the bright yellow plant compound in turmeric; and resveratrol, a natural compound common to red grapes or berries.\n\n\"These nutrients have potential anti-cancer properties and are readily available,\" says Tiziani. \"We only need to increase concentration beyond levels found in a healthy diet for an effect on prostate cancer cells.\"\n\nThe new research paper also demonstrates how the plant-based chemicals work together. Combining ursolic acid with either curcumin or resveratrol prevents cancer cells from gobbling something that they need to grow, glutamine. This is a neat solution: blocking the uptake of a nutrient needed by prostate cancer cells with nutrients that are commonly in the human diet.\n\nFunders of this research include that National Institutes of Health and the University of Texas System.

So researchers have long sought a way to put back healthy insulin-producing cells, known as beta cells, into patients.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out a way to replace nature\u2019s solution,\u201d said Douglas Melton, co-director of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute.\n\nFor years, physicians have been using beta cells from dead donors. But because the immune system of the recipient recognizes the donor cells as foreign, patients who receive a transplant have to take immune-suppressing drugs for the rest of their lives.\n\nThose drugs are not ideal, because they carry a risk of infection or cancer. Plus, donors are in short supply and can\u2019t yield enough cells to treat the millions of people with type 1 diabetes around the world.\n\nThe researchers behind two studies published Monday demonstrated they had made progress on both fronts, encapsulating the cells in a protective bubble to shield them from the body\u2019s immune response, and creating beta cells from stem cells, which are potentially limitless.\n\nFor the capsules, the scientists homed in on alginate \u2014 a seaweed extract \u2014 as the starting material. Alginate allows sugar and insulin to flow between the cells and the body, but blocks immune cells from reaching the beta cells.\n\nThe problem with existing alginates is that the body eventually catches on to the material as a foreign substance, suffocating the implant in a layer of scar tissue. So, Daniel Anderson, a bioengineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, went in search of a better kind of alginate.\n\nIn one of two related studies published Monday, Anderson and his colleagues described in the journal Nature Biotechnology how they had tested 774 variations of alginate in rodents and monkeys and identified a handful that elicited a greatly reduced foreign body response.\n\nFor the other paper, published in Nature Medicine, the group embedded tiny capsules made from that durable alginate with beta cells derived from human embryonic stem cells. They then transplanted them into mice with a disease akin to type 1 diabetes.\n\nThe beta cells performed \u201cevery bit as good as the body\u2019s own cells,\u201d said Melton, a co-author on the Nature Medicine paper.\n\nThe transplanted cells controlled glucose levels in the mice without immune-suppressing drugs, the researchers reported. And when the scientists removed the capsules after almost six months, the cells were still cranking out insulin and there was little sign of an immune response to the capsules.\n\n\u201cFrom very early on, we were getting great success,\u201d said Arturo Vegas, a lead author of the papers who worked in Anderson\u2019s lab before moving to Boston University, where he is now an assistant chemistry professor.\n\n\u201cEverything kind of fell into place,\u201d Vegas continued. \u201cYou saw less foreign body response. The human beta cells survived exquisitely well.\u201d\n\nThe studies show \u201cyou can take stem cells and make a limitless supply of [human beta cells] and put them in a device and cure an entirely different species of animal,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nJust because the system produced strong results in mice does not mean people will respond the same way. But experts say the findings provide hope for future treatments for people.\n\n\u201cThis is really the first demonstration of the ability of these novel materials in combination with a stem-cell derived beta cell to reverse diabetes in an animal model,\u201d said Julia Greenstein, vice president of discovery research at JDRF, an organization trying to end type 1 diabetes that provided some funding for the studies. \u201cOur goal is to bring that kind of biological cure across the spectrum of type 1 diabetes.\u201d\n\nThe potential of the approach has attracted interest from both small startups and large biopharmaceutical companies that are looking at stem cell-based therapies for diabetes.\n\nOne company, San Diego-based ViaCyte, launched the first cell replacement clinical trial in 2014. Melton also recently helped start Semma Therapeutics, based in Cambridge\u2019s Kendall Square neighborhood. Semma has not begun any human clinical trials yet, but the goal is to develop a device that once implanted could control someone\u2019s blood sugar for a year or more, saving them from insulin injections and needing to check their blood sugar every few hours.\n\n\u201cThe individuals would not have to worry about that,\u201d Semma CEO Robert Millman said.\n\nOther companies pursuing stem cells treatments for diabetes include Novo Nordisk and BetaLogics, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson.\n\nMost of these other companies are taking a different approach from the work done in the studies published Monday.\n\nThe MIT team has developed tiny capsules for the cells, but ViaCyte, for example, has created a larger device outfitted with the cells that gets inserted under the skin. And whereas the Massachusetts researchers examined beta cells exclusively for their study, the ViaCyte team is exploring using less mature cells that, once implanted, differentiate into both insulin-producing beta cells and those that secrete another hormone called glucagon that\u2019s deficient in the disease.\n\n\u201cThe main issue with type 1 diabetes is a loss of beta cells,\u201d said ViaCyte CEO Paul Laikind, \u201cbut there\u2019s also good data out there to suggest dysfunction in other regulatory cell types.\u201d\n\nThe team behind the studies published Monday, meanwhile, is working on tests now in monkey models. Vegas said that if the primate studies are successful, the next step will be developing a therapy to be used in people.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve advanced the ball pretty far, almost as far you could get in an academic environment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe talk is shifting toward doing something clinically.\u201d", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "Most of the sources are connected to the study, either from the research institutions involved or the funders.

A larger part is at this point, we just don't fully understand what the genetic mechanism that leads to autism is.\"\n\nStandard practice is to offer children with autism two tests as a first-line genetic work-up: karyotype and fragile X testing, the researchers said.\n\nIn karyotyping, forms of which have been around since the 1960s, geneticists use a microscope to look for chromosomal abnormalities that are associated with autism, explained Dr. David Miller, a clinical geneticist and assistant director of the Genetics Diagnostic Laboratory at Children's Hospital Boston, which conducted the new research along with Boston's Autism Consortium.\n\nLike karyotyping, CMA also looks for chromosomal abnormalities, but does so at 100 times the resolution of the earlier test, Miller said. CMA, a genome-wide test, can identify sub-microscopic deletions of duplications of DNA sequences, called copy-number variants, known to be associated with autism, he said.\n\n\"Think of chromosomes as a library full of books and each book as a gene,\" Miller said. \"What we look for are shelves of books that have gone missing, which represent a missing fragment of a chromosome, or extra fragments of chromosome, that could contain genes related to autism.\"\n\nWhile both Children's Hospital Boston and Montefiore have offered CMA testing for several years, not all hospitals do, nor does all insurance pay for it, the researchers noted.\n\nThe main purpose of genetic testing of children with autism is to help parents determine if they're at a higher risk of having another child with autism, Marion said.\n\nIf tests pinpoint an autism-related chromosomal abnormality in the child, the parents are then offered testing. If a parent is also found to have the abnormality, geneticists conclude that the couple is at higher risk of having a child with autism. (The precise risk depends on what the variant is.)\n\nBut if the parents don't have the abnormality, geneticists conclude that the deletion or duplication happened by chance, and the parents are probably not at any greater risk of having another child with autism than the general population, Marion said.\n\nStill, there is much geneticists can't tell parents. Between 10 percent and 15 percent of autism cases can be traced to a known genetic cause, the researchers noted. Of that, CMA alone can detect 7 percent of those.\n\nThere are a few other genetic tests that can explain another few percentage points of autism cases.\n\nBut that leaves 85 percent or more families with little explanation for the disorder, Marion said.\n\n\"CMA is better, but it's not great,\" Marion said. \"The vast majority of children who have autism have no identifiable genetic markers that will help in genetic counseling for future pregnancies.

Some previous research has been limited by a number of factors, including the lack of a comparison group of obese patients who did not undergo bariatric surgery.\n\nWho and When: 8,385 obese patients in Israel who underwent bariatric surgery (laparoscopic banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy) from 2005-2014; 25,155 obese patients who received nonsurgical care for obesity management from primary care physicians that may have included dietary counseling and behavior modification.\n\nWhat (Study Measures): Bariatric surgery (exposure); death from any cause (outcome)\n\nHow (Study Design): This is a retrospective cohort study that used data from the past to compare obese patients who had bariatric surgery with those who didn't and death from any cause. The study is observational. Because researchers are not intervening for purposes of the study they cannot control for all the natural differences that could explain study findings.\n\nResults: The rate of death from any cause over about 4.5 years was lower among obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery compared with patients who managed their obesity with nonsurgical care.\n\nStudy Limitations: Imbalances caused by matching groups of obese patients for comparison based on age, sex, body mass index and diagnoses of diabetes.\n\nStudy Conclusions: The association between bariatric surgery and a lower rate of death from any cause adds to the limited literature describing the beneficial outcomes of these surgical procedures for obese patients.\n\nThe following related elements from this issue of JAMA are also available on the For The Media website:\n\n-- Effect of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy vs Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass on Weight Loss at 5 Years Among Patients With Morbid Obesity\n\n-- Effect of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy vs Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass on Weight Loss in Patients With Morbid Obesity\n\n-- Lifestyle Intervention and Medical Management With vs Without Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and Control of Hemoglobin A , LDL Cholesterol, and Systolic Blood Pressure at 5 Years in the Diabetes Surgery Study\n\n-- Association of Bariatric Surgery vs Medical Obesity Treatment With Long-term Medical Complications and Obesity-Related Comorbidities\n\n-- Editorial: Comparing the Outcomes of Sleeve Gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass for Severe Obesity\n\nFor more details and to read the full study, please visit the For The Media website.\n\nPlease see the article for additional information, including other authors, author contributions and affiliations, financial disclosures, funding and support, etc.\n\nWant to embed a link to this report in your story?

With increased mitochondria, the treated mice were able to burn off more fat and thus avoid weight gain and decreased sensitivity to insulin, Dr. Auwerx said. He found that their muscle fibers had been remodeled by the drug into the type more prevalent in trained human athletes.\n\nDr. Ronald M. Evans, a leading expert on the hormonal control of metabolism at the Salk Institute, said that the report by Dr. Auwerx\u2019s team had \u201cshown very convincingly that resveratrol improves mitochondrial function\u201d and fends off metabolic disease.\n\nDr. Evans described the study as \u201cvery important, because it is rare that we identify orally active molecules, especially natural molecules, that have such a broad-based, positive effect on a problem as widespread in society as metabolic disease.\u201d\n\nDr. Ronald Kahn, director of the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, said the research would focus attention on the sirtuins, a recently discovered group of enzymes that resveratrol is believed to affect. Noting that he is a scientific advisor to Sirtris, a company developing drugs that activate the sirtuins, Dr. Kahn said, \u201cCertainly, drugs that act on this class of proteins have the potential to have major effects on human disease.\u201d\n\nDr. Auwerx\u2019s study complements one published earlier this month by Dr. David Sinclair of the Harvard Medical School, who found that much more moderate doses of resveratrol protected mice from the metabolic effects of a high-calorie diet. Though his mice did not lose weight, they lived far longer than undosed mice that were fed the same high-calorie diet.\n\nThe two studies were started and performed independently, Dr. Auwerx said, though he obtained supplies of resveratrol from Sirtris, which was co-founded by Dr. Sinclair, and he has become a scientific advisor to the company.\n\nA drug that prolongs life, averts degenerative disease and, on top of all that, makes you into a champion athlete \u2014 at least if you are a mouse \u2014 sounds almost too good to be true.\n\nDr. Christoph Westphal, Sirtris\u2019s chief executive, replied to this objection with a question: \u201cIs it too good to be true that when you are young you get no disease?\u201d\n\nHe believes that activation of the sirtuins is what keeps the body healthy in youth, but that these enzymes become less powerful with age, exposing the body to degenerative disease. That is the process that he says is reversed by resveratrol and, he hopes, by the more powerful sirtuin-activator drugs that his company is developing, though many years of clinical trials will still be needed to demonstrate whether they work and are safe to use.\n\nThe developing buzz over sirtuin activators has captivated some scientists who do research on the aging process, several of whom are already taking resveratrol themselves. Dr. Sinclair has said that he has been swallowing resveratrol capsules for three years, and that his parents and half his lab staff do the same.\n\nSo does Dr. Tomas Prolla at the University of Wisconsin. \u201cThe fact that investigators in the field are taking it is a good sign there is something there,\u201d he said.\n\nBut many others believe taking the drug now is premature, including Dr. Leonard Guarente of M.I.T. whose 15-year study of the sirtuins laid the basis for the field of study. It was after working in Dr. Guarente\u2019s lab as a postdoctoral student that Dr. Sinclair found in 2003 that resveratrol was a sirtuin activator.\n\nThough resveratrol has long been known to be a component red wine and other foods, it is present there in only minuscule amounts, compared with the very large doses used in experiments. Dr. Sinclair dosed his mice daily with 22 milligrams of resveratrol for each kilogram of weight, and Dr. Auwerx used up to 400 milligrams. No one could drink enough red wine to obtain such doses.\n\nResveratrol is now available in capsules that contain extracts of red wine and giant knotweed, a plant found in China. One manufacturer of such capsules is Longevinex, whose president, Bill Sardi, said today that demand for the product had increased by a factor of 2400 since Nov. 1. But even Longevinex\u2019s capsules, which at present contain 40 milligrams of resveratrol each, would have to be gulped in almost impossible quantities for a human to obtain doses equivalent to those used in mice. \u201cIt\u2019s like eating a whole bottle of Tums every day,\u201d Dr. Evans said.\n\nWhether much lower doses would benefit athletic performance is not clear, Dr. Evans said. And higher doses may not be as safe as the lower doses found now in foods and \u201cnutraceuticals\u201d like the extract capsules.\n\nBesides these uncertainties over what a safe and effective dose of resveratrol might be, the science underlying the field is still in full flux. Many central details are still unclear. The principal theory developed by Dr. Guarente and others is that the sirtuins somehow sense the level of energy expenditure in living cells and switch the body\u2019s resources from reproduction to tissue maintenance when food is low.\n\nThis is an ancient strategy, Dr. Guarente believes, that allows an organism to live through famines and postpone breeding until good times return. The switch to tissue maintenance involves specific action to stave off the major degenerative diseases of aging, such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease and neurodegeneration.\n\nThough resveratrol is in the spotlight, the central focus of researchers is on how the sirtuins are activated and what they do. One serious uncertainty is whether, in the mouse experiments, resverattrol in fact acted through the sirtuins or by some other unknown mechanism. In the latter case, Dr. Sinclair\u2019s and Dr. Auwerx\u2019s mouse experiments would offer less support to the sirtuin theory.\n\nDr. Auwerx cites evidence that resveratrol does activate sirtuin, but Dr. Evans said the case was not yet fully convincing.\n\nDr. Bruce Spiegelman, a Harvard Medical School expert on fat metabolism, said Dr. Auwerx\u2019s paper was \u201cpretty good.\u201d Dr. Auwerx believes resveratrol activates sirtuin, which in turn activates a factor known as PGC1-alpha in a manner first described by Dr. Spiegelman and his colleagues last year. Subsequent actions by PGC1-alpha then stimulate cells to produce more mitochondria.\n\nIncreased energy production by mitochondria generates potentially dangerous reactive chemicals that are known to damage cells. So it has long been puzzling that exercise, in which energy is expended, is good for health, not bad.\n\nDr. Auwerx noted that Dr. Spiegelman showed in a report in the journal Cell last month that PGC1-alpha not only increases mitochondria, but at the same time generates chemicals that detoxify the energy by-products.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "While the story quoted several scientists not directly associated with the particular studies or companies mentioned, there was no balance to the perspectives represented.\u00a0 The story would have been greatly imporved if it had included some serious comment about the ramifcations of the scientific observations reported.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "The requested URL /2011-08-30/business/29945941_1_mark-kris-cancer-cases-lung was not found on this server.", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "\n\n\nWhile the story notes the conflicts of some sources, it appears that all the experts quoted were participants in a conference call arranged by Pfizer.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Doctors-in-training face long, stressful hours, sleepless nights and a high risk of depression and suicidal thoughts, but often are too stoic and time-starved to seek help. A study suggests online self-help behavior therapy could be a solution.\n\nSuicidal thoughts were much less common in new doctors who had four half-hour online sessions before starting their first year of training, compared with those who got no therapy.\n\nThe research involved about 200 medical interns \u2014 residents in their first post-graduate year, which is often one of the most intense periods of doctor training. It often involves 80-hour weeks and overnight hospital shifts dealing with multiple medical crises.\n\nAn earlier study of 740 interns found that suicidal thoughts increased almost four-fold during the first three months of residency, said Dr. Constance Guille of the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston. Her research group led both studies.\n\nSarah Dalechek, a first-year psychiatry resident at that university, said her program requires two month-long rotations of 16-hour overnight shifts in an emergency room. She said she became very depressed but had little time to seek help.\n\n\"It's very stressful because you're sleep-deprived, you're not eating right ... you're working back-to-back shifts and you're trying to catch up on sleep but you can't,\" Dalechek said. She was not involved in the study.\n\nDalechek said she looked into seeing a therapist but would have preferred a web-based program since it's confidential and requires no appointment. Luckily, her depression subsided when that rotation ended.\n\nGuille said offering web-based therapy routinely to medical residents could be beneficial, if her research results are confirmed in a broader study.\n\nThe results were published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry.\n\nThe study involved interns at Yale University and the University of Southern California. It used a free online program developed at the National Institute for Mental Health Research at the Australian National University in Canberra. Interns who got the sessions were 40 percent less likely to have suicidal thoughts during that first year compared to those who received four weekly emails with information about depressions and where to seek help.\n\nThe online program included sessions about how to put feelings of stress or despair into perspective. For example, a poor test grade or bad performance evaluation might lead to feelings of \"I'm not good enough,\" but the lessons encourage more positive thinking about \"how many exams have you passed, to put this failure in a more accurate light,\" Guille said.\n\nThe training also encourages seeking out activities or thoughts that bring pleasure, especially when feeling down.\n\nPrevious research has shown benefits from similar web-based therapy in other settings.\n\nGuille said medical students and residents tend to be high-achieving perfectionists, but that they need to learn \"you can't always be perfect in medicine, you have to figure out how to deal with failure.\"", "question": "Does the story use independent sources and identify conflicts of interest?", "explanation": "The story provides comments from a psychiatry resident not affiliated with the study who offers an important view from the inside.With that being said, we wish the story had included the views of an expert in the field, commenting specifically on the intervention that\u2019s the basis for the story.", "answer": 1}]
