[{"article": "Eating tomatoes in your daily salad or regularly enjoying a healthy red sauce on your spaghetti could help reduce your risk of stroke, according to research published this week in the journal Neurology.\n\nTomatoes contain a powerful antioxidant that is good for brain health, the researchers say, and cooked tomatoes seem to offer more protection than raw.\n\n\"This study adds to the evidence that a diet high in fruits and vegetables is associated with a lower risk of stroke,\" says study author Jouni Karppi, of the University of Eastern Finland in Kuopio. \"A diet containing tomatoes... a few times a week would be good for our health. However, daily intake of tomatoes may give better protection.\" \n\n \n\n Karppi says it's the chemical lycopene that gives tomatoes and other fruits/vegetables their rich red color, that is helping to protect the brain. Tomatoes are particularly high in the powerful antioxidant that acts like a sponge, soaking up rogue molecules called free radicals that if left unchecked can damage cells.\n\nResearchers tested the level of lycopene in the blood of more than 1,000 Finnish men aged 46 to 65, starting in 1991. Scientists then followed the men on average for more than a decade to record the number who had strokes.\n\nThe scientists found that those with the highest levels of lycopene were 55% less likely to have a stroke than those with the lowest amounts in their blood.\n\nThough the study looks promising, experts say that we can't necessarily give all of the credit to lycopene.\n\n\"It's a compelling study and it fits with other data that we have about risk of stroke and vegetable and fruit consumption,\" explains Dr. Daniel Labovitz, director of the Stern Stroke Center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York. \"But it's not proof that if you eat tomatoes you're going to have less risk of stroke.\"\n\nLabovitz also points out that the group of men who had fewer strokes were younger, had lower blood pressure and smoked less than the group more prone to stroke. Though the researchers tried to take these lifestyle factors into account when calculating their findings, it may be that these things influenced the outcomes.\n\nIn other words, perhaps better health habits - not necessarily just the lycopene - lead to fewer strokes.\n\nLycopene has attracted a lot of attention in recent years because it's such a powerful antioxidant. If we don't eat enough lycopene-packed foods, experts suspect too many free radicals get left in the body, damaging blood vessels by helping to form fatty deposits. When these deposits build up, a blockage forms. If that vessel is in the brain, the blockage can cause a stroke.\n\nBut the foods we eat are complex and filled with many nutrients, making it tough to prove what is really providing benefits.\n\n\"Eating tomatoes is a good thing, but we don't know if there is really anything unique about tomatoes apart from other fruits and vegetables that reduce stroke risk,\" explains Dr. Walter Willett, chair of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nTomatoes could contribute to reducing stroke in other ways, Willett says, because they are a good source of potassium, which is known to reduce blood pressure. Elevated blood pressure is major risk factor for stroke.\n\nSo are lycopene packed tomatoes really the magic fruit? It seems the jury is still out, but researchers suggest we eat healthy as they continue to search for answers.\n\n\"This is one more reason to consume fruits and vegetables - at least 5 a day - and it's good to include tomatoes in that mix,\" Willett said.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "There is enough independent perspective in this piece that we can be sure it wasn\u2019t based on a press release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Two highly effective contraceptives\u2014the intrauterine device (IUD) and the implant\u2014actually last much longer than they are currently recommended, according to new research.\n\nIn a new study published in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology, researchers discovered that the hormonal IUD and the implant are highly effective a year after they are currently approved for use.\n\nMORE: The IUD Answer: Why The Best Form of Birth Control is the One No One Uses\n\nThe researchers followed 237 women who were using an implant like Implanon and Nexplanon and 263 women using the Mirena hormonal IUD. The implants are currently approved for three years, and the hormonal IUD used in the study is approved for five. (There is also a non-hormonal IUD that is approved for 12 years, but it was not included in the current study.)\n\nAll the women were between the ages of 18 and 45 and their contraceptives were within six months of expiring before they enrolled in the study.

Still, the failure rate was similar to the failure rate of the IUD when used during the five-year period (which is under 1%).

The longer use also makes the IUD and implant more convenient for women, since maintenance is reduced.\n\nThough the data is preliminary, the researchers say they believe that the hormonal IUD and the implant can both be used for an additional year longer than the FDA recommends.

Olive oil is a key ingredient in the so-called Mediterranean diet. And some clinical trials have suggested that the diet helps control risk factors for heart disease, like high blood pressure, abdominal obesity and elevated levels of \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol.\n\nHigh olive oil intake is also linked to a lower risk of heart attack, and a longer lifespan among heart attack survivors. These latest findings support the general advice that people replace dubious dietary fats \u2014 namely, saturated fats and \u201ctrans\u201d fats \u2014 with olive oil and other unsaturated fats, according to an expert not involved in the study. But he also stressed that the study does not prove that olive oil, per se, helps prevent strokes.\n\n\u201cWe need to remember that this is an observational study,\u201d said Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, a neurologist at Columbia University Medical Center in New York who wrote an editorial published with the study.\n\nThe study found a correlation between people\u2019s olive oil use and their stroke risk, he told Reuters Health \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into cause-and-effect.\n\n\u201cPeople who use a lot of olive oil may be very different from people who don\u2019t,\u201d Scarmeas said.\n\nOlive oil users may, for example, have higher incomes, eat better overall or exercise more often than people who never use the oil. The researchers on the new study, led by C\u00e9cilia Samieri of the French national research institute INSERM, tried to account for those differences. And after they did, olive oil was still linked to a lower stroke risk.\n\nBut it\u2019s impossible to fully account for all those variables, Scarmeas noted. What\u2019s needed, he said, are clinical trials where people are randomly assigned to use olive oil or not, then followed over time to see who suffers a stroke. Such clinical trials are considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d of medical evidence.\n\nThe current study included 7,625 French adults age 65 and older who reported on their diets and other lifestyle factors. People who said they used olive oil for both cooking and as a dressing were considered \u201cintensive users.\u201d\n\nOver the next five to six years, those intensive users suffered strokes at a rate of 0.3 percent per year. That compared with just over 0.5 percent among non-users, and 0.4 percent among moderate users.\n\nWhen the researchers factored in other diet habits, exercise levels and major risk factors for stroke \u2014 like high blood pressure and diabetes \u2014 heavy olive oil use was tied to 41 percent reduction in the odds of stroke.\n\nSamieri\u2019s team also took blood samples from another 1,245 older adults, measuring their levels of oleic acid \u2014 a monounsaturated fat that accounts for most of the fatty acids in olive oil. The one-third of participants with the highest oleic acid levels were 73 percent less likely to suffer a stroke than the one-third with the lowest levels.\n\nThe findings, according to Scarmeas, argue for more research into olive oil\u2019s potential benefits against not only heart disease, but stroke and other neurological diseases as well.\n\nFor now, he suggested that people choose olive oil and other unsaturated fats over saturated fats (found largely in meat and dairy) and trans fats (found in some processed foods, like crackers, cookies and chips).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to rely on this type of fat for your overall health,\u201d Scarmeas said.\n\nThat said, no single food is consumed in isolation, he points out in his editorial. Olive oil is one part of the Mediterranean diet that has been tied to heart benefits. The diet also boasts plenty of fruits and vegetables, legumes, whole grains, fish and moderate amounts of red wine.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "It\u2019s clear the story did not rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Human Genome Sciences, based in Rockville, Md., is sharing development and marketing rights to the drug with GlaxoSmithKline.

The disease, which primarily affects women of child-bearing age, can cause rashes, arthritis, mouth sores, kidney damage and other problems.\n\nOne recent study estimated that 322,000 Americans definitely or probably have systemic lupus erythematosus, the most common form of the disease and the one against which Benlysta was tested. The Lupus Foundation of America estimates that 1.5 million Americans have some form of lupus.\n\nBecause the disease\u2019s symptoms wax and wane on their own and vary considerably from one patient to another, it has been hard to demonstrate the efficacy of drugs in clinical trials.\n\nAmong the companies that have had setbacks or outright failures in clinical trials are Roche and Biogen Idec with their drug Rituxan; La Jolla Pharmaceutical with Riquent; Bristol-Myers Squibb with Orencia; ZymoGenetics and Merck Serono with atacicept; Genelabs Technologies with Prestara; Teva Pharmaceutical Industries with edratide; and Aspreva Pharmaceuticals and Roche with CellCept.\n\nBenlysta, which was previously called Lymphostat-B and is known generically as belimumab, also failed in its Phase 2, or midstage, trial.\n\nBut Human Genome Sciences, in consultation with the Food and Drug Administration, restricted the Phase 3 trials to a subset of patients who seemed to respond better to the drug in the earlier trial. It also changed the measurement of success and lengthened the trial to give the drug more time to work.\n\n\u201cWe knew the drug was safe and biologically active,\u201d H.

Steroids can cause severe weight gain, acne and the weakening of bones, among other side effects.\n\n\u201cI think it looks good,\u201d Dr. Merrill said. \u201cAnd we are in a field where we haven\u2019t even had anything fair.\u201d\n\nBenlysta, which is given by infusion once every four weeks, inhibits the action of a protein in the body called B-lymphocyte stimulator, which helps B cells in the blood respond to infections. The company said high levels of the protein might spur the immune system to attach the body\u2019s own tissues.\n\nHuman Genome, a pioneer in studying human genes, discovered the gene for the stimulator protein.

Statins include widely used medications such as Crestor, Lipitor and Zocor.\n\n\"For high-risk people, those with heart disease or [who] have had a stroke who are taking a standard dose of a statin, further reduction in LDL cholesterol will give them extra benefit,\" said Dr. Colin Baigent of the Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit at University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, who was involved in both studies. This applied even if the patients already had low levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or \"bad\") cholesterol, he noted.\n\nThe reports are published in the Nov. 9 online edition of The Lancet.\n\nIn the first study, researchers at Oxford and the University of Sydney in Australia collected data from studies on 170,000 patients who took part in 26 trials. This type of review, called a meta-analysis, gathers data from various studies to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nAmong these trials, five compared high doses of statins with regular doses and the other 21 studies compared people taking statins with people not taking the drugs.\n\nThe researchers found that in trials comparing statin doses, taking high-dose statins reduced the odds of having a stroke by an additional 15 percent, compared to the usual doses of statins.\n\nSpecifically, there was a 13 percent reduction in heart-related death or heart attack, a 19 percent reduction in the need for a new heart operation and a 16 percent reduction in stroke, the researchers found.\n\nWhen they did an updated analysis of the 21 trials, first major cardiovascular events (such as heart attack and stroke) were lowered by a \"highly significant\" 22 percent for a 1.07 millimole per liter (mmol/L) reduction of LDL cholesterol.\n\nTaking all 26 trials together, deaths were reduced by 10 percent for 1 mmol/L in reduction of LDL cholesterol, with no significant effect on deaths from stroke or other vascular causes.\n\nIn addition, there were no significant effects of statins on deaths due to cancer or other non-vascular causes, and no excess risk of cancer, even at low LDL cholesterol concentrations.\n\nThe second study is a randomized trial called the Study of the Effectiveness of Additional Reductions in Cholesterol and Homocysteine (SEARCH), led by professor Jane Armitage, also a scientist at the CTSU in Oxford.\n\nThis trial looked at the benefits of statin therapy with 80 milligrams (mg) versus 20 mg simvastatin (Zocor) among 12,000 heart attack survivors.\n\nThe study was supported by a grant from Merck (manufacturer of the simvastatin).\n\nOver almost seven years of follow-up, those taking the higher dose statin had greater reductions in LDL cholesterol compared with those taking the lower dose.\n\nThe reduction in LDL cholesterol from the higher dose ended up decreasing the risk of a major cardiac event by 6 percent, the researchers found, although the statistic in itself was not clinically significant.\n\nThe researchers noted that the higher dose of Zocor (simvastatin) did result in a risk of a muscle disease 10 times higher than that associated with the lower dose. The muscle disease, known as myopathy, can cause pain, weakness, and in its rare but most severe form, destruction of the muscle tissue leading to kidney failure. Researchers found that two cases of myopathy occurred with the low dose and 53 cases with the higher dose.\n\nResearchers also found that rhabdomyolysis -- the most severe form of the muscle disease associated with statins -- was diagnosed in seven participants given 80 mg of Zocor (simvastatin), compared to none who were given 20 mg of simvastatin. Two died within a few weeks of developing the disorder, with one cause of death mentioning the muscle disorder as a contributing factor.\n\nResearchers also found that seven participants had creatine kinase levels higher than 40 times the upper limit of normal -- a possible indicator of kidney damage. For this reason, they noted that the incidence of severe muscle disease on 80 mg of Zocor might be an \"underestimate.\"\n\nBaigent noted this side effect is one associated with Zocor, but taking lower doses of other, more powerful statins may alleviate the problem. \"There are newer ways of increasing LDL cholesterol reduction by using the newer, more potent statins such a Lipitor or Crestor,\" he said. (All statins carry the risk of myopathy, but lower dosages are associated with a reduced risk.)\n\nBernard M.Y. Cheung, from the University of Hong Kong and coauthor of an accompanying journal editorial, said that \"people who are at risk from heart attacks and strokes should have their LDL-cholesterol lowered intensively.\"\n\nTheir doctors should consider prescribing a statin, either at a high dose or using a more powerful statin, he said.\n\n\"If you are at risk from a heart attack or stroke, either because you have had these conditions before or because you have the risk factors for them, you should be considered for intensive treatment to lower the LDL cholesterol,\" Cheung said.\n\n\"If your blood cholesterol is raised but you do not have other risk factors for heart disease and stroke, then your doctor may well decide that you do not need to take any drugs to lower cholesterol,\" he said. \"But if you are at risk from those diseases, you would need intensive treatment to lower LDL cholesterol, even if your LDL cholesterol level is not very high,\" he added.\n\nCommenting on the studies, Dr. Gregg Fonarow, American Heart Association spokesman and professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that \"despite the proven benefits of LDL cholesterol-lowering with statin therapy, many physicians have been reluctant to prescribe and patients reluctant to take higher doses of more potent statin medications due to concerns about side effects or safety.\"\n\nLowering LDL cholesterol by 50 to 60 percent with potent statins such as atorvastatin at 80 mg or rosuvastatin at 20 to 40 mg lowers the risk of major cardiovascular events by 50 to 60 percent, he said.\n\n\"Most patients tolerate higher doses of more potent statins equally well as lower doses of less potent statins,\" Fonarow said. \"Millions of patients with or at high risk of cardiovascular disease, who would derive additional cardiovascular protection from higher doses of more potent statins, are not currently treated with these agents. But [they] should be.\"\n\nFor more information on statins, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not appear to rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A new, non-invasive knee procedure could bring some relief for patients suffering from debilitating chronic pain, for whom surgery is not an option.\n\nThe treatment, recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, is called \u201ccooled radio frequency ablation\u201d and is a less drastic option for people with moderate to severe osteoarthritis pain who are not ready to have knee replacement surgery, or who have health conditions that don\u2019t make them a good candidate for surgery.\n\nMarketed as \"Coolief\", the procedure uses radio frequency to target and mute the nerves responsible for sending pain signals from the arthritic knee to the brain.

According to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, nearly 10 million Americans had osteoarthritis of the knee in 2010.\n\nThe three current recommended approaches for knee arthritis pain are physical therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and naproxen, or the opioid painkiller tramadol.\n\nBut those didn't help Felicia McCloden, a 65-year-old grandmother from outside of Chicago. The excruciating pain in her right knee made simple tasks like grocery shopping impossible.\n\n\u201cI had inflammation, swelling, and my knee was like the size of a golf ball, McCloden told NBC News. \"The arthritis was so bad that I could barely step down without severe pain.\u201d\n\nBecause she wasn\u2019t eligible for a knee replacement she tried cortisone injections, physical therapy, medications \u2014 nothing relieved her pain.\n\n\"I thought I was going to limp for the rest of my life,\" she said.\n\nRelated: What Really Helps Knee Pain?

Breast cancer afflicts 1 in 8 women in their lifetime and 1 in 25 die from this disease. Although a number of randomized trials demonstrate the clear benefits of mammography screening in women up to age 74 on reducing mortality, data are sparse in women over the age of 74, especially minorities. In 2010, 41 percent of breast cancer deaths occurred in the more than 19 million women who are between the ages of 65 to 84 years.\n\nIn a new study published in the American Journal of Medicine, Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., senior author and first Sir Richard Doll Professor and senior academic advisor to the dean in the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine at Florida Atlantic University, indicates that black and white women ages 75 to 84 years who had an annual mammogram had lower 10-year breast cancer mortality than corresponding women who had biennial or no/irregular mammograms.\n\nAmong elder women, the American Cancer Society and the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommend regular mammography for ages 65 to 74.\n\nAlthough many guidelines rely on self-reports, Hennekens and his collaborators from Baylor College of Medicine and Meharry Medical College, used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program file linked to the Medicare administrative claims file, which allowed them to identify screening mammography use from 1995 to 2009 from 64,384 non-Hispanic women (4,886 black and 59,498 white). These linked files also permitted them to explore breast cancer mortality differences between elderly black or white women who self-selected for regular annual or biennial mammography screening. The researchers selected 69 as the lower age limit because Medicare coverage of the general population begins at age 65, and the exposure of interest was regular mammography screening in the four years immediately preceding breast cancer diagnosis.\n\nThree mutually exclusive categories were defined: no or irregular mammography; biennial mammography; and annual mammography. They looked at data from non-Hispanic, white or black women; Hispanics were not included because Hispanic white women have substantially lower mortality than non-Hispanic whites, and the number of Hispanic blacks is small. The researchers also measured socioeconomic status looking at median household income, the percentage of individuals living below the poverty level, and whether or not they had a high school education.\n\u2022 White women who had died tended to be older, to have a later stage diagnosis, to have received chemotherapy, and to have a higher socioeconomic status.\n\u2022 White women who died were less likely to have undergone surgery and receive radiation therapy.\n\u2022 Similar characteristics were seen in black women as in white women.\n\u2022 69- to 84-year-old women receiving regular annual screening mammography during the four years immediately preceding breast cancer diagnosis had consistently lower five-year and 10-year risks of breast cancer mortality than women with no or irregular screening regardless of race.\n\u2022 10-year risks were more than three times higher among white and more than two times higher among blacks aged 69 to 84 years with no or irregular screening compared with annual screening.\n\nHennekens notes that further research is needed, but that in the future, the use of regular claims-based surveillance for mammography as a source of data may offer some unique advantages over self-reports.\n\nFrom 1995 to 2005, according to Science Watch, Hennekens was the third most widely cited medical researcher in the world and five of the top 20 were his former fellows and/or trainees.

Of about 150 patients, the group that got radiofrequency treatment immediately had more people who felt better.\n\nAlmost everyone suffering from back pain says something like, \"I want to feel better, I want to play golf again, or I want to be able to play baseball with my grandkids,\" anesthesiologist and lead author Steve P. Cohen tells Shots. Patients don't care much about the finer points of diagnostic accuracy. They just want relief.\n\nBut some pain experts defend the value of the diagnostic tests. Dr. Nikolai Bogdu at the Newcastle Bone & Joint Institute in Australia told Reuters that further cost analysis is needed to account for millions of patients who might not get pain relief from the radiofrequency treatment.\n\nThe study's suggestion on how to manage back pain also runs counter to current guidelines from major medical groups. The American Chronic Pain Association for example says that a block test determines who should get radiofrequency treatment.\n\nCohen, who serves as a colonel in the U.S. Army Reserves, tell us he's seen immediate treatment work on soldiers, who need to quickly return to their posts, so there's no reason why skipping straight to radiofrequency treatment shouldn't also work on civilian patients.\n\nDoctors may not change their approach anytime soon, however.

The retrospective study was led by researchers at Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation, University of Arizona, Medical College of Wisconsin, University of Miami, Essentia Health, Stanford University and University of Southern California.\n\n\"Research points to this as a pathway to regulate and prevent this most common cause of blindness in adults,\" said Murray Brilliant, Ph.D., director, Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation Center for Human Genetics, Marshfield, Wisconsin. \"Imagine telling patients we potentially have medication that will allow them to see and continue enjoying life, their family and perform every day activities as they age. That is very powerful.\"\n\nAMD, the No. 1 cause of legal blindness in adults over 60, is a progressive eye condition affecting as many as one in three adults. The disease attacks the macula of the eye, where the sharpest central vision occurs, causing central blindness. This vision is used to drive, read, recognize faces and perform daily tasks. AMD spares the peripheral vision, leaving dim images or black holes at the center of vision.\n\nL-DOPA is a natural by-product of pigmentation and is made in a layer of cells in the back of the eye that functions to promote health and survival of retinal tissues. Researchers asked the question if people taking L-DOPA as a medicine are protected from AMD.\n\n\"The obvious question was if the L-DOPA no longer produced was supplemented via pill form, does it have the potential to serve as a preventive medicine against AMD,\" Brilliant said. \"We need more research, but this first step is promising.\"\n\nThis work grew out of research using albino mouse models. Mice, as well as humans who have albinism or lack of pigmentation, have profound vision loss and changes in the eye structure , especially the macula, the oval-shaped area near the center of the retina associated with a person's ability to see clearly.\n\nRace and ocular pigmentation are known risk factors for developing AMD, indicating darker pigmentation may protect from the disease as it occurs much, much more frequently in the white population than black or Hispanic populations. This led to the hypothesis that those with darker pigmentation may have greater L-DOPA signaling in the RPE.\n\nTo test this, researchers examined health records of 37,000 Marshfield Clinic patients looking for those with AMD, those taking L-DOPA and those with both L-DOPA and AMD. They then determined the age patients developed AMD.\n\nAccording to national statistics, the average age at which individuals are given L-DOPA is 67; the average age of AMD diagnosis is 71. In those people who got L-DOPA before being diagnosed with AMD, their AMD diagnosis occurred eight years later than those without L-DOPA.\n\nThese provocative results were then confirmed in a much larger data set of 87 million patients where similar results were observed and the study expanded to include prevention and delay of \"wet\" AMD, the most devastating form of the disease.\n\nIn all the groups examined, data suggests L-DOPA may prevent or delay AMD.\n\n\"This study suggests an intriguing link between patients taking L-DOPA and a lower incidence and delayed onset of AMD,\" said Paul A. Sieving, M.D., Ph.D., director of the National Eye Institute. \"Showing that L-DOPA causes this protective effect will require further investigation, but if confirmed, could lead to new drugs or combination therapies for AMD that target DOPA-responsive cells in the retina.\"\n\nThe next step in this research is to perform a clinical trial to determine the ability of this drug to prevent AMD.\n\n\"Results suggest a new path forward in our fight against AMD that may even include a strategy to prevent those at risk of the disease from ever developing it,\" said Brian McKay, Ph.D., associate professor, Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Science, University of Arizona. \"In the end, L-DOPA may not be the drug that ends the disease but the pathway identified is likely to be a key observation as the search for a cure continues.\"\n\nThis research, titled \"Mining Retrospective Data for Virtual Prospective Drug Repurposing: L-DOPA and Age-related Macular Degeneration,\" was supported by National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Human Genome Research Institute, Research to Prevent Blindness, Bright Focus Foundation, The Edward N. & Della L.

Three years after receiving two administrations of the bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine four weeks apart, all members of a group of adults with longstanding type 1 diabetes showed an improvement in HbA1c to near normal levels - improvement that persisted for the following five years. The study from a Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) research team - published in npj Vaccines - also reports that the effects of BCG vaccine on blood sugar control appear to depend on a totally novel metabolic mechanism that increases cellular consumption of glucose.\n\n\"This is clinical validation of the potential to stably lower blood sugars to near normal levels with a safe vaccine, even in patients with longstanding disease,\" says Denise Faustman, MD, PhD, director of the MGH Immunobiology Laboratory , principal investigator of BCG clinical trials at MGH and senior author of the npj Vaccines report. \"In addition to the clinical outcomes, we now have a clear understanding of the mechanisms through which limited BCG vaccine doses can make permanent, beneficial changes to the immune system and lower blood sugars in type 1 diabetes.\"\n\nFaustman will also present five-year follow-up results of a separate group of BCG clinical trial participants with longstanding type 1 diabetes on Saturday, June 23, at the 78th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association in Orlando.\n\nUsed for almost a century to prevent tuberculosis, BCG has been known for more than 30 years to boost production of a cytokine called tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which may be beneficial in autoimmune diseases both by eliminating the autoreactive T cells that attack an individual's tissues - in the case of type 1 diabetes, pancreatic islets - and by inducing production of regulatory T cells (Tregs) that could prevent an autoimmune reaction. Faustman's team first reported in 2001 that inducing TNF production could cure type 1 diabetes in mice, but since TNF dosing is toxic in humans, clinical trials have utilized BCG for its ability to elevate TNF levels safely.\n\nInitial clinical trial results, published in a 2012 PLOS One paper, reported that two doses of BCG spaced four weeks apart led to reductions in autoreactive T cells, an increase in Tregs and what turned out to be a transient increase in insulin production. But by the end of that short, 20-week trial, there was no reduction in HbA1c, the established measure of blood sugar levels over time. An extension and expansion of that trial with long term follow-up, the current results are based on data from 282 human study participants - 52 with type 1 diabetes who participated in the BCG clinical trials and 230 who contributed blood samples for mechanistic studies.\n\nRegular monitoring of clinical trial participants found that HbA1c levels of those receiving BCG had dropped by more than 10 percent at three years after treatment and by more than 18 percent at four years. That reduction was maintained over the next four years, with treated participants having an average HbA1c of 6.65, close to the 6.5 considered the threshold for diabetes diagnosis, and with no reports of severe hypoglycemia. Participants in the placebo group and in a comparison group of patients receiving no treatment experienced consistent HbA1c elevations over the same eight-year time period.\n\nIn investigating how BCG administration produces its beneficial effects, the research team identified a mechanism never previously seen in humans in response to treatment with any drug - a shifting of the process of glucose metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation, the most common pathway by which cells convert glucose into energy, to aerobic glycolysis, a process that involves significantly greater glucose consumption by cells. The researchers also found that BCG could reduce blood sugar elevations in mice that were caused by means other than autoimmune attack, raising the possibility that BCG vaccines could also be beneficial against type 2 diabetes.\n\nMihai G. Netea, PhD, professor in the Department of Internal Medicine at Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, says of this study, \"The clinical effects and the proposed mechanism demonstrated are exciting and add to the emerging consensus that the BCG vaccine can have a lasting and valuable impact on the immune system. We know, and this study shows, that BCG vaccination induces epigenetic reprogramming at the chromatin architecture level and functional alterations indicative of a permanent change in immunity. The MGH trials and other, larger prevention and intervention trials underway around the globe may lead to a major shift in the prevention and treatment of infections and autoimmunity.\" Netea was not involved in the current study.\n\nThe MGH team's findings set the stage for further testing of BCG administration, including the FDA-approved phase 2 study currently underway, testing multiple BCG doses in a large group of participants with longstanding type 1 diabetes. That trial is fully enrolled, and there are seven additional BCG clinical trial groups currently recruiting or enrolling at MGH, with a pediatric trial in the planning stages.

The researchers found other fruits such as apples and pears were not associated with a decreased risk.\n\nTo study the relationship between berry consumption and heart disease, Cassidy and her collaborators at the Harvard School of Public Health analyzed findings from the Nurses Health Study 2 which includes more than 90,000 nurses in the U.S. Periodically over the past 18 years the nurses have reported details about their diets and lifestyles to researchers. At the same time, researchers have monitored the nurses' health to see which diseases they go on to develop, or not.\n\nIt's certainly not a perfect way to detect how certain foods may influence health, but it identifies important associations. Cassidy says the association between berry consumption and heart disease was strengthened when she and her collaborators controlled for other reasons that could have explained the finding.\n\n\"Even when we adjusted for things like fat intake, fiber intake, medication use, or body size, and for example, exercise, we still got these strong reductions in risk,\" Cassidy says.\n\nSo what's in blueberries that makes them so good for us? Researchers have pinpointed a class of plant compounds known as anthocyanins. These compounds give the red and blue color to everything from berries to eggplants to cherries. And when you eat a steady diet of them, they seem to have a number of positive health effects.\n\n\"They have effects on blood pressure in animal models,\" says Cassidy. And in lab experiments they're shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects, as well as help modulate nitric oxide in the body, which could help arteries stay more elastic and flexible.\n\nAll of these effects could be beneficial, explains Robert Eckel, a preventive cardiologist at the University of Colorado. But he says it's important to point out that the women in this study weren't prime candidates for heart attacks anyway.\n\n\"Having a heart attack when you're a woman between ages of 45 and 60 is distinctly unusual,\" says Eckel.\n\nWould the protective effect hold up for older women? Eckel says it's not clear.\n\n\"But nonetheless, for the first time I think we have some evidence that the intake of theses anthocyanins may have a protective effect.\"\n\nSo, go ahead.

In contrast, of study participants who were assigned to a wait-list for therapy, none showed a similar decline in pain.\n\nFibromyalgia is a syndrome marked by widespread pain \u2014 including discomfort at specific \u201ctender points\u201d in the body \u2014 along with symptoms such as fatigue, irritable bowel and sleep problems. It is estimated to affect up to 5 million U.S. adults, most commonly middle-aged women.\n\nThe precise cause of fibromyalgia is unknown \u2014 there are no physical signs, such as inflammation and tissue damage in the painful area \u2014 but some researchers believe the disorder involves problems in how the brain processes pain signals.\n\nStandard treatments include painkillers, antidepressants, cognitive- behavioral therapy and exercise therapy. However, many people with fibromyalgia find that their symptoms \u2014 pain, in particular \u2014 persist despite treatment.\n\nPart of that, according to the researchers on the new study, may be because standard treatments do not specifically address the role psychological stress and emotions can play in triggering people\u2019s pain.\n\nThat is not to say that the pain people with fibromyalgia feel is \u201call in their head,\u201d stressed Dr. Howard Schubiner, of St. John Health/ Providence Hospital and Medical Centers in Southfield, Michigan.\n\n\u201cThe pain is very real,\u201d Schubiner said in an interview. But, he explained, pain and emotions are \u201cconnected in the brain,\u201d and emotional factors may act to trigger \u201clearned nerve pathways\u201d that give rise to pain.\n\nPast studies have found that compared with people without fibromyalgia, those with the disorder have higher rates of stressful life events, such as childhood abuse, marital problems and high levels of job stress. There is also evidence that they are relatively less aware of their own emotions and more reluctant to express their feelings, particularly anger.\n\nFor the new study, published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, Schubiner and his colleagues tested the effects of affective self-awareness \u2014 a technique Schubiner developed and uses in treating certain chronic-pain conditions \u2014 on fibromyalgia.\n\nThey randomly assigned 45 women with the condition to either undergo the therapy or go on a wait-list for treatment, serving as a control group. Women in the treatment group each had a one-on-one consultation, then attended three group meetings to learn the affective self-awareness techniques so that they could carry them out on their own.\n\nThe therapy involves an educational component where patients learn about the emotion-pain connection. They learn specific techniques \u2014 including mindfulness meditation and \u201cexpressive\u201d writing \u2014 for recognizing and dealing with the emotions that may be contributing to their pain. Patients are also encouraged to get back to any exercise or other activities that they have been avoiding due to pain.\n\nSchubiner\u2019s team found that six months later, 46 percent of the treatment group had at least a 30-percent reduction in their pain ratings compared with scores at the outset. And 21 percent had a 50-percent or greater reduction.\n\nNone of the women in the control group had a comparable improvement.\n\nThe study is only the first clinical trial to test affective self-awareness for fibromyalgia, and it had a number of limitations, including its small size. In addition, the control group received no active therapy to serve as a comparison.\n\nThat is important because it is possible for patients to benefit from simply receiving attention from a healthcare provider, or being part of small-group sessions with other people suffering from the same condition, for example.\n\nSchubiner also acknowledged that this general \u201cmodel\u201d for understanding and addressing fibromyalgia pain is controversial.\n\nHe said that he and his colleagues have applied for funding to conduct a larger clinical trial comparing affective self-awareness with standard cognitive-behavioral therapy.\n\nAffective self-awareness and cognitive-behavioral therapy have similarities, according to Schubiner. Both, for example, try to show patients that they have the power to improve their own health.\n\nA key difference, Schubiner said, is that affective self-awareness asks people to \u201cdirectly engage\u201d the emotions that may be helping to drive their symptoms.\n\nAnother difference is that, right now, only a small number of healthcare providers practice affective self-awareness, according to Schubiner.\n\nSome components of the technique, such as teachings in mindfulness meditation, are more widely available.

But the first to reach an infant born by cesarean section come mostly from the environment \u2014 particularly bacteria from inaccessible or less-scrubbed areas like lamps and walls, and skin cells from everyone else in the delivery room.\n\nThat difference, some experts believe, could influence a child\u2019s lifelong health. Now, in the first study of its kind, researchers on Monday confirmed that a mother\u2019s beneficial microbes can be transferred, at least partially, from her vagina to her baby after a C-section.\n\nThe small proof-of-principle study suggests a new way to inoculate babies, said Dr. Maria Gloria Dominguez-Bello, an associate professor of medicine at New York University and lead author of the report, published on Monday in Nature Medicine.\n\n\u201cThe study is extremely important,\u201d said Dr. Jack Gilbert, a microbial ecologist at Argonne National Laboratory who did not take part in the work. \u201cJust understanding that it\u2019s possible is exciting.\u201d\n\nBut it will take further studies following C-section babies for many years to know to what degree, if any, the method protects them from immune and metabolic problems, he said.\n\nSome epidemiological studies have suggested that C-section babies may have an elevated risk for developing immune and metabolic disorders, including Type 1 diabetes, allergies, asthma and obesity.\n\nScientists have theorized that these children may be missing key bacteria known to play a large role in shaping the immune system from the moment of birth onward. To replace these microbes, some parents have turned to a novel procedure called vaginal microbial transfer.\n\nA mother\u2019s vaginal fluids \u2014 loaded with one such essential bacterium, lactobacillus, that helps digest human milk \u2014 are collected before surgery and swabbed all over the infant a minute or two after birth.\n\nAn infant\u2019s first exposure to microbes may educate the early immune system to recognize friend from foe, Dr. Dominguez-Bello said.\n\nFriendly bacteria, like lactobacilli, are tolerated as being like oneself. Those from hospital ventilation vents or the like may be perceived as enemies and be attacked.\n\nThese early microbial interactions may help set up an immune system that recognizes \u201cself\u201d from \u201cnon-self\u201d for the rest of a person\u2019s life, Dr. Dominguez-Bello said.\n\nIn the United States, about one in three babies are delivered by C-section, a rate that has risen dramatically in recent decades. Some hospitals perform the surgery on nearly seven in ten women delivering babies.\n\nAn ideal C-section rate for low-risk births should be no more than 15 percent, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nDr. Dominguez-Bello\u2019s study involved 18 babies born at the University of Puerto Rico hospital in San Juan, where she recently worked. Seven were born vaginally and 11 by elective C-section. Of the latter, four were swabbed with the mother\u2019s vaginal microbes and seven were not.\n\nMicrobes were collected on a folded sterile piece of gauze that was dipped in a saline solution and inserted into each mother\u2019s vagina for one hour before surgery. As the operations began, the gauze was pulled out and placed in a sterile collector.\n\nOne to two minutes after the babies were delivered and put under a neonatal lamp, researchers swabbed each infant\u2019s lips, face, chest, arms, legs, back, genitals and anal region with the damp gauze. The procedure took 15 seconds.\n\nDr. Dominguez-Bello and her colleagues then tracked the composition of microbes by taking more than 1,500 oral, skin and anal samples from the newborns, as well as vaginal samples from the mothers, over the first month after birth.\n\nFor the first few days, ambient skin bacteria from the delivery room predominated in the mouths and on the skin of C-section babies who were not swabbed, Dr. Dominguez-Bello said.\n\nBut in terms of their bacterial colonies, the infants swabbed with the microbes closely resembled vaginally delivered babies, she found, especially in the first week of life. They were all covered with lactobacilli.\n\nGut bacteria in both C-section groups, however, were less abundant than that found in the vaginally delivered babies.\n\nAnal samples from the swabbed group, oddly, contained the highest abundance of bacteria usually found in the mouth.\n\nThe results show the complexity of labor, said Dr. Alexander Khoruts, a microbial expert and associate professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota. \u201cIt cannot be simplified to a neat, effortless passage of the infant through the birth canal,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the month progressed, the oral and skin microbes of all infants began to resemble normal adult patterns, Dr. Dominguez-Bello said. But fecal bacteria did not, probably because of breast or formula feeding and the absence of solid foods.\n\nThe transfer fell short of full vaginal birth-like colonization for two reasons, Dr. Dominguez-Bello said. Compared to infants who spent time squeezed inside the birth canal, those who were swabbed got less exposure to their mother\u2019s microbes.\n\nAnd all infants delivered by C-section were exposed to antibiotics, which also may have reduced the number and variety of bacteria colonizing them.\n\nA larger study of vaginal microbial transfer is underway at N.Y.U., Dr. Dominguez-Bello said. Eighty-four mothers have participated so far.\n\nInfants delivered both by C-section and vaginally will be followed for one year to look for differences in the treated and untreated groups and to look for complications. Thus far the swabbing has proved entirely safe.\n\nThe procedure is not yet recommended by professional medical societies, said Dr. Sara Brubaker, a specialist in maternal and fetal medicine at N.Y.U. Until more is known, physicians are hesitant to participate.\n\n\u201cBut it has hit the lay press,\u201d she said. \u201cPatients come in and ask for it. They are doing it themselves.\u201d\n\nDr. Brubaker is one of them. When her daughter was born three and a half months ago, she arranged to have her baby swabbed.\n\u2022 Let Me Tell You About My Big Baby\n\nFor more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The article clearly goes beyond the news release.\n\u00a0", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Community screening for osteoporosis could prevent more than a quarter of hip fractures in older women, according to new research.\n\nA new study, published in The Lancet, has shown that a simple questionnaire, combined with bone mineral density measurements for some, would help identify those at risk of hip fracture.\n\nThe research, involving more than 12,000 older women and carried out in collaboration between the universities of Birmingham, East Anglia, Bristol, Leicester, York and Sheffield, found that screening through GP practices allowed patients to be targeted for treatment. In women agreeing to participate, this led to a 28 per cent reduction in hip fractures over five years.\n\nProfessor Neil Gittoes, of the University of Birmingham's Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, said: \"Our findings showed that screening led to a statistically significant decrease in hip fractures. \"Our data has the potential to influence national policies around prevention of hip fractures, which is particularly relevant in our ageing society. The consequences of hip fractures to older people can be devastating, including impaired mobility and loss of independence. \"While we have demonstrated clinical effectiveness of screening, we are also exploring cost-effectiveness of this approach; initial analyses also look promising in this respect.\"\n\nProfessor Lee Shepstone, from UEA's Norwich Medical School, said: \"Approximately one in three women and one in five men aged over 50 year will suffer a fragility fracture during their remaining lifetime. In the UK around 536,000 people suffer fragility fractures each year, including 79,000 hip fractures.\n\n\"A hip fracture can be devastating with a loss of independence and less than one third of patients make a full recovery. Mortality at one-year post-fracture is approximately 20 per cent.\"\n\n\"We wanted to find out whether screening, like screening for breast cancer, could help identify those at risk of suffering a fracture.\"\n\nThe team used a University of Sheffield developed tool called FRAX, which predicts the probability of a hip fracture or a major osteoporotic fracture (a hip, spine, upper arm or lower arm fracture), to identify older women at high risk.\n\nA total of 12,483 women aged 70-85 were recruited from 100 GP practices in seven regions -Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester, Norwich, Sheffield, Southampton, and York. Half of the women were screened to compare screening with routine care.\n\nAmong those screened, treatment was subsequently recommended for one in seven women deemed at high risk of hip fracture. This recommendation was acted upon by the women and their GPs so that over three quarters of the women at high risk were on osteoporosis medications within six months of screening.\n\nWhile screening did not reduce the incidence of all osteoporosis-related fractures, there was strong evidence for a reduction in hip fractures.\n\nIn the screening group, there were 54 fewer women who suffered one or more hip fractures compared to the routine care group.\n\nThe study suggests that one hip fracture could be prevented for every 111 women screened and early analysis suggests the approach is likely to be cost-effective.\n\nProfessor Shepstone added: \"This is the first trial to show that a community-screening approach based on the FRAX fracture risk tool is both feasible and effective. Given that the number of costly and debilitating hip fractures are expected to increase with an ageing population, the results of this study potentially have important public health implications.\"\n\nProfessor Eugene McCloskey, of the University of Sheffield, said: \"Low-cost screening with FRAX among the older population could result in effective, targeted intervention to reduce the human and socioeconomic burden of hip fractures.\n\n\"If the SCOOP screening strategy was taken up in exactly the same way as in the study in all UK women aged 70-85 years, we estimate that the strategy could prevent up to 8000 hip fractures per year in the UK. Even greater gains could be made if we could reach out to women similar to those who did not take part in the study.\"\n\nThe randomised controlled trial 'SCreening for Osteoporosis in Older women for the Prevention of fracture' (SCOOP) was funded by the Medical Research Council and Arthritis Research UK.\n\nDr Natalie Carter, head of research liaison and evaluation at Arthritis Research UK, said: \"Ten of thousands of people a year present with hip fractures in the UK.

The outcome was excellent, but the recovery was long and horrible. The orthopedist wouldn\u2019t let me drive for six weeks, or run, swim or lift weights for three months. I suffered through weeks of torturous physical therapy. It was nearly six months before I felt normal again.\n\nSo in 2014, after a nurse improperly administered a vaccination that resulted in chronic pain and an MRI revealed another rotator-cuff tear, I vowed I would not go through shoulder surgery (or its aftermath) again.\n\nCortisone injections and physical therapy didn\u2019t help, so I decided to try something else: platelet-rich plasma, a therapy that uses the body\u2019s natural healing properties to mend injuries. Its practitioners believe it will transform orthopedics. Based on my experience with it, I think they are right.\n\nIt may not work for every condition, or for everyone. But it worked for me.\n\n[PRP therapy is popular for sports injuries, but does it work?]\n\nBefore undergoing PRP treatment, I read quite a bit about it, learning that it holds promise for healing soft-tissue injuries such as tearing of the rotator cuff (the group of tendons and muscles that provide stability to the shoulder), tennis elbow, plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendinitis, patella tendinitis and hamstring tears; it may even provide relief for mild to moderate osteoarthritis.\n\n\u201c[PRP] works, and the results have been amazing,\u2019\u2019 says John Ferrell, the sports medicine physician who treated me. \u201cThere still needs to be more research done to perfect the process, but [it] will change the way orthopedics is practiced in the future. We will be more preventive. We will be able to treat ailments noninvasively, and at an earlier stage.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe procedure involves collecting several ounces of blood from a patient\u2019s arm, spinning the blood in a centrifuge to concentrate the platelets and injecting the concentrated platelets into the injury site to stimulate healing. Platelets, the blood cells that promote clotting, contain hundreds of proteins, called growth factors, that are important in repairing injuries.\n\n\u201cPRP works by acting like a stem-cell magnet,\u2019\u2019 says Ferrell, who practices at Regenerative Orthopedics & Sports Medicine, which has several offices in the Washington area. \u201cIt releases growth factors that signal stem cells to come [and] help regenerate the injured area. Rotator-cuff tendon partial tears are notorious for not healing because of the poor blood supply there. PRP actually creates new blood vessels that feed the tendon the proper nutrients it needs to heal.\u2019\u2019\n\nA recent pilot study conducted at the Glen Sather Sports Medicine Clinic at the University of Alberta on rotator-cuff tears supports this. It showed tissue healing in five of seven of the patients who received PRP, as well as improvements in their pain and function.\n\nThe researchers call the results \u201cclinically relevant,\u2019\u2019 despite the study\u2019s small size, and say the next step should be a larger, controlled clinical trial. \u201cI\u2019ve heard some skeptics call PRP a cure looking for a disease, but it is being used in so many areas of medicine now with promising outcomes,\u201d says Marni Wesner, a sports medicine physician at the clinic and one of the study\u2019s authors. \u201cThe potential for benefit from PRP is real.\u2019\u2019\n\nI had my first appointment with Ferrell last October to find out whether PRP might help me. By then, my painful shoulder had been keeping me up nights for more than a year. It bothered me while swimming and lifting weights, and while getting dressed. By performing several tests to assess my strength and range of motion, Ferrell discovered that my left shoulder \u2014 the site of the tear \u2014 was considerably weaker than my right.\n\nHe then used ultrasound to find the tear and showed it to me on a monitor. It turned out to be larger than indicated in the static MRI pictures I had obtained earlier.\n\nBefore deciding whether PRP was right for me, he had to be sure that the tear was the source of my pain and weakness. He injected an anesthetic into the tear, then he ran the strength tests again. My strength was significantly better. This meant that the tear was causing my problems, and fixing it probably would restore strength and function to my shoulder and end my pain.\n\nI had the first PRP injection on Oct. 23. It was painful, and the aching persisted for about 36 hours. I had one bad night, followed by an uncomfortable day. After that, the pain stopped. Still, Ferrell advised me to baby the shoulder \u2014 to use my other arm when holding a dog leash and to skip swimming and weights for two weeks. Running was fine. He also recommended physical therapy after two weeks.\n\nAfter what I went through in 2008, those were restrictions I could live with.\n\nFerrell told me not to use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, such as ibuprofen, for a week after the injection because the goal is to encourage, not stifle, inflammation. Other pain relievers such as acetaminophen were okay. \u201cWe want to stimulate an acute inflammatory reaction, which will trigger the healing cascade to start to work,\u2019\u2019 Ferrell says.\n\nBecause there is not yet enough research on PRP \u2014 and because some studies have shown mixed results \u2014 insurance will not cover it.\n\nStill, \u201cit has significant cost savings\u201d compared with surgery, Ferrell says. The average treatment is two injections, which costs about $1,000 at his practice, whereas rotator-cuff surgery runs about $13,000, he says, although insurance often covers most of the costs of surgery.\n\nWith additional research, insurance may ultimately pay for PRP. Unfortunately, there is little financial incentive to conduct such studies because there is nothing for the Food and Drug Administration to approve, such as a drug or device. The centrifuges already are licensed, and the procedure uses a patient\u2019s own blood, which is regarded as safe. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons \u2014 which says PRP \u201cholds great promise\u2019\u2019 \u2014 describes the risk as minimal.\n\nThose who seek this treatment must look for a clinician with considerable PRP experience \u2014 someone who does the procedure several times a day, not once or twice a month \u2014 and who has a good success rate, Ferrell says.\n\nMoreover, \u201cyou see the greatest results when the injections are done under direct visualization with ultrasound,\u201d he adds.\n\nBy February, the ultrasound showed my tear to be about 80 percent healed. The remaining tear was quite small. Ferrell recommended a second injection to finish the job.\n\nI had it on March 4.\n\nWhen I returned to see him on April 12, I was feeling pretty good. No pain, no problems. He rolled in the ultrasound machine, and I was not surprised by the results. The tear was completely gone.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "This story does not rely on a news release.\n\u00a0", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Microcapsules loaded with stem cell-derived insulin-producing cells retrieved after they had been transplanted into a mouse.\n\nKendall Squared brings you dispatches from the world\u2019s epicenter for biotechnology and drug discovery.\n\nScientists on Monday showed they had overcome some of the major hurdles standing in the way of a long-sought therapeutic fix for patients with type 1 diabetes, outlining an approach that the body\u2019s immune system could tolerate and providing a possible pathway toward clinical trials in the next few years.\n\nIn people with type 1 diabetes, formerly known as juvenile-onset diabetes, the immune system dismantles the pancreatic cells that normally produce insulin. So researchers have long sought a way to put back healthy insulin-producing cells, known as beta cells, into patients.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out a way to replace nature\u2019s solution,\u201d said Douglas Melton, co-director of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute.\n\nFor years, physicians have been using beta cells from dead donors. But because the immune system of the recipient recognizes the donor cells as foreign, patients who receive a transplant have to take immune-suppressing drugs for the rest of their lives.\n\nThose drugs are not ideal, because they carry a risk of infection or cancer. Plus, donors are in short supply and can\u2019t yield enough cells to treat the millions of people with type 1 diabetes around the world.\n\nThe researchers behind two studies published Monday demonstrated they had made progress on both fronts, encapsulating the cells in a protective bubble to shield them from the body\u2019s immune response, and creating beta cells from stem cells, which are potentially limitless.\n\nFor the capsules, the scientists homed in on alginate \u2014 a seaweed extract \u2014 as the starting material. Alginate allows sugar and insulin to flow between the cells and the body, but blocks immune cells from reaching the beta cells.\n\nThe problem with existing alginates is that the body eventually catches on to the material as a foreign substance, suffocating the implant in a layer of scar tissue. So, Daniel Anderson, a bioengineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, went in search of a better kind of alginate.\n\nIn one of two related studies published Monday, Anderson and his colleagues described in the journal Nature Biotechnology how they had tested 774 variations of alginate in rodents and monkeys and identified a handful that elicited a greatly reduced foreign body response.\n\nFor the other paper, published in Nature Medicine, the group embedded tiny capsules made from that durable alginate with beta cells derived from human embryonic stem cells. They then transplanted them into mice with a disease akin to type 1 diabetes.\n\nThe beta cells performed \u201cevery bit as good as the body\u2019s own cells,\u201d said Melton, a co-author on the Nature Medicine paper.\n\nThe transplanted cells controlled glucose levels in the mice without immune-suppressing drugs, the researchers reported. And when the scientists removed the capsules after almost six months, the cells were still cranking out insulin and there was little sign of an immune response to the capsules.\n\n\u201cFrom very early on, we were getting great success,\u201d said Arturo Vegas, a lead author of the papers who worked in Anderson\u2019s lab before moving to Boston University, where he is now an assistant chemistry professor.\n\n\u201cEverything kind of fell into place,\u201d Vegas continued. \u201cYou saw less foreign body response. The human beta cells survived exquisitely well.\u201d\n\nThe studies show \u201cyou can take stem cells and make a limitless supply of [human beta cells] and put them in a device and cure an entirely different species of animal,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nJust because the system produced strong results in mice does not mean people will respond the same way. But experts say the findings provide hope for future treatments for people.\n\n\u201cThis is really the first demonstration of the ability of these novel materials in combination with a stem-cell derived beta cell to reverse diabetes in an animal model,\u201d said Julia Greenstein, vice president of discovery research at JDRF, an organization trying to end type 1 diabetes that provided some funding for the studies. \u201cOur goal is to bring that kind of biological cure across the spectrum of type 1 diabetes.\u201d\n\nThe potential of the approach has attracted interest from both small startups and large biopharmaceutical companies that are looking at stem cell-based therapies for diabetes.\n\nOne company, San Diego-based ViaCyte, launched the first cell replacement clinical trial in 2014. Melton also recently helped start Semma Therapeutics, based in Cambridge\u2019s Kendall Square neighborhood. Semma has not begun any human clinical trials yet, but the goal is to develop a device that once implanted could control someone\u2019s blood sugar for a year or more, saving them from insulin injections and needing to check their blood sugar every few hours.\n\n\u201cThe individuals would not have to worry about that,\u201d Semma CEO Robert Millman said.\n\nOther companies pursuing stem cells treatments for diabetes include Novo Nordisk and BetaLogics, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson.\n\nMost of these other companies are taking a different approach from the work done in the studies published Monday.\n\nThe MIT team has developed tiny capsules for the cells, but ViaCyte, for example, has created a larger device outfitted with the cells that gets inserted under the skin. And whereas the Massachusetts researchers examined beta cells exclusively for their study, the ViaCyte team is exploring using less mature cells that, once implanted, differentiate into both insulin-producing beta cells and those that secrete another hormone called glucagon that\u2019s deficient in the disease.\n\n\u201cThe main issue with type 1 diabetes is a loss of beta cells,\u201d said ViaCyte CEO Paul Laikind, \u201cbut there\u2019s also good data out there to suggest dysfunction in other regulatory cell types.\u201d\n\nThe team behind the studies published Monday, meanwhile, is working on tests now in monkey models. Vegas said that if the primate studies are successful, the next step will be developing a therapy to be used in people.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve advanced the ball pretty far, almost as far you could get in an academic environment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe talk is shifting toward doing something clinically.\u201d", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A study believed to be the largest of its kind suggests that the physical aspects of yoga are effective at relieving low back pain, but it didn't find any evidence that yoga provided broader mental benefits.\n\nThe study, funded by the National Institutes of Health's National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, was published online Monday in the Archives of Internal Medicine.

The vegetarian diet consisted of vegetables, grains, legumes, fruits and nuts, with animal products limited to a maximum of one portion of low-fat yoghurt per day; the conventional diabetic diet followed the official recommendations of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD). Both diets were restricted by 500 kilocalories per day compared to an isocaloric intake for each individual.\n\nThe vegetarian diet was found to be almost twice as effective in reducing body weight, resulting in an average loss of 6.2kg compared to 3.2kg for the conventional diet.\n\nUsing magnetic resonance imaging, Dr. Kahleov\u00e1 and colleagues then studied adipose (fat-storage) tissue in the subjects' thighs to see how the two different diets had affected subcutaneous, subfascial and intramuscular fat (that is, fat under the skin, on the surface of muscles and inside muscles).\n\nThey found that both diets caused a similar reduction in subcutaneous fat. However, subfascial fat was only reduced in response to the vegetarian diet, and intramuscular fat was more greatly reduced by the vegetarian diet.\n\nThis is important as increased subfascial fat in patients with type 2 diabetes has been associated with insulin resistance, so reducing it could have a beneficial effect on glucose metabolism. In addition, reducing intramuscular fat could help improve muscular strength and mobility, particularly in older people with diabetes.\n\nDr. Kahleov\u00e1 said: \"Vegetarian diets proved to be the most effective diets for weight loss. However, we also showed that a vegetarian diet is much more effective at reducing muscle fat, thus improving metabolism.

The researchers, led by Dale Boger, co-chair of TSRI\u2019s Department of Chemistry, discovered a way to structurally modify vancomycin to make an already-powerful version of the antibiotic even more potent.\n\n\u201cDoctors could use this modified form of vancomycin without fear of resistance emerging,\u201d said Boger, whose team announced the finding today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe original form of vancomycin is an ideal starting place for developing better antibiotics. The antibiotic has been prescribed by doctors for 60 years, and bacteria are only now developing resistance to it. This suggests bacteria already have a hard time overcoming vancomycin\u2019s original \u201cmechanism of action,\u201d which works by disrupting how bacteria form cell walls.\n\nBoger called vancomycin \u201cmagical\u201d for its proven strength against infections, and previous studies by Boger and his colleagues at TSRI had shown that it is possible to add two modifications to vancomycin to make it even more potent. \u201cWith these modifications, you need less of the drug to have the same effect,\u201d Boger said.\n\nThe new study shows that scientists can make a third modification\u2014which interferes with a bacterium\u2019s cell wall in a new way\u2014with promising results. Combined with the previous modifications, this alteration gives vancomycin a 1,000-fold increase in activity, meaning doctors would need to use less of the antibiotic to fight infection.\n\nThe discovery makes this version of vancomycin the first antibiotic to have three independent mechanisms of action. \u201cThis increases the durability of this antibiotic,\u201d said Boger. \u201cOrganisms just can\u2019t simultaneously work to find a way around three independent mechanisms of action. Even if they found a solution to one of those, the organisms would still be killed by the other two.\u201d\n\nTested against Enterococci bacteria, the new version of vancomycin killed both vancomycin-resistant Enterococci and the original forms of Enterococci.\n\nThe next step in this research is to design a way to synthesize the modified vancomycin using fewer steps in the lab, as the current method takes 30 steps. But Boger calls this the \u201ceasy part\u201d of the project, compared with the challenge of designing the molecule in the first place.\n\nEven if the process isn\u2019t streamlined, Boger believes the new vancomycin\u2019s lifesaving powers make its production valuable. \u201cAntibiotics are total cures for bacterial infections,\u201d said Boger. \u201cMaking this molecule is important, even by the current approach, if the failure of antibiotics continues.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Boger, authors of the study, \u201cPeripheral modifications of [\u03a8[CH2NH]Tpg4]vancomycin with added synergistic mechanisms of action provide durable and potent antibiotics,\u201d included first author Akinori Okano and Nicholas A.

The findings also underscore the importance of flu vaccination for this risk group.\n\n\"Treating pregnant women who have influenza with antiviral drugs can have substantial benefit in terms of reducing length of stay in the hospital,\" said Sandra S. Chaves, MD, MSc, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and senior author of the study. CDC recommends treatment of suspected cases of flu among pregnant women with antiviral drugs as soon as possible, without waiting for test results to confirm influenza. \"The earlier you treat, the better chances you have to modify the course of the illness.\"\n\nPast studies have suggested that flu antiviral therapy is safe and beneficial for pregnant women. The current study, based on data from a nationwide flu surveillance network including 14 states, focused on pregnant women hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed flu over four recent flu seasons, from 2010 to 2014. During the study period, 865 pregnant women were hospitalized with flu. Sixty-three of these patients, or about 7 percent, had severe illness.\n\nAfter adjusting for underlying medical conditions, vaccination status, and pregnancy trimester, the researchers found that early treatment with the antiviral drug oseltamivir was associated with a shorter hospital stay. Among pregnant women with severe flu illness who were treated early -- within two days of the start of symptoms -- the median length of stay was about five days shorter compared to hospitalized pregnant women with severe flu illness who were treated later (2.2 days vs. 7.8 days). Pregnant women hospitalized with less severe illness who were treated early also had a shorter hospital stay than those treated later, but the difference was not as great.\n\nIn the study, pregnant women hospitalized with severe flu illness were half as likely to have been vaccinated as women hospitalized with milder illness (14 percent vs. 26 percent).

In previous studies, folic acid levels have been linked to mental ability; however, until now this had not been linked with improved school performance, the study authors said.\n\n\"We know that folate plays a really critical role in brain development and brain function,\" said Dr. Daniel Armstrong, associate chair of pediatrics at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.\n\n\"We know that, in young children, folate deficiencies are associated with poorer neurocognitive function and neurocognitive development,\" he noted. In fact, folate deficiencies may be involved in the development of autism, he added.\n\nArmstrong thinks that a diet rich in folate might be important for brain functioning throughout life. \"It's one of those things that's no harm, no foul. It's not going to do us any harm and it might do us some good,\" he said.\n\nTo find out whether folate might do some good, a team led by Dr. Torbjorn K. Nilsson, from the department of laboratory medicine at Orebro University Hospital in Sweden, collected data on folic acid levels in 386 teens aged 15 years. The researchers also looked at any possible effects of socioeconomic status and genetics.\n\nThe investigators found that teens who had the highest levels of folic acid also got the best grades. None of the other factors they examined accounted for their finding, Nilsson's team noted.\n\n\"These results provide new information that points to the importance of keeping a closer watch on folate status in childhood and adolescence. They may also have direct implications for school meal provisions, school teaching programs and information to parents,\" the authors concluded.\n\nHowever, there is no scientific evidence that taking folate supplements will be beneficial, Armstrong noted. \"It's too early to say that everyone should start taking folate,\" he stressed.\n\nFolic acid is one of the B vitamins and is a key component in making DNA and RNA. Insufficient folic acid is a cause of certain birth defects of the spine and brain, including spina bifida.\n\nAmong the elderly, folic acid consumption appears to affect mental ability, and low levels of this vitamin have been associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease, according to several studies.\n\nFolic acid is found in leafy green vegetables, fruits, dried beans, peas and nuts.

An endometriosis pain treatment was just approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and it\u2019s expected to arrive at pharmacies as soon as August. The pill, called elagolix (brand name Orilissa), from the drugmaker AbbVie, is the first FDA-approved oral treatment in more than a decade for the moderate to severe pain that comes with endometriosis.\n\n\u201cThis [medication] could really be transformative,\u201d said Hugh Taylor, an OB-GYN at Yale Medical School who led the key trials testing the drug.\n\nEndometriosis is one of the most common gynecological conditions, affecting as many as one in 10 women of reproductive age. And it can be incredibly painful. The reason is simple: Women with the condition are growing excess tissue in their abdomen that they can\u2019t shed.\n\nEvery month, a woman\u2019s uterine lining thickens and sheds during her period if she\u2019s not pregnant. With endometriosis, that tissue thickens and bleeds, but it happens outside of the uterus \u2014 on the fallopian tubes, or even in the nose or lungs. Because the extra tissue has no way to exit the body (it can\u2019t go through the vagina since it\u2019s not growing in the uterus), it builds up and becomes trapped, leading to pain and, in some cases, infertility.\n\nThere\u2019s no cure for endometriosis. To manage symptoms, women are usually prescribed birth control or over-the-counter painkillers as a first-line approach, but they don\u2019t always work. In severe cases, a doctor may suggest \u201cexcision surgery\u201d to remove the extra tissue. (Dunham had eight surgeries and ended up getting a hysterectomy, which was considered an extreme measure.)\n\nEnter elagolix. Endometriosis is an estrogen-driven disease, and the drug works by lowering estrogen levels. Two large double-blind, placebo-control randomized trials, which 1,285 women completed, tested whether it can help women control endometriosis pain. The results, published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine, were impressive. The patients in those trials scored their pain from 0 (no pain) to 3 (severe pain). On average, they had pain levels of 2.2 out of 3 before starting on the drug \u2014 and they experienced a 2-point reduction in pain after taking the treatment for three months.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a major advance,\u201d said Dr. Louis DePaolo, head of the fertility and infertility branch at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, \u201cand another option women have that\u2019s effective.\u201d\n\nNow the less good news: The drug won\u2019t cure endometriosis; it\u2019ll only tamp down the pain it causes. Many women in the trial experienced the symptoms of menopause \u2014 hot flashes, headache, insomnia \u2014 and researchers have also found the drug causes bone loss. We have no idea about the long-term effects of taking the drug because there are no trials lasting for longer than a year, or how it stacks up against other painkillers (since the trials only compared it to placebo). That\u2019s not to mention cost: The drug\u2019s price is listed at $850 per month. But for some, the risks and costs may be worth it. Here\u2019s why.\n\nEndometriosis is incredibly common \u2014 but it can go undiagnosed for years\n\nEndometriosis is a chronic, sometimes highly disruptive condition. The three main ways it manifests are through pelvic pain, infertility, and pelvic masses such as cysts, scar tissue, and fibroids. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, some important signs of endometriosis include:\n\u2022 Pain before and during periods\n\nBut many women don\u2019t know they have endometriosis. It\u2019s sometimes mistaken or dismissed for regular period pain. Definitively diagnosing the disorder requires invasive surgery; doctors need to peer inside the pelvis through a laparoscopy. (Imaging is rarely helpful in getting a clear diagnosis.) This involves making a small incision in the belly and inserting a tube with a tiny camera to see if the pelvic organs show signs of tissue scarring and buildup. So it\u2019s no surprise it takes between three and 11 years after the onset of symptoms to diagnose endometriosis.\n\nDoctors aren\u2019t sure why some women get it\n\nAdding to the mystery around endometriosis: No one knows exactly what causes it, but doctors have some theories.\n\u2022 Retrograde menstrual flow: During a period, when a woman is shedding her uterine lining, some of that tissue can flow through her fallopian tubes and into her pelvis, which researchers think may cause endometriosis. But doctors have also found that the rate of retrograde menstruation is about the same in women with and without endometriosis, so they think additional factors spur the disorder in some.\n\u2022 Genes: The disorder runs in families, so doctors believe there\u2019s a genetic component. If a woman\u2019s mom or sister had endometriosis, the woman is believed to be at a higher risk.\n\u2022 Somatic mutations: Researchers are also finding that somatic mutations \u2014 acquired changes to DNA that happen after a person is born \u2014 may also be an endometriosis driver.\n\u2022 Immune system dysfunction: Problems with the immune system can hamper a woman\u2019s ability to clear her menstrual debris, leading to endometriosis.\n\u2022 Environmental factors: There\u2019s some evidence to suggest environmental exposures to certain chemicals may contribute to one\u2019s risk of developing endometriosis.\n\nThe treatments available don\u2019t always help, and some have severe side effects\n\nWhen birth control pills or over-the-counter painkillers fail to help endometriosis pain, women are often left choosing between a monthly injection called Lupron Depot, which can put women into a profoundly menopausal state, or Danazol, a male hormone that often causes acne and facial hair growth.\n\nIn women for whom these drugs aren\u2019t effective, or who don\u2019t want to take medications, surgery to remove the displaced endometrial tissue can be a highly effective option. But the trouble with surgery is that endometriosis can recur, so women may need more surgeries. The success of surgery also depends on finding a skilled and experienced surgeon, and there\u2019s always the risk of surgical complications.\n\nThe new drug elagolix is not risk-free, either. In the trials, women who took the drug had greater bone loss than did those who received placebo, and this wasn\u2019t entirely surprising. Like other endometriosis treatments, the drug works by lowering estrogen levels (since endometriosis needs estrogen to grow). When that happens, women experience menopausal side effects. The most common in the trials were hot flashes, headaches, and insomnia. (Elagolix is available in two doses \u2014 150 mg per day, or 200 mg twice daily \u2014 and the women on the higher dose experienced the side effects more frequently.) Mood swings and night sweats were less common, and one woman in the trial died by suicide (though there\u2019s no indication that the medicine was a cause of her death).\n\nDePaolo pointed out, \u201c[Elagolix] doesn\u2019t have the pronounced side effects some of the other compounds have.\u201d That\u2019s because, he said, it doesn\u2019t drive down estrogen levels as severely.\n\nBut for patients who have tried other estrogen-lowering medicines, elagolix isn\u2019t all that appealing. \u201cThis drug is palliative in nature. It does not cure or shrink the disease,\u201d Casey Berna, director of programs and partnerships for the advocacy group EndoWhat. The drug\u2019s side effects also concerned her, as did the lack of knowledge about its long-term impact.\n\nFor other women, though, the trade offs may be worth it. But in either case, women with severe endometriosis are still left choosing between terrible pain, surgery, or drugs with serious side effects.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "Abbvie, the company that funded the Stage 3 clinical trials of elagolix (brand name: Orilissa) and will now market the drug, made available an extensive news release on its web site.

The results showed no differences in IQ.\n\n\"There is growing evidence from a number of studies that all infants, those born at term and those born early, benefit from receiving extra blood from the placenta at birth,\" said Dr. Heike Rabe, a neonatologist at Brighton & Sussex Medical School in the United Kingdom. Rabe's editorial accompanied the study published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics.\n\nDelaying the clamping of the cord allows more blood to transfer from the placenta to the infant, sometimes increasing the infant's blood volume by up to a third. The iron in the blood increases infants' iron storage, and iron is essential for healthy brain development.\n\n\"The extra blood at birth helps the baby to cope better with the transition from life in the womb, where everything is provided for them by the placenta and the mother, to the outside world,\" Rabe said. \"Their lungs get more blood so that the exchange of oxygen into the blood can take place smoothly.\"\n\nPast studies have shown higher levels of iron and other positive effects later in infancy among babies whose cords were clamped after several minutes, but few studies have looked at results past infancy.\n\nIn this study, researchers randomly assigned half of 263 healthy Swedish full-term newborns to have their cords clamped more than three minutes after birth. The other half were clamped less than 10 seconds after birth.\n\nFour years later, the children underwent a series of assessments for IQ, motor skills, social skills, problem-solving, communication skills and behavior. Those with delayed cord clamping showed modestly higher scores in social skills and fine motor skills. When separated by sex, only the boys showed statistically significant improvement.\n\n\"We don't know exactly why, but speculate that girls receive extra protection through higher estrogen levels whilst being in the womb,\" Rabe said. \"The results in term infants are consistent with those of follow-up in preterm infants.\"\n\nDelayed cord clamping has garnered more attention in the past few years for its potential benefits to the newborn. Until recently, clinicians believed early clamping reduced the risk of hemorrhaging in the mother, but research hasn't borne that out.\n\nMuch of the research has focused on preterm infants, who appear to benefit most from delayed cord clamping, Rabe said. Preemies who have delayed cord clamping tend to have better blood pressure in the days immediately after birth, need fewer drugs to support blood pressure, need fewer blood transfusions, have less bleeding into the brain and have a lower risk of necrotizing enterocolitis, a life-threatening bowel injury, she said.\n\nThis study is among the few looking at healthy, full-term infants in a country high in resources, as opposed to developing countries where iron deficiency may be more likely.\n\nThe American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has not yet endorsed the practice, citing insufficient evidence for full-term infants. The World Health Organization recommends delayed cord clamping of not less than one minute.\n\nIt is unclear whether the practice could harm infants' health. Some studies have found a higher risk of jaundice, a buildup of bilirubin in the blood from the breakdown of red blood cells. Jaundice is treated with blue light therapy and rarely has serious complications.\n\nAnother potential risk is a condition called polycythemia, a very high red blood cell count, said Dr. Scott Lorch, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine and director of the Center for Perinatal and Pediatric Health Disparities Research at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\n\"Polycythemia can have medical consequences for the infant, including blood clots, respiratory distress and even strokes in the worst-case scenario,\" Lorch said. Some studies have found higher levels of red blood cells in babies with delayed cord clamping, but there were no complications.\n\nLorch also pointed out that this study involved a mostly homogenous population in a country outside the U.S.\n\n\"We should see whether similar effects are seen in higher-risk populations, such as the low socioeconomic population, racial and ethnic minorities and those at higher risk for neurodevelopmental delay,\" Lorch said.\n\nSo far, studies on delayed cord clamping have excluded infants born in distress, such as those with breathing difficulties or other problems. But Rabe said these infants may actually benefit most from the practice.\n\nThese babies often need more blood volume to help with blood pressure, breathing and circulation problems, Rabe said. \"Also, the placental blood is rich with stem cells, which could help to repair any brain damage the baby might have suffered during a difficult birth,\" she added. \"Milking of the cord would be the easiest way to get the extra blood into the baby quickly in an emergency situation.\"", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not rely solely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The Pleasantville, N.Y., developmental pediatrician won\u2019t allow drug marketers in his office, and says he doesn\u2019t always prescribe medication for children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Yet Dr. Bertin has recently changed the way he talks about medication, offering parents a powerful argument. Recent research, he says, suggests the pills may \u201cnormalize\u201d the child\u2019s brain over time, rewiring neural connections so that a child would feel more focused and in control, long after the last pill was taken.\n\n\u201cThere might be quite a profound neurological benefit,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nA growing number of doctors who treat the estimated 6.4 million American children diagnosed with A.D.H.D. are hearing that stimulant medications not only help treat the disorder but may actually be good for their patients\u2019 brains. In an interview last spring with Psych Congress Network, an Internet news site for mental health professionals, Dr. Timothy Wilens, chief of child and adolescent psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital, said \u201cwe have enough data to say they\u2019re actually neuroprotective.\u201d The pills, he said, help \u201cnormalize\u201d the function and structure of brains in children with A.D.H.D., so that, \u201cover years, they turn out to look more like non-A.D.H.D. kids.\u201d\n\nMedication is already by far the most common treatment for A.D.H.D., with roughly 4 million American children taking the pills \u2014 mostly stimulants, such as amphetamines and methylphenidate. Yet the decision can be anguishing for parents who worry about both short-term and long-term side effects. If the pills can truly produce long-lasting benefits, more parents might be encouraged to start their children on these medications early and continue them for longer.\n\nLeading A.D.H.D. experts, however, warn the jury is still out.\n\n\u201cSometimes wishful thinking gives us hope that the impressive short-term relative benefits of medication over other treatments will persist beyond childhood, but I haven\u2019t seen it,\u201d said James Swanson, director of the Child Development Center at the University of California at Irvine. Dr. Swanson, a co-author of a landmark federally funded study, the Multimodal Treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, said that follow-up research found overall improvement but no greater long-term benefits after three years for children who were treated with medication compared to those who weren\u2019t. One possible reason, as the report noted, was that many children refuse to continue taking medication after a year or so, something most parentsof such children well know.\n\nResearch has shown that the brains of people with A.D.H.D. on average look and function differently than those who don\u2019t have the disorder, particularly when it comes to processing two important neurotransmitters: dopamine and norepinephrine. For most people with A.D.H.D., stimulants can temporarily boost focus, motivation and self-control by increasing the availability of these chemical messengers. The question is whether these effects can last once the drugs have left the bloodstream.\n\nIn arguing for \u201cnormalization,\u201d Dr. Wilens cited a major review in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry in late 2013, which looked at 29 brain-scan studies. Although the studies had different methods and goals, the authors said that, together, they suggested that stimulants \u201care associated with attenuation of abnormalities in brain structure, function, and biochemistry in subjects with A.D.H.D.\u201d\n\nBut other A.D.H.D. experts challenge this conclusion. Dr. F. Xavier Castellanos, director of research at the New York University Child Study Center, called assertions that stimulants are neuroprotective \u201cexaggerated,\u201d adding: \u201cThe best inference is that there is no evidence of harm from medications \u2013 normalization is a possibility, but far from demonstrated.\u201d\n\nA.D.H.D. is an exceptionally controversial diagnosis, with particular controversy zeroing in on researchers, including Dr. Wilens himself and some of the authors of the 2013 report he cited who have received financial support from pharmaceutical firms. In an email, Dr. Wilens said he had not received \u201cany personal income\u201d from the pharmaceutical industry since 2009.\n\nAs several experts noted, a major impediment to determining the long-term impacts of A.D.H.D. medication is that a \u201cgold-standard\u201d study would require researchers to assign children randomly to groups that either received medication or didn\u2019t. Such a practice has been deemed unethical due to the widespread belief that the medication can help struggling children, at least in the short-term.\n\nAnd other research has raised new concerns. One peer-reviewed 2013 study co-authored by Dr. Swanson suggested that the stimulants may change the brain over time so as to undermine the long-term response to the medication and even exacerbate symptoms when people aren\u2019t taking them.\n\nDr. Peter Jensen, the former associate director of child and adolescent research at the National Institute of Mental Health, cautioned that parents should not try to force children with A.D.H.D. to take medication when they don\u2019t want to, adding that \u201cmost kids don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\nDr. Jensen, who now heads the REACH Institute, a national nonprofit organization concerned with children\u2019s mental health, once surveyed 100 parents of sons and daughters in their 20s who had been diagnosed with A.D.H.D., asking what made the most difference.\n\n\u201cEighty percent of them said \u2018Love your child. Help him or her advocate for themselves, and find a doc who\u2019ll work with you through thick or thin whether you medicate or not,\u201d Dr. Jensen said. \u201cOnly a minority of these parents mentioned medication.\u201d\n\nKatherine Ellison is a Pulitzer Prize-winning former foreign correspondent and author and co-author of seven books, including the forthcoming \u201cWhat Everyone Needs to Know about A.D.H.D.\u201d (Oxford University Press), co-authored with Stephen Hinshaw, Vice-Chair for Psychology, Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Francisco.\n\nKatherine Ellison is an author or co-author of four books about A.D.H.D. and education, including \u201cBuzz: A Year of Paying Attention.\u201d", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story appears to be based on original reporting and the expertise of the writer.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "June 11, 2012 (Philadelphia) -- In an early study, an experimental stem cell procedure helped 15 teens with type 1 diabetes stay off of insulin injections for about 1.5 years, on average.\n\nThe study was very small, and the procedure is not ready for widespread use. \"We now have a unique approach with some positive findings, but it's still early.

In type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks and destroys insulin-producing cells within the pancreas.\n\nThe experimental treatment is called autologous nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). It aims to kill the destructive immune system cells and replace them with immature stem cells not programmed to destroy insulin-producing cells.\n\nFirst, patients are given drugs to stimulate production of blood stem cells.

But within 40 minutes of receiving a ketamine injection, their depressive symptoms improved; the effect persisted for at least three days.\n\nRight now, medications available for treating either major depression or bipolar illness can take weeks, or even months, to work, notes Dr. Carlos A. Zarate Jr. of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, one of the researchers on the study.\n\nAnd as a person waits for their medications to kick in, he added, they will continue to have difficulty working and coping with social and family life; they may even be having thoughts of suicide. \u201cWe want to alleviate the suffering and get them back to their life,\u201d he said.\n\nZarate and his colleagues had previously demonstrated that ketamine shots helped some patients with treatment-resistant unipolar depression, meaning they did not cycle through manic episodes. In the new study, they gave patients with bipolar illness ketamine or a placebo on two test days two weeks apart.\n\nAll of the patients were on lithium or valproate - two drugs commonly used for bipolar illness - but had not responded to treatment. Nearly all were unemployed, Zarate and his team note, and two-thirds were on psychiatric disability.\n\nCompared to placebo, patients showed significant improvement in mood within 40 minutes of receiving the ketamine infusion, using a common depression rating scale. Symptom improvement peaked two days after the injection, but remained significantly greater than for placebo for three days.\n\nSeventy-one percent of the patients responded to ketamine, meaning they had at least a 50 percent improvement in their depressive symptoms. Six percent responded to placebo.\n\nSide effects included anxiety, \u201cfeeling woozy or loopy,\u201d headache, and dissociative symptoms, meaning a temporary sense of disconnection from reality, although there were no serious adverse events. By developing more specifically targeted drugs, Zarate noted, it may be possible to treat patients effectively while avoiding these symptoms.\n\nKetamine appears to work by \u201cresetting\u201d the way nerve cells process glutamate, a brain chemical key for learning, memory, and other functions, according to Zarate. The problem in bipolar illness and depression, he explains, doesn\u2019t appear to be that a person has too much or too little glutamate; instead, it\u2019s likely that the way their neurons release and take up the chemical is out of whack.\n\nFirst introduced in 1962, ketamine is used legally in both human and veterinary medicine as an anesthetic. It\u2019s also a drug of abuse, at much higher doses than those used in Zarate\u2019s research; while patients in the current study received about 50 milligrams during a 40-minute period, a dose too low to induce anesthesia, recreational users of ketamine, known as \u201cSpecial K,\u201d may take hundreds of milligrams per week.\n\nIn 1999, US regulators classified ketamine as a Schedule III controlled substance, meaning it has the potential for abuse but is also useful medically.\n\nKetamine could improve treatment of bipolar illness and depression in a variety of ways, Zarate said; for example, as a means to jump-start standard drug treatment, or as an anesthetic before ECT. \u201cIt\u2019s opened the floodgate of many different directions of research, and all of them are quite encouraging,\u201d said Zarate, who along with a co-author has filed for a patent on the use of ketamine in depression. Those rights would be assigned to his employer, the National Institutes of Health.\n\nEfforts are already underway in Europe to develop guidelines for how ketamine should be used and prescribed to treat bipolar illness and depression, the researcher said.\n\nIn the US, research is continuing on the drug, he added, and some physicians are likely trying the drug in their patients with bipolar illness or depression who aren\u2019t helped by standard treatments.

Cytology-based screening, known as the Pap test or Pap smear, is used to detect abnormal cells. The Pap test can also find noncancerous conditions, such as infections and inflammation.\n\nCervical cancer screening guidelines have changed dramatically over the last 15 years, following introduction of testing for the dozen high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types that cause virtually all cervical cancer and its precursors. Despite more research into HPV, and the introduction of preventive HPV vaccines, screening will remain important and comprise many millions of tests annually for decades to come. But improved screening methods have also introduced some confusion, even controversy.\n\nHPV testing is more sensitive than the Pap test for detecting precancer. The HPV test captures the known cancer causing viruses, but there are gynecologists who believe that there may be unknown cancer causing viruses and so continue to do the Pap smear (plus HPV testing).\n\nHowever, reports of rare HPV-negative, Pap-test-positive cancers are motivating continued use of both tests (cotesting) despite increased testing costs. An HPV test, in which doctors test a cervicovaginal specimen for the presence of the nucleic acids of carcinogenic types of HPV, is more sensitive than the Pap test (a microscopic examination of exfoliated cells) for detection of precancers. Thus, if a single screening method were chosen to complement HPV vaccination, primary HPV testing likely would gradually supplant the Pap test.\n\nIn the US, an interim guidance issued by a committee of experts from several clinical societies recommended primary HPV testing every three years, the same as the Pap test. Alternatively, current guidelines recommend cotesting but, in recognition of the additional reassurance provided by this approach compared with the Pap test alone, the screening interval is extended to every five years. Draft guidelines from the US Preventive Services Task Force recently recommended either primary HPV testing every five years or the Pap test every three years for women 30 to 64, and did not recommend cotesting.\n\nThe accumulated evidence supports inclusion of HPV testing in screening; thus, the main choice moving forward is between cotesting and primary HPV testing alone.\n\nResearchers were searching for realistic performance data to quantify the additional benefit of the Pap test component of cotesting, as the costs of intensive screening of all women using two screening tests are substantial.\n\nIn January 2003, just prior to US FDA approval of HPV and Pap test cotesting in mid-2003 and interim guidelines in 2004, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large integrated health care organization, introduced three-year cotesting in women aged 30 years and older. Kaiser Permanente has now screened over a million women by cotesting. This remains the most extensive experience of HPV testing incorporated into routine screening in the world.\n\nResearchers here quantified the detection of cervical precancer and cancer by cotesting compared with HPV testing alone at Kaiser Permanente, where 1,208,710 women have undergone triennial cervical cotesting since 2003. Screening histories preceding cervical cancers (n=623) and precancers (n=5,369) were examined to assess the relative contribution of the Pap test and HPV test components in identifying cases.\n\nThe analysis found that HPV testing identified more women subsequently diagnosed with cancer and precancer than the Pap test. HPV testing was statistically significantly more likely to be positive for cancer at any time point, except within 12 months. HPV-negative/ Pap test-positive results preceded only small fractions of cases of precancer (3.5%) and cancer (5.9%); these cancers were more likely to be regional or distant stage than other cases.\n\nGiven the rarity of cancers among screened women, the contribution of the Pap test to screening translated to earlier detection of at most five cases per million women per year. Two-thirds (67.9%) of women found to have cancer up to 10 years of follow-up at Kaiser Permanente were detected by the first cotest performed.\n\nThe researchers conclude that the added sensitivity of cotesting versus HPV alone for detection of treatable cancer affected extremely few women.?\n\nThe paper \"Relative Performance of HPV and Cytology Components of Cotesting in Cervical Screening\" is available at: https:/\n\nTo request a copy of the study, please contact: Daniel Luzer\n\n daniel.luzer@oup.com", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "We found no unjustifiable language.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Coffee or tea?

More than one-fifth of people dropped out when they couldn\u2019t tolerate the supplement\u2019s taste, texture and side effects.\n\nResearchers have explored the potential of seaweed as an appetite suppressant, but so far products haven\u2019t panned out.\n\n\u201cThere have been problems in the past to develop something (that tastes) acceptable,\u201d said Dr. Arne Astrup, one of the study\u2019s authors from the University of Copenhagen and a member of the advisory board to S-Biotek, a Danish company that provided funding for the study.\n\nPrevious seaweed-based supplements were slimy and caused bloating, and they also had a fishy taste. The new supplement used in this study is less unpleasant \u2014 but there\u2019s still room for improvement, said Astrup.\n\nThe supplement is based on the seaweed extract alginate, a thickening agent and a common ingredient in foods like soups and jellies. It\u2019s also increasingly used by the weight-loss industry, marketed as an appetite suppressant.\n\nPackaged in powder form and mixed with liquid, alginate expands in the stomach to form a thick gel, mimicking the effect of a large meal.\n\n\u201cThis gel is really like a pudding that will last in the stomach for hours, gradually degrading and disappearing,\u201d Astrup said.\n\nFor the study, the researchers randomly divided 96 generally healthy but obese people, aged 20 to 55, into two groups.\n\nOne group was given packets of the gel supplement, containing 15 grams of fiber, and the other got a seaweed-free placebo drink. Neither the researchers nor the participants knew who was receiving the seaweed supplement.\n\nIn terms of calories, flavor and appearance, the placebo and treatment drink were identical.\n\nFor three months, study participants drank the supplements, dissolved in two cups of water, 30 minutes before each meal. They were also told to cut back on calories. By the end of the trial, sixteen people had dropped out of the study, including 10 out of 48 from the seaweed group, according to findings published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.\n\nAmong people who stuck with the trial, those on the fiber supplement lost 15 pounds, on average, compared to 11 pounds in the placebo group. But when all 96 original participants were included in the analysis, the researchers found no significant difference in weight loss between the two treatment groups.\n\nPrevious studies have shown eating a high-fiber diet can help reduce the hunger pangs that may lead to over-eating and derail a healthy diet plan.\n\nStill, the new results should be treated with caution, according to Dr. Maria Vazquez Roque, who has worked on alginate-based gels at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, but was not involved in the study. Just looking at the effect of the supplement on people who finished the treatment can bias the findings, she said.\n\nFor Mette Kristensen, one of the study\u2019s authors, the message seems clear: \u201cIf you actually comply with the treatment, you do have the improvement in weight loss.\u201d\n\nHowever, effects on blood pressure were less promising. Systolic blood pressure \u2014 the top number on a blood pressure reading \u2014 fell by almost six points on average in the placebo group over the 12-week study, but by just over one point in the treatment group. At times during the trials, systolic blood pressure increased in the alginate group by one to two points.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the higher sodium content of the alginate drink \u2014 a little over one gram per dose, or about half a teaspoon of salt \u2014 could have offset any potential blood-pressure reducing effect of the supplement. The American Heart Association recommends that adults eat less than 1.5 g of sodium per day.\n\nQuestions remain about the safety of the fiber supplement over the long term. Five people taking the fiber gel left the study due to problems with stomach bloating, nausea and diarrhea. Two people taking a placebo supplement, which didn\u2019t contain the seaweed fiber, experienced similar problems.\n\nThere are many different types of alginate, said Richard Mattes, who has studied the effect of alginate fiber on appetite at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana \u2014 so the trick is to find the right alginate in the right dose.\n\nAnd just feeling less hungry due to a supplement won\u2019t make you lose weight unless you eat fewer calories, said Mattes, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nThe research group is working on a new supplement that uses 80 percent less alginate, with less sodium, better taste and fewer side effects than the current formula, Astrup told Reuters Health.\n\nAlginate as an aid to weight loss is already commercially available in pill form and costs around $45 for a seven-day supply.

Even today, in much of the developing world, people exercise through activities such as farming and fetching water that are necessary for survival.\n\nHowever, in the developed Western world, where exercise tends to be an extracurricular activity, there is apparently tremendous interest in just how fast you should move in order to improve your health. Consider, for example, the many posts on The New York Times\u2019 Well blog on the topic (walking versus running, the \u201cright dose of exercise,\u201d \u201cwalk hard, walk easy\u201d), all of which focus on the relative benefits of walking versus jogging versus running.\n\nSo is it better to walk? To walk fast? To run slow? To run fast? On its face, this question is poorly posed, since it says nothing about our goals or our constraints. Am I aiming to lose weight? To live longer? To win road races? Am I willing to exercise for three hours a day? Twenty minutes? Almost never? Clearly, these considerations matter when trying to determine the optimal speed. Here is how I would think about asking the question instead: What is the easiest way to reduce my chance of death?\n\nTo analyze the impact of walking or running, researchers need a way to describe the effort exerted. The ideal measure would combine the length of time spent exercising with the amount of energy expended \u2014 basically, we want to figure out a way to credit people who walk at half the speed for twice as long the same amount as those who walk faster for less time.\n\nThe way researchers do this is with a measurement known as MET \u2014 metabolic equivalent of task \u2014 which gives a numeric value to various activities depending on their energy intensity. By multiplying an activity\u2019s METs by the time you engage in it, you can get an overall measure of how much energy you expend.\n\nThe goal here is to use these METs and their relationship to health to analyze the value of walking compared with jogging or running. At least in this article, I won\u2019t say anything about other kinds of exercise \u2014 no yoga or SoulCycle \u2014 though these have their own MET measures.\n\nLet\u2019s first look at the results from two papers \u2014 here and here \u2014 that relate energy expenditures from walking (in MET hours per day) to the risk of death.\n\nDoing this analysis is a little complicated. You can\u2019t look at the relationship between exercise and the chance of ever dying, because ultimately everyone dies. Instead, these studies look at whether exercise changes the risk of death at a given time. But since the people in the studies are of different ages, researchers can\u2019t just look to see whether they have, say, a 2 percentage point lower risk of death in a given year, since that lower risk would mean a lot more for someone who is 30 than for someone who is 90. Results in these two papers \u2014 and basically all the others we\u2019ll look at here \u2014 therefore report their results in \u201chazard ratios.\u201d A hazard rate of 0.90, for example, means a 10 percent reduction in the risk of death. If there is a 10 in 1,000 chance you\u2019ll die in the next year without exercise, this means by exercising you\u2019d reduce that chance to 9 in 1,000.\n\nThis research shows that those who walk have a lower risk of mortality relative to people in the comparison group, who don\u2019t walk for exercise at all (they probably do still walk some, just not for exercise). This risk of death is lower even with a very minimal energy expenditure. The lowest-energy-expenditure group in each study is walking at about 3 mph for 20 to 40 minutes per day. In other words, a mile or two of walking. In exchange, their risk of death goes down by 10 percent.\n\nWalking a bit farther \u2014 say, 2 to 3 miles at 3 mph \u2014 gets you an additional death reduction of about 30 percent. But walking more than that, or more than an hour a day at this speed, is no better.\n\nOther studies of walking find similar magnitudes. A large meta-analysis found that, on average, walking 1 to 3 miles at about a 20-minute-mile pace results in a reduction in death risk of about 10 percent.\n\nMany of these studies do not separate out speed and duration, but to the extent they do, it seems like walking faster may be better than walking slower. Here is one study that shows large mortality reductions for fast walking even for short periods, and here is another showing that very slow walking has fewer benefits than faster walking.\n\nAt first glance, it may seem obvious that the harder you exercise, the better. If walking faster is more energy-intensive than walking slower, and running is more energy-intensive than walking, it seems like the health benefits of running would be even greater. In some sense, you\u2019d hope so, since most of us find running more difficult than walking.\n\nBroadly, over some range, this seems to be right. The chart below shows results for two studies of runners that, again, relate METs to hazard rates of death. Running \u2014 even slowly, like 5 mph \u2014 is far more energy-intensive than walking. An energy expenditure of 1.19 METs per day (the lowest-energy-expenditure group in the second study here) means about 20 minutes of running a 12-minute mile, three times a week.\n\nSlow running like this appears to have a much larger impact on mortality than walking. A hazard rate of 0.48 \u2014 compared with a sedentary group \u2014 suggests a much larger reduction in the risk of death than a hazard rate of 0.90. What is a bit surprising about this chart is that running faster or farther doesn\u2019t seem to reduce death rates any more than running slowly and, in fact, in both cases is slightly worse.\n\nIn one of these studies it looks like running very intensely (faster than an eight-minute mile, more than four hours a week) increases your risk of death relative to not running at all. But a closer look at the data suggests that this is probably just a statistical artifact: This intense running group contains only 36 people and two deaths, versus hundreds of people in the more casual running groups.\n\nEven if we dismiss the possibility that running harder is worse, it is probably useful to note that running harder or farther doesn\u2019t seem to be better. I have occasionally felt guilty about my thrice-weekly 25-minute runs, especially in comparison to my brother, who runs a 2:45 marathon and once attempted the Leadville Trail 100. It is comforting to know that I can still outlive him.\n\nOne general problem with all of this research is that none of these studies is randomized. People who exercise are different from those who do not, and those who exercise more are different from those who exercise less. This should, as usual, give us some pause in trumpeting the virtues of exercise. However, I\u2019d argue that the comparisons the studies make among runners are still valid.\n\nTo be more concrete: In most of these studies, the more intense runners are healthier (for example: less likely to smoke and thinner) than the less-intense runners. We may tend to attribute the health of this group to their running habits. The fact that even with this bias we see no large benefit \u2014 indeed, seemingly no benefit at all \u2014 to running more rather than running less reinforces the value of moderate running.\n\nIf we take this research at face value, we learn a few things. First, some exercise reduces your risk of death. Second, the optimal walking/jogging exercise is light to moderate jogging. The optimal speed is between 5 and 7 mph, and if you do 25 minutes about three times a week, you\u2019re all set. Nothing in the data suggests that running more \u2014 farther, or faster \u2014 will do more to lower your risk of death.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The work does not appear to be based on a news release or other promotional materials.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "With the widespread availability of marijuana in recent years thanks to its legalization in a growing number of states, there has been increasing concern about the long-term health consequences on teens who might be able to get easier access to it illegally.\n\nA study published by the American Psychological Association in the journal Psychology of Addictive Behaviors this week should alleviate some of the worst fears.\n\nResearchers from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Rutgers University studied 408 males from adolescence to their mid-30s. The participants fell into four groups: those with no use or low use of marijuana, early chronic users, those who only smoked during their teens and those who began using it later and continued using the drug. The early chronic users smoked a great deal -- a peak of more than 200 days per year on average when they were 22 years old.\n\nThe researchers found no links to physical or mental health issues -- including depression, psychotic symptoms or asthma -- in any group, even those with very high use. They controlled for cigarette smoking, other drug use, access to health insurance and other factors.\n\n\"What we found was a little surprising,\" lead author Jordan Bechtold, a research fellow at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said in a statement.\n\nBased on other studies in the past that seemed to allude to marijuana use and later development of psychotic symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations, the researchers had thought they might find some associations to disease or other health conditions. But there were none.\n\nThey also found no link to a wide range of other health issues: cancer, asthma, respiratory problems, depression, anxiety, allergies, headaches or high blood pressure.\n\nBechtold said the researchers wanted to \"help inform the debate about legalization of marijuana\" but that this is a very complicated issue and one, study, including his own, should not be taken in isolation and should be viewed in context of other studies on teenagers' marijuana use.\n\nOne major limitation of the study is that it ends when the men are in their 30s \"which may be too early for decrements in health to emerge,\" the authors acknowledge. \"Therefore, continued data collection and longer follow-ups are needed.\"\n\nUpdate: The study's findings generated significant controversy along with requests for supplemental analysis, according to the editors of the Psychology of Addictive Behaviors. In a lengthy clarification issued in December 2015, the journal said that by applying different models to look at the data they confirmed that there did not appear to be any link between marijuana use and health issues. However, the reanalysis regarding psychotic disorders contradicted the earlier conclusions -- that there indeed appeared to be a higher risk of psychotic disorders among marijuana users in the study versus non-users that approached statistical significance when using a more liberal test.\n\nYour office thermostat is set for men's comfort.

The treatment does not cure hay fever but is generally effective at reducing symptoms. However, inconvenience and discomfort limits patients\u2019 willingness to try allergy shots.\n\nSublingual immunotherapy is an alternative and has become commonly used in Europe, where two tablet-based products against grass-pollen allergies are available: Grazax and Oralair. There are also a number of drop-based products. No sublingual immunotherapy products have yet been approved in the United States, however.\n\nFor the new study, reported in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Italian researchers combined the results of 19 clinical trials conducted since 1995 on the effectiveness of immunotherapy tablets and drops against hay fever caused by grass pollen.\n\nThe trials lasted anywhere from three months to three years.\n\nAcross the studies, which included a total of 2,971 adults and children with grass-pollen allergies, immunotherapy reduced symptoms by about 20 percent to 30 percent, on average. It also allowed patients to reduce their use of antihistamines and other medications.\n\nThe researchers, led by Dr. Gabriele Di Lorenzo of the University of Palermo, describe the benefits as \u201cmodest.\u201d\n\nIn an email, Di Lorenzo told Reuters Health that the findings suggest that sublingual immunotherapy is \u201chighly effective in many, but not in all patients.\u201d He said that more work is needed to identify which patients might be most likely to benefit.\n\nDr. Harold Nelson, an allergist at National Jewish Health in Denver, said that the body of evidence indicates that sublingual immunotherapy beats antihistamines and other medications used to control hay fever symptoms.\n\nIn an interview, he noted that antihistamines reduce symptoms by about 12 percent to 15 percent, on average. Nasal steroids, another hay fever option, appear to cut symptoms by about 17 percent.\n\nOn the other hand, Nelson said, allergy shots appear to outperform the oral versions, with a symptom reduction about twice that of sublingual immunotherapy.\n\nIn addition, the long-term effectiveness of the grass-pollen tablets is not yet fully clear.\n\nLike allergy shots, the oral immunotherapy takes time. Grazax, for instance, is taken daily, starting several months before the start of the next grass-pollen allergy season and continuing for three years thereafter.\n\nResearch so far suggests that the symptom relief persists in the year after patients stop taking Grazax. A study published earlier this year \u2014 and not included in the current analysis \u2014 found that during that post-treatment year, Grazax patients had one-quarter fewer hay fever symptoms than those who had been given a placebo for comparison.\n\nBut longer term data are not yet available. The benefits of allergy shots, by contrast, have been shown to persist for 10 years or beyond, Nelson noted.\n\nThe ultimate cost-effectiveness of sublingual immunotherapy has also yet to be determined; in the UK, for example, Grazax treatment costs about 2.25 pounds ($3.50) per day. In theory, that could pay off if long-term use of allergy medications was cut, but that has yet to be shown.\n\nStill, Nelson said that if sublingual products do win approval in the U.S., they will likely boost the number of hay fever sufferers who want to use under-the-tongue immunotherapy. Even though the effectiveness is less than that of allergy shots, the convenience of an at-home version of immunotherapy is a plus, and the sublingual therapy tends to have fewer side effects than shots, according to Nelson.\n\nThe most common side effects include itchiness and irritation in the mouth, ears and eyes, swelling of the mouth or tongue, headache and gastrointestinal problems like stomach pain and heartburn.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "1clip_filelist.xml\"/>1clip_themedata.thmx\"/>1clip_colorschememapping.xml\"/>\n\n\n\n \nThis piece does not rely on a press release. \n", "answer": 1}, {"article": "DALLAS - Jan. 8, 2018 - Exercise can reverse damage to sedentary, aging hearts and help prevent risk of future heart failure - if it's enough exercise, and if it's begun in time, according to a new study by cardiologists at UT Southwestern and Texas Health Resources.\n\nTo reap the most benefit, the exercise regimen should begin by late middle age (before age 65), when the heart apparently retains some plasticity and ability to remodel itself, according to the findings by researchers at the Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine (IEEM), which is a collaboration between UT Southwestern Medical Center and Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas.\n\nAnd the exercise needs to be performed four to five times a week. Two to three times a week was not enough, the researchers found in an earlier study.\n\n\"Based on a series of studies performed by our team over the past 5 years, this 'dose' of exercise has become my prescription for life,\" said senior author Dr. Benjamin Levine, Director of the Institute and Professor of Internal Medicine at UT Southwestern. \"I think people should be able to do this as part of their personal hygiene - just like brushing your teeth and taking a shower.\"\n\nThe regimen included exercising four to five times a week, generally in 30-minute sessions, plus warmup and cool-down:\n\u2022 One of the weekly sessions included a high-intensity 30-minute workout, such as aerobic interval sessions in which heart rate tops 95 percent of peak rate for 4 minutes, with 3 minutes of recovery, repeated four times (a so-called \"4 x 4\").\n\u2022 Each interval session was followed by a recovery session performed at relatively low intensity.\n\u2022 One day's session lasted an hour and was of moderate intensity. (As a \"prescription for life,\" Levine said this longer session could be a fun activity such as tennis, aerobic dancing, walking, or biking.)\n\u2022 One or two other sessions were performed each week at a moderate intensity, meaning the participant would break a sweat, be a little short of breath, but still be able to carry on a conversation -- the \"talk test.\" In the study, exercise sessions were individually prescribed based on exercise tests and heart rate monitoring.\n\u2022 One or two weekly strength training sessions using weights or exercise machines were included on a separate day, or after an endurance session.\n\nStudy participants built up to those levels, beginning with three, 30-minute, moderate exercise sessions for the first 3 months and peaked at 10 months when two high-intensity aerobic intervals were added.\n\nThe more than 50 participants in the study were divided into two groups, one of which received two years of supervised exercise training and the other group, a control group, which participated in yoga and balance training.\n\nAt the end of the two-year study, those who had exercised showed an 18 percent improvement in their maximum oxygen intake during exercise and a more than 25 percent improvement in compliance, or elasticity, of the left ventricular muscle of the heart, Dr. Levine noted. He compared the change in the heart to a stretchy, new rubber band versus one that has gotten stiff sitting in a drawer.\n\nSedentary aging can lead to a stiffening of the muscle in the heart's left ventricle, the chamber that pumps oxygen-rich blood back out to the body, he explained.\n\n\"When the muscle stiffens, you get high pressure and the heart chamber doesn't fill as well with blood. In its most severe form, blood can back up into the lungs. That's when heart failure develops,\" said Dr. Levine, who holds the S. Finley Ewing Chair for Wellness at Texas Health Dallas and the Harry S. Moss Heart Chair for Cardiovascular Research. He also holds the Distinguished Professorship in Exercise Sciences at UT Southwestern, which is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year.\n\nEarlier research by UT Southwestern cardiologists showed that left ventricular stiffening often shows up in middle age in people who don't exercise and aren't fit, leaving them with small, stiff chambers that can't pump blood as well.\n\nHowever, the researchers also found that the heart chamber in competitive masters-level athletes remains large and elastic, and that even four to five days of committed exercise over decades is enough for noncompetitive athletes to reap most of this benefit.\n\nIn the current study, researchers wanted to know if exercise can restore the heart's elasticity in previously sedentary individuals - especially if begun in late middle age. Previous studies from Dr. Levine's research program have shown substantial improvements in cardiac compliance in young individuals after a year of training, but surprisingly little change if the training was started after age 65.\n\nTo start the study, researchers recruited 53 participants, ages 45 to 64.

The new research aimed to test whether this 'chemical signature' that seemed to typify cancer could be the basis of a diagnostic test.\n\nIn the new study, the research team collected breath samples from 335 people at St Mary's Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust; University College London Hospital; and the Royal Marsden Hospital, London. Of these, 163 had been diagnosed with stomach or oesophageal cancer and 172 showed no evidence of cancer when they had an endoscopy.\n\nAll the samples were analysed with a technique called selected ion flow-tube mass spectrometry, which is able to accurately measure small amounts of different chemicals in mixtures of gases such as breath.\n\nResearchers measured the levels of the five chemicals in each sample to see which ones matched to the 'chemical signature' that indicated cancer.\n\nThe results showed that the test was 85% accurate overall, with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 81%. This means that not only was the breath test good at picking up those who had cancer (sensitivity), it was also good at correctly identifying who did not have cancer (specificity).\n\nDr Markar said: \"Because cancer cells are different to healthy ones, they produce a different mixture of chemicals.

They also found that the sooner people started taking blood thinners after their diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, the lower their risk for dementia.\n\nAlong with not taking blood thinners, the strongest predictors for dementia were age, Parkinson's disease and alcohol abuse, according to the study, published Oct. 25 in the European Heart Journal.\n\nThe findings strongly suggest that blood thinners reduce the risk for dementia in people with atrial fibrillation, but proving that would not be possible, the Swedish researchers said.\n\n\"In order to prove this assumption, randomized placebo-controlled trials would be needed, but such studies cannot be done because of ethical reasons,\" researchers Leif Friberg and Marten Rosenqvist, of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, said in a journal news release. \"It is not possible to give placebo to [atrial fibrillation] patients and then wait for dementia or stroke to occur.\"\n\nHowever, the findings show that people with atrial fibrillation should start taking blood thinners as soon as possible after their diagnosis and continue to take the drugs, Friberg noted.\n\n\"Patients start on oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention but they stop after a few years at an alarmingly high rate,\" he said. \"In the first year, approximately 15 percent stop taking the drugs, then approximately 10 percent each year.\"\n\n\"If you know that [atrial fibrillation] eats away your brain at a slow but steady pace and that you can prevent it by staying on treatment, I think most patients would find this a very strong argument for continuing treatment,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has more on atrial fibrillation.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "Several quotes are taken directly from this European Heart Journal news release.

In new research that could suggest a road to cure, scientists at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Boston Children's Hospital have found that CML stem cells die in response to inhibition of a protein called Ezh2. Drugs that target the protein are currently being tested in clinical trials for other cancers.\n\nThe findings, reported online today by the journal Cancer Discovery, raise the prospect that Ezh2 blockers, in combination with Gleevec and similar drugs, could eradicate the disease in some patients in relatively rapid fashion or could be an effective therapy for those who become resistant to Gleevec-like agents, the authors state.\n\nIn a paper published simultaneously by Cancer Discovery, a team of Scottish scientists report similar findings using a different research approach.\n\n\"The vast majority of patients with CML do remarkably well on imatinib [Gleevec] and similar drugs: The disease is well controlled and side effects are tolerable,\" says Stuart Orkin, MD, the study's senior author and a pediatric hematologist/oncologist at Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center. \"In only 10-20 percent of patients, however, are the leukemia cells fully cleared from the body. The other 90 percent retain a reservoir of leukemic stem cells - which initiate the disease - and must stay on the drugs permanently.\"\n\nCML is a slowly progressing type of blood cancer that develops in the bone marrow. Primarily occurring in adults, it is rare in children.\n\nOver time, some patients develop resistance to Gleevec and other drugs that block BCR-ABL, the misbegotten \"fusion\" protein that drives CML growth. Although second- and third-line targeted therapies can often return the disease to remission, some patients don't benefit from these drugs or develop severe side effects.\n\nThe new study grew out of efforts to discover whether different types of cancer are susceptible to Ezh2 inhibitors. In laboratory experiments, the Dana-Farber/Boston Children's researchers found not only that Ezh2 is overabundant in leukemia stem cells but that it helps them survive and give rise to full-fledged CML cells. Follow-up studies in mice showed that inactivating Ezh2 through gene-editing techniques caused CML stem cells to die, halting the disease at its source.\n\n\"The stem cells' dependence on Ezh2 suggests they will be especially vulnerable to drugs that target the protein,\" Orkin remarks. \"Such drugs are already in clinical trials for other diseases, including lymphoma and some solid tumors.\"\n\nEpizyme, a biopharmaceutical company based in Cambridge, MA, recently opened a pediatric trial of an Ezh2 inhibitor for children with rhabdoid and other tumors. Dana-Farber/Boston Children's is a site in the multi-center Phase 1 trial.\n\nAlthough adding Ezh2-targeting agents to the standard drug regimen for CML has the potential to dramatically shorten the treatment period for many patients, ethical considerations may lead to the agents' first being tested in patients who don't respond to Gleevec and similar drugs, either initially or after drug resistance develops, Orkin remarks. \"Our findings suggest inhibition of Ezh2 should be considered as a way to eradicate CML when used in combination with current targeted therapies. It offers a promising approach to shortening the duration of therapy in order to achieve a cure. If successful, the cost savings of such an approach could also be significant.\"\n\nJoining senior author Orkin, the study's lead author is Huafeng Xie, PhD, of Dana/Farber/Boston Children's.

They put these on a gene chip or microarray to see which genes were active in the cells.\n\n\u201cWe found this certain pathway, PI3K, was turned on in patients that had lung cancer as opposed to patients that had other problems,\u201d Bild said.\n\nPI3K had long been suspected in lung cancer.

Two weeks prior to surgery they received a single injection of varying doses of the anti-TNF drug, or placebo. The tissue removed during surgery, which is usually discarded, was then analysed in the laboratory. The team found that adalimumab (at a dose of 40mg formulated in 0.4ml) reduces expression of the fibrotic markers, -smooth muscle actin (-SMA) and type I procollagen, at 2 weeks post injection, suggesting this drug could be used to stop the growth of disease causing myofibroblast cells. They also found the drug to be safe and well tolerated.\n\nThe findings are published on line in the journal EBioMedicine, published by The Lancet.\n\nDupuytren's disease is a common condition of the hand that affects 4% of the UK population and causes the fingers to curl irreversibly into the palm. There is currently no NICE approved treatment for early disease and typically people are told to return to their GP once their fingers become so bent that their hand function is impaired.\n\nThe anti-TNF drug adalimumab (Humira) is currently licensed in the EU for the treatment of a number of conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and overall has an excellent safety profile.\n\n\"We are delighted to have received further funding from the Wellcome Trust and Department of Health to test whether adalimumab will work for patients with early stage Dupuytren's disease,\" said Professor Sir Marc Feldmann, co-author and former director of the Kennedy Institute.

It concluded that these other groups perform about as well as 12-step programs.\n\n\u201cThis study suggests that these alternatives really are viable options for people who are looking for recovery support and don\u2019t like AA for whatever reason,\u201d Sarah Zemore, lead author of the study, told me.\n\nThe research is by no means the last word on this question \u2014 Zemore characterized the study as the beginning of a deeper evaluation into AA alternatives.\n\nBut this is important. There has been a good amount of research into AA and the 12 steps over the years, broadly finding that about a third of people maintain recovery from alcohol addiction due to 12-step treatment, another third get something out of the treatment but not enough for full recovery, and another third get nothing at all.\n\nResearchers have long suspected, though, that the benefits found in 12-step treatment programs are not exclusive to the 12 steps. As Zemore told me, \u201cThe benefits of 12-step groups are not driven by the 12 steps\u2019 specific philosophy or adherence to the 12 steps. It\u2019s really more about general mechanisms like abstinence motivation and social support for abstinence. Presumably, you could get those by participating in alternatives to AA.\u201d\n\nIn other words, these alternatives could help the one-third to two-thirds of people who don\u2019t get anything or much out of AA. That would help deal with a big public health issue: Based on federal data, more than 20 million people in the US have a substance use disorder, and within that group, more than 15 million have an alcohol use disorder. Excessive drinking alone is linked to 88,000 deaths each year. So finding the right solutions for this problem is literally a matter of life or death.\n\nThe study, conducted by the Alcohol Research Group at the Public Health Institute in California and published last month in the Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment, surveyed more than 600 people with alcohol use disorder (AUD), who were divided by which mutual help group they primarily participated in. Researchers followed up at six months then 12 months, measuring involvement in the groups and various substance use outcomes, including abstinence from drinking and alcohol-related problems.\n\nAfter controlling for several factors, the researchers concluded that \u201c[Women for Sobriety], LifeRing, and SMART are as effective as 12-step groups for those with AUDs.\u201d\n\n\u201cEssentially, that\u2019s the story,\u201d Zemore said. \u201cWe were really interested in whether the effects of involvement on recovery outcomes depended on which group [participants] were in. And we found that they did not.\u201d\n\nThere were some differences in the data. People who reported SMART as their primary group seemed to have worse substance use outcomes, and there were lower odds of total abstinence among LifeRing members.\n\nThat might have something to do with differences in recovery goals. For example, AA really emphasizes total abstinence from drinking as the solution to alcohol addiction. Groups like SMART and LifeRing, meanwhile, can be friendlier to the idea of members moderating their drinking but not quitting altogether. That could affect substance use outcomes \u2014 and especially abstinence outcomes.\n\nThe study\u2019s survey data suggests this is in fact what was going on: When researchers controlled for people\u2019s recovery goals \u2014 meaning, whether they wanted to commit to lifetime total abstinence or not \u2014 the differences between the 12-step groups, SMART, and LifeRing went away.\n\n\u201cThat suggests that people with less commitment to lifetime total abstinence are more likely to participate in SMART and LifeRing than they are to participate in 12-step groups,\u201d Zemore said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing these associations between SMART and LifeRing affiliation at baseline and worse recovery outcomes when you control for involvement.\u201d She added, \u201cBut I want to emphasize that these go away when you control for recovery goals.\u201d\n\nAgain, the study is not the final word. John Kelly, an addiction researcher at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the study, told me that the study is \u201cgood news, in general,\u201d but pointed out that it\u2019s limited by its methodology: It\u2019s based on an online survey, not the kind of randomized trial that\u2019s typically the gold standard in research. That may have led to some potentially biased results \u2014 perhaps participants in specific groups were less likely to report bad outcomes, for instance.\n\nAnd since it\u2019s only one study, it\u2019s possible that the results were biased in some other way. So it\u2019s up to future research to verify the findings.\n\nOne tricky thing with this line of research is you can\u2019t really force people to participate in certain groups \u2014 so studies that randomly assign participants to AA, SMART, LifeRing, or Women for Sobriety may not be easy to do. But there are ways that researchers could get around these problems, such as only using participants who are willing to try different groups and actively following up with them to make sure they are actually participating.\n\nAnother big research question: figuring out why, exactly, these groups might work to help people stay alcohol- or drug-free. There\u2019s good research into how AA works, but it\u2019d be good to figure out if SMART, LifeRing, and Women for Sobriety work in a similar way. That, Zemore said, will be one of her goals in future studies.\n\nWhy we need alternatives\n\nIn discussions about addiction treatment, AA and the 12 steps tend to prompt polarizing reactions \u2014 some people swear by the programs, others absolutely hate them.\n\nThere\u2019s a good explanation for that: While the research shows that 12-step treatment can be as effective as professional treatment modalities like cognitive behavioral therapy, the research also shows that the 12 steps don\u2019t work for everyone.\n\nAs one example, a prominent complaint about 12-step programs is the spiritual aspect. This is a big part of the 12 steps, with the final step even invoking \u201ca spiritual awakening.\u201d For people who aren\u2019t religious or spiritual, this can be a big turn-off; that\u2019s one reason SMART and LifeRing exist to begin with \u2014 they\u2019re meant to be secular alternatives to the 12 steps.\n\nThe good news is that the research suggests the spiritual aspect doesn\u2019t fully explain why the 12 steps are effective for some people. Instead, it seems other traits are just as, if not more, important \u2014 such as the social support that AA meetings provide and the lessons that participants can pick up at meetings.\n\nThat\u2019s long led researchers to suspect that alternative mutual help groups could work. If so, that would let some people go to AA meetings if they prefer the 12 steps, while others could find SMART, LifeRing, Women for Sobriety, or something else that works for them. Basically, everyone could find a workable solution.\n\nProviding these alternatives would essentially move addiction treatment closer to other kinds of medical problems. As Keith Humphreys, a drug policy expert at Stanford University, previously told me, \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything that works for everybody. There\u2019s very few places in medicine where you do.\u201d So there need to be as many alternatives as possible.\n\nThe US is far from that at the moment. Most treatment facilities in America are, according to the survey data and research, at least partly based on the 12 steps \u2014 making it the only option for many people. While alternatives like SMART or LifeRing do exist, they\u2019re not nearly as available as AA \u2014 and they certainly aren\u2019t built into professional treatment programs in the same way as the 12 steps.\n\nAs Albert, a pseudonym for an AA member in Georgia, previously told me, \u201cThere\u2019s just not a lot of widely advertised options available.\u201d AA and 12-step treatment are \u201cthe most well-known and most recommended option, so that\u2019s kind of where you tend to go.\u201d\n\nZemore\u2019s study begins to peel away at this problem. By showing that there really might be other effective options out there, the research provides hope that there may be a better \u2014 or at least more complete \u2014 solution out there for alcohol addiction.\n\nFor more on the research into AA and the 12 steps, read Vox\u2019s explainer.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story clearly goes beyond any news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Measuring blood levels of the recently discovered hormone irisin may improve diagnosis rates of teenagers with polycystic ovary syndrome, according to research presented today at the 55th Annual European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology Meeting\n\nMeasuring blood levels of the recently discovered hormone irisin may improve diagnosis rates of teenagers with polycystic ovary syndrome, according to research presented today at the 55th Annual European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology Meeting. The findings may reduce the number of unnecessary treatments prescribed to otherwise healthy girls.\n\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder affecting up to 12% of women. Women with PCOS are more likely to suffer from irregular periods, have excessive levels of male hormones and may have difficulty in conceiving due to irregularities in the ovaries. Doctors are cautious when diagnosing PCOS in teenagers because the symptoms can be confused with normal pubertal changes. Having tools that make diagnoses more accurate can reduce unnecessary treatment for otherwise healthy teenagers at a critical stage in their lives.\n\nThe cause of PCOS is unknown and there is currently no cure for the condition. Previous studies have associated high levels of irisin, a newly discovered hormone which is released from muscles and regulates energy metabolism, with PCOS in adults.\n\nIn this study, Greek researchers from Aghia Sophia Children's Hospital in Athens compared the hormones of 23 teenagers with PCOS with 17 healthy teenagers of the same age and BMI. They found that teenagers with PCOS had significantly higher irisin levels compared to the control group, and that this was associated with higher levels of the male sex hormone testosterone, a key marker of PCOS.\n\nThe findings suggest that irisin could be a marker for PCOS allowing the condition to be diagnosed more easily. \"Teenagers who get an early diagnosis of PCOS can sooner start to deal with the physical and psychological symptoms caused by this lifelong condition,\" said lead researcher Dr Flora Bacopoulou. \"Whether it's through counselling or medication, girls can manage their symptoms and decrease the risk of further complications such as fertility problems, hirsutism (excessive hair growth) and type-2 diabetes\".\n\nThe group will next focus on confirming their results and investigate the biological role of irisin in PCOS. \"If high irisin levels in teenagers with PCOS is established, this could lead to the development of treatments for PCOS. Lifestyle changes and different exercise-related signals that regulate the secretion of irisin could provide a potential option for the management of PCOS. The potential of irisin as a meaningful drug target in PCOS is very promising,\" said Dr Bacopoulou.", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "The release uses language responsibly.

The company expects a decision by May.\n\nThe drug has been available in Europe and Canada for several years.\n\nTwo other oral medications indicated to treat uterine fibroids are also in development. Bayer launched a phase 3 clinical trial\u2014usually the final trial used by regulators to decide whether to approve a drug\u2014for a similar drug, vilaprisan, in the summer. And AbbeVie is in the midst of phase 3 trials for elagolix to treat uterine fibroids and endometriosis, a disorder in which the tissue that lines the inside of the uterus grows outside of it, causing pelvic pain. The company hopes to have a product available by 2020.\n\nUterine fibroids are benign tumors that grow in and around the uterus. It\u2019s estimated that as many as 26 million women in the U.S. have one or more such tumors, though less than half experience symptoms. The most common symptom is long and excessive bleeding during menstrual periods, which can lead to anemia and the need for blood transfusions. Other symptoms can include pelvic pain or pressure, a swollen abdomen and frequent urination. Fibroids can also cause fertility and pregnancy problems, depending on their size and location.\n\nThe cause of fibroids remains unknown, though those with a family history have an increased risk of developing them. Dietary factors may also play a role. African-American women have a higher rate of uterine fibroids. If a woman has no symptoms, treatment of fibroids isn\u2019t necessary, experts say.\n\nWhile a hysterectomy is the most common way to treat fibroid tumors, women who still want to have children can have a myomectomy. That surgery removes fibroids while keeping the uterus intact. But fibroids can grow back after the procedure. A number of other minimally invasive procedures are less commonly used and usually not recommended for women who want to have children. There\u2019s some chance of recurrence with most of them.\n\nUA belongs to a group of drugs called selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRM). They block the progesterone from feeding the fibroids, which causes them to shrink.\n\n\u201cThis particular drug also works directly on the lining of the uterus\u2014the endometrium\u2014so it also quite fast and dramatically decreases and stops the vaginal bleeding,\u201d says Ayman Al-Hendy, director of interdisciplinary translational research at Augusta University in Georgia and a member of Allergan\u2019s advisory board. Bleeding is reduced within five to six days, he says. Headaches and hot flashes were the most common side effects in the trials with UA, affecting less than 10% of women.\n\nPatients take the once-a-day pill for three months and then stop for one menstrual cycle to allow the endometrium to shed, since the medication makes it grow thicker. Dr. Al-Hendy says the changes to the endometrium don\u2019t raise the risk of endometrial cancer, which some have raised as a concern.\n\nPatients with the condition say it\u2019s time for better treatments.\n\nTanika Gray Valbrun, a 39-year-old network news producer in Atlanta, says she welcomes less invasive treatments that don\u2019t affect fertility. She started the White Dress Project, a nonprofit patient advocacy group for women with uterine fibroids, in 2014.\n\nShe was diagnosed with fibroids at 19. She has suffered from pelvic pain, abdominal bloating that has resulted in people mistakenly thinking she\u2019s pregnant and extremely heavy bleeding that has left her anemic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had five blood transfusions because of the amount of blood I\u2019ve lost,\u201d she says.\n\nShe has tried different types of birth control, but none helped with her symptoms. In 2013 she had a myomectomy and doctors removed 27 fibroids, keeping her out of work for nine weeks. Four years later, the fibroids are back.\n\nVanessa Jacoby, an associate professor in the department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at University of California, San Francisco, conducts research in new fibroid treatments.\n\nShe says UA appears to have fewer side effects than Lupron, the only medication, an injectable, available in the U.S. that shrinks fibroids. Lupron effectively puts women into early menopause, which can result in hot flashes and bone loss. Women often must take it with hormone replacement therapy. It is usually used in preparation for surgery to shrink fibroids and maintain blood reserves.\n\nWhile the company has done studies of women taking the drug up to a year, some experts believe the long-term health profile of a drug needs to be evaluated up to seven years, Dr. Jacoby says.\n\nShao-Lee Lin, vice president of therapeutic areas and international development at AbbVie , says the company is testing a twice daily dosing of elagolix. It is also studying including low-dose hormone therapy within elagolix to help maintain bone health.\n\nLike Lupron, elagolix decreases sex hormones that cause fibroids to grow. What makes it different is it\u2019s fast-acting and easier to reverse the effects if you stop taking it.\n\nStudies have found it significantly reduces heavy menstrual bleeding and decreases the thickness of the endometrium by six months. It also decreases the size of fibroids.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story includes comments from two experts and it appears as though the second one had no involvement with the study.

The women who took the 10-week stress-management class shortly after surgery reported feeling better and having fewer depressive symptoms such as anxiety than those who took a one-day, breast-cancer education session.\n\nThe women felt better one year after the course, five years later, and \u2014 according to a new study published last month in the journal Cancer \u2014 an average of 11 years later. (Stagl and her colleagues tracked down 100 of the original participants; another 30 had died; and 110 couldn\u2019t be found or didn\u2019t want to participate.)\n\nThe positive results surprised even Stagl. \u201cIt\u2019s quite amazing,\u201d she said.\n\nStagl doesn\u2019t know whether the women are still using the techniques they were taught \u2014 which include mindfulness, deep breathing, visual imagery, cognitive behavioral therapy, and learning how to ask for help from friends and family.

The test is administered like a tuberculin skin test (TST), and results are interpreted by measuring the size of the skin induration two or three days later.\n\nThe TST is the most commonly used test to detect TB infection, with about 50 million tests worldwide each year, according to the World Health Organization. The test is easy to administer but produces too many false positives to achieve the WHO's goal of reducing TB deaths by 95 percent and new cases by 90 percent by 2035, Dr. Ruhwald said.\n\nIntroduced a decade ago, IGRAs have high specificity, producing few false positives, but require blood samples and complicated lab work, which has limited their widespread use. There is also a dramatic price difference between the two diagnostic tests. According to Dr. Ruhwald, a TST costs about $2; an IGRA is 20 to 40 times more expensive depending on setting.\n\nIn the first clinical trial, Dr. Ruhwald and colleagues conducted a double-blinded study of C-Tb in 979 participants enrolled at 13 clinical trial sites in Spain. Participants, all adults, ranged in TB status from presumed uninfected through intermediate and high risk of latent TB to active disease.\n\u2022 Both C-Tb and the IGRA had a specificity of 97 percent.\n\u2022 C-Tb was highly concordant to IGRA in 95 percent of study participants.\n\u2022 The specificity of C-Tb, unlike the TST, was not impacted by the BCG vaccine, the partially effective vaccine that many residents in the developing world receive. TST specificity in this group was only 62 percent.\n\u2022 The sensitivity of C-Tb was comparable to the IGRA in confirmed TB cases (77 percent vs. 81 percent), indicating similar abilities to detect infection.\n\nIn the second double-blinded trial, researchers were primarily concerned with testing how accurate C-Tb was in HIV-positive patients and in young children--populations in which the accuracy of the TST and the IGRA is known to be compromised. The study, conducted in South Africa, enrolled 1,090 participants, including 299 patients with HIV and 402 children as young as 28 days.\n\u2022 Among participants with HIV, the ability of all three tests to detect TB infection was diminished, though the C-Tb appeared more robust in HIV-infected participants with low CD4 T cell counts.\n\u2022 Among children under 5, C-Tb was comparable with the other two tests in identifying those infected.\n\nDr. Ruhwald said another advantage of C-Tb is that the measurement of infection, a 5mm or larger induration, is universal across patients with different risk factors, including HIV infection. With TST, the size of the induration is often adjusted to increase its accuracy in measuring infection in different patient populations.\n\nRegulatory approval for C-Tb is currently being sought and Statens Serum Institute is actively seeking a commercial partner for marketing of C-Tb. The cost of a C-Tb test is to be determined; however, it is expected to be significantly less than an IGRA.\n\nDiagnostic Accuracy of the Novel C-Tb Skin Test for Latent M.tuberculosis Infection; Results from Two Phase III Clinical Trials \n\nM.

C-Tb combines the field friendliness of the PPD-based Tuberculin Skin Test (TST), with the high specificity of the interferon gamma release assays (IGRA).\n\nThis presentation outlines the results from two recently completed phase III trials (TESEC-05 and -06). The results have not previously been published or presented.\n\nThe TESEC-06 trial included 979 participants from 13 clinical trial sites in Catalonia, Galicia and Basque Country (Spain) with various risk profiles of M.tuberculosis infection. The TESEC-05 trial included 1090 participants with symptoms of TB and 100 endemic controls from Cape Town (South Africa).\n\nIn both trials C-Tb and TST were administered in a double-blinded fashion to one or the other forearm. Skin indurations were read 2 to 3 days later. A reading ?5mm was considered positive for the TST and C-Tb (cut off preset in phase II). Blood for IGRA testing (Quantiferon, QFT-GIT) was drawn prior to skin testing.\n\nThe safety profile of C-Tb was acceptable and not different from TST. Test specificity was assessed in 212 presumed unexposed Spanish controls. Here, C-Tb had comparable specificity to QFT-GIT (both 97%, p=1.0, and there was no impact of BCG vaccination). By contrast, previous BCG vaccination subverted TST specificity [62% (67/108) in BCG vaccinated compared to 95% (99/104) in BCG unvaccinated persons; (p<0.001)]. Sensitivity of C-Tb and QFT-GIT was comparable in patients with confirmed TB [77% (235/307) vs 81% (250/307); p=0.08]. In contacts, mirroring the findings with QFT-GIT, there was a strong trend in increasing C-Tb test positivity with M. tuberculosis exposure (figure 1). The impact of age and HIV infection on C-Tb, TST and QFT reactivity was assessed in 1090 individuals with symptoms suspect of TB disease, analysis is ongoing and will be included in the presentation.\n\nThese phase III trial results demonstrate that C-Tb is safe, has comparable diagnostic performance to QFT-GIT and addresses the problem of false positive TST results in BCG vaccinated persons.\n\nThe field-friendliness and high specificity offered by the C-Tb test could allow for improved targeted treatment of M. tuberculosis-infected persons in also in resource-constrained settings, where IGRAs are too complicated to implement.", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "The release does not appear to use any unjustifiable language.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "WEDNESDAY, Oct. 26, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental psoriasis treatment performed significantly better than the commonly prescribed medication methotrexate in a new clinical trial.\n\nThe drug briakinumab reduced psoriasis symptoms by at least 75 percent in nearly 82 percent of those taking it, compared to just 40 percent of those on methotrexate.

The disease causes patches of thick, red, inflamed skin that have silvery scales. Psoriasis can affect any part of the body, including the skin, nails, genitals and inside the mouth, according to NIAMS.\n\nThe current study included 317 people with moderate to severe psoriasis. The study volunteers had had psoriasis for at least six months, and the condition affected at least 10 percent of their bodies.\n\nNearly half of the study participants were randomly selected to receive injections of briakinumab at a dose of 200 milligrams (mg) for the first and fourth week of the study, and 100 mg at week eight and every four weeks thereafter. The study lasted one year. The remaining volunteers were given between 5 mg and 25 mg of oral methotrexate weekly.\n\nAfter six months, nearly 82 percent of those in the briakinumab group had at least a 75 percent improvement in the psoriasis area-and-severity index (PASI), a commonly used measurement to assess the severity of psoriasis. Slightly less than 40 percent of those on methotrexate had a 75 percent improvement in their PASI score, according to the study.\n\nAfter a year, about 66 percent of those taking briakinumab had a 75 percent improvement in their PASI score compared to almost 24 percent for those on methotrexate, according to the study.\n\nBriakinumab works by dampening the immune system response that causes psoriasis, said Bruce Bebo, director of research and medical programs for the National Psoriasis Foundation, based in Portland, Ore.\n\nMore serious infections were seen in people taking briakinumab (2.6 percent) vs. those taking methotrexate (1.8 percent). There were also two cases of cancer in people taking briakinumab and none in the methotrexate group.

It published the new guidelines today in the Annals of Internal Medicine. \"And on the other side, the risks are large and dramatic.\"\n\nThe task force and other groups concluded previously that it was unclear whether the benefits of the prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, test outweigh the risks. The new review of the scientific literature found no evidence to alter that assessment for younger men. It did find enough new data to recommend for the first time against screening for older men.\n\n\"We felt with sufficient certainty that your risk of being harmed exceeded your potential benefits starting at age 75,\" Calonge said.\n\nThe recommendations come at a time when doctors are increasingly questioning whether many tests, drugs and procedures are being overused, unnecessarily driving up health-care costs and exposing patients to the risks of unneeded treatment.\n\n\"There is this idea that more is always better, and if a test is available we should use it,\" said Howard A. Brody, a professor of family medicine at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. \"A lot of times, we're doing more harm than good.\"\n\nThe guidelines address perhaps the most important and contentious issue in men's health, and were praised by officials at several leading medical groups, including the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society. But they drew strong criticism from others who are convinced that routine screening is necessary.\n\n\"I think they're really missing the boat,\" said William J. Catalona, a professor of urology at Northwestern University. \"It's a disservice to patients. A lot of men die from prostate cancer, and there's just an overwhelming amount of evidence that screening saves lives.\"\n\nEach year, prostate cancer is diagnosed in more than 218,000 U.S. men. About 28,000 die of it, making it the most common cancer and second-leading cancer killer among men.\n\nThe PSA test, which measures a protein in the blood produced by prostate tissue, has significantly increased the number of prostate cancer cases being diagnosed at very early stages. But it remains unclear whether that translates into a reduction in the death rate from the disease. Prostate cancer often grows so slowly that many men die from something else without ever knowing they had it.\n\nBecause it is not clear precisely what PSA level signals the presence of cancer, many men experience stressful false alarms that lead to unnecessary surgical biopsies to make a definitive diagnosis, which can be painful and in rare cases can cause serious complications.\n\nEven when the test picks up a real cancer, doctors are uncertain what, if anything, men should do about it. Many men simply are monitored closely to see if the tumor shows signs of growing or spreading. Others undergo surgery, radiation and hormone treatments, which often leave them incontinent, impotent and experiencing other complications.\n\n\"People say, 'What's the harm in screening?' In fact, there are several ways in which screening can actually be harmful,\" said Howard L. Parnes of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nSince the task force issued its previous recommendations in 2002, at least eight new studies have been published. Among them was a large Swedish review that found that men age 65 and older who were treated for prostate cancer were no more likely to survive than those who were not.\n\n\"If therapy isn't providing meaningful benefit, then how could screening provide benefit?\" Calonge said. \"And we know that the therapy produces significant harms.\"\n\nMen younger than 75 should be carefully counseled about the potential risks associated with the test and the lack of evidence about any benefit before getting it, the panel said.\n\nMen at high risk for prostate cancer, such as African Americans and those with a family history of the disease, are the most likely to benefit from PSA screening. But the panel concluded that the evidence remains inconclusive for those men as well.\n\nSeveral other experts said that the new recommendations strike a careful balance, and that they hope they might discourage large-scale screenings where the risks and benefits are not carefully laid out.\n\n\"I think they are right on target,\" Parnes said.\n\nOthers were highly critical, noting that prostate cancer death rates have plummeted in many countries after they instituted widespread PSA screening.\n\n\"We have seen a dramatic drop in mortality,\" said J. Brantley Thrasher, chairman of the urology department at the University of Kansas and a spokesman for the American Urological Association. \"They're not paying attention to that.\"\n\nOthers objected to setting an age cutoff, saying men should be evaluated individually.\n\n\"Men are living a lot longer and healthier these days. I play golf with 84-year-old guys who beat me all the time,\" said E. David Crawford, a professor of surgery and radiation at the University of Colorado at Denver. \"You have to individualize treatment. If a 75-year-old man is found to have high-grade prostate cancer, it's going to kill him, and we can intervene and do something for him.\"\n\nTwo large studies are underway -- one in the United States and one in Europe -- to answer the question of whether screening reduces mortality.\n\n\"If it turns out that PSA screening and aggressive treatment saves lives, maybe all the harm that it has caused is worth it,\" said Otis W. Brawley, chief medical officer at the American Cancer Society. \"If PSA screening does not save lives, then it's clearly not worth it.

Older adults who did the basic exercises followed by later sessions were three times as fast as those who got only the initial sessions when it came to activities of daily living, such as reacting to a road sign, looking up a number in a telephone book or checking the ingredients on a medicine bottle -- abilities that can spell the difference between living independently and needing help.\n\nExperts said the federally funded study is a call to action for anyone who has ever worried about developing Alzheimer's, dementia and similar disorders. Americans spend billions of dollars each year on their physical well-being, but there are no comparable efforts to keep people mentally agile and strong.\n\nIf anything, the study suggests, there is a bigger payoff to mental exercise, because the brief training sessions seemed to confer enormous benefits as many as five years later. That would be as if someone went to the gym Monday through Friday for the first two weeks of the new year, did no exercise for five years, and still saw significant physical benefits in 2012.\n\nThe researchers divided the volunteers into four groups, including a control group that received no training. A second group was trained in reasoning skills -- being asked to spot the pattern in the sequence \"a, c, e, g, i,\" for example -- every other letter of the alphabet. A third group was taught memory skills, which involved remembering word lists and using visualizations and associations as memory aids. A fourth group was given exercises to speed up mental processing -- being asked to identify an object flashed briefly on a computer screen while fighting off distractions.\n\nEach of the groups being trained had 10 sessions, each lasting an hour to 75 minutes, and each session presented progressively more challenging problems. Compared with the control group, those who got memory training did 75 percent better on memory tasks five years later, those who got the reasoning training did 40 percent better on reasoning tasks, and those who got the speed training did 300 percent better than the control group.\n\nResearchers noted that mental skills can sometimes compensate for physical disabilities: Knowing how to figure out directions and find a new route on a map, for example, could allow someone to retain mobility even after their night vision deteriorates to the point where driving on certain roads becomes difficult.\n\nThe study tracked 2,802 healthy adults from diverse backgrounds who were, on average, 73 years old. Although it did not examine the effects of mental exercise on people who had begun to show signs of Alzheimer's or other brain disorders, previous studies have pointed toward the conclusion that anyone can benefit.\n\n\"People think education is for people who are already educated,\" said Michael Marsiske, one of the researchers. \"This kind of training works no matter where you are in society.\"\n\n\"If you think you have come to a time in your life when new learning is impossible and there are no benefits of continuing mental activity, the study shows that for a large number of people that this is not true,\" added Marsiske, a clinical and health psychologist at the University of Florida at Gainesville.\n\nThe participants in the study ranged from age 65 to their early 90s, but Marsiske said the findings apply to people in their 50s or even younger. Mental skills acquired earlier in life persist well into old age, he said.\n\n\"I don't like to play my son's video games, but I keep telling myself to challenge myself,\" said Marsiske, 41. \"What I personally take away from the study is, if you challenge yourself to do some new learning, something that isn't easy at the start, it can have dividends.\"\n\nThe study did not indicate that mental training can hold off all cognitive decline permanently. Rather, as is the case with physical exercise, strengthening the mind appeared to slow decline.\n\nSherry L. Willis, the lead author of the study and a Pennsylvania State University professor of human development, said those who had the training also reported greater confidence in their ability to solve everyday problems, and this was especially true of the group that got the reasoning training. In performing daily functions, people who got the speed training along with a handful of follow-up sessions significantly outperformed those who did not get such training.\n\nThe results, being published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association, are heartening, but Willis and Marsiske cautioned that the biggest challenge lies ahead, in getting people to apply the findings to their lives. Whether it is encouraging people to eat right or to exercise, they said, the hardest part is not getting them to start doing the right things but getting them to keep doing the right things.\n\n\"It's just like physical exercise -- when we are approaching the new year we will buy a pass for the gym and go fervently in January and then slack off,\" Willis said. \"Mental exercise is the same way. It has to be consistent, and it has to be challenging. Just like you have to keep increasing the weights at the gym to make it challenging, you have to do the same with mental activity.\"\n\nTo reap the benefits, Willis said, people need to get outside their comfort zones. For someone who likes to solve crossword puzzles, it is important to make sure the puzzles get harder with time -- or to start playing chess. Someone who hates to play games, she said, should find something else that stretches the mind. Mental activities do not have to involve expensive toys; everyday life can offer a variety of mental challenges. Finding a friend who can join in a new activity can be a powerful motivator, she added.\n\nSally Shumaker, a professor of public health science at Wake Forest University in North Carolina who wrote an editorial accompanying the study, said it pointed the way to a future in which mental training is made widely available.\n\n\"I can imagine a situation in which facilities are available in community centers and libraries and aging centers, where people can play some games that are specifically designed to improve cognitive ability,\" she said. \"People are fearful of cognitive decline, and the idea that a small and simple intervention can have an impact is pretty compelling.\"", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "Does not appear to rely on a press release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The Pomegranate is hot.

For the most advanced patients, 50 percent survival was the norm, whether patients had surgery to totally remove the voice box or alternative treatment with chemotherapy and radiation to try to avoid surgery.\n\nBut the head and neck oncology team at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center came up with a different approach: Give patients a single dose of chemotherapy and see who responds to it. The responders can continue with combination chemotherapy and radiation. The non-responders can be referred immediately for surgery.\n\nAfter a decade of using this approach, researchers are reporting \"exceptional\" survival rates nearing 80 percent, even for the most advanced patients. The team published their outcomes in JAMA Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery.\n\n\"In trying to match the biology of the tumor to the treatment, all of the patients get better outcomes,\" says study author Gregory T. Wolf, M.D., professor and chair emeritus of otolaryngology - head and neck surgery at Michigan Medicine.\n\n\"This approach allows us to enhance quality of life for all of our patients. Many patients can spare their voice box by having chemotherapy and radiation. But that's only good if the treatment works. For patients who must go on to receive surgery, by selecting them up front, we can spare them the complications that may occur when the voice box is removed following multiple cycles of chemotherapy with radiation,\" adds study author Francis Worden, M.D., professor of hematology/oncology.\n\nThe Michigan Medicine team first tested the idea in 1995. They found that patients whose tumor shrunk by more than half after one round of chemotherapy were more likely to do well with chemotherapy and radiation and have an excellent chance of saving their voice box. If the tumor did not respond after that first dose, patients would likely fail on the chemotherapy and would do better going straight to surgery.\n\nIn a clinical trial, they saw disease-specific survival rates of 80 percent in patients with advanced disease. This was unheard of. And it wasn't just those who responded to the chemotherapy. The non-responders who were immediately referred for surgery had better outcomes too.\n\n\"We adopted the treatment approach and started offering it to all our laryngeal cancer patients,\" Wolf says. As part of a Specialized Program of Research Excellence, or SPORE, grant, the team was already maintaining long-term follow-up data on patients. Wolf suggested they look back and see if they were still maintaining such strong outcomes with this approach. The results surprised even him.\n\nOver 10 years, 153 stage 3 and 4 laryngeal cancer patients were treated at Michigan Medicine, with about half receiving the induction chemotherapy. The remainder elected to proceed straight to surgery or chemo-radiation without the induction dose.\n\nAverage disease specific survival at five years for the induction chemotherapy patients was 79 percent - equivalent to the results in patients with early stage disease, and significantly better than the 66 percent survival for patients who had chemo-radiation without the induction strategy.\n\n\"This adds ammunition to the idea that we need to pick individual therapies more carefully. Both chemo-radiation and surgery are difficult treatments with their share of challenging long-term effects. But if we tailor treatments to the individual biology of the tumor and characteristics of the patient, we'll get the best results,\" Wolf says.\n\nThe study did find lower functional preservation of the larynx in the induction chemotherapy group compared to those who elected chemoradiation. Two-thirds of the induction group achieved organ preservation, while more than three-quarters of the chemo-radiation patients did.\n\nWolf notes, however, that chemoradiation often severely damages the larynx, which may cause problems with eating or swallowing years later.\n\nThe induction approach can be done anywhere, but requires intense collaboration among surgeons, medical oncologists and radiation oncologists. All three must be involved to assess the patient and refer to the appropriate therapy.\n\nEven that single dose of chemotherapy can be debilitating and toxic for some patients.

The results of this pilot study, published in the peer-reviewed journal European Neuropsychopharmacology, suggest that this may become an effective medical treatment for patients with cocaine addiction, although a larger trial is needed to confirm the initial findings.\n\nCocaine use is widespread in the Western World. Last year, 2.3 million young Europeans (aged 15 to 34) used cocaine, and the US National Institute on Drug Abuse estimates that 1.4 million Americans suffer from cocaine addiction1. There is no effective drug treatment for cocaine addiction, with behavioural therapies being the main element of any treatment regime. Now a group of researchers working in Italy and the USA have shown in a preliminary clinical study that cocaine use can be reduced by treatment with rTMS (repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation).\n\nAs author, Dr Antonello Bonci (Scientific Director, National Institute on Drug Abuse, and Adjunct Professor, John Hopkins University, Baltimore) said:\n\n\"Despite the fact that more than 20 million people worldwide suffer from cocaine use disorders2, there are no effective neurobiological treatments for patients with this devastating condition\".\n\nThe practical work was conducted by team of scientists led by Dr Luigi Gallimberti, from the University of Padova Medical School, Italy, who enrolled 32 patients who were seeking treatment for cocaine addiction at the hospital clinic. The participating patients were randomized to receive either rTMS or standard symptom-relieving medications.\n\nThe experimental group received one rTMS session per day for five days, and then once a week for the following three weeks, for a total of 8 TMS sessions over 29 days. Those in the control group received pharmacological treatment for symptoms associated with cocaine addiction (such as depression, anxiety and sleep problems). The study indicated the safety of rTMS in patients with cocaine addiction. There was significantly less craving and there were a significantly higher number of cocaine-free urine drug tests in the rTMS compared to the control group. In addition, 69% (11/16) patients) in the experimental group showed no relapse to cocaine use, whereas only 19% (3/16) patients) in the control group showed a similar positive result (the results are adjusted for patients who dropped out of the trial).\n\nDr Bonci said: \"rTMS is a non-invasive and very safe therapeutic approach which is used with other mental health and neurological conditions, such as depression and neuropathic pain. Our study suggests that rTMS may also represent a new treatment for patients with cocaine use disorder\".\n\nAt the end of the first 29 days of the experiment, the experimental group was given the option of continuing the treatment, whereas those in the control group were given the possibility of receiving the same rTMS treatment as the experimental group for 63 days. Results further confirmed the beneficial effects of rTMS in helping patients to maintain abstinence from cocaine.\n\nDr. Bonci continued: We consider this study promising but preliminary. We need to replicate the work in a bigger group of patients using sham-TMS as the control condition. As far as we know, this work represents the first clinical report indicating that rTMS treatment results in significant reduction in cocaine use. It is also important to emphasize that, in this study patients were seeking treatment for their cocaine addiction in a hospital setting: the group studied, albeit small, was a \"real world\" sample. We have continued to follow patients from the trial, and the improvement seems to be sustained over time, up to 12 months, although we don't have any hard data on that yet. It is important that this is taken forward to a larger trial.\n\nWe decided to target an area of the brain involved in decision making, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DL PFC). This was because previous animal studies from our lab had shown that compulsive cocaine-seeking was associated with hypoactivity in the prelimbic cortex, which is a brain area that shares similar behavioural roles to the DL PFC. Importantly, we had found that increasing the activity in the prelimbic cortex could significantly reduce cocaine self-administration\".\n\n\"This study represents a creative approach to a disorder that is notoriously difficult to treat in the real world.

During the study, caregivers used either acetaminophen (commonly known as Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) whenever a child needed pain relief or had a fever. None of the study investigators, children, or caregivers knew which study drug each child was receiving.\n\nThe study did not detect any worsening of asthma in the children treated with acetaminophen compared with those receiving ibuprofen. This was measured by asthma exacerbation rate, the number of days of asthma control, the need for rescue medications, and unscheduled medical visits for asthma. They also did not find any significant differences in safety between the two drugs.\n\nAsthmaNet is a nationwide clinical research network created by the NHLBI in 2009. The purpose of AsthmaNet is to develop and conduct multiple clinical trials that explore new approaches in treating asthma from childhood through adulthood. AsthmaNet studies are currently being conducted in 14 states. In the United States, more than 22 million people are known to have asthma.\n\nThe Division of Pediatric Pulmonology and Allergy/Immunology at UH Rainbow is currently recruiting for a number of asthma-related clinical trials.

The new vaccine offers significantly greater protection than the current vaccine, which protects against only two cancer causing types of HPV.\n\nA pivotal international clinical trial compared the safety and efficacy of the new vaccine, Gardasil 9, with the current vaccine, Gardasil, in more than 14,200 women aged between 16 and 26 years old. The findings indicate that if uninfected populations are vaccinated with Gardasil 9, approximately 90 per cent of all cervical cancers worldwide could be prevented.\n\nPublished in the New England Journal of Medicine, the study found that, among uninfected women, Gardasil 9 was 97 per cent effective at preventing high-grade cervical, vulvar and vaginal disease caused by HPV 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58, and was equally effective as the current Gardasil vaccine in preventing diseases caused by HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18.\n\nProfessor Jack Cuzick of Queen Mary University of London, who co-authored the report and participated in the design and analysis of the study, and served on the Trial Advisory Board, comments: \"This is a significant achievement. The new vaccine, Gardasil 9, is not only safe but will offer greatly improved protection against cervical and other cancers. Eventually this will mean less screening is needed, as women will have greater protection from the outset.\n\n\"Gardasil 9 offers the potential to increase overall cervical cancer prevention from 70 to 90 per cent, nearly eliminating this cancer among vaccinated women. However, it's crucial to remember that vaccination must be done before exposure to the virus. Our focus for prevention must be on girls aged 12-13, as the current UK vaccine programme is doing, but the vaccine may also be appropriate for women 25-45 as part of a screening appointment.\"\n\nUntil late last year, there were two available vaccines to protect against HPV related disease (Cervarix and Gardasil). The UK currently uses Gardasil which protects against four HPV types and offers about 70 per cent protection against cervical cancer, and also significantly reduces the risk of other types of cancer and genital warts.\n\nHowever, researchers have been trying to find methods to completely eliminate cervical cancer and other HPV related disease and by adding five more cancer related HPV types. The development of the new Gardasil 9 vaccine makes an important step in that direction.\n\nHPV is the most common sexually transmitted virus. Many people infected with HPV clear it from their systems with no lasting health concerns and some types of the virus are low risk, causing warts or verrucas. However, other types are high risk, causing cervical cancer (and less commonly vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal, and throat cancers). Almost all cases of cervical cancer occur as a result of infection with high risk types of HPV.\n\nCervical cancer is still the fourth most common cancer in women, with over 500,000 cases and 250,000 deaths per year worldwide. In the UK around 3,000 women a year are diagnosed with cervical cancer and in 2011 there were around 970 deaths.\n\nIn the UK, all girls aged 12 to 13 are offered HPV vaccination as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme.\n\nProfessor Jack Cuzick concludes: \"Following these important findings, this vaccine has been licenced in the USA and approval is currently being sought in the UK and other countries.

Those who do worse in the tests will be the ones most likely to succumb to Alzheimer\u2019s later in life, scientists now believe.\n\nBy identifying potential patients far earlier than is possible at present, researchers hope it should then become easier in the long term to develop treatments aimed at halting or slowing their condition.\n\n\u201cIt is usually thought memory is the first attribute affected in Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d said project leader Dennis Chan, a neuroscientist based at Cambridge University. \u201cBut difficulty with navigation is increasingly recognised as one of the very earliest symptoms. This may predate the onset of other symptoms.\n\n\u201cBy pinpointing those who are beginning to lose their navigational skills, we hope to show that we can target people at a much earlier stage of the condition and one day become far more effective in treating them.\u201d\n\nThe discovery that loss of navigational skills was associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease was made several years ago by Chan and colleagues based at several centres in the UK. These studies used tablet computers to test navigational tasks.\n\nBut now scientists plan to take their tests to a new level with the use of the virtual reality sets in which wearers are immersed in simulated environments through which they must navigate.\n\nAround 300 people, aged between 40 and 60, will be recruited to take part in the study.

In 2013 alone, according to the American Cancer Society, more than 230,000 were given that diagnosis. Each one very likely came as a devastating blow, both to the patient and to her family.\n\nBut what if some of these cases are preventable? What if there was a medication that could at least reduce a woman\u2019s risk of developing breast cancer?\n\nThe Breast Cancer Prevention Trial published results in 1998 indicating that women who took one of those drugs, tamoxifen, were half as likely to develop breast cancer as similar women who did not take the drug.\n\nOther medications, including raloxifene and a class of drugs called aromatese inhibitors, do much the same thing, though the Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved aromatese inhibitors for this use. Studies estimate that more than 2 million American women at high risk for breast cancer could benefit from taking a preventive drug.\n\nBut few women are opting for this protection, which goes by the name chemoprevention. A 2010 study found \u201cexceptionally low\u201d rates of usage.\n\nIn part this may be because many doctors are not even discussing this option with their patients. A small 2014 study in the Journal of Women\u2019s Health found that only 13 percent of internal medicine, family medicine and gynecology physicians reported having recommended or prescribed these medications to women who might benefit from them.\n\nThe \u201clow uptake of these medications is a missed opportunity,\u201d says Heidi Nelson, a professor of medical informatics and clinical epidemiology at the Oregon Health & Science University in Portland. \u201cMany high-risk women . . . could reduce their risks for invasive cancer by approximately 30 to 50 percent.\u201d On the other hand, these drugs don\u2019t suit everyone, and they are not without risks of their own. Because some of the side effects are serious \u2014 such as blood clots in the legs and in the lungs, and, in the case of tamoxifen, uterine cancer \u2014 only women who are deemed to be at high risk for the disease should consider them. But there are conflicting views on who meets that \u201chigh risk\u201d definition\n\nChemoprevention should not be confused with chemotherapy. Although both involve taking drugs, chemoprevention medications are taken with the goal of avoiding breast cancer altogether and the subsequent need for chemotherapy later.\n\nAnd they work on the body differently. Chemotherapy kills off cells, healthy ones as well as cancercous ones. The chemoprevention drugs, by contrast, work by blocking estrogen, a hormone known to promote the growth of cancer cells in breast tissue. Chemoprevention drugs are called SERMs, or selective estrogen receptor modulators, and two have been approved specifically for breast cancer prevention: tamoxifen, which was developed to treat breast cancer after its onset and only later was found to have a preventive benefit, and raloxifene, which was designed to treat osteoporosis.\n\nA 2013 study in the Lancet analyzed data for more than 80,000 women taking tamoxifen or other SERM drugs. The researchers found an overall 38 percent reduction in new cases of breast cancer 10 years after women took these drugs compared with women who took a placebo. The effect was even larger during the first five years of the study.\n\nInvestigators working for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent group of scientists and clinicians funded by the government, echoed these results. After looking at multiple trials of tamoxifen and raloxifene, the task force noted that these drugs reduced new cases of breast cancer significantly: from 23 cases per 1,000 women in the control groups to 16 cases per 1,000 women in the treatment groups.\n\nNelson, one of the lead authors of the analysis, is \u201cconfident\u201d that these results show a true benefit. Others are more cautious.\n\nKenneth Lin, a family physician at Georgetown University who worked on developing the task force\u2019s SERM guidelines, notes that while SERMs may have reduced new cases, they \u201chave not been shown to reduce breast cancer mortality in any study or meta-analysis.\u201d One possible explanation, he says, is that \u201cthese drugs are effective at preventing nonlethal cancers rather than the more serious ones.\u201d\n\nNot used enough?\n\nGiven that these drugs seem to offer some protection, why are they not in widespread use? Serious side effects is one reason. Beyond blood clots and uterine cancer, other known reactions to the drugs include strokes, cataracts, bone pain, hot flashes, nausea and vaginal dryness.\n\nFor some women, the risk of such side effects may be worth taking, depending on their particular odds of developing breast cancer. Those odds can be figured by using a commonly used calculator, often called the Gail model, that estimates a woman\u2019s chances of having breast cancer in a five-year period and over a lifetime.\n\nBut this is where it gets more complicated. While many experts agree that women at high risk should consider the medications, they do not agree on what Gail score should trigger that consideration.\n\nThe studies that served as the basis for the FDA approval of the drugs, along with recently released guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), set the threshold at a five-year Gail score of 1.67 percent.\n\nThe Preventive Services Task Force, however, recommended a threshold of 3 percent. At that point, the panel said, women \u201care likely to have more benefit than harm from using tamoxifen or raloxifene.\u201d\n\nASCO\u2019s lower cutoff worries some experts. \u201cAt the 1.67 percent high-risk threshold,\u201d Georgetown\u2019s Lin says, \u201cevery woman age 62 and older would be [considered] high-risk.\u201d That might lead to a situation in which millions of women would be encouraged, unnecessarily,to consider this therapy, along with its potential harmful effects.\n\nKala Visvanathan, the lead author of the ASCO recommendations and a faculty member at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, said the cutoffs provide only a rough estimate of risk.\n\nIt is important to realize, she adds, that \u201cas the risk increases, the benefits tend to be greater. This is an evolving field, and our goal is to better discern who is at high and low risk of breast cancer and develop a greater range of prevention strategies.\u201d\n\nAn individual risk analysis should prompt conversation between doctor and patient about the potential benefits and the risk of the therapy.\n\nBoth the ASCO and the task force guidelines recommend such a conversation. \u201cThe discussion should include the specific risks and benefits associated with each chemopreventive agent,\u201d according to ASCO.\n\nThe task force similarly recommends that \u201cclinicians engage in a shared, informed decision making\u201d with women and said that clinicians \u201cshould offer to prescribe\u201d these drugs. Many risk factors increase a woman\u2019s chances of having side effects. These factors include older age, obesity, having a history of a blood clot, history of any cancer, immobility, history of certain autoimmune conditions, history of using estrogen or oral contraceptives and history of some form of heart disease.\n\nInsured women with a high risk for breast cancer and a low risk for side effects who try this therapy will not incur out-of-pocket costs, because this treatment was included in the Affordable Care Act as mandated, no-charge preventive care.\n\nSo what should a woman do?\n\nMost important, become familiar with your family history, know your risk factors and discuss them with your primary-care physician. Age and family history cannot be controlled, but lifestyle changes \u2014 including eating a healthful diet, exercising, not smoking and not overconsuming alcohol \u2014 are eminently doable and can reduce your risk. These basic tenets of leading a healthy lifestyle have been shown to be important factors in breast cancer prevention.\n\nVisvanathan and her colleagues are hopeful that more women will be aware of this option.\n\n\u201cA discussion on the use of preventive agents needs to become part of routine care in women at high risk,\u201d she says. \u201cWe should begin to implement preventive strategies based on what we already know.\u201d\n\nMishori is an associate professor of family medicine at the Georgetown University School of Medicine and director of the Health & Media fellowship.

The study included 18,201 people in 1,034 clinical sites in 39 countries and was consistent worldwide, the sponsors said. Although the study was financed by the drug makers, which raises the issue of bias, it met the gold standard for medical research as a randomized, double-blinded trial in which doctors and patients did not know who took which pill until the end.

As many as 12 million people will have it by 2020 because of an aging population with longer life expectancy. The arrhythmia in the left upper chamber of the heart can cause slow blood flow and clots, raising the risk of stroke by four to six times on average, the government says.\n\nAs many as half of people with the condition, however, are untreated, by varying estimates. Warfarin, a cheap 60-year-old drug sold generically under the brand name Coumadin, requires frequent blood tests to monitor its active level and interacts with some other drugs and foods, including leafy greens.

Chan School of Public Health, the U.S. National Cancer Institute, and more than 20 other medical centers and organizations finds that higher circulating vitamin D concentrations are significantly associated with lower colorectal cancer risk. This study strengthens the evidence, previously considered inconclusive, for a protective relationship. Optimal vitamin D concentrations for colorectal cancer prevention may be higher than the current National Academy of Medicine recommendations, which are based only on bone health. The study appears online in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nVitamin D, known for its role in maintaining bone health, is hypothesized to lower colorectal cancer risk via several pathways related to cell growth and regulation. Previous prospective studies have reported inconsistent results for whether higher concentrations of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the accepted measure of vitamin D status, are linked to lower risk of colorectal cancer. The few randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation and colorectal cancer completed thus far have not shown an effect; but study size, supplementation duration, and compliance may have contributed to their null findings.\n\n\"To address inconsistencies in prior studies on vitamin D and to investigate associations in population subgroups, we analyzed participant-level data, collected before colorectal cancer diagnosis, from 17 prospective cohorts and used standardized criteria across the studies,\" said Stephanie Smith-Warner, PhD, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and co-senior author on the article. The analysis included over 5,700 colorectal cancer cases and 7,100 controls from the United States, Europe, and Asia. A single, widely accepted assay and laboratory was used for new vitamin D measurements and calibration of existing vitamin D measurements. \"In the past, substantial differences between assays made it difficult to integrate vitamin D data from different studies,\" explained Regina G. Ziegler, PhD, a National Cancer Institute epidemiologist and co-senior author on the article. \"This calibration approach enabled us to systematically explore risk over the broad range of vitamin D levels seen internationally.\"\n\nCompared to participants with circulating vitamin D concentrations considered sufficient for bone health, those with deficient concentrations of vitamin D had a 31% higher risk of colorectal cancer during follow-up, which averaged 5.5 years (range: 1 - 25 years). Similarly, concentrations above bone health sufficiency were associated with a 22% lower risk. However, risk did not continue to decline at the highest concentrations. These associations persisted even after adjusting for known colorectal cancer risk factors. Protective associations were seen in all subgroups examined. However, the association was noticeably stronger in women than men at concentrations above bone health sufficiency. The lifetime risk of colorectal cancer is 4.2% (1 in 24) in women and 4.5% (1 in 22) in men. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women in the United States, with about 140,250 new cases and 50,630 deaths expected during 2018.\n\n\"Currently, health agencies do not recommend vitamin D for the prevention of colorectal cancer,\" said Marji L. McCullough, ScD, American Cancer Society epidemiologist and co-first author of the study. \"This study adds new information that agencies can use when reviewing evidence for vitamin D guidance and suggests that the concentrations recommended for bone health may be lower than would be optimal for colorectal cancer prevention.\"\n\nVitamin D can be obtained in the diet, particularly from fortified foods, from supplements, and from sun exposure. Experts recommend vitamin D be obtained through diet whenever possible because excessive ultraviolet radiation is a major risk factor for skin cancer.\n\nArticle: Circulating Vitamin D and Colorectal Cancer Risk: An International Pooling Project of 17 Cohorts.

These wires can break or become infected, he explained, making the idea of a wire-free pacemaker appealing.\n\nThe new pacemaker is about the size of a AAA battery and provides jolts to one chamber of the heart, Reddy said. Most people with pacemakers require jolts to both chambers, so the pacemaker in its current form wouldn't work for them.\n\nIn the new study, researchers implanted the pacemaker in 32 people for the first time through a puncture in the skin; in 10 patients, they had to reposition it. The researchers reported positive results at up to three months. However, one patient died of a stroke while convalescing after suffering a heart injury during implantation and another had the pacemaker replaced with a defibrillator.\n\nWhy get a wire-free pacemaker? \"For patients with heart problems, this could potentially mean fewer infections related to leads and less discomfort during the implant procedure,\" Reddy said. And children who get pacemakers wouldn't face chest scarring, he added.\n\nDr. Saman Nazarian, a cardiologist and assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins Hospital, said the findings are promising and \"the new technology has enormous potential.\" He expects the pacemaker \"will likely be utilized for some select patients\" after more testing.\n\nStill, he said, the new device will probably be more expensive than other pacemakers, and may pose special risks of its own.\n\nDr. Harish Doppalapudi, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, added that there are unanswered questions regarding replacement of the new pacemakers.\n\n\"When the battery of the implanted leadless pacemaker is exhausted, a new implant is necessary, with all the potential risks associated with this,\" Doppalapudi said. \"It is not known if it will be feasible to safely retrieve the old device. If the old device is left in place, it is not known what the long-term effects of this will be.\"\n\nStudy author Reddy has received grant funding from Nanostim, and works for the company as a consultant.

Forty-six of the infants had an older sibling with an autism spectrum disorder, while the other 33 had no family history of autism.\n\nChildren who have a sibling with autism are much more likely to develop autism themselves, explained lead study author William Bosl, a neuroinformatics researcher at Children's Hospital Boston. Prior research has shown that about 20 percent of siblings of children with autism will also develop autism and another 40 to 50 percent will have some characteristics of the disorder, such as repetitive behaviors or problems with social interaction, language or communication, but not the full-blown disorder.\n\nWhile the children watched people blowing bubbles, researchers measured the babies' brain waves and analyzed the results using computer algorithms. The algorithms can detect subtle patterns in the lines created by EEGs that the human eye might miss, Bosl explained.\n\nWhen the babies were nine months old, researchers could predict who was in the high-risk autism group -- that is, they had a sibling with autism -- with nearly 80 percent accuracy.\n\n\"In this study, we have taken the first step in showing that there is definitive information in the electrical signals measured by EEG to distinguish normal controls from infants at high risk for developing autism,\" Bosl said.\n\nWhen broken out by gender, researchers found other differences. For example, at nine months they were able to predict which boys were in the high-risk group with near 100 percent accuracy. But accuracy for girls at that age was only 60 percent, not statistically significant.\n\nAt six months of age, however, they could predict the high risk girls with about 80 percent accuracy, though they couldn't do the same for boys that young.\n\n\"It seems perhaps they are on a slightly different developmental trajectory,\" Bosl said.\n\nThe study is published online Feb. 22 in BMC Medicine.\n\nEEGs measure brain electrical activity through electrodes attached to the scalp. The technology has been around for awhile -- developed in the late 1920s, it has been used for more than 60 years to detect seizures in epileptics.\n\nBut it's the newer, artificial intelligence technology and sophisticated computer algorithms that enabled the researchers to look more deeply into what the EEGs show, Bosl said.\n\n\"Artificial intelligence gives us the ability to find patterns we might not find with our own eyes,\" Bosl said. \"One of the difficulties with a disorder like autism is that it's very heterogenous. A very high-functioning person with autism might not be so different from a so-called 'normal' person who is quirky. Defining the differences may be somewhat subtle.\"\n\nEEGs are also relatively inexpensive, painless and safe, Bosl said. And unlike MRIs, they require no sedation, so testing could be put to widespread use, he said.\n\n\"My hope is we would have a simple way of measuring brain activity in every child and see the patterns emerging that might track autism characteristics,\" Bosl said. \"That would be tremendously useful. We know early intervention is extremely important. Right now, for a lot of children, that means 3 years old. What we don't know yet is if you can intervene at 9 or 12 months and how effective that could be.\"\n\nDr. Joshua Ewen, a neurologist and director of the clinical neurophysiology laboratory at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, said the study is well done and looks promising, but needs to be replicated.\n\nAlso, the study predicted who was at high risk of autism, but it's unknown if those babies actually went on to develop autism, he noted.\n\n\"If it can eventually be shown that this technique can reliably identify which children will indeed develop autism, then we will have a valuable tool for early detection,\" Ewen said. \"Early detection continues to be of critical importance, as it opens the door to early intervention, which has been shown to improve outcomes for children with autism.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more on autism.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "No evidence that the story relied on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Strobe lighting has been shown to reduce levels of the toxic proteins seen in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, in findings that raise the tantalising possibility of future non-invasive treatments for the disease.\n\nThe study, in mice, found that exposure to flickering light stimulated brain waves, called gamma oscillations, that are known to be disturbed in Alzheimer\u2019s patients.

The technique, known as optogenetics, allowed the scientists to artificially cause groups of neurons to fire in unison by pulsing light into the brains of the mice.\n\n\n\nAfter an hour of stimulation, the researchers found a roughly 50% reduction in the levels of beta amyloid proteins in the hippocampus, the brain\u2019s memory centre. Closer inspection showed that the amyloid had been taken up by microglia, the brain\u2019s immune cells.\n\nIn a healthy brain, microglia act as chemical rubbish collectors, surveying the local environment, clearing up unwanted compounds, but in Alzheimer\u2019s these cells can lose this function and switch into an inflammatory state in which they secrete toxic compounds instead. Strengthening gamma oscillations appeared to switch the microglia back into a productive state.\n\nNext, the scientist showed that gamma oscillations could also be stimulated non-invasively in the visual brain region simply by exposing the mice to a flickering light. At 40Hz the flicker of the light is barely discernible and would be \u201cnot offensive at all\u201d for a person to have in the background.\n\nAfter being given one hour of flickering light each day for a week, the scientists saw a 60% reduction of harmful amyloid plaques in the brains of the mice.\n\nEd Mann, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Oxford, said: \u201cI was surprised, and it\u2019s exciting, that such a simple stimulus can target a molecular pathway and have such an effect in an hour.\u201d\n\nQuestions remain, however, about whether boosting gamma oscillations and sweeping amyloid plaques out of the visual brain region would help with memory, which is centred in the hippocampus, or broader cognitive abilities.\n\nDavid Reynolds, chief scientific officer at Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, said: \u201cIt is conceivable that changing brain cell rhythms could be a future target for therapies, but researchers will need to explore how light flickering approaches could not only reduce amyloid in the visual area of the brain but in those areas more commonly affected in Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThe authors suggest that it may be possible to take a multi-sensory approach, using a combination of flashing lights and vibrating chairs.

Even low levels of dehydration can seriously compromise normal physiological function, yet recent studies looking at hydration in laboring women via the rates of intravenous (IV) fluid showed conflicting results. By pooling the data of several studies, Thomas Jefferson University researchers showed that a higher rate of IV fluids not only decreased c-section rates, but also shortened the overall length of labor by one hour, as well as shortened the pushing phase. The results were published online as an accepted article in Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica.\n\n\"The results are compelling and strongly argue for a change in practice,\" says Vincenzo Berghella, M.D., the Director of Maternal Fetal Medicine and Professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University. \"We have already begun changing practice at Jefferson to give women more fluids in labor, to allow them to have the best chance of delivering vaginally.\"\n\nDr. Berghella and colleagues compiled data from seven small clinical trials that collectively included a total of 1,215 women. Of those, about half (or 593 women) received IV fluids at a rate of 250 milliliters per hour, and the other half (622 women) received fluids at the lower rate of 125 milliliters per hour. General practice in the United States is to administer IV fluids at 125 milliliters per hour during labor.\n\nWith the data pooled, the researchers could see a clear difference in outcomes for women in the two groups. Women getting the faster fluid rate (250 milliliters per hour) were less likely to get a cesarean section. The higher fluid rate also reduced the overall time of labor by an average of 64 minutes, and shortened the pushing phase by nearly 3 minutes, on average.\n\n\"We've known that it's important for women to stay well hydrated during pregnancy and labor. This study suggests that IV fluids could help women maintain hydration at appropriate levels, reduce the likelihood of c-section, and decrease length of labor,\" says Dr. Berghella. \"Recently, we also showed that letting women eat more liberally in labor, especially in early labor, has benefits including shorter labor, and no identifiable risks.\"\n\nToday, approximately one in three births in the United States occurs via c-section, despite an increased attention by national and international obstetric societies on safely reducing the practice.

They have designed a \"granular jamming cap\" filled with coffee grounds that does a better job of tracking patient head movements than current methods. They are disclosing the novel design and data on its effectiveness at the International Conference on Information Processing in Computer-Assisted Interventions in Barcelona on June 20.\n\nOf course, the coffee grounds are not loose: they form a thin layer inside a stretchy silicone headpiece, which looks something like a black latex swim cap decorated with reflective dots. After the cap is placed on the patient's head, it is attached to a vacuum pump that sucks the air out of the cap, jamming the tiny grounds together to form a rigid layer that conforms closely to the shape of the patient's head. (This is the same effect that turns vacuum-packed coffee into solid bricks.)\n\nBefore surgery, a special scanner is used to map the location of the dots relative to key features on the patient's head: a process called registration. Then, during surgery an overhead camera observes the position of the dots allowing the navigation system to accurately track the position of the patient's head when the surgeon repositions it. The computer uses this information to combine a CT scan, which provides a detailed 3-D view of the bone and soft tissue hidden inside the patient's head, with the position of the instruments the surgeon is using and displays them together in real time on a monitor in the operating room.\n\n\"These are very delicate operations and a sophisticated image guidance system has been developed to help the surgeons, but they don't trust the system because sometimes it is spot on and other times it is off the mark,\" said Robert Webster, associate professor of mechanical engineering and otolaryngology, who is developing a surgical robot designed specifically for endonasal surgery. \"When we heard about this, we began wondering what was causing these errors and we decided to investigate.\"\n\nWhen Webster and his research team looked into the matter, they were surprised by what they found. They discovered it wasn't the hardware or the software in the guidance system that was causing the problem. It was the way the reflective markers were attached to the patient's head that was at fault. Typically, these \"fiducial markers\" are attached by an elastic headband and double-backed tape and are subject to jarring and slipping. Their tests found that skin movement and accidental bumps by operating room staff both produced large tracking errors.\n\n\"The basic assumption is that, after registration, the spatial relationships between the patient's head and the fiducial markers remains constant,\" said Patrick Wellborn, the graduate student who is making the presentation. \"Unfortunately, that is not the case. For one thing, studies have shown that the skin on a person's forehead can move as much as a half an inch relative to the skull. And accidentally bumping or dragging cables over the headband can also produce significant targeting errors.\"\n\nIn fact, previous research has found that when everything goes well, the guidance system produces targeting errors of about 2 millimeters but, in about one operation out of seven, the target error is much larger, forcing the surgeon to redo the registration process.\n\n\"Actually, we do have a solution to this problem but it involves drilling and attaching the markers directly to the skull...which we don't like to do because it is painful and it's a step backwards from the majority of what we are doing,\" said Assistant Professor of Otolaryngology Paul Russell, who is collaborating with the engineers on the project.\n\nSo the team began thinking up alternative, non-invasive methods to attach these critical markers. Webster recalled some experiments that were done using coffee grounds to help robots grip irregularly shaped objects. Bladders filled with coffee grounds were built into the robot's gripper. When it grabbed an object, the bladders conformed to its shape. Then a vacuum was pulled, the coffee grounds became rigid and locked the object into place. The researchers decided to see if this technique could be applied to the problem.\n\nIn the last three years, they have gone through a number of designs. They began with headbands that had coffee-ground-filled bags over the temples. Their tests showed that these models could reduce the targeting error by about 50 percent. But the engineers still weren't satisfied.\n\nThen, Wellborn, who was taking over the project, had a brainstorming session with fellow graduate student Richard Hendrick. Among the materials that his predecessor had left behind was a latex bald cap. \"That sparked the idea of caps in general,\" Wellborn recalled. \"We wanted something elastic that was form fitting, which led to the idea of a swim cap.\"\n\nIn addition to fitting extremely tightly to the head, the new design had another advantage. The headband system has only three fiducial markers attached on the ends of three thin rods to form a triangle. The new design allowed them to attach several dozen markers directly to the surface of the cap, which the researchers believe will also contribute to improving the guidance system's accuracy.\n\nThey designed three tests to determine how well this \"granular jamming cap\" performed relative to the current headband in reducing targeting error:\n\u2022 They \"bumped\" both them from a number of different directions with a tennis ball filled with plastic particles swinging on the end of a string. They found that the cap reduced targeting errors by 83 percent.\n\u2022 They simulated the case where a cable or other piece of equipment is accidentally pushed against the two by applying forces ranging from four to six pounds in different directions. They determined that the cap outperformed the headband by 76 percent when the forces were applied to the headband and by 92 percent when they were applied to the markers.\n\u2022 They tested the effects of head repositioning by having an experienced surgeon reposition test subjects' heads six to seven times. In this case, the cap proved to have 66 percent lower error rates than the headband.\n\nOn the strength of these results, Vanderbilt University has applied for a patent on the design and the technology is available for licensing. (Interested parties should contact the Vanderbilt Center for Technology Transfer and Commercialization.)\n\n\"It's a very clever way--that doesn't involve drilling holes in patients' skulls--to greatly improve the accuracy of the guidance system when we are operating in the middle of a person's skull: a zone where the accuracy of the current system is inadequate,\" said Russell.\n\nStudy coauthors also include graduate student Neal Dillon and former postdoctoral fellows Jessica Burgner, professor engineering at Leibniz University in Hanover, Germany, Ray Lathrop, senior consultant engineer at Eli Lilly and Company, and Raul Wirz, medical imaging processing research scientist/engineer at Vanderbilt University Medical Center,\n\nThe research was supported by National Institutes of Health grant R01 EB017467 and National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship grant 144519.", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "The news release maintains a restrained approach, with the exceptions of the headline and the lead. \u201cHow six cups of ground coffee can improve nose, throat surgery\u201d is vague and misleading, since there\u2019s no proven benefit yet.

Yet 90% of these patients will be able to return home safely, as no trauma has been detected. Today, the only reliable diagnosis is the CT Scan, which is only available in some hospitals and, in addition to being expensive, exposes patients to radiations. Researchers from the University of Geneva (UNIGE), in collaboration with the Hospitals of Barcelona, Madrid and Seville, have developed a small device - Point-of-Care Test (POCT) - that analyses the level of proteins in the blood and allows, using a single drop of blood, to diagnose the possibility of a mild traumatic brain injury. This discovery, described in PLOS ONE, will not only relieve emergency departments, free patients from often long waits, but also save on costly medical examinations.\n\nFalling whilst skiing, tumbling down the stairs or getting hit on the head can cause symptoms such as blurred vision, vomiting, loss of consciousness or memory for about 30 minutes. There is then a risk of mild cerebral trauma, which represents more than 90% of brain injuries admitted to hospitals. But is there really a brain lesion? Or are these symptoms merely the consequence of the violence of the shock, of which will ultimately only leave a bump behind?\n\nToday, the injured patients have to go to the emergency rooms of hospitals equipped with a CT Scan, an expensive examination that sends X-rays to the brain to detect the presence or absence of brain trauma. As their case is not a priority, it often takes a long time for the majority of patients to return home without risk of sequelae, except for bad memories.\n\n\"We wondered if it was possible to isolate certain proteins whose presence in the blood increases in the event of mild traumatic brain injury,\u00bb explains Jean-Charles Sanchez, professor at the Department of Internal Medicine of Specialties and the Biomarkers Centre of the Faculty of Medicine of the UNIGE. \"Our idea was to find a way to do a quick examination that would allow, during a boxing or American football match for example, to determine whether the athlete can return to the field or if his condition requires hospitalization. The opposite of the CT Scan, an exam that lasts a long time and cannot be done anywhere,\" he adds.\n\nDuring a shock on the head, some brain cells are damaged and release the proteins they contain, increasing their level in the blood. Scientists at UNIGE and Spanish hospitals then compared the blood of patients admitted for mild traumatic brain injury but diagnosed as negative with that of patients actually suffering from a brain lesion. Using proteomic analyses, which can quantify thousands of proteins simultaneously and observe variations in their levels in the blood, they gradually isolated four molecules indicating the presence of a brain injury: H-FABP, Interleukin-10, S100B and GFAP. \"We have noticed that the H-FABP level alone makes it possible to confirm that there is no risk of trauma in one third of patients admitted after a shock,\" enthuses Jean-Charles Sanchez. The rest of the patients will have to undergo a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nIt was still necessary to develop a device that could be used everywhere, quickly and simply, and that could be available in pharmacies or sports halls. \"When a person has an accident in the mountain, few practices can do a CT Scan,\" notes the Geneva researcher. His team has developed a rapid diagnostic test (POCT) called TBIcheck, inspired by the principle of pregnancy testing: by placing a single drop of blood on the well of a small 5cm plastic case, the patient knows within 10 minutes whether there is a risk of mild trauma, namely whether or not his H-FABP level is higher than 2.5 nanograms per millilitre of blood. \"If a lane appears, the injured person must go to a hospital for a CT scan, if there is nothing, he can go home safely!\" Jean-Charles Sanchez says. In case of doubt when reading the result, a small reader, the Cube Reader, can be installed on TBIcheck. It will display the word \"positive\" or \"negative\" and send the result to the patient's or caregiver's smartphone via Bluetooth. No more doubts!\n\nThese results, patented by UNIGE and awarded the Prix de l'Innovation Academy in December 2017, will be marketed from 2019 by ABCDx, a start-up founded four years ago by Jean-Charles Sanchez of UNIGE and Joan Montaner of Vall d'Hebron Hospital in Barcelona, co-authors of this study. \"Today, our research shows that the results are even more accurate when we combine H-FABP and GFAP levels,\" continues Jean-Charles Sanchez. \"We are currently preparing an even more effective TBIcheck, which will allow 50% of patients to be sent home, but which requires an increase in the sensitivity of the test that receives the blood.\" ABCDx's ultimate goal is to bring to market biomarkers capable of diagnosing brain trauma, stroke and aneurysms. \"Biomarkers are a mine of information on patients' state of health, it is up to us to decode them,\" concludes the Geneva researcher.", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "The headline \u2014 \u201cA brain injury diagnosed with a single drop of blood\u201d \u2014 was among several examples of language in this news release that exaggerated the benefits of this test.

There is no correlation between getting the Gardasil vaccine and seriously adverse effects such as \u201cautoimmune diseases (including Guillain-Barre Syndrome and multiple sclerosis), anaphylaxis, venous thromboembolism, and stroke.\u201d\n\nMind you, all these things and more have been used by people who attack vaccines as an argument against it. And, just like essentially every claim made by the anti-vaccination movement, these arguments are wrong.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t stop them from making them, or from them getting attention by mainstream media; attention they most assuredly do not deserve.\n\nIt\u2019s very frustrating; mounds of data show these vaccinations are incredibly low-risk, but it only takes a little bit of doubt and fear to make vaccine rates drop. For example, a young girl died tragically not long after getting the vaccine, and it got a lot of press, but it was later found that she died of a completely unrelated cause. This, sadly, is expected; more than 178 million doses of Gardasil have been given worldwide, and given that huge number it\u2019s a statistical certainty that some young people will die not long after getting them. But as the saying goes, correlation is not causation. The vaccines are not to blame here.\n\nEven more frustrating about this vaccine is that it\u2019s being fought by an unusual group of people; while most anti-vax leanings are not affiliated with any particular political persuasion, Gardasil gets attacked additionally by conservatives who think that girls getting it will become more promiscuous, because HPV is a sexually transmitted disease.\n\nHowever, this has been shown to be false. Worse, these same people tend to promote abstinence-only education, which has been shown conclusively to be the worst possible sex education; kids taught his way tend to have more pregnancies and more STIs than ones who are taught progressive, healthy sex ed.\n\nIt\u2019s like Bizarro world, where everything is backward. All the evidence shows Gardasil to be safe and to be effective against a virus that causes horrific illnesses. It also shows that the claims made by anti-vaxxers are wrong, and that people fighting the vaccine because of their own sexual biases are making things far worse.\n\nAnd yet they dig in. They insist real science is wrong, that their anecdotes are better, that the entire medical industry is on the take (which is silly beyond reason).\n\nBut that\u2019s where we are. When it comes to health issues, especially ones tied to sexuality, reason goes out the window and emotions take over.\n\nThat\u2019s why I am very, very clear about this: I and my family are all up to date with our vaccinations, and my daughter has had all three stages of the Gardasil vaccine (we\u2019d have done that if she had been a boy, too). As a parent, as someone who knows and loves someone with an autoimmune disorder, and as a person who knows just how truly awful so many diseases are and how easily and safely they can be prevented, I am a strong advocate for vaccinations.\n\nIt\u2019s your body, but it affects literally everyone around you. Don\u2019t listen to the anti-vaxxers, who just want to scare you. Get the facts. And please, talk to your board-certified doctor and find out if there are any vaccinations you need.\n\nHow many lives will you save when you do?\n\nTip o\u2019 the virion to the Refutations of Anti-Vaccine Memes group on Facebook.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "There\u2019s enough context here that we can be sure the story does not rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "(Reuters Health) - Brain surgery for children whose epilepsy is resistant to drug therapy can produce a 10-fold increase in the odds of being seizure-free after one year and can do it without affecting IQ, according to a new Indian study of 116 patients in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nSeventy-seven percent of the children were free of seizures at one year after the surgery, compared with seven percent in a control group of youngsters who received medical therapy alone while waiting for surgery. Behavior and quality of life also improved.\n\nBut surgery also produced serious adverse effects in one-third of the children, most frequently a weakness on one side of the body, known as hemiparesis. The researchers said that was to be expected and, without surgery, patients probably would have experienced similar problems as a result of their continuing seizures.\n\n\u201cWhat the study clearly shows is surgery for children produces seizure freedom compared to children not operated on for similar conditions,\u201d senior author Dr. Manjari Tripathi, a professor of neurology and epilepsy at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi, told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.\n\nNot only \u201cdoes it reassure us that several surgical procedures are effective,\u201d she said, it demonstrates that surgery \u201cshould be done as early as possible\u201d once it becomes clear that a child is not responding to two anti-seizure medications.\n\nAbout 50 million people worldwide suffer with epilepsy and drugs can\u2019t control the seizures in approximately 30 percent of the cases.\n\n\u201cThis is the first randomized study to look at surgical outcome in children,\u201d said Dr. Donald Schomer, director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Program at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. He was not involved in the research.\n\n\u201cThe results are impressive,\u201d he told Reuters Health by phone. Adults who undergo surgery often suffer from the collective effect of years of uncontrolled seizures. \u201cThe study in kids shows if you reduce the time from the onset of seizures from the 15 to 20 years you see in adults down to four to five years, the outcome is much better. It\u2019s documentation that these techniques really work.\u201d\n\nAlthough 77 percent were judged by the Tripathi team to be seizure-free at the end of the study, some of those children actually had seizures immediately after surgery. Yet the cases were judged to be a success because the seizures decreased in frequency over time. Ultimately, 37 percent never had a seizure in the year after surgery.\n\nWhen all seizures were taken into account, children who did not have surgery were four times more likely to have a seizure during that year than youngsters in the surgery group, the researchers calculated.\n\nSuccess rates ranged from 87 percent to 100 percent depending on the type of surgery used to correct the child\u2019s particular brain abnormality.\n\nSurgery improved quality of life and social well-being, and it didn\u2019t affect IQ, something that can decline with ongoing seizures. But Dr. Schomer said the children were only followed for one year, and \u201cthat may be too soon to see a noticeable change\u201d in the intelligence quotient.\n\nPost-surgery weakness was seen in 15 of the 19 patients who had a serious side effect following surgery.\n\nThe weakness \u201cis significant,\u201d Dr. Tripathi said. \u201cThe child may not be able to ambulate by his- or herself. But with physical therapy, all regain the lower and upper limb function within six months. The only thing that does not improve is the wrist and the fingers. They are left with this minor deficit. But even before surgery, some of them have this weakness.\u201d\n\nOther side effects depended on the area of the brain that was removed or disconnected from the rest of the brain.\n\nIn contrast, 16.5 percent of the children waiting for surgery had a serious injury as a result of their continuing seizures.\n\nThe surgery \u201chad a transforming effect on how they get along in life,\u201d Dr. Tripathi said. \u201cMany could go back school earlier or go back to being tutored, and get on with their life.\u201d\n\nBut a major problem facing these children is getting insurance companies to pay for such surgeries, said Dr. Schomer of Beth Israel.\n\nRather than pay $35,000 to $50,000 on surgery that might cure the problem and prevent further damage to the child, insurance companies prefer to demand that more drugs be tried, even if the odds of them working in drug-resistant cases is small, he said.\n\n\u201cStudies like this lend credence to the idea that the earlier you do it, the better the outcome,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope insurance companies will look at this and realize that early detection and surgery, if appropriate, will ultimately save them money in the long term.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2gVClQv The New England Journal of Medicine, online October 25, 2017.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The article quotes outside sources.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "This could be good news for those trying to prevent preterm labor: New research published online in The FASEB Journal suggests that exposing bitter taste receptors in the uterus to certain substances can stop many unwanted contractions that occur during premature labor.\n\n\"The biological mechanism of labor initiation remains unknown, and a large percentage of preterm pregnancies do not respond well to current medications,\" said Ronghua Zhuge, Ph.D., associate professor within the University of Massachusetts Medical School's Department of Microbiology and Physiological Systems in Worcester, Massachusetts. \"The bitter taste receptors that we have found on uterine muscle could be one more piece of the puzzle to understand the onset of labor, both at term and preterm, and develop new therapeutics for preterm labor.\"\n\nZhuge and colleagues attached strips of human and mouse uterine myometrium tissue (also known as smooth muscle) to a machine that measured their contraction efforts.

(Jan. 2, 2018) - In just four months, high-doses of vitamin D reduce arterial stiffness in young, overweight/obese, vitamin-deficient, but otherwise still healthy African-Americans, researchers say.\n\nRigid artery walls are an independent predictor of cardiovascular- related disease and death and vitamin D deficiency appears to be a contributor, says Dr. Yanbin Dong, geneticist and cardiologist at the Georgia Prevention Institute at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University.\n\nSo researchers looked at baseline and again 16 weeks later in 70 African-Americans ages 13-45 - all of whom had some degree of arterial stiffness - taking varying doses of the vitamin best known for its role in bone health.\n\nIn what appears to be the first randomized trial of its kind, they found that arterial stiffness was improved by vitamin D supplementation in a dose-response manner in this population, they write in the journal PLOS ONE.\n\nOverweight/obese blacks are at increased risk for vitamin D deficiency because darker skin absorbs less sunlight - the skin makes vitamin D in response to sun exposure - and fat tends to sequester vitamin D for no apparent purpose, says Dong, the study's corresponding author.\n\nParticipants taking 4,000 international units - more than six times the daily 600 IUs the Institute of Medicine currently recommends for most adults and children - received the most benefit, says Dr. Anas Raed, research resident in the MCG Department of Medicine and the study's first author.\n\nThe dose, now considered the highest, safe upper dose of the vitamin by the Institute of Medicine, reduced arterial stiffness the most and the fastest: 10.4 percent in four months. \"It significantly and rapidly reduced stiffness,\" Raed says.\n\nTwo thousand IUs decreased stiffness by 2 percent in that timeframe. At 600 IUs, arterial stiffness actually increased slightly - .1 percent - and the placebo group experienced a 2.3 percent increase in arterial stiffness over the timeframe.\n\nThey used the non-invasive, gold standard pulse wave velocity to assess arterial stiffness. Reported measures were from the carotid artery in the neck to the femoral artery, a major blood vessel, which supplies the lower body with blood. The American Heart Association considers this the primary outcome measurement of arterial stiffness.\n\nWhen the heart beats, it generates a waveform, and with a healthy heart and vasculature there are fewer and smaller waves. The test essentially measures the speed at which the blood is moving, and in this case, fast is not good, Raed says.\n\n\"When your arteries are more stiff, you have higher pulse wave velocity, which increases your risk of cardiometabolic disease in the future,\" says Raed.\n\nThe varying doses, as well as the placebo participants took, were all packaged the same so neither they or the investigators knew which dose, if any, they were getting until the study was complete. Both placebo and supplements were given once monthly - rather than daily at home - at the GPI to ensure consistent compliance.\n\nDong was also corresponding author on a study published in 2015 in the journal BioMed Central Obesity that showed, in this same group of individuals, both 2,000 and 4,000 IUs restored more desirable vitamin D blood levels of 30 nanograms per milliliter.\n\nThe 4,000 upper-limit dose restored healthy blood level quicker - by eight weeks - and was also better at suppressing parathyroid hormone, which works against vitamin D's efforts to improve bone health by absorbing calcium, they reported.\n\nWhile heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, blacks have higher rates of cardiovascular disease and death than whites and the disease tends to occur earlier in life. The authors write that arterial stiffness and vitamin D deficiency might be potential contributors.\n\nWhile just how vitamin D is good for our arteries isn't completely understood, it appears to impact blood vessel health in many ways. Laboratory studies have shown that mice missing a vitamin D receptor have higher activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, says Raed. Activation of this system increases blood vessel constriction, which can contribute to arterial stiffness. Vitamin D also can suppress vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, activation of garbage-eating macrophages and calcification formation, all of which can thicken blood vessel walls and hinder flexibility. Vitamin D also reduces inflammation, an underlying mechanism for obesity related development of coronary artery disease, says Raed.\n\nNow it's time to do a larger-scale study, particularly in high-risk populations, and follow participants' progress for longer periods, Dong and Raed say. \"A year would give us even more data and ideas,\" Raed adds.\n\nDong notes that pulse wave velocity and blood pressure measures are complimentary but not interchangeable. \"We think maybe in the future, when you go to your physician, he or she might check your arterial stiffness as another indicator of how healthy you are,\" Raed says.\n\nThere were no measurable differences in weight or blood pressure measurements over the 16-week study period.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine currently recommends a daily intake of 800 IUs of vitamin D for those age 70 and older. For adolescents and adults, they recommend 4,000 IUs as the upper daily limit; 2,000 was a previous upper limit.\n\nMore than 80 percent of Americans, the majority of whom spend their days indoors, have vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency. Dong, an expert in vitamin D and a professor in the MCG Department of Population Health Sciences, says about 15 minutes daily in the \"young\" sun - between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. - but before your skin starts to get pink, is the best source of vitamin D.\n\nFoods like milk, milk products like cheese and yogurt, fatty fish like mackerel and sardines, some greens like kale and collards and fortified cereals also are good sources.

MicroRNAs influence protein activities throughout the body, and they are easily measured in biofluids, including blood, cerebrospinal fluid and saliva, according to the authors.\n\nDr. Steve Hicks, senior author of the study and an assistant professor of pediatrics at Penn State College of Medicine, said the \"five microRNAs in saliva could predict with approximately 85% accuracy which concussed children would have symptoms one month later. In comparison, standard survey measures that are typically used in clinics were approximately 65% accurate.\"\n\nThe study was funded in part by Quadrant Biosciences, a biotech company that hopes to bring a saliva test for concussion to market in the next 12 to 24 months, Hicks said.\n\n\"It's frustrating for both parents and physicians that we can't accurately and objectively predict how long a child's concussion symptoms might last, what those symptoms are likely to consist of and when it might be safe for them to return to sports or school,\" said Hicks, who, as a practicing pediatrician, has routinely cared for kids with concussions.\n\nFor the study, Hicks and his co-authors looked at 52 patients between the ages of 7 and 21, with an average age of 14.\n\nMicroRNA expression was measured in saliva spit into a cup by the patients, who had been injured mostly in sports or car accidents, when they arrived at Penn State Hershey Medical Center for an evaluation. Of the 52, 30 had prolonged symptoms and 22 had short-term symptoms of mild traumatic brain injury.\n\n\"We found three microRNAs that were highly associated with specific symptoms one month after injury, such as headache, fatigue and memory difficulties,\" Hicks said. He added that creating an actual test for use by doctors will require collaboration on the part of researchers.\n\n\"Fortunately, the technology required to measure saliva RNA is already employed in medicine; we use it to check patients for upper respiratory viruses in our hospitals and clinics every day,\" Hicks said. \"Modifying this approach for patients with concussions could potentially provide a rapid, objective tool for managing brain injury.\"\n\n'Way too early to know'\n\nHowever, the editorial authors, Dr. William P. Meehan III of Micheli Center for Sports Injury Prevention at Boston Children's Hospital in Massachusetts and Dr. Rebekah Mannix of Brain Injury Center at Boston Children's Hospital, noted that \"the relatively small sample size in this study requires larger-scale studies to determine the reliability\" of the results.\n\nFor example, they noted that the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications is common among those with more severe injury. In the study, those who had used anti-inflammatory medications were the ones with longer-term symptoms. Possibly, then, the drugs may be a potential 'confounding' variable, they wrote, meaning that medication may influence test results and symptoms, adding an element of confusion to the study and its possible interpretation.\n\nStill, \"the findings are promising, representing potential biomarkers for the diagnosis, recovery, and prognostic assessment of a sport-related concussion.\"\n\nDr. Jeffrey Kutcher, a neurologist and National Director of The Sports Neurology Clinic at The CORE Institute, said that \"work like this is important because it does provide potential for tests that can be helpful in the clinical setting.\"\n\n\"I think the main caveat is, this is way too early to know what this type of tool can do for us,\" added Kutcher, who was not involved in the new research. \"The main reason is that there's a difference between simply having a brain that experiences force and being concussed.\"\n\nThe saliva biomarker may be showing that neurons experienced force and not that a there is a concussion, with which the brain cannot perform its typical functions within a normal range, he said: \"I would hesitate to assign too much potential groundbreaking science.\"\n\nOther biomarkers, including blood, are being investigated as potential concussion tests, he said, though \"nothing is at this stage or beyond this.\"\n\nThere are also tools that look at the electrical networks that brains form, he said, disclosing that he is consulting for a company working on one such technology. A patient undergoes an electroencephalogram while doing a cognitive task, and the EEG records how the brain responds.\n\n\"By actually (measuring) the brain network activity directly, you can look at really what is the functional health of the brain,\" he said.\n\nIn addition, some scientists are exploring functional MRI techniques to look at the metabolic function of different areas of the brain to gain insight into concussion, he said.\n\nHicks said he and his colleagues are collaborating with others to examine saliva biomarkers in adult athletes and members of the armed services.\n\n\"Because the markers we identified in this study are not correlated with patient age, we are hopeful they may be applied in adult populations, as well,\" he said.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story includes a substantial amount of information not included in the Penn State Health news release about the study.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "\"We think it will be a very important tool in the toolbag of surgeons and physicians treating obesity and its co-morbidities,\" said Gregory S.

But hot flashes, vaginal bleeding, bladder control problems and leg cramps were more common in the women who took tamoxifen, while pain during sexual intercourse and joint pain were more common in the raloxifene group.\n\nThe new data are not likely to settle the debate about which drug is better. \"Although media coverage of the early release of data from the STAR trial suggests a clear 'winner' in raloxifene, the data from clinical endpoints and patient-reported symptoms suggest a less clear conclusion,\" Dr. William J. Gradishar and David Cella of Northwestern University wrote in an editorial in the medical journal.\n\nDr. Patricia A. Ganz of the University of California, Los Angeles, who presented the quality-of-life data here, said decisions should be made based on each woman's circumstances. If a woman is worried about uterine cancer, she might use raloxifene, Dr. Ganz said. If an active sex life is important to her, a woman might prefer tamoxifen.\n\nBut Dr. Ganz said that side effects of both drugs were generally mild and that it was important that women at high risk of breast cancer take one of them.\n\nRelatively few women at high risk of breast cancer take tamoxifen, and some patient advocates question whether they should, saying many women are exposed to side effects for each case of cancer prevented.\n\nThe editorial in the journal said the new data \"still may not be enough to convince primary care physicians to be more aggressive than they have been to date in breast cancer chemoprevention.\"\n\nAs for the data on vaginal and vulvar cancer prevention, they came from combining data from three trials used to test the ability of the vaccine, Gardasil, made by Merck & Company, to prevent cervical cancer. Vaginal and vulvar cancers are usually caused by the human papillomavirus, which also causes cervical cancer.\n\nAmong 18,172 women, ages 15 to 26, there were 5 cases of precancerous vaginal and vulvar lesions in the women who got the vaccine, compared with 27 in those who got a placebo, after about 18 months. That made the vaccine 81 percent effective, said Dr. Jorma Paavonen of the University of Helsinki, the lead author.\n\nWhen the researchers looked only at lesions caused by the particular viral strains in the vaccine, they found no cases in the vaccinated group and 24 in the placebo group.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story cites information from both the editorial that accompanied these studies as well as the researcher who presented the results at a professional meeting. It might have been helpful to note that neither the authors of the editorial nor the presenter appear to have any financial relationship with either drug manufacturer; this information was available in the published articles. ", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Two big studies suggest possible new ways to screen healthy people for cervical or prostate cancers, but a third disappointed those hoping for a way to detect early signs of deadly ovarian tumors.\n\n-For women 30 and over, a test for the virus, HPV, is better than a Pap smear for predicting cervical cancer risk, and those who test negative on both can safely wait three years to be screened again.\n\n-A single PSA blood test at ages 44 to 50 might help predict a man's risk of developing advanced prostate cancer or dying of it up to 30 years later. The PSA test is notoriously unreliable, but using it this way separates men who need a close watch from those who are so low-risk that they can skip testing for five years or more.\n\n-Screening women with no symptoms for ovarian cancer with a blood test and an ultrasound exam is harmful. It didn't prevent deaths and led to thousands of false alarms, unneeded surgeries and serious complications.\n\nThe last study is a warning to people who get screening tests that aren't recommended, or who question whether screening can ever hurt.\n\n\"The answer is, it could hurt a lot,\" said Dr. Allen Lichter, chief executive of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. The group published these and 4,000 other studies Wednesday, ahead of its annual meeting next month.\n\nCervical cancer is easy to prevent. It's very slow-growing and screening finds precancerous cells and allows early treatment. The new study was the first big one to examine a newer screening tool, HPV tests, with or without Pap smears in routine practice.\n\nFor a Pap test, cells scraped from the cervix, the gateway to the uterus, are checked under a microscope. But this can miss problems or raise false alarms.\n\nHPV tests detect the human papillomavirus, which causes most cases of cervical cancer. But HPV is \"the common cold\" of the nether regions \u2014 most sexually active young people have been exposed to it, said Debbie Saslow, the American Cancer Society's director of breast and gynecologic cancer. Most infections go away on their own; they're only a cancer risk when they last a year or more.\n\nYounger women tend to have short-term infections, so Pap tests are a better way to screen them. HPV tests are approved as an option along with Paps for women 30 and older, and the cancer society says that if a woman tests negative on both, she can wait three years to be screened again. Few take this advice, though.\n\n\"Women still want their annual Pap and doctors still want to give them,\" and think it's rationing care to test less often, Saslow said.\n\nThe new study gives \"very, very solid support\" for screening less often, Lichter said.\n\nHormuzd Katki of the National Cancer Institute studied more than 330,000 women getting HPV and Pap tests through Kaiser Permanente Northern California for five years.\n\nOnly about three out of 100,000 women each year developed cervical cancer after negative HPV and Pap tests. HPV tests were twice as good as Paps for predicting risk. Adding a Pap after a negative HPV test did little to improve risk prediction.\n\nHowever, if an HPV test was positive, a Pap test helped confirm or rule out the need for follow-up.\n\nThe study didn't look at the downside of HPV testing \u2014 how many false alarms and needless procedures it triggered. HPV tests cost $80 to $100 compared to $20 to $40 for Paps.\n\nThe prostate study sought a better way to use PSA tests, which are troublesome because PSA can be high for many reasons besides cancer, and doctors don't know which cancers need treatment or whether screening saves lives. Most groups don't recommend PSA tests, but most men over 50 get them anyway.\n\nThe new study \"is not going to end the controversy, but it suggests a very interesting middle ground,\" Lichter said.\n\nResearchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York used stored blood samples that 12,000 Swedish men gave for a heart study decades ago, when most were 44 to 50 years old. They also had second samples from some of them six years later, and samples from other 60-year-old men.\n\nLooking 27 years later, researchers saw that 44 percent of cancer deaths occurred in men whose initial PSAs had been in the top 10 percent when they were 44 to 50 years old.\n\nConversely, scoring below the median meant very little cancer risk years later.\n\n\"They're identifying a group of guys who don't need to be screened, or need to be screened less often,\" said Dr. Otis Brawley, the cancer society's chief medical officer.\n\nThe results are \"provocative,\" but this type of study can't prove that screening prevents deaths, said Dr. Matthew R. Smith of the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center. Few of the Swedish men were treated for prostate cancer as most men are today, which can affect survival.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute, the Swedish Cancer Society and several foundations paid for the work, and one researcher holds patents for two PSA-related tests.\n\nBaseline PSA tests for men in their 40s can't be recommended yet, Brawley said. The cancer society says men should be informed of the risks and benefits of PSA tests starting at age 50, and sooner for blacks and those with family history of prostate cancer.\n\nThe government-funded ovarian cancer study involved nearly 80,000 women. Half were screened annually with an ultrasound for four years and a blood test for six years. The blood test looked for CA-125, a substance often elevated in ovarian cancer.\n\nAfter 13 years, there were no major differences in ovarian cancers found or deaths from the disease. Screening found only 212 cancers while giving 3,285 false alarms that led to 1,080 unneeded biopsy surgeries and 163 serious complications.\n\n\"So many people say `how can cancer screening be harmful?' This thing documents it,\" Brawley said.\n\nThe results don't apply to using these tests on women with symptoms of ovarian cancer or abnormal physical exams. That's still the best way to check for ovarian cancer in those cases.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story goes far beyond any news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The investigators found that the less salt people ate, the more likely they were to die of heart disease \u2014 50 people in the lowest third of salt consumption (2.5 grams of sodium per day) died during the study as compared with 24 in the medium group (3.9 grams of sodium per day) and 10 in the highest salt consumption group (6.0 grams of sodium per day).

His own study, with people who had high blood pressure, found that those who ate the least salt were most likely to die.\n\nDr. Alderman said that he once was an unpaid consultant for the Salt Institute but that he now did no consulting for it or for the food industry and did not receive any support or take any money from industry groups.\n\nLowering salt consumption, Dr. Alderman said, has consequences beyond blood pressure. It also, for example, increases insulin resistance, which can increase the risk of heart disease.\n\n\u201cDiet is a complicated business,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are going to be unintended consequences.\u201d\n\nOne problem with the salt debates, Dr. Alderman said, is that all the studies are inadequate.

But after the robotic job earlier this month, she was out of the hospital in a few days and feeling chipper.\n\n\"The robot is the way to go,\" Jackson said. \"Yes, indeed.\" Using a robot enables a surgeon to work on a patient without splitting open the chest and using a heart-lung machine, as happens with traditional surgery. The robotic tools are inserted through small openings made in the patient's body, minimizing trauma and significantly reducing recovery time.\n\nWhile surgical robots have been available for most of this decade, few are used to do cardiac bypass surgery, even though that was their focus when the machines were introduced.\n\nThe robot - not a kind of mechanical being but a system that enables a surgeon at a control panel to manipulate microtools - has proved more challenging to integrate into coronary bypass surgery than expected, illustrating how technological advancements can be difficult to readily adapt.\n\nNow, the University of Chicago Medical Center, where Jackson had her surgery, has launched a major new effort to make robotic bypass surgery more widely available.\n\nIt has hired the nation's foremost master of robotic bypass surgery to help lead a revolution in coronary bypass. Dr. Valluvan Jeevanandam, the chief of cardiothoracic surgery at the U. of C. Medical Center and in charge of the hospital's initiative, acknowledges he has set a difficult task.\n\nInstead of opening up a patient and working directly on his heart, the robotic-assisted surgeon sits at a console near the patient, looking at three-dimensional high-definition images on a screen and using his hands and feet to control the microtools inserted within the patient's chest. Tiny laser lights and video cameras provide the surgeon's view of what's happening.\n\n\"Using the robot isn't easy,\" Jeevanandam said. \"A drop of blood can block your view and you have to take out the camera and clean it.\" Heart surgeons tend to be confident, competent people used to taking hold of a problem and moving ahead directly. Many who trained to use robots to do coronary bypass run out of patience after three or four procedures, Jeevanandam said, which is why he decided to hire Dr. Sudhir Srivastava, who performed hundreds of robotic bypasses while working at a center in Odessa, Texas.\n\n\"We're a top center,\" said Jeevanandam. \"If they can do this in Odessa, why not Chicago?\"\n\nSrivastava brings a focus and determination to mastering robotic surgery that Jeevanandam wants to spread to other heart surgeons at Chicago.\n\n\"He practices yoga,\" Jeevanandam said. \"It comes in handy.\" But Dr. Pat Pappas, chief of cardiac surgery at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, Ill., wonders if Jeevanandam may be overestimating robotic capabilities.\n\n\"At some point it may happen,\" he said. \"But given the current state of the technology, I don't think that's the case now.\" Pappas started using a surgical robot in 2001, and he intended to use the machine to do minimally invasive coronary bypass procedures, but he found it too difficult. Instead, he has used the machine to do hundreds of heart valve repairs.\n\nThe robots have proven popular for urologic, gynecologic and some general surgery, Pappas said, but few coronary surgeons use them for valve repairs and fewer still do bypass procedures. The problem, he said, is a surgeon cannot feel what he's doing.\n\n\"There's no tactile feedback,\" Pappas said. \"The exactness of bypass surgery is so high that many people are reluctant to do it without tactile as well as visual feedback.\"\n\nSrivastava said it is true that the normal sense of touch is missing from robotic work, and that is a shortcoming, but it can be overcome with practice. Before working on humans in Odessa, he practiced on dozens of pig hearts.\n\n\"After doing it hundreds of times,\" Srivastava said, \"I almost feel the machine is no longer between me and the patient. My hands and feet move in a way that's totally intuitive. That is achievable. You almost develop this sixth sense where looking at what you're doing gives you pseudo-tactile feedback.\"\n\nWhile some have suggested that younger physicians who grew up playing video games may find robotic surgery more natural, Srivastava disagrees. He said that experienced cardiac surgeons who have mastered conventional bypass surgery are the best candidates for learning to use robots because they have the skills and confidence to get themselves out of difficult situations that may arise.\n\n\"Skill set is important, but mental attitude is very important,\" he said. \"I've been in practice more than 20 years, and five years ago we launched robotics. This old dog learned.\"\n\nThe maker of the robotic systems, Intuitive Surgical Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., is an enthusiastic backer of the University of Chicago's initiative.\n\nRecent concerns raised over the safety of medicated stents used in coronary angioplasty procedures have caused more patients and physicians to consider bypass surgery as a better therapy for blocked coronary arteries, said Chris Rabbitt, cardiac marketing director for the company.\n\nAngioplasty, which uses a balloon to open blocked arteries, has been a popular alternative to bypass surgery in part because it brings less trauma to the patient. Stents are small devices used to keep arteries open after the balloon breaks up the blockage. Many stents are infused with chemicals intended to keep the arteries open, but some studies suggest the medication introduces new risks to cardiac health.\n\n\"Patients are more educated,\" Rabbitt said. \"It used to be that when you fell ill, you'd get angioplasty and be stented. But patients understand they have more options.\"\n\nUsing robotics to bypass major blocked arteries and putting stents in other blocked arteries is gaining some currency, Rabbitt said, although few surgeons have come close to Srivastava's familiarity with the robot.\n\nEven though they cost, on average, $1.5 million, the robot systems are gaining popularity. There are 504 systems in North America, 108 in Europe and 44 in the rest of the world.\n\nIf he can train several cardiac surgeons and their teams at the University of Chicago to do robotic coronary bypass procedures, Srivastava said it will change the face of bypass surgery because consumers who hear the benefits of avoiding a cracked sternum will demand the minimally invasive approach.\n\nFinding satisfied patients is probably the easiest aspect of robotic surgery.\n\nJohn Farrell, 70, of Valparaiso, Ind., had severe back pain and needed surgery this summer, but his cardiologist said that blockage of his coronary arteries need to be fixed before he could undergo the back operation. By opting for robotic surgery, Farrell was able to get his back repaired just 10 days after his heart.\n\n\"The heart operation was no problem at all,\" he said.\n\nFor Mary Lou Coulter, 77, of Westville, Ind., the main aftereffect of her robotic procedure was some soreness and numbness.\n\n\"When I left the hospital, I asked them when I could drive,\" she said, \"and they said `Whenever you feel like it,' which really surprised me.\"\n\nFirst published on September 5, 2007 at 12:00 am", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "A\u00a0University of Chicago issued a press release on the robot surgery program\u00a0and its head, Sudhir Srivastava,\u00a0on July 31.

A subset of four VOCs\u2014called carbonyl compounds because of their carbon base\u2014have been discovered in the exhaled breath of lung cancer patients. Being able to identify this lung cancer \u201csignature\u201d through a simple breath test has emerged as one of the most promising ways to diagnose the disease. Now the test is being used to monitor for disease recurrence.\n\nErin M. Schumer, MD, MPH, Victor van Berkel, MD, PhD, and colleagues from the University of Louisville analyzed breath samples collected before and after surgery from 31 lung cancer patients and compared their carbonyl VOCs levels with samples from 187 healthy patients.\n\nThe researchers found a significant decrease in overall carbonyl VOC levels following surgery; in fact, three of the four carbonyl VOCs normalized after surgery, matching levels in the control group.\n\n\u201cThe rapid normalization of almost all of the four compounds after surgery provides strong evidence that they are directly produced by the tumor environment,\u201d said Dr. Schumer. \u201cThis study confirms that the technology is accurate.\u201d\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death. The American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates that more than 224,000 Americans will be diagnosed with lung cancer this year, and more than 158,000 lung cancer patients will die\u2014that translates to 433 lung cancer deaths per day in the United States.\n\nDr. Schumer said those grim statistics underscore the need for early detection, \u201cWe hope that breath analysis will allow us to diagnose patients with primary or recurrent lung cancer long before they suffer from symptoms, when we have more options for treating them, giving them the best chance for cure.\u201d\n\nCurrently, lung cancer patients are followed after surgery with chest computed tomography (CT) scans, which can be inconvenient, expensive, and expose the patient to radiation. \u201cWe hope that the breath analysis can serve as the primary screening tool for cancer recurrence and a CT scan ordered only if the breath test suggests that there has been a change,\u201d said Dr. van Berkel.\n\nHow the Breath Test WorksThe process of breath analysis is relatively simple. The patient blows a single breath into a specialized balloon. The balloon is then connected to a pump that pulls the breath over a small microchip (smaller than a quarter), trapping the chemicals. The microchip is sent to the lab, where the chemicals are analyzed within hours. Breath collection can be performed in the doctor\u2019s office. The pump is reusable; the balloon, microchip, and lab test together cost around $20, all supporting the increasing acceptance of breath tests as a cost-effective, easy-to-perform, non-invasive, and rapid option for the diagnosis of lung cancer.\n\n\u201cThe great potential with breath analysis is detecting lung cancer at any point, both as a primary screening tool and to follow patients after disease has been treated,\u201d said Dr. van Berkel. \u201cThe technology is pretty robust.

Notably, participants did not take any MS medications after receiving HDIT/HCT. Other studies have indicated that currently available MS drugs have lower success rates.\n\nThe trial, called HALT-MS, was sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, and conducted by the NIAID-funded Immune Tolerance Network (ITN). The researchers published three-year results from the study in December 2014, and the final five-year results appear online Feb. 1 in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.\n\n\u201cThese extended findings suggest that one-time treatment with HDIT/HCT may be substantially more effective than long-term treatment with the best available medications for people with a certain type of MS,\u201d said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. \u201cThese encouraging results support the development of a large, randomized trial to directly compare HDIT/HCT to standard of care for this often-debilitating disease.\u201d\n\nMS symptoms vary widely and may include motor and speech difficulties, weakness, fatigue and chronic pain. The most common form of MS is relapsing-remitting MS, which is characterized by periods of mild or no symptoms interspersed with symptom flare-ups or relapses. Over years, the disease can worsen and shift to a progressive form.\n\nIn HALT-MS, researchers tested the safety, efficacy and durability of HDIT/HCT in 24 volunteers aged 26 to 52 years with relapsing-remitting MS who, despite taking clinically available medications, experienced active inflammation, evidenced by frequent severe relapses, and worsened neurological disability.\n\nThe experimental treatment aims to suppress active disease and prevent further disability by removing disease-causing cells and resetting the immune system. During the procedure, doctors collect a participant\u2019s blood-forming stem cells, give the participant high-dose chemotherapy to deplete the immune system, and return the participant\u2019s own stem cells to rebuild the immune system. The treatment carries some risks, and many participants experienced the expected side effects of HDIT/HCT, such as infections.

Although ACE inhibitors were developed 10 years earlier, both types of drugs showed similar effects in the analysis, challenging previous findings that suggest ACE inhibitors have greater benefits.\n\nAccording to the new analysis, published online Jan. 4 in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings, the only difference between the medications is that ARBs are more easily tolerated.\n\n\"There has been debate for many years over the safety and efficacy of ACE inhibitors compared to ARBs, with many of them using an 'ACE inhibitor-first' approach, with ARBs regarded as less effective,\" study author Dr. Sripal Bangalore said in a medical center news release.\n\n\"We believe that our study ends the debate and gives physicians the option to prescribe either drug for their patients,\" added Bangalore, an associate professor in the division of cardiology, in the department of medicine at NYU Langone.\n\nBoth ARBs and ACE inhibitors interfere with the function of a hormone called angiotensin II, which regulates blood pressure, but they do this in different ways, the study authors said.\n\nAngiotensin II restricts blood flow through vessels, raising blood pressure. ACE inhibitors prevent the body from making angiotensin II, while ARBs prevent the hormone from doing its job by taking its place on the surface of blood vessels, the researchers explained.\n\nPrevious studies have suggested that older ACE inhibitors are more effective than ARBs. But, this latest analysis attributed that difference to changes in the standard of care over the decade between trials of the two types of drugs, greater emphasis on quitting smoking, and wider use of cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins.\n\nHowever, when trials were conducted at similar times, one drug was not more effective than the other, the findings showed.\n\n\"This is the first time that we have a clear and consistent message from the three buckets of trials of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, all of which show that there is no outcome difference between the two agents, except for better tolerability of ARBs,\" Bangalore said.\n\n\"The results of our analysis are especially important for patients, given that many ARBs are now also generic, which reduces their costs,\" he added.\n\nFor more about blood pressure drugs, visit the American Heart Association.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "Given that the quotes in this story closely mirror those in the NYU news release, and that no additional sources or material are provided to amplify the story, we believe the writer relied heavily, if not totally, on the prepared news release.

Neoptolemos, of the Cancer Research U.K. Liverpool Cancer Trials Unit at the University of Liverpool in England, and colleagues.\n\nThe study authors noted that, currently, the prognosis for pancreatic cancer is very poor, with a five-year survival rate of less than 5 percent. Surgery to remove cancerous tissue can boost the odds to as much as 10 percent, however, and there is active search underway to improve a patient's chances even more by adding in additional chemotherapy following surgery.\n\nThe pool of nearly 1,100 patients that the researchers focused on were part of the large European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer trial that took place across 159 pancreatic cancer centers located in Europe, Canada, Australasia and Japan.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2007, the participants were divided into one of two six-month chemotherapy groups: one receiving fluorouracil and folinic acid post-surgery and the other receiving gemcitabine.\n\nAfter nearly three years of treatment, the researchers found almost no difference between survival rates in the two groups.\n\nThose who received fluorouracil and folinic acid chemotherapy had lived an average of 23 months. At the one- and two-year markers, survival rates for that group was approximately 78.5 and 48 percent, respectively.\n\nAt the three-year mark, patients on the gemcitabine regimen achieved an average survival rate of 23.6 months. One- and two-year survival rates were 80 and 49 percent, respectively, the investigators found.\n\n\"In conclusion, gemcitabine did not result in improved overall survival compared with fluorouracil plus folinic acid in patients with [surgically removed] pancreatic cancer,\" the authors concluded in their report.\n\nHowever, the team did observe one appreciable difference: patients on gemcitabine were less likely to experience serious side effects as a result of their chemotherapy treatment than those on the fluorouracil/folinic acid treatment (7.5 percent versus 14 percent).\n\nDr. Michael Choti, a professor of surgery and oncology at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, described the study as \"important,\" but he does not believe it will alter the current approach to post-surgical chemotherapy.\n\n\"Really in the scope of things following major surgery, both are fairly tolerable regimens, and this study doesn't necessarily change the pattern of use in terms of choosing post-operative therapy,\" Choti said.\n\n\"But the point is that pancreatic cancer is a terrible disease, and really just a minority of patients are candidates for surgery. And even for those, unfortunately 75 to 80 percent of those will go on to recur even after the surgery appears to be successful. So, indeed, there has been a strong interest in giving the best additional therapy possible,\" Choti added.\n\n\"So this is not a revolutionary finding, but it's part of an effort to look at what we have and even to find newer regimens with more combinations of drugs,\" he noted. \"And that's exactly what's already underway, as we search for more aggressive and more successful treatments.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more information on pancreatic cancer.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "A JAMA press release seems to be the primary source, but an independent expert gets enough air time that we give the author the benefit of the doubt.\u00a0", "answer": 1}, {"article": "MONDAY, March 28, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Fennel extract, herbal tea and sugar water relieved colic in some infants better than a placebo, according to a new study that reviewed clinical trials of alternative remedies for colic.\n\nBut parents shouldn't get their hopes up too high. All of the trials reviewed had \"major limitations,\" such as having too few patients, relying on parental reports of symptoms, or the study design (such as not being double-blinded).\n\n\"The notion that any form of complementary and alternative medicine is effective for infantile colic currently is not supported from the evidence from the included randomized clinical trials,\" the researchers from the United Kingdom wrote. \"Additional replications are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.\"\n\nBut because fennel extract, certain herbal teas and sugar water are generally safe, and because the research does suggest babies may benefit, pediatricians said they would feel comfortable recommending them to parents.\n\n\"It's reasonable for parents to consider those kinds of interventions for which there is some suggestion of benefit but no known risks,\" said Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York.\n\nThe study, published in the April print issue of Pediatrics, appears online March 28.\n\nColic usually starts when a baby is about three weeks old, said Dr. Ari Brown, a pediatrician in Austin, Texas, and author of the Expecting 411 book series. Colic is usually defined as excessive and inconsolable crying for at least three hours a day for more than three days a week over more than three weeks.\n\n\"It's miserable for both baby and the parents,\" Brown said. \"And although we've been studying it for years, no one has figured out what the cause is, which makes it all the more difficult to treat.\"\n\nIn the United States, between 5 and 19 percent of infants are estimated to have colic, according to background information in the article.\n\nBecause pediatricians can't offer parents much help with it -- for the most part, babies grow out of colic in time -- desperate parents often turn to alternative or complementary treatments, according to the study.\n\nIn the review, the study authors searched various databases of medical research and chose 15 randomized clinical trials involving alternative treatments for colic. The studies were published between 1991 and 2008, came from 10 different countries and included a total of 944 children.\n\nSeveral studies looked at spinal manipulation by a chiropractor. In three of those studies, parents reported their children cried significantly less afterwards. But those studies were small and flawed, so no conclusions can be made about the technique, according to the new review.\n\nThree studies looked at herbal supplements. One found improvement in infants given fennel extract compared to infants given a placebo; another found that infants given a tea containing chamomile, vervain, licorice, fennel and balm-mint seemed to work; while a third found infants given a tea containing fennel, lemon balm and chamomile cried less than infants given a placebo.\n\nFennel, an intestinal \"antispasmodic,\" may increase the speed at which food moves through the intestine, Brown said. This may help if the underlying cause of colic is cramping or discomfort due to an immature digestive tract, although that is just a theory, Brown added.\n\nTwo studies looked at giving babies solutions of sugar water, which some researchers believe has pain-killing properties. The parents of babies given sugar water reported significantly less crying. (If parents want to try it, they could deliver sugar water in a dropper, or put a small amount in a bottle, Adesman said.)\n\nA study of probiotics, which are reputed to help digestion, found that 95 percent of infants given L. reuteria probiotics seemed to reduce their average crying time compared to 7 percent of babies given simethicone, which is marketed to relieve gas under the brand names Mylicon and PediaCare Infants' Gas Relief.\n\n\"This is pertinent given that simethicone is considered the best available and most commonly prescribed treatment for colic, although it previously has been shown to be no more effective than the placebo,\" according to the authors.\n\nBrown said the strength of that finding suggests L. reuteria is worth further study.\n\nOne study found no difference in improvement of symptoms between infants whose parents were taught to do infant massage compared to infants put in a crib that vibrated. Nor did soy-enriched formula seem to help.\n\nA small study of babies given reflexology showed some improvement, but there was no difference in whether the reflexology targeted the feet, which are considered to be therapeutic for colic, or other parts of the body.\n\nThis implies the improvement may \"have more to do with the therapeutic effect of touch than the actual therapy itself,\" Dr. Edzard Ernst, of the department of complementary medicine at Peninsula Medical School, Universities of Exeter and Plymouth, in the United Kingdom, and colleagues wrote in the report.\n\nThe Nemours Foundation has more on colic.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story goes well beyond any news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Medical Cannabis Significantly Safer for Elderly With Chronic Pain Than Opioids, According to Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Researchers\n\nBEER-SHEVA, Israel...February 13 - Medical cannabis therapy can significantly reduce chronic pain in patients age 65 and older without adverse effects, according to researchers at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU) and the Cannabis Clinical Research Institute at Soroka University Medical Center.\n\nThe new study, published in The European Journal of Internal Medicine, found cannabis therapy is safe and efficacious for elderly patients who are seeking to address cancer symptoms, Parkinson's disease, post-traumatic stress disorder, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, and other medical issues.\n\n\"While older patients represent a large and growing population of medical cannabis users, few studies have addressed how it affects this particular group, which also suffers from dementia, frequent falls, mobility problems, and hearing and visual impairments,\" says Prof. Victor Novack, M.D., a professor of medicine in the BGU Faculty of Health Sciences (FOHS), and head of the Soroka Cannabis Clinical Research Institute.

Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nThe study - the first trial to publish five-year results from SBRT treatment for prostate cancer - found a 98.6 percent cure rate with SBRT, a noninvasive form of radiation treatment that involves high-dose radiation beams entering the body through various angles and intersecting at the desired target. It is a state-of-the-art technology that allows for a concentrated dose to reach the tumor while limiting the radiation dose to surrounding healthy tissue.\n\n\"The high cure rate is striking when compared to the reported five-year cure rates from other approaches like surgery or conventional radiation, which range between 80 to 90 percent, while the side effects of this treatment are comparable to other types of treatment,\" said Dr. Raquibul Hannan, Assistant Professor of Radiation Oncology and lead author for the study. \"What we now have is a more potent and effective form of completely noninvasive treatment for prostate cancer, conveniently completed in five treatments.\"\n\u2022 Prostatectomy, the surgical removal of the prostate gland, which can be done with minimally invasive techniques and robotic assistance;\n\u2022 Brachytherapy, in which doctors implant numerous small radioactive seeds about the size of a grain of rice into the prostate gland using multiple large needles inserted through the skin in the operating room. Once implanted, the seeds release their radioactivity directly into the prostate gland; and\n\u2022 External beam radiation, which involves 42 to 45 treatments administered over two or more months, five days a week.\n\n\"The current form of radiation is 44 treatments given over nine weeks.

A total of 91 patients were treated prospectively and followed for five years, with only one patient experiencing a recurrence of his cancer. The findings are published in the European Journal of Cancer.\n\nTerry Martin of McKinney, Texas, - about an hour outside Dallas - said the fewer number of treatments was a compelling advantage when he was evaluating treatment options.\n\n\"I live 45 minutes away from UT Southwestern. The difference between being treated five times versus 44 times is enormous,\" said Mr. Martin, a retired airline pilot. \"I felt that I was back to normal just 10 days after finishing treatment.\"\n\nIn addition to shorter treatment times, researchers found that side effects were not necessarily different compared to other forms of prostate cancer treatment. In the short term, the side effects of SBRT can include urinary issues (urgency, frequency and burning) and rectal irritation, which are often temporary and reverse within four weeks of treatment. Researchers found a small risk of longer-term urinary and rectal complications, which is also comparable to conventional treatments. Decrease in erectile function was seen in 25 percent of patients, fewer than with conventional radiation or surgery, said Dr. Hannan.\n\nTo reduce the side effects associated with SBRT, current clinical trials at UTSW are using a unique and biodegradable rectal spacer gel to protect the rectum. UTSW is currently the only accredited site in Texas at which this spacer gel can be used.\n\nOther clinical trials at the UTSW Department of Radiation Oncology are seeking to expand the application of SBRT to high-risk (Stage III) prostate cancer patients. \"Our hope is that the high potency of this form of treatment will significantly improve treatment of these patients,\" says Dr. Hannan, the principal investigator of the high-risk prostate SBRT trial.\n\nUT Southwestern has been a leader in pioneering use of SBRT. Dr. Timmerman, Director of Image-Guided Stereotactic Radiation Therapy, Medical Director of Radiation Oncology, and holder of the Effie Marie Cain Distinguished Chair in Cancer Therapy Research, has served as the lead investigator in several national trials designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SBRT to treat other types of cancer, including cancer in the lung, liver, and spine. A range of clinical trials of SBRT therapy are under way at Simmons Cancer Center, including new investigations evaluating use of SBRT for cancers in the breast and larynx.\n\nSince 2009, UT Southwestern has trained more than 300 physicians and peers interested in implementing SBRT in their clinical practice. Simmons Cancer Center's arsenal of stereotactic radiotherapy technology includes the cutting-edge Gamma Knife, CyberKnife, Agility, Vero SBRT and TrueBeam technologies.\n\nThe SBRT study for prostate cancer was supported by a grant from the U.S. Department of Defense. Additional UTSW researchers involved in the study include Dr. Yair Lotan, Professor of Urology and holder of the Helen J. and Robert S. Strauss Professorship in Urology, and Dr. Xian-Jin Xie, Professor of Clinical Science.\n\nThe Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center is the only NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in North Texas and one of just 45 NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers in the nation. The Simmons Cancer Center includes 13 major cancer care programs with a focus on treating the whole patient with innovative treatments, while fostering groundbreaking basic research that has the potential to improve patient care and prevention of cancer worldwide. In addition, the Center's education and training programs support and develop the next generation of cancer researchers and clinicians.\n\nThe Simmons Cancer Center is among only 30 U.S. cancer research centers and the only cancer center in North Texas to be named a National Clinical Trials Network Lead Academic Participating Site, a prestigious designation by the NCI, designed to bolster clinical cancer research for adults and to provide patients access to cancer research trials sponsored by the NCI, where promising new drugs often are tested.\n\nUT Southwestern, one of the premier academic medical centers in the nation, integrates pioneering biomedical research with exceptional clinical care and education.

And some experts believe the evidence is getting thinner all the time.\n\n\"In health as elsewhere, if something looks too good to be true, it should be treated with great caution,\" says an editorial published this week in the medical journal BMJ. Mike Daube, professor of health policy at Curtin University in Australia, writes that the once-touted benefits of moderate drinking \"are now evaporating.\"\n\nHis editorial accompanies a British study that finds death rates among moderate drinkers and non-drinkers are not different enough to suggest any real health benefits for drinkers. The only possible exception: women over age 65.\n\nAlso, a recent Swedish study found that middle-aged people having more than two drinks a day \u2013 just above the moderate level for men \u2014 had a markedly increased stroke risk.\n\nStudies will continue, and not everyone has given up the idea that moderate drinking \u2014 up to two drinks a day for men and one day for women \u2014 might have some cardiovascular benefits.\n\nHere's what U.S. experts say you need to know for now:\n\u2022 Any benefits are unclear. \"I cannot prove and I don't think anyone can prove that alcohol consumption can prevent anyone from dying or prevent heart attacks,\" says Kenneth Mukamal, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, Boston. But he says some studies show moderate drinking can boost levels of \"good\" HDL cholesterol and a hormone key to blood sugar control. Some studies following moderate drinkers and non-drinkers for decades find lower death rates and fewer heart attacks and strokes in the drinkers, he says. But those studies do not prove alcohol is the reason for the differences. One theory, backed by the new British study: the results are skewed by the fact that some non-drinkers are former drinkers with health problems.\n\u2022 The risks are real. For some people, even moderate drinking is clearly risky. Those include people taking blood-thinning medicines and those with uncontrolled high blood pressure, says Curtis Rimmerman, a cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic. Alcohol raises blood pressure and thins blood, he say. It's also a source of \"non-essential liquid calories,\" a big concern in an overweight nation, he says. And heavy drinking is not good for anyone: It has long been linked with stroke, heart failure and many non-cardiovascular hazards, including car crashes.\n\u2022 Gender matters. Women are advised to drink less than men, partly because they tend to be smaller. But that's not the only reason, says Lori Mosca, a professor of medicine at Columbia University Medical Center and a spokesperson for the American Heart Association. \"Our blood vessels have a different hormonal milieu,\" she says and women are more vulnerable to the anti-clotting effects of alcohol \u2013 something that could raise the risk of bleeding strokes. Another consideration: even light drinking is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, according the National Cancer Institute.\n\u2022 Age matters too. There's no evidence drinking in your 20s or 30s has any health benefits. \"At those ages, any benefit we get from moderate drinking is only to the extent that someone who is moderately drinking is not heavily drinking,\" Mukamal says.\n\u2022 There's probably nothing special about wine. \"About a decade ago, there was this myth that red wine was better than white wine and wine was better than beer and spirits,\" Mosca says. Studies have failed to prove any difference.\n\n\"I don't want to be a killjoy,\" Mosca says. \"But I would never recommend alcohol as a preventative intervention.\"\n\n\"There may be some evidence that perhaps one glass with a meal is OK,\" says Demetrius Lopes, a neurological surgeon at Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, and another spokesperson the heart association. \"But it's a slippery slope to saying 'OK, maybe two is better.' I do think people don't know the dangers.\"\n\nNo health agency or major medical group recommends drinking for health. But, if you do drink, groups including the American Heart Association and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend:\n\u2022 No more than two drinks a day for men.\n\u2022 No more than one drink a day for women (and none for pregnant women).\n\u2022 1.5 ounces of 80-proof spirits or 1 ounce of 100-proof spirits.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The USA Today report was not based on this\u00a0press release\u00a0about the study.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Researchers trying to find a way to treat multiple sclerosis think they\u2019ve come up with an approach that could not only help patients with MS, but those with a range of so-called autoimmune diseases, from type-1 diabetes to psoriasis, and perhaps even food allergies.\n\nSo far it\u2019s only worked in mice, but it has worked especially well. And while mice are different from humans in many ways, their immune systems are quite similar.\n\n\u201cIf this works, it is going to be absolutely fantastic,\u201d said Bill Heetderks, who directs outside research at the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, part of the National Institutes of Health, which helped pay for the research. \u201cEven if it doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s going to be another step down the road.\u201d\n\nIn autoimmune disease, the body\u2019s immune cells mistakenly attack and destroy healthy tissue. In MS, it\u2019s the fatty protective sheath around the nerves; in type-1 or juvenile diabetes it\u2019s cells in the pancreas that make insulin; in rheumatoid arthritis it\u2019s tissue in the joint.\n\nCurrently, the main treatment is to suppress the immune system, an approach that can leave patients vulnerable to infections and cancer. The new treatment re-educates the immune cells so they stop the attacks.\n\nThe approach uses tiny little balls called nanoparticles made of the same material used to make surgical sutures that dissolve harmlessly in the body. They\u2019re attached to little bits of the protein that the immune cells are attacking, the researchers report in Sunday\u2019s issue of the journal Nature Biotechnology.\n\nStephen Miller of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago had been trying a slightly different approach to treating MS. When normal cells die naturally through a self-destruction process called apoptosis, immune cells called macrophages come in and eat up the mess.\n\nThe macrophages are carried to the spleen where they show these ground-up bits of cells to other immune cells called T-cells. It\u2019s a kind of introduction that familiarizes the T-cells with the body\u2019s normal cells. Then T-cells know not to attack healthy cells.\n\nMiller\u2019s team had been trying to find ways to use this process to re-educate the T-cells. They have been attaching bits of the myelin that T-cells mistakenly attack to healthy cells from MS patients that were self-destructing, then infusing the concoction back into MS patients.\n\nThe idea would be to \u201cintroduce\u201d the myelin to the T-cells at the same time they were \u201cmeeting\u201d the healthy tissue, and educate them to leave the myelin alone.\n\nSo far the team has only shown the process is safe \u2013 a phase 1 clinical trial. But Miller says the experiment also seemed to show they were beginning to repair the patients\u2019 immune systems. However, it was hideously expensive. \u201cIt cost probably about a million dollars to treat 10 patients using live cells,\u201d he said.\n\nObviously, the researchers needed something cheaper. Miller got together with Lonnie Shea, a professor of chemical and biological engineering at Northwestern. They substituted cheap little balls of plastic called polystyrene nanoparticles for the self-destructing cells.\n\nThese new nanoparticles stopped the course of a MS-like disease in mice, the researchers found. But polystyrene is no good to use in people. It doesn\u2019t break down and contains a compound, styrene, that may cause cancer.\n\nShea had another possibility, called poly(lactide-co-glycolide) or PLG for short. \u201cIt turns out this is an FDA approved substance that is used in resorbable sutures,\u201d said Miller.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing rare or exotic or strange here,\u201d said NIBIB\u2019s Heetderks. The particles are easy to produce, he said.\n\nThis worked just as well in mice. It only takes an hour in a chemical bath to attach little bits of myelin to the nanoparticles of PLG. When infused into a vein, they\u2019re carried by the blood right to the spleen, where the nanoparticles \u201cmeet\u201d the T-cells.\n\nIf the treatment was done as soon as the mice had their first MS-like attack, the attacks stopped. The effects lasted for the entire lives of the mice, Miller said.\n\nWhat\u2019s great about the approach, Miller says, is that it can be used to treat any autoimmune disease. For diabetes, little bits of pancreatic beta cells could be attached to the nanoparticles. For a food allergy, the part of the food that causes the allergic response could be attached. \u201cYou can try to induce tolerance to peanuts or eggs or shellfish or whatever you are allergic to,\u201d he said.\n\nOne shortcoming is that scientists don\u2019t always know what\u2019s causing an autoimmune disease. \u201cWe know that in rheumatoid arthritis, your joints get attacked, but what we don\u2019t know really well is what specific protein in your joints is being attacked. We really need to know that before we can apply this therapy,\u201d Miller said.\n\nNow the researchers are looking for funding so they can test this new approach in people. They\u2019re in discussions with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation to test it in people with type-1 diabetes, and the Myelin Repair Foundation to test it in MS patients, Miller said. They may form their own company to develop it as a medical treatment, something that would be years away.\n\nMice don\u2019t live very long, and it\u2019s not clear if human patients would need repeat treatments. But the T-cells that are re-educated usually live for a long time in the body, and have long memories, Miller said.\n\nIt\u2019s also clear the approach would not repair any damage already done by the disease, so the best candidates would be patients having their very first symptoms. But it might be possible down the road to combine the nanoparticle treatment with another treatment to replace the damaged tissue in more advanced patients, Miller said.\n\nNew drug may help MS", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not rely on a press release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "\"This new drug could be a game changer for future treatment of asthma\" - Professor Chris Brightling, NIHR Senior Research Fellow at the University of Leicester\n\nThe first new asthma pill for nearly 20 years has the power to significantly reduce the severity of the condition, a study led by the University of Leicester has found.\n\nThe research was funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals, National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and the EU (AirPROM), and is described by the lead researcher as \"a game changer for future treatment of asthma.\"\n\nThree people die every day because of asthma attacks and research shows that two thirds of asthma deaths are preventable, according to Asthma UK.\n\nFevipiprant (QAW039) significantly decreased the symptoms of asthma, improved lung function, reduced inflammation and repaired the lining of airways.\n\nThe drug is currently being evaluated in late stage clinical trials for efficacy in patients with severe asthma, according to ClinTrials.gov.\n\nA total of 61 people took part in the research. One group was given 225mg of the drug twice a day for 12 weeks and the other participants were assigned to a placebo group.

And a new clinical trial suggests they are not just blowing smoke.\n\nThe study, published Monday, found that for 30 MS patients with muscle \u201cspasticity,\u201d a few days of marijuana smoking brought some relief.\n\nBut the big caveat, researchers say, is that it\u2019s not clear that the downsides of pot smoking are worth it.\n\nSome people with MS are already using medical marijuana to treat certain symptoms, including spasticity \u2014 when the muscles in the legs or arms contract painfully, in something akin to a \u201ccharley horse.\u201d\n\nThere is some science behind the idea: The body naturally produces cannabinoids, the group of chemicals found in marijuana. And studies have suggested the cannabinoid receptors on our cells help regulate muscle spasticity.\n\nBut the evidence that pot smoking actually helps with spasticity has been anecdotal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard from patients that marijuana helps their spasticity, but I think a lot us thought, \u2018Well, it\u2019s probably just making you feel good,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Jody Corey-Bloom, the lead researcher on the new study.\n\n\u201cI think this study shows that yes, (marijuana) may help with spasticity, but at a cost,\u201d said Corey-Bloom, of the University of California, San Diego.\n\nThe cost, her team found, is that smoking caused fatigue and dizziness in some users, and generally slowed down people\u2019s mental skills soon after they used marijuana.\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear if that would have any long-term consequences, Corey-Bloom said.\n\nAbout 400,000 people in the United States have MS, a chronic disease in which the protective coating around nerve fibers starts breaking down.\n\nThe new study, reported in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, included 30 MS patients with muscle spasticity that had failed to get better with standard medication.\n\nCorey-Bloom\u2019s team had each patient smoke marijuana or \u201cplacebo\u201d joints \u2014 which looked, smelled and tasted like the real thing, but lacked the active ingredient in marijuana, known as THC.\n\nEach patient smoked marijuana once a day for three days and used the placebo cigarette once a day on three separate days. Before and after each treatment, an independent rater assessed the patients\u2019 muscle spasticity.\n\nOverall, the study found, measures of spasticity dropped an average of three points \u2014about 30 percent \u2014 on a 24-point scale when patients smoked marijuana, but didn\u2019t change after they smoked the placebo.\n\nThe issue of treating spasticity is \u201ccertainly an important one,\u201d said Nicholas LaRocca, vice president of healthcare delivery and policy research at the National MS Society.\n\n\u201cSpasticity is a big problem for many people with MS, and the current medications don\u2019t necessarily work for everyone,\u201d said LaRocca, who was not involved in the new study.\n\n\u201cBut smoking marijuana does not appear to be a long-term solution, because of the cognitive effects,\u201d he told Reuters Health.\n\nPeople with MS are already at some risk of \u201ccognitive changes,\u201d LaRocca pointed out, so the potential for lasting effects from long-term marijuana smoking is a concern.\n\nHowever, LaRocca said, researchers are developing cannabinoid-based medications for MS. That includes a cannabinoid mouth spray called Sativex that has been approved in the UK, Canada, Spain and New Zealand to treat MS-related spasticity.\n\nResearch into cannabinoids and spasticity should continue, LaRocca said, because medications may be able to harness the benefits of specific cannabis compounds, without the side effects linked to smoking pot.\n\nBoth LaRocca and Corey-Bloom said there were limitations to the current study.\n\n\u201cBlinding\u201d people as to whether they are on marijuana or a placebo is tough since the drug creates a \u201chigh\u201d feeling.\n\nIn this study, 17 of 30 patients were able to correctly guess whether they were using marijuana or a placebo at each of their six visits with the researchers. And the rest often guessed correctly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that the patients were not really blinded,\u201d LaRocca said. \u201cWhat effects that might have had on the results is unclear.\u201d\n\nCorey-Bloom said that should not have influenced the spasticity findings, since an independent researcher (who didn\u2019t know whether patients were smoking marijuana or the placebo) rated spasticity using a standard scale.\n\nBut another limitation, she pointed out, is that the study looked at the effects, and side effects, of marijuana over only a few days. \u201cWe can\u2019t say anything about long-term effects,\u201d Corey-Bloom told Reuters Health.\n\nFor now, LaRocca recommended that people with spasticity see a doctor experienced in treating MS.

This week an unprecedented travel advisory was given for southern Florida after more than a dozen people were diagnosed with Zika after being bitten by \"homegrown\" mosquitoes.\n\nZika virus is most dangerous to pregnant women, because it can cause severe birth defects in babies if they are infected in the womb.\n\nRelated: Could We Nave New Zika Vaccine Soon?\n\nRight now, just one of those three vaccines will be progressing to clinical trials. That vaccine \u2014 dubbed ZPIV for purified inactivated Zika virus \u2014 uses a more traditional vaccine approach and depends on dead virus particles.\n\nTo develop the vaccine, researchers kill the virus with chemicals, leaving behind harmless proteins that the body can learn to recognize as foreign invaders. Using those proteins as targets, the immune system can then produce antibodies to latch onto live virus particles and destroy them. This kind of vaccine is much safer than ones that depend on live virus particles to foster immunity.\n\nRelated: Company Gets OK to Test New Zika Vaccine\n\nThe researchers gave 16 monkeys an initial dose of ZPIV and then a booster four weeks later. Then the monkeys were exposed to active forms of the virus. In tests afterwards, the monkeys showed antibodies against Zika and no detectable virus in their blood or urine, meaning that the protection from the vaccine was complete. Monkeys that got a sham vaccine developed no antibodies.\n\nThe results were \u201cstriking,\u201d said study coauthor Dr. Dan Barouch, a professor of medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School. \u201cThe findings published today substantially increase our optimism for the potential for the development of a Zika vaccine for humans.\u201d\n\nBeyond that, \u201cthis is a promising [vaccine] candidate that can be easily produced in large quantities,\u201d said coauthor, Col. Nelson Michael, an Army doctor who specializes in flaviviruses, such as Zika and dengue.\n\nTo continue the development of the vaccine, the researchers will be partnering up with the largest pharmaceutical company solely devoted to vaccines, Sanofi Pasteur.\n\nThe researchers hope to test the vaccine in people by October, Barouch said.\n\nRelated: New Study Shows Just How Tricky the Zika Virus Is\n\nThe two other experimental vaccines described in the new report also sparked an immune response in monkeys. Both of these vaccines depend on new technology in which scientists learn the exact DNA of proteins on the surface of the virus and then create copies to be put in a vaccine. One vaccine had just the man-made proteins in it, the other wrapped a common cold virus around the proteins. The protein/cold virus vaccine was especially effective, sparking a significant immune response after just one dose.\n\nAnother experimental vaccine, developed by researchers at the National Institutes of Health, is a bit further along.\n\nTrials of that vaccine in people, which is also based on man-made copies of virus proteins, began on August 2, when the first study volunteer was given a vaccination through a needle free injector, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nResults are expected by December and if they are promising, a bigger phase II trial will be launched in Zika endemic countries\n\nThat puts the project ahead of schedule, since the original launch of the phase I trials was expected to start in September, Fauci said.\n\nStill, with many years of experience in vaccine development behind him, Fauci said, \u201cyou\u2019re never overconfident of the clinical results.\"\n\n\"But we are optimistic that this new DNA Zika is a viable platform,\" Fauci said. \"So we\u2019re cautiously optimistic.\u201d\n\nAnd if problems turn up, there are the three potential vaccine described in the new study.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always good to have multiple different vaccine candidates in both clinical and pre-clinical testing,\u201d Barouch said. \u201cThat increases the chance that we will have at least one, if not more than one, that works in the end.\u201d", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The news story does not appear to be based on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Even if you\u2019re not a big fan of seafood, you probably know that adding more fish to your diet can do a lot of good, from improving your heart health to lowering inflammation. Now, according to scientists at the University of Colorado, there is even evidence that the healthy fat can boost your chances of getting pregnant.\n\nThe study, presented at the American Society of Reproductive Medicine annual meeting, was in mice, so more research needs to be completed before omega 3 foods or supplements become part of treatment for infertility. But Dr. Malgorzata Skaznik-Wikiel, an obstetrician-gynecologist who led the study, is encouraged. She worked with a group of mice that are genetically bred to have healthy ratios of omega 3 fatty acids. These mice are born with the ability to bathe cells and tissues in omega 3 fats, so the team then looked at their egg development in the ovaries.\n\nWhat she found: The mice with the higher levels of omega 3 fatty acids seemed to have more precursors to egg cells than control mice with lower levels of the fat, meaning they had a larger reserve of eggs-to-be. These could then mature into a healthy egg that is fertilized and can lead to a live birth. When the ovaries were examined even further, Skaznik-Wikiel also found that the quality of the eggs were better among the animals with higher levels of omega 3s. Higher quality eggs improves the chances that the egg will be fertilized and develop into a live pup.\n\n\u201cBased on this study, it looks very encouraging that omega 3s can potentially improve fertility,\u201d says Skaznik-Wikiel. \u201cOur study shows that there may be some relationship between dietary factors and things like egg quality so one idea may be recommending supplementation with omega 3s to improve fertility.\u201d\n\nExactly how the healthy omega 3 fatty acids are helping the ovary to produce better quality eggs isn\u2019t clear yet. But other studies Skaznik-Wikiel has done with mice suggests that these fats may lower levels of inflammation that can adversely affect ovarian function.\n\nMore studies need to replicate and confirm the role that omega 3 fatty acids might play in fertility, but for now, Skaznik-Wikiel says that there isn\u2019t much harm in consuming more omega 3 fats. (Some people who are predisposed to bleeding problems may be at higher risk of hemorrhages with high doses of omega 3s, but those cases are relatively rare.)\n\nThere may also be other benefits linked to omega 3 fatty acids for the fetus as well, in helping nerve development \u2014 that\u2019s why many prenatal vitamins include forms of omega 3 fats. \u201cWe hope in the future to have more answers to be able to say firmly that yes, omega 3 fatty acids are the way to go [for women hoping to get pregnant,]\u201d she says. \u201cBut even without that firm answer at this point I don\u2019t see the harm in supplementing.\u201d", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The reporter who wrote this story does appear to have interviewed the lead researcher on the study, so the story does not appear to rely entirely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A research team from the University of Liverpool has reached an important milestone towards creating a urine diagnostic test for prostate cancer that could mean that invasive diagnostic procedures that men currently undergo eventually become a thing of the past.\n\n'The use of a gas chromatography (GC)-sensor system combined with advanced statistical methods towards the diagnosis of urological malignancies', published today in the Journal of Breath Research, describes a diagnostic test using a special tool to 'smell' the cancer in men's urine.\n\nWorking in collaboration with the University of the West of England's (UWE Bristol) Urological Institute team at Southmead Hospital and Bristol Royal Infirmary, the pilot study included 155 men presenting to urology clinics. Of this group, 58 were diagnosed with prostate cancer, 24 with bladder cancer and 73 with haematuria or poor stream without cancer. The results of the pilot study using the GC sensor system indicate that it is able to successfully identify different patterns of volatile compounds that allow classification of urine samples from patients with urological cancers.\n\nProfessor Chris Probert from the University of Liverpool's Institute of Translational Medicine began work on this project with UWE Bristol when he was working in Bristol as a gastroenterologist with clinical and research interest in inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nThe research team used a gas chromatography sensor system called Odoreader that was developed by a team led by Professor Probert and Professor Norman Ratcliffe at UWE Bristol. The test involves inserting urine samples into the Odoreader that are then measured using algorithms developed by the research team at the University of Liverpool and UWE Bristol.\n\nProfessor Probert said: \"There is an urgent need to identify these cancers at an earlier stage when they are more treatable as the earlier a person is diagnosed the better. After further sample testing the next step is to take this technology and put it into a user friendly format. With help from industry partners we will be able to further develop the Odoreader, which will enable it to be used where it is needed most; at a patient's bedside, in a doctor's surgery, in a clinic or Walk In Centre, providing fast, inexpensive, accurate results.\"\n\nProfessor Norman Ratcliffe said, \"There is currently no accurate test for prostate cancer, the vagaries of the PSA test indicators can sometimes result in unnecessary biopsies, resulting in psychological toll, risk of infection from the procedure and even sometimes missing cancer cases. Our aim is to create a test that avoids this procedure at initial diagnosis by detecting cancer in a non-invasive way by smelling the disease in men's urine. A few years ago we did similar work to detect bladder cancer following a discovery that dogs could sniff out cancer. We have been using the Odoreader, which is like an electronic nose to sense the cancer.\"\n\n\"The Odoreader has a 30 metre column that enables the compounds in the urine to travel through at different rates thus breaking the sample into a readable format. This is then translated into an algorithm enabling detection of cancer by reading the patterns presented. The positioning of the prostate gland which is very close to the bladder gives the urine profile a different algorithm if the man has cancer.\"\n\nMr Raj Prasad, Consultant Urologist at Southmead Hospital, North Bristol NHS Trust, said: \"If this test succeeds at full medical trial it will revolutionise diagnostics. Even with detailed template biopsies there is a risk that we may fail to detect prostate cancer in some cases. Currently indicators such as diagnosed prostatomegaly (enlarged prostate) and unusually high PSA levels can lead to recommendations for biopsy if there is a concern that cancer may be prevalent. An accurate urine test would mean that many men who currently undergo prostate biopsy may not need to do so.\"\n\nThe pilot trial was funded by the Rotary Club in Bristol who held annual Run for the Future events in Bristol.\n\nThe research team is now looking to fund a full clinical trial.\n\nA video in which Professor Probert explains how the machine works can be found here", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "The release contains several instances of unjustifiable language when it calls the test \u201crevolutionary\u201d and says earlier diagnosis is \u201curgent.\u201d Examples:\nIn fact, earlier diagnosis often does not yield expected benefits, because it\u2019s difficult to tell which cancers are aggressive and fast-growing and which ones grow so slowly that they would never cause a problem during the patient\u2019s lifetime.\nThe release also suggests the test could replace biopsy when there\u2019s no evidence for that. \u201cAn accurate urine test would mean that many men who currently undergo prostate biopsy may not need to do so,\u201d according to the release.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Researchers said they had identified a family of retroviruses in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, opening up a potentially promising new avenue of treatment for a debilitating disease that afflicts as many as four million Americans and 17 million people world-wide.\n\nThe finding will likely spur patients with the condition to seek treatment with drugs used to fight HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

Currently, the standard treatment includes a combination of psychotherapy and prescription medications such as mood stabilizers and antipsychotics.\n\nHowever, an emerging field of research is exploring the use of probiotics--often thought of as \"good bacteria\"--as a potential new avenue for treatment of bipolar and other psychiatric mood disorders. And a new study from Baltimore's Sheppard Pratt Health System, conducted by a research team led by Faith Dickerson, finds that a probiotic supplement may reduce inflammation of the gut, which is known to exacerbate bipolar disorder. Probiotic organisms are non-pathogenic bacteria that, when present in the gut flora, are known to improve the overall health of the host.\n\nIn recent years, research has demonstrated a strong link between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. This connection, named the \"gut-brain axis\" (GBA), allows for crosstalk between the endocrine, immune, and autonomic nervous systems. The GI tract is also home to the intestinal microbiome, a complex population of roughly 100 trillion microorganisms (more than ten times the number of cells that make up the human body) that interacts with the mucosal lining of the GI tract. Studies have shown that the intimate association between the gut microbiome and GI tissue has a significant effect on the GBA.\n\nThere is also mounting evidence linking imbalances in the microbial species that make up the gut microbiome to a number of health problems including allergies, autoimmune disorders, and psychiatric mood disorders.\n\nIn the case of bipolar disorder and the GBA, previous studies have shown that inflammation, or overstimulation of the body's immune system, is a contributing factor in the disease. With this in mind, researchers developed a probiotic supplement aimed at reducing inflammation caused by microbial imbalances in the gut.\n\nA group of patients recently hospitalized for mania participated in a 6-month study to track the effects of probiotic treatment on both their mood and the status of their immune system.\n\nThe patients were randomly selected to receive either the probiotic supplement or a placebo in addition to their usual medications. The results showed that the group receiving the probiotic supplement, on average, didn't return to the hospital as quickly and required less in-patient treatment time compared to the placebo group. The beneficial effects were most pronounced in those patients who exhibited abnormally high levels of inflammation at the beginning of the study.\n\nOverall, these results indicate that changes in intestinal inflammation can alter the trajectory of psychiatric mood disorders and that modulating the intestinal microbiota may be a new avenue of treatment for patients suffering from these diseases.", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "Along with the unsubstantiated headline suggesting \u201cmillions\u201d of people who suffer with bipolar disease could be helped by probiotics, the release employs the pseudoscientific term \u201cgut-brain axis\u201d to suggest there are known connections between good and bad bacteria, microbial balance, and psychiatric mood disorders.\nBut without data, much of the language used throughout the news release is unjustified.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "SATURDAY, March 31, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- A noninvasive scan might someday help doctors track the progress of prostate cancer and help guide treatment, researchers report.\n\nThe imaging tool, known as a prostate cancer-specific radiotracer, has so far only been tested successfully in mice.

Using positron emission tomography -- also known as a PET scan -- doctors are then able to better visualize tumors and tumor spread.\n\nIn studies involving mice with prostate cancer, the researchers had the radiotracer hone in on prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the same prostate cancer marker used in the PSA test.

Gains after two years were about the same for Eylea and Lucentis (ranibizumab), contrary to year-one results from the study, which showed Eylea with a clear advantage. The three drugs yielded similar gains in vision for patients with 20/32 or 20/40 vision at the start of treatment. The clinical trial was conducted by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net), which is funded by the National Eye Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health.\n\n\u201cThis rigorous trial confirms that Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis are all effective treatments for diabetic macular edema,\u201d said NEI Director Paul A. Sieving, M.D., Ph.D. \u201cEye care providers and patients can have confidence in all three drugs.\u201d\n\nEylea, Avastin, and Lucentis are all widely used to treat DME, a consequence of diabetes that can cause blurring of central vision due to the leakage of fluid from abnormal blood vessels in the retina. The macula is the area of the retina used when looking straight ahead. The drugs are injected into the eye and work by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a substance that can promote abnormal blood vessel growth and leakage. Although the drugs have a similar mode of action, they differ significantly in cost. Based on Medicare allowable charges, the per-injection costs of each drug at the doses used in this study were about $1850 for Eylea, about $60 for Avastin, and about $1200 for Lucentis.\n\nDRCR.net investigators enrolled 660 people with DME at 89 clinical trial sites across the United States. When the study began, participants on average were 61 years old with 17 years of type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Only people with a visual acuity of 20/32 or worse were eligible to participate (to see clearly, a person with 20/32 vision would have to be 20 feet away from an object that a person with normal vision could see clearly at 32 feet). At enrollment, about half the participants had 20/32 to 20/40 vision. The other half had 20/50 or worse vision. In many states, a corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better in at least one eye is required for a driver\u2019s license that allows both day- and nighttime driving.\n\nEach participant was assigned randomly to receive Eylea (2.0 milligrams/0.05 milliliter), Avastin (1.25 mg/0.05 mL), or Lucentis (0.3 mg/0.05 mL). Participants were evaluated monthly during the first year and every 4-16 weeks during the second year. Most participants received monthly injections during the first six months. Thereafter, participants received additional injections of assigned study drug until DME resolved or stabilized with no further vision improvement. Subsequently, injections were resumed if DME worsened. Additionally, laser treatment was given if DME persisted without continual improvement after six months of injections. Laser treatment alone was the standard treatment for DME until widespread adoption of anti-VEGF drugs a few years ago.\n\nAmong participants with 20/40 or better vision at the trial\u2019s start, all three drugs improved vision similarly on an eye chart. On average, participants\u2019 vision improved from 20/40 vision to 20/25.\n\nAmong participants with 20/50 or worse vision at the trial\u2019s start, visual acuity on average improved substantially in all three groups. At two years, Eylea participants were able to read about 3.5 additional lines on an eye chart; Lucentis participants were able to read about three additional lines, and Avastin participants improved about 2.5 lines, compared with visual acuity before treatment. Eylea outperformed Avastin at the one- and two-year time points. While Eylea outperformed Lucentis at the one-year time point, by the two-year time point gains in visual acuity were statistically no different. At the end of the trial, average visual acuity was 20/32 to 20/40 among participants in all three groups.\n\n\u201cThe results of the DRCR Network\u2019s comparison of Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis will help doctors and their patients with diabetic macular edema choose the most appropriate therapy,\u201d said John A. Wells, M.D., the lead author of the study and a retinal specialist at the Palmetto Retina Center, Columbia, South Carolina. \u201cThe study suggests there is little advantage of choosing Eylea or Lucentis over Avastin when a patient\u2019s loss of visual acuity from macular edema is mild, meaning a visual acuity of 20/40 or better. However, patients with 20/50 or worse vision loss may benefit from Eylea, which over the course of the two-year study outperformed Lucentis and Avastin.\u201d\n\nThe number of injections participants needed was about the same for all three treatment groups. Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis participants on average required nine injections in the first year of the study and five in the second year.\n\nThe need for laser treatment varied among the three treatment groups. By two years, 41 percent of participants in the Eylea group received laser treatment to treat their macular edema, compared with 64 percent of participants in the Avastin group and 52 percent in the Lucentis group.\n\nThe risk of heart attack, stroke, or death from a cardiovascular condition or an unknown cause by end of the trial was higher among participants in the Lucentis group. Twelve percent of Lucentis participants had at least one event, compared with five percent of participants in the Eylea group and eight percent of participants in the Avastin group. This difference in cardiovascular rates has not been seen across all other studies, and therefore may be due to chance. Continued assessment of these serious cardiovascular events and their association with these drugs is important in future studies. Cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke are common complications of diabetes. The occurrence of eye complications, such as eye infections and inflammation, was similar for all three drugs.\n\nResults of the study were published online today in Ophthalmology, the journal of the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Eylea and Lucentis were provided by drug manufacturers Regeneron and Genentech, respectively.

The new drug stabilizes dopamine signaling in areas of the brain that control movement and coordination.\n\nAccording to the study authors, this is the first drug shown to improve patients' loss of ability to move their muscles voluntarily. The only drug currently approved for Huntington's is tetrabenazine, which treats only involuntary movements and can cause serious side effects.\n\nThe results of the phase 3 clinical trial, conducted by Spanish researchers led by Dr. Justo Garcia de Yebenes, of the department of neurology, Hospital Ramon y Cajal in Madrid, appear in the Nov. 7 online edition of The Lancet Neurology.\n\nThe study included 437 Huntington's disease patients from eight European countries. The participants took either pridopidine (45 milligrams once daily or 45 mg twice daily) or a placebo for 26 weeks.\n\nAfter six months of treatment, patients taking the higher dose of pridopidine showed improvements in motor function -- specifically in eye and hand movements, involuntary muscle contractions (dystonia), and gait and balance -- compared with patients taking the placebo.\n\nMore than 70 percent of the patients taking the higher dose of the drug showed a significant benefit, according to the researchers. Side effects among patients taking the drug were similar to the placebo group.\n\n\"Pridopidine has the potential to complement available treatments by improving a different range of motor deficits. Its lack of severe side-effects . . . suggests that pridopidine might be useful even for those patients who are treated at sites that are not centers of excellence for Huntington's disease,\" the researchers concluded.\n\nOne U.S. neurologist agreed that the drug seems promising against a disease with few treatment options.\n\n\"There has been a great deal of attention for this drug, as it is one of the few molecules that in preliminary studies was found to have some efficacy in Huntington's disease,\" said Dr. Alessandro Di Rocco, professor in the department of neurology and chief of the division of movement disorders at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City.\n\n\"However, this is the first large study to show evidence of a positive result in treating the motor symptoms of this devastating disease. And, though the compound is apparently well tolerated without significant side effects, the benefit is modest and limited to the motor symptoms of the disease and it is unknown how long the improvement observed could last,\" he added.\n\nStill, pridopidine does not get at the underlying cause of Huntington's disease, Di Rocco said.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Huntington's is a progressive disease and this drug is not a treatment of the disease itself but only improves some of its symptoms,\" he explained. \"Nevertheless, it is a welcome addition because there is very little else yet available to treat the symptoms. The challenge for scientists and clinicians is to discover therapies that actually slows or halts the progression of the disease.\"\n\nAnother expert agreed that new treatment options for patients are sorely needed.\n\n\"A well-tolerated drug that produces even small benefits for patients with Huntington's disease would be a very welcome addition to the currently available treatments for this debilitating disorder,\" Andrew Feigin, from The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in New York City, wrote in an accompanying commentary.\n\nThe study was funded by European pharmaceuticals company NeuroSearch A/S.\n\nWe Move has more about Huntington's disease.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The same quotation in the news release is used in the HealthDay story, suggesting that the article was somewhat based off the news release.

And the news is very good.\n\nThe paper outlines the results of an international clinical trial, led by Jeff Elias, MD, of the University of Virginia Health System, that evaluated the scalpel-free approach called focused ultrasound for the treatment of essential tremor (ET), a condition that afflicts an estimated 10 million Americans. Not only did the researchers determine that the procedure was safe and effective, they found that it offered a lasting benefit, reducing shaking for trial participants throughout the 12-month study period.\n\n\u201cThis study represents a major advance for neurosurgery, treatment of brain disease and specifically the treatment of ET,\u201d Elias said. \u201cFor the first time in a randomized controlled trial, we have shown that ultrasound can be precisely delivered through the intact human skull to treat a difficult neurological disease.\u201d\n\nPioneering Tremor TrialThe multi-site clinical trial included 76 participants with moderate to severe essential tremor, a condition that often robs people of their ability to write, feed themselves and carry out their normal daily activities. The trial participants all had tried existing medications, without success. The mean age was 71, and most had suffered with their tremor for many years.\n\nSeventy-five percent of participants received the experimental treatment using focused ultrasound guided by magnetic resonance imaging. The remaining 25 percent underwent a sham procedure, to act as the control group. (They would later be given the opportunity to undergo the real procedure.)\n\nParticipants who received the treatment showed dramatic improvement, with the beneficial effects continuing throughout the study period. The researchers employed a 32-point scale to assess tremor severity, and they found that mean tremor scores improved by 47 percent at three months and 40 percent at 12 months. Participants reported major improvements in their quality of life. People who couldn\u2019t feed themselves soup or cereal could again do so.\n\nParticipants who received the sham procedure, on the other hand, showed no significant improvements.\n\n\u201cThe degree of tremor control was very good overall in the study, but the most important aspects were the significant gains in disabilities and quality of life \u2013 that\u2019s what patients really care about,\u201d Elias said.\n\nThe most commonly reported side effects were gait disturbances and numbness in the hand or face; in most instances, these side effects were temporary but some were permanent.\n\nFDA Approved Based on the clinical trial led by Elias, the federal Food and Drug Administration has approved the focused ultrasound device, manufactured by InSightec Inc., for the treatment of essential tremor. The device focuses sound waves inside the brain to create heat, much like a magnifying glass focuses light. That heat can then be used to interrupt the troublesome brain connections responsible for the tremor. Elias can actually watch as patients\u2019 tremor decreases, and the real-time imaging allows him to zone in on exactly the right spot before making any permanent changes to the brain.\n\nThe FDA approval means UVA can make the procedure available to eligible patients. UVA, however, is still working out the necessary logistics; it\u2019s not yet clear when Elias will begin treating patients. Because the approach is so new, insurance plans will not yet cover the procedure, though that may change in the coming months. The cost at UVA has not yet been determined.\n\nPeople interested in the procedure can learn more at uvahealth.com/focusedultrasound. The site includes a list of frequently asked questions and will be updated as UVA prepares to make the treatment available.\n\nThe procedure is not for everyone with essential tremor. It can\u2019t be used in patients who cannot undergo MRI imaging, including those with implanted metallic devices such as a pacemaker. It is also not available for pregnant women, people with heart conditions or very high blood pressure, patients with kidney disease or clotting disorders, patients on blood thinners, patients with a history of strokes or brain tumors and people with substance abuse issues. There are other exclusions as well. Doctors at UVA will evaluate potential patients to determine their eligibility and then recommend the best course of treatment.\n\nGroundbreaking ResearchUVA is a world leader in focused ultrasound research. Elias and his colleagues are testing the capability of focused ultrasound to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease, epilepsy, brain tumors and benign breast tumors.\n\nThe essential tremor research has been supported by InSightec, the Focused Ultrasound Foundation and the BIRD (US-Israel Binational Industry Research and Development) Foundation.\n\nFOR REPORTERS: Elias will be available for interviews today, and he\u2019ll be doing a Facebook Live broadcast at 3:15 Eastern.

People with hypertension have traditionally been advised to stay away from alcohol because excessive drinking can increase blood pressure. An international team of researchers led by Dr. Kenneth Mukamal and Joline Beulens sought to find out how moderate drinking affects cardiovascular disease in people with high blood pressure. A group of 11,711 men with hypertension were surveyed about their drinking habits every four years from 1986 to 2002. The researchers found that people who drank moderate amounts of beer, wine, or liquor had fewer heart attacks, though their risk of death was not significantly different from that of the other subjects in the study.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Having one or two drinks a day may be beneficial for men with high blood pressure, but studies like these shouldn't be used to justify excessive drinking. \"Men with hypertension who drink moderately and safely do not need to change their drinking habits,\" said Beulens, of the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands, who was the study's lead author.\n\nCAUTIONS: The study included only male healthcare providers, so it might not be generalizable to a broader population. And, one of the study authors, Eric Rimm of the Harvard School of Public Health, has been sponsored by the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States to speak at academic conferences.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT: Researchers said they want to see whether moderate drinking also benefits women with hypertension.\n\nWHERE TO FIND IT: Annals of Internal Medicine, Jan 2.\n\nCould negative stereotypes be self-fulfilling prophecies? Maryjane Wraga , associate professor of psychology at Smith College in Northampton, tested 54 women for spatial reasoning skills -- the ability to solve problems related to shape and measurement. Before the test, one group was exposed to a negative stereotype: They were told that women do not perform well at spatial reasoning. A second group received a positive message, and the control group received no message. The negative-message subjects made 14 percent more errors than the positive, with the control subjects falling in between. MRI measurements of brain activity in the subjects suggested that the difference was related to a surge in negative emotions. \"It's the difference between a B and an A\" on a test, says Wraga. Spatial reasoning skills are believed to be important in how people perform on standardized tests such as the SAT. A similar study by Wraga, soon to be published, finds men also perform worse under similar conditions. Overall, the results suggest that a change in societal messages could spur changes in actual performance. \"It sounds corny, but 'accentuate the positive,' \" Wraga says.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Exposure to negative stereotypes can actually cause people to perform more poorly.\n\nCAUTIONS: The study looks only at spatial reasoning. Different activities -- such as speech or music -- may be affected differently by stereotypes. The forthcoming study on men doesn't include an MRI component needed for a more complete comparison.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT: Wraga wants to study how long negative messages continue to impact performance after they are heard.\n\nWHERE TO FIND IT: Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, Dec. 7, 2006.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "There is no way to know if the story relied on a press release as the sole source of information.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "June 7, 2011 - People with well-controlled type 1 diabetes had even better sugar control, used less insulin, and lost an average of 10 pounds in six months when taking the type 2 diabetes drug Victoza in a small clinical study.\n\nThose who continued treatment for a full year continued these improvements and felt much better overall, says study leader Paresh Dandona, MD, of the State University of New York, Buffalo.\n\n\"It is a dramatic change.

They began looking for small variations in tiny DNA regions that were associated with prostate cancer. That resulted in the discovery, by several groups of investigators in Iceland and the United States, of the gene variants, small alterations in gene sequences. Unlike traditional genetic links to disease, the variants are not mutations that destroy a gene\u2019s function. In fact, no one knows what their effect is.\n\nThe next step was to ask whether those variants really could predict who had prostate cancer. So Dr. Jianfeng Xu, a professor of epidemiology and cancer biology at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, and his colleagues studied a Swedish population of 2,893 men with prostate cancer and 1,781 men who did not have it. That led to their finding that each of the five variants independently predicted prostate cancer risk.\n\n\u201cEach confers a moderate risk,\u201d Dr. Xu said, adding that the effect of having just one of the variants \u2014 a 10 or 20 percent increase in a man\u2019s chance of having prostate cancer \u2014 was not enough to justify using a single variant for screening. But, he added, because each conferred an independent risk, the risks added up so that the more men had, the greater their risk. Then they found that family history of the cancer added an independent risk. \u201cThat was very, very surprising to us,\u201d Dr. Xu said.\n\nThe next step, Dr. Isaacs said, is to look in other populations. \u201cWe think that can happen almost instantaneously,\u201d he said, explaining how scientists have blood samples and family histories of thousands of men who were tested for prostate cancer.\n\nBut some said that if the test leads to more screening, it is not necessarily a good thing. There is already too much prostate-cancer screening, they say, resulting in too much treatment. \u201cTo me, it is a nightmare,\u201d Dr. Albertsen said. \u201cWe are just feeding off of this cancer phobia.\u201d\n\nWhat is needed, and what the new test does not provide, is a way to decide which cancers are dangerous and which are not, Dr. Isaacs said. Still, he said the new test could help patients if it was used with caution. \u201cWe may be premature with this idea \u2014 everyone has a different way of thinking about this \u2014 but it should not take five years to know if we are on the right track. All this can happen very rapidly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have worked with enough families that have a positive family history to know that people are anxious to know their risk of prostate cancer,\u201d he said.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story included interview material with several respected clinicians active in this field.

They came with \"horrible\" side effects, he said, and so he rarely took them.\n\nAs a blood pressure monitor squeezed snugly around his arm, the pharmacist counseled Thomas, 49, on his diet and stress level while checking his blood pressure. She then helped Thomas find a medication better suited for his body.\n\nThomas was not at a health clinic or pharmacy or a primary care physician's office.\n\nHe was at the barbershop where he works in Inglewood, California. As part of a study, these health services were provided at his barbershop and others across Los Angeles County.\n\nThe study, published Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine , tested whether pharmacist-led programs in barbershops could significantly lower high blood pressure in black men in the United States.\n\nResults from 12 months after the study show that when guidance was coupled with medication, a blood pressure measurement of less than 130/80 was achieved by 68% of men who participated in the study program, versus 11% of those who didn't.\n\n\"To a certain extent, I was surprised by the magnitude of the effect of the intervention,\" said Ciantel Blyler, a clinical pharmacist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles who was a co-author of the study.\n\n\"Especially once we sat down and looked at the blood pressure control rates and we were comparing the intervention group and the control group, I was sort of taken aback,\" she said.\n\n\"The first number, called systolic blood pressure, measures the pressure in your blood vessels when your heart beats,\" the CDC says. \"The second number, called diastolic blood pressure, measures the pressure in your blood vessels when your heart rests between beats.\"\n\nMany older black men tend to avoid seeing the doctor until they have a serious health problem, and then they \"use the emergency room as a doctor,\" Thomas said.\n\n\"If it wasn't for the program, a lot of guys wouldn't have known they had high blood pressure,\" he said of the study. \"Unfortunately, I wish we had other programs to come in, too.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the barbershop represents a safe haven in the black community -- a no-judgment zone -- where conversations about health and other personal topics are commonplace.\n\nAs a barber, \"we know more about our customers than their spouses do,\" Thomas said.\n\nShape your hair and your blood pressure\n\nThe new study included 319 black men across 52 black-owned barbershops in California's Los Angeles County. The men, 35 to 79 years old, had systolic blood pressure of 140 or more.\n\nThe researchers randomly assigned the men, based on their barbershop, to participate in the pharmacist-led program or to a control group between February 2015 and July 2017.\n\nIn the program group, barbers encouraged the men to meet with specially trained pharmacists at the barbershop to help monitor their blood pressure. The pharmacists could prescribe drug therapy under a collaborative agreement with the men's doctors.\n\nAt his barbershop, Thomas said, many customers were hesitant to open up to the pharmacists and doctors and to meet with them for health consultations.\n\n\"No one wanted to do it,\" he said. \"But by them being there -- they were in there every day -- and then we got used to them, and they warmed up to everybody. ... Then a lot of guys eventually were like, 'I'll go. Let me make sure I'm OK.' \"\n\nBlyler said it didn't take long for the customers to warm up to her and her colleagues.\n\n\"They understood that we were there with good intentions. It was a very comfortable environment, and folks were very welcoming, and it really worked,\" she said.\n\nIn the control group, barbers encouraged the men to make lifestyle changes and doctor appointments, but not much else changed in their usual barbershop visits.\n\nBy the end of the study, the researchers found that the barbers' role in encouraging the men to monitor and improve their health resulted in a significant reduction in blood pressure, when coupled with medication from the pharmacists.\n\nIn participants assigned to the pharmacist-led program, the average reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 21.6 and 14.9 greater, respectively, than in those assigned to the control group at six months, the researchers found.\n\nAt 12 months, the average reductions were \"statistically indistinguishable\" from the six-month data, according to the researchers.\n\n'Medical mistrust has been an important barrier'\n\nThe study had some limitations, including that it was not blind, because both participants and researchers knew who was assigned to the pharmacist-led program and who was in the control group.\n\nAdditionally, more research is needed to determine whether similar study results would occur on a national level, since the study was conducted only in the Los Angeles area.\n\nAlso, pharmacists aimed to lower blood pressure in the program participants to less than 130/80, whereas the primary care providers of those in the control group probably targeted a blood pressure of less than 140/90.\n\nThe researchers found that 17.5% of men who received help were screened, compared with 8.4% of those who didn't receive the screening help.\n\n\"Medical mistrust has been an important barrier to African-Americans seeking health care, and so the barbershop -- where men go on a monthly basis and have an opportunity to develop a rapport with a trusted key opinion leader in the community -- that rapport is a perfect foundation for talking about health,\" Ravenell said.\n\n\"We know that when it comes to people being receptive to health messages, the setting and the mood that people are in can have an impact on how open they are to receiving those messages,\" he said. \"Since the barbershop is a place where men want to be, it's a place that's known for open collegial conversation, it really is a perfect place to relay health messages that are important for black men.\"\n\nThe history of barbershops as havens for health\n\nIn the years to come, as racial segregation laws limited the spaces where black Americans could gather, the barbershop served as a safe meeting space for the black community. In barbershops, black men could speak openly and honestly about a range of topics, including their health -- and that seems to continue today.\n\n\"I think that what's so wonderful about health outreach in the barbershop: It's a comfortable place,\" Blyler said.\n\n\"Folks can ask questions or get information about their health in a 'low-stakes,' relaxed environment,\" she said. \"Barbershops are a social hub for black men, a place where they gather, when getting a haircut or not, and share information.\"", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "This does not appear to rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Acupuncture No Better Than Placebo for Hot Flashes\n\nThe search for a benign, effective alternative treatment for hot flashes -- which has included the use of soy products, Chinese herbs and hypnosis -- has hit another roadblock.\n\nA new study of acupuncture by Mayo Clinic researchers has found that sham treatments were no better than real acupuncture in relieving the daily drenching sweats that some women find disabling during menopause.\n\nThe new research, presented last month at the North American Research Conference on Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Edmonton, Alberta, is scheduled to be published in the journal Menopause early next year, according to lead researcher Ann Vincent, an assistant professor of medicine at the Rochester, Minn., clinic.\n\nVincent said she and her colleagues were disappointed by the results of the study, which was funded by Mayo and prompted in part by the findings from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), a federally funded study of more than 36,000 women ages 50 to 79.\n\n\"We were hoping for something better,\" she said.\n\nBeginning in 2002, WHI researchers reported that estrogen was beneficial in reducing hot flashes, but that the hormone, routinely prescribed to middle-aged women for years, also raised the risk of cancer, heart disease, stroke, dementia and other ailments.\n\nAs a result, federal health officials have recommended that women bothered by menopausal symptoms such as unpredictable sweats, sleep disturbances and vaginal dryness take the lowest dose of estrogen for the shortest possible time. Hot flashes, one of the most common symptoms of menopause, affect an estimated 75 percent of women, most of them in their forties and fifties.\n\nIt is unclear what causes hot flashes, which range in severity from barely noticeable to embarrassingly obvious and can leave some sufferers red-faced and wrung out. In most cases they are transitory, lasting only a few months or years, but in some cases they can last a decade or more. Hot flashes typically begin in the year or so before menopause and tend to abate in the years afterward.\n\nExperts in women's health say they are one of the most common ailments for which women use alternative medicine and that interest in non-hormonal treatments has increased as a result of the WHI findings.\n\nThe study of acupuncture as a remedy for hot flashes was sparked by reports from women who had undergone the ancient Chinese therapy for other problems and reported that their hot flashes seemed to moderate.\n\nAcupuncture involves the use of hair-thin disposable metallic needles inserted into various parts of the body; treatments are supposed to be painless and are designed to correct energy imbalances.\n\nThe 2,000-year-old treatment is widely used around the world, according to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nA 1997 NIH consensus statement on acupuncture found that its success has been mixed, but some studies have found that it might be effective in blunting postoperative pain and in reducing the vomiting and nausea that often follows chemotherapy.\n\nTo prove it is effective in reducing hot flashes, the Mayo team needed to demonstrate that it was superior to sham, or placebo, treatment. That requirement has hobbled other alternative treatments, including the herb red clover and vitamin E supplements. That's because hot flashes have a high placebo-response rate: Symptoms often improve, at least temporarily, with a dummy treatment. Researchers believe this may result from the perception of patients that they are being treated with something that is likely to be effective.\n\nVincent's group recruited 103 women between the ages of 45 and 59 who reported that they had at least five hot flashes per day and were not using any other treatments for them. Half were randomly assigned to receive a series of 10 standardized acupuncture treatments -- needles were placed at the same spots in the arms, legs and lower belly; the other half received sham treatments in which needles were placed superficially near the same locations but away from so-called pressure points.\n\nResearchers knew who was receiving sham treatment, but the women, who completed questionnaires detailing the extent of their hot flashes, did not.\n\nBy the end of six weeks, there was no difference between the groups: 61 percent of the sham group was experiencing hot flashes, while 62 percent who got actual acupuncture reported them.\n\nThat doesn't surprise Adriane Fugh-Berman, associate professor in the complementary medicine program at Georgetown University School of Medicine.\n\n\"Hot flashes are one of the most placebo-responsive conditions,\" she said. Some herbs and supplements seem to work, she added, but improvement has proven to be temporary. ?", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "There is no evidence that this story relied on a news release.

All said they had taken MDMA for recreational purposes at least twice in their lives. They were randomly assigned to take either a low or moderate dose of MDMA, methamphetamine or a sugar pill during four sessions in about a three-week period.\n\nEach session lasted at least 4.5 hours, or until all effects of the drug had worn off. During that time, participants stayed in a laboratory testing room, and social interaction was limited to contact with a research assistant who helped administer cognitive exams.\n\nA moderate dose of MDMA was found to significantly increase feelings of loving, friendliness and playfulness, the researchers said, whereas the low dose of MDMA boosted feelings of loneliness.\n\nThe moderate dose also prompted a drop in the ability to accurately recognize fear in other people's faces, determined by having the participants look at a range of photos, the study found, but it did not affect the ability to perceive the shifting cues in a person's eyes or voice, determined by having the participants listen to a series of audio clips.\n\nThis effect, the Bedi and his team suggested, could help people improve their social skills by shielding them from the negative emotions of others.\n\nIn a twist, the researchers also found that methamphetamine similarly prompted feelings of friendliness and loving. In fact, those who took the drug actually rated themselves as more sociable than those taking MDMA.\n\nAs a warning, the researchers noted that MDMA might indeed facilitate socializing, but it also might impair a person's perceptive abilities and thus prompt risk-taking.\n\nNonetheless, the researchers suggested that MDMA might help people with PTSD as well those with autism, schizophrenia or antisocial personality disorder cope with a variety of emotional difficulties.\n\n\"More controlled research is needed to establish whether MDMA can safely and effectively add to psychotherapy for some conditions and, if so, what the mechanisms of these effects are,\" Bedi said.\n\nDr. Michael Mithoefer, author of the earlier study on MDMA and PTSD, also urged further exploration of the medicinal potential of the drug.\n\n\"First, I think it's very important that we investigate potential new therapies, and that we shouldn't be dissuaded from doing that just because something can be misused,\" he said. \"Many things can be life-threatening or dangerous if used incorrectly. But if used in the right setting wisely, many things can also be helpful. So there's no question we should be looking into how this might benefit people who are suffering.\"\n\nThe results of his earlier study, which had focused on the moderate dose of MDMA, \"were very promising,\" Mithoefer said. \"Now, there's a long way to go between that and proving effectiveness.

Although smoking rates in the United States have declined in recent decades, tens of millions of adults continue to smoke, and the habit causes more than 440,000 deaths a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAn effective vaccine could play a major role in reducing smoking around the world, said Dr. Vocci, who estimated that current rates of smoking would lead to one billion deaths in the 21st century.\n\nSurveys show that about 7 in 10 smokers say they would like to quit, but a vast majority of those who try end up relapsing. While the market for smoking cessation therapies is estimated to be more than $1 billion annually, many smokers continue to fail in their efforts to quit even while using the available products, with long-term success rates generally peaking at about 20 percent.\n\n\"It's the period between four-week abstinence and one-year abstinence that's the critical period,\" said Dr. Victor I. Reus, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, and a lead investigator on the NicVax study.\n\nIf the vaccine helps smokers quit, Dr. Reus said, a central question will be whether booster shots could help prevent relapse.\n\nThe classic nicotine buzz occurs when the molecule travels in the bloodstream across the \"blood-brain barrier\" to reach specific receptors in the brain. Nicotine itself does not cause the body to create antibodies as part of an immunological response, the way disease-causing viruses and bacteria do.\n\nThe anti-nicotine antibodies generated by NicVax are proteins that bind to the nicotine molecule. Because the compound is too big to cross the blood-brain barrier, the vaccine is expected to diminish or eliminate the pleasure associated with puffing a cigarette. This lack of positive physiological reinforcement for smoking is believed to reduce the nicotine craving that causes smokers to fail in their efforts to quit.\n\nThe most widespread therapies currently available are nicotine-replacement products, like nicotine patches and gum, which are designed to wean the smoker by administering trickles of nicotine to the body, replacing the surges delivered by cigarettes.\n\nZyban, a repackaging of the antidepressant Wellbutrin, was approved by the F.D.A. a decade ago for smoking cessation. Most recently, the F.D.A. approved Chantix, which works by binding to the nicotine receptors in the brain.\n\nThe current study will test vaccine dosages and sequences of four or five shots; some subjects will get a placebo.

Rush began offering SAVI SCOUT, which has been used in more than 50 lumpectomy surgeries, in July.\n\nSAVI SCOUT allows a radiologist to insert a radar wave reflector the size of a grain of rice in the patient\u2019s breast up to 30 days before surgery to mark the location of the lesion, as shown with ultrasound or X-ray mammography. The reflector replaces the widespread current practice of inserting a thin, hooked wire into the breast the same day as surgery.\n\n\u201cWhen there is an abnormality that we can\u2019t feel and are unable to biopsy, we have to find that lesion in surgery,\u201d said Dr. Andrea Madrigrano, assistant professor of surgery at Rush University Medical Center.\n\nSAVI SCOUT replaces a more inconvenient technique used since '70s\n\nUsed since the 1970s, a hooked wire is placed in the breast through the skin to the abnormality using ultrasound or X-ray guidance with local anesthesia. The wire is placed into the breast to help guide the surgeon in removing the abnormality later that day.\n\n\u201cUntil now, a patient would go to the imaging center to have the thin wire precisely placed in the breast. The woman would then be taken to the operating room area,\u201d Madrigrano said.\n\nWire localization requires a high degree of coordination between radiology and surgical scheduling, which can lead to delays between placement of the wire and surgery, often requiring a woman to wait long periods of time with the wire in her breast.\n\n\u201cBefore surgery, these patients are in a hospital gown and are walking around while this wire is in place, which obviously is less than ideal for the patient,\u201d Madrigrano said.\n\n\u201cThe radar reflector is a replacement for the wire and is essentially a little marker. After the patient receives a local anesthetic, it can be placed into the breast using an extremely thin needle under image guidance days or weeks prior to surgery. Because this important step is out of the way in advance, it completely changes the patient\u2019s day of surgery experience.\u201d\n\nRadar can target abnormality within 1 mm, sparing more healthy tissue\n\nUnlike mastectomy, which treats breast cancer by removing an entire breast, lumpectomy surgery \u2014 also known as breast-conserving surgery \u2014 is used to remove only the tumor and a small amount of tissue surrounding the tumor. Using the SAVI SCOUT system technology, which emits 50 million radar pulses per second, surgeons can target the affected tissue within 1 millimeter of the reflector.\n\n\u201cWhen Madrigrano told me about it, I thought it was an ingenious idea and I\u2019m glad it was developed,\u201d said Nancy Morrissey, who underwent lumpectomy surgery at Rush in July using the SAVI SCOUT technology. \u201cIt made surgery go smoothly, and I didn\u2019t have any pain before or after.\n\n\u201cWhen the marker was inserted near the lump, it was similar to a biopsy. I was glad it was done a week before and not the same day as the lumpectomy surgery. I have been very impressed with the experience.\u201d According to Cianna Medical, the company that created SAVI SCOUT, 70 percent of women return to work the next day after the SCOUT procedure.\n\nIn addition to enhancing the patient\u2019s surgical experience, the more precise localization of the surgical site enable surgeons to plan the procedure better. That advantage may lead to less tissue needing to be removed and a better appearance of the breast after surgery.\n\n\u201cUltimately, this wireless technology has the potential to reduce surgical delays, and more importantly will benefit patients by increasing comfort and satisfaction during a stressful time,\u201d Madrigrano said.", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "The release doesn\u2019t rely on sensational language.

But, by good fortune, the protein turns up in exosomes only when there is cancer, so its presence could be an early, and testable, marker for the disease.\n\nIt\u2019s rare to discover pancreatic cancer early, said study coauthor Dr. Raghu Kalluri, professor and chairman of the department of cancer biology at the MD Anderson Cancer Center. \u201cPeople don\u2019t feel any symptoms that make them want to go to the clinic until their cancer is stage 3 or stage 4,\u201d he added. \u201cUsing this test we were 100 percent accurate at identifying all cancer patients.\u201d\n\nIn 2015 48,960 Americans will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, according to estimates by the National Cancer Institute. And an estimated 40,560 will die from the disease. It is the most deadly cancer with just 7.2 percent surviving five years.\n\nFor perspective, over the course of a lifetime, 1.5 percent of Americans will develop pancreatic cancer.\n\nWhile quite promising, the new findings will need to be verified and validated by other studies, experts told NBC News. And even if it passes muster, it will take some time before a test could be developed to screen for the disease.\n\nKalluri and his colleagues examined serum samples from 190 patients with pancreatic cancer, 32 patients with breast cancer and 100 healthy volunteers. They found levels of the protein in exosomes correlated with the severity of the disease \u2014 so there was more in patients with more advanced disease. It was not present in the healthy volunteers.\n\nEven more promising are the findings from the seven patients with early pancreatic cancer that were detectable through their protein levels. Further, levels dropped when patients had surgery to remove their tumors, so the marker could also be used to follow the progression of the disease, Kalluri said.\n\nKalluri says that a screening test might be available in as little as a year.

It is a good example of how this disease sneaks up on people and gives no warning.\u201d\n\nA test for pancreatic cancer could save lives, perhaps even Flippo-Morton\u2019s, Raghavan said.\n\n\u201cIf this study is confirmed, this will make a difference because it\u2019s one of the cancers we don\u2019t have any reliable screening test for,\u201d he added. \u201cIt kills people and it kills them quickly.\u201d\n\nA screening test could have a huge effect, said Dr. Timothy Donahue, an associate professor of surgery and molecular and medical pharmacology and chief of pancreas and gastrointestinal surgery at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cPancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in this country and it\u2019s predicted, if the current prevalence and survival rate continues, that it will become number two within the next five to 10 years,\u201d Donahue said. \u201cSomething like this could potentially flatten that curve and change the epidemiology of pancreatic cancer.\u201d\n\nStill, Donahue said, the method needs to be \u201cheavily vetted and validated. But it\u2019s as good of an academic start as I\u2019ve ever seen. It now needs to be taken over by some diagnostic corporation before it can launch into something for widespread use.\u201d\n\nWhat needs to be determined is \u201cwhat the sensitivity and specificity would be in a screening population of 100,000 people,\u201d said Dr. Brian Wolpin, of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. \u201cIn this study the patients were known to have cancer or not to have cancer.

It is less useful for some of the most common diseases, such as heart disease or diabetes, because they are influenced by vast numbers of genes-gone-wrong working together in complicated ways.\n\nOn Monday, researchers revealed a new way to measure millions of small genetic variations that add up to cause harm, letting them calculate someone's inherited risk for the most common form of heart disease and four other serious disorders. They estimated that up to 25 million Americans may have triple the average person's risk for coronary artery disease even if they haven't yet developed warning signs like high cholesterol.\n\n\"What I foresee is in five years, each person will know this risk number, this 'polygenic risk score,' similar to the way each person knows his or her cholesterol,\" said Dr. Sekar Kathiresan, who led the research team from the Broad Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School.\n\nIf the approach pans out and doctors adopt it, a bad score wouldn't mean that you'd get a disease, just that your genetic makeup increases the chance \u2014 one more piece of information in deciding on care.

An unhealthy lifestyle could overwhelm the protection of good genes.\n\nThe scoring system can also predict an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, breast cancer and an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation, the team reported in the journal Nature Genetics \u2014 noting that next steps include learning what might likewise lower those risks.\n\nIt doesn't require the most sophisticated type of genetic testing. Instead, Kathiresan can calculate risk scores for those five diseases \u2014 eventually maybe more \u2014 simply by reanalyzing the kind of raw data people receive after sending a cheek swab to companies like 23andMe.\n\nA geneticist who specializes in cardiovascular disease, he hopes to open a website where people can send in such data to learn their heart risk, as part of continuing research. Kathiresan and co-author Dr. Amit Khera, a Mass General cardiologist, are co-inventors on a patent application for the system.\n\nOther scientists and companies have long sought ways to measure risk from multiple, additive gene effects \u2014 the \"poly\" in polygenic \u2014 and Myriad Genetics has begun selling a type of polygenic test for breast cancer risk.\n\nBut specialists in heart disease and genetics who weren't involved with the research called the new findings exciting because of their scope.\n\n\"The results should be eye-opening for cardiologists,\" said Dr. Charles C. Hong, director of cardiovascular research at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. \"The only disappointment is that this score applies only to those with European ancestry, so I wonder if similar scores are in the works for the large majority of the world population that is not white.\"\n\nHong pointed to a friend who recently died of a massive heart attack despite being a superfit marathon runner who'd never smoked, the kind of puzzling death that doctors have long hoped that a better understanding of genetics could help to prevent.\n\n\"Most of the variation in disease risk comes from an enormous number of very tiny effects\" in genes, agreed Stanford University genetics Professor Jonathan Pritchard. \"This is the first time polygenic scores have really been shown to reach the level of precision where they can have an impact\" on patient health.\n\nFirst, the Boston-based team combed previous studies that mapped the DNA of large numbers of people, looking for links to the five diseases \u2014 not outright mutations but minor misspellings in the genetic code.\n\nEach variation alone would have only a tiny effect on health. They developed a computerized system that analyzed how those effects add up, and tested it using DNA and medical records from 400,000 people stored in Britain's UK Biobank. Scores more than three times the average person's risk were deemed high.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "There\u2019s no indication that this story relied on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Lost Posture: Why Some Indigenous Cultures May Not Have Back Pain\n\nEditor's note, June 10: We have added an acknowledgement of several sources that Esther Gokhale used while developing her theories on back pain. These include physiotherapy methods, such as the Alexander Technique and the Feldenkrais Method, and the work of anthropologist Noelle Perez-Christiaens.\n\nBack pain is a tricky beast. Most Americans will at some point have a problem with their backs. And for an unlucky third, treatments won't work, and the problem will become chronic.\n\nBelieve it or not, there are a few cultures in the world where back pain hardly exists. One indigenous tribe in central India reported essentially none. And the discs in their backs showed little signs of degeneration as people aged.\n\nAn acupuncturist in Palo Alto, Calif., thinks she has figured out why. She has traveled around the world studying cultures with low rates of back pain \u2014 how they stand, sit and walk. Now she's sharing their secrets with back pain sufferers across the U.S.\n\nAbout two decades ago, Esther Gokhale started to struggle with her own back after she had her first child. \"I had excruciating pain. I couldn't sleep at night,\" she says. \"I was walking around the block every two hours. I was just crippled.\"\n\nGokhale had a herniated disc. Eventually she had surgery to fix it. But a year later, it happened again. \"They wanted to do another back surgery. You don't want to make a habit out of back surgery,\" she says.\n\nThis time around, Gokhale wanted to find a permanent fix for her back. And she wasn't convinced Western medicine could do that. So Gokhale started to think outside the box. She had an idea: \"Go to populations where they don't have these huge problems and see what they're doing.\"\n\n[Added June 10] So Gokhale studied findings from anthropologists, such as Noelle Perez-Christiaens, who analyzed postures of indigenous populations. And she studied physiotherapy methods, such as the Alexander Technique and the Feldenkrais Method.\n\nThen over the next decade, Gokhale went to cultures around the world that live far away from modern life. She went to the mountains in Ecuador, tiny fishing towns in Portugal and remote villages of West Africa.\n\n\"I went to villages where every kid under age 4 was crying because they were frightened to see somebody with white skin \u2014 they'd never seen a white person before,\" she says.\n\nGokhale took photos and videos of people who walked with water buckets on their heads, collected firewood or sat on the ground weaving, for hours.\n\n\"I have a picture in my book of these two women who spend seven to nine hours everyday, bent over, gathering water chestnuts,\" Gokhale says. \"They're quite old. But the truth is they don't have a back pain.\"\n\nShe tried to figure out what all these different people had in common. The first thing that popped out was the shape of their spines. \"They have this regal posture, and it's very compelling.\"\n\nAnd it's quite different than American spines.\n\nIf you look at an American's spine from the side, or profile, it's shaped like the letter S. It curves at the top and then back again at the bottom.\n\nBut Gokhale didn't see those two big curves in people who don't have back pain. \"That S shape is actually not natural,\" she says. \"It's a J-shaped spine that you want.\"\n\nIn fact, if you look at drawings from Leonardo da Vinci \u2014 or a Gray's Anatomy book from 1901 \u2014 the spine isn't shaped like a sharp, curvy S. It's much flatter, all the way down the back. Then at the bottom, it curves to stick the buttocks out. So the spine looks more like the letter J.\n\n\"The J-shaped spine is what you see in Greek statues. It's what you see in young children. It's good design,\" Gokhale says.\n\nSo Gokhale worked to get her spine into the J shape. And gradually her back pain went away.\n\nThen Gokhale realized she could help others. She developed a set of exercises, wrote a book and set up a studio in downtown Palo Alto.\n\nNow her list of clients is impressive. She's helped YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki and Matt Drudge of the Drudge Report. She has given classes at Google, Facebook and companies across the country. In Silicon Valley, she's known as the \"posture guru.\"\n\nEach year, doctors in the Bay Area refer hundreds of patients to Gokhale. One of them is Dr. Neeta Jain, an internist at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation. She puts Gokhale's method in the same category as Pilates and yoga for back pain. And it doesn't bother her that the method hasn't been tested in a clinical trial.\n\n\"If people are finding things that are helpful, and it's not causing any harm, then why do we have to wait for a trial?\" Jain asked.\n\nBut there's still a big question looming here: Is Gokhale right? Have people in Western cultures somehow forgotten the right way to stand?\n\nScientists don't know yet, says Dr. Praveen Mummaneni, a neurosurgeon at the University of California, San Francisco's Spine Center. Nobody has done a study on traditional cultures to see why some have lower rates of back pain, he says. Nobody has even documented the shape of their spines.\n\n\"I'd like to go and take X-rays of indigenous populations and compare it to people in the Western world,\" Mummaneni says. \"I think that would be helpful.\"\n\nBut there's a whole bunch of reasons why Americans' postures \u2014 and the shape of their spines \u2014 may be different than those of indigenous populations, he says. For starters, Americans tend to be much heavier.\n\n\"If you have a lot of fat built up in the belly, that could pull your weight forward,\" Mummaneni says. \"That could curve the spine. And people who are thinner probably have less curvature\" \u2014 and thus a spine shaped more like J than than an S.\n\nAmericans are also much less active than people in traditional cultures, Mummaneni says. \"I think the sedentary lifestyle promotes a lack of muscle tone and a lack of postural stability because the muscles get weak.\"\n\nEveryone knows that weak abdominal muscles can cause back pain. In fact, Mummaneni says, stronger muscles might be the secret to Gokhale's success.\n\nIn other words, it's not that the J-shaped spine is the ideal one \u2014 or the healthiest. It's what goes into making the J-shaped spine that matters: \"You have to use muscle strength to get your spine to look like a J shape,\" he says.\n\nSo Gokhale has somehow figured out a way to teach people to build up their core muscles without them even knowing it. \"Yes, I think that's correct,\" Mummaneni says. \"You're not going to be able to go from the S- to the J-shaped spine without having good core muscle strength. And I think that's key here.\"\n\nSo indigenous people around the world don't have a magic bullet for stopping back pain. They've just got beefy abdominal muscles, and their lifestyle helps to keep them that way, even as they age.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story isn\u2019t linked to any news release that we could find, and includes enough original reporting that we can be sure it wasn\u2019t based entirely on a release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Robert Bush has multiple sclerosis (MS), which sapped his ability to walk five years ago. Joseph McGlynn suffered a stroke that seriously impaired his left side, also five years ago.\n\nUsing technology designed by Case Western Reserve University and the Advanced Platform Technology and Functional Electrical Stimulation centers at the Louis Stokes Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center, the two men got their feet back under them.\n\nTwo studies, published in the American Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, show that functional electrical stimulation (FES) significantly helped McGlynn and Bush to effectively walk at the medical center.\n\n\"I went in there and I could barely take two steps,\" said Bush, 42, who researchers believe is the world's first MS patient to \"test-drive\" an implanted FES system. The proof-of-feasibility test lasted 90 days. \"At the end,\" said Bush, of Columbus, Ohio, \"I was walking down the hallway. To me, it was monumental.\" A video of him walking with and without the system can be found at: https:/ .\n\nMcGlynn, 69, of North Royalton, Ohio, could walk with a cane, but not easily. With the technology switched on, he covered far more ground and his pace was twice as fast during his 30-week study.\n\n\"It's helped with balance and confidence,\" said McGlynn, who used to tread a lot of stairs maintaining equipment at a steel plant. \"I'm confident now that I can walk without stumbling and falling.\" A video of him walking with and without aid of the system can be found here: https:/ .\n\nNathan Makowski, an investigator at the Cleveland FES Center, created by Case Western Reserve and the Cleveland VA, said that FES technology has been used primarily for therapy in stroke patients in the past. \"This, though, is a more long-term assistive system,\" he said.\n\nThe researchers hope these studies will lay the foundation for implanted systems that restore some independence to people with MS or who have suffered a stroke.\n\nTheir numbers are substantial. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society estimates that more than 2.3 million people have the disease worldwide. Surveys have found that 93 percent suffer gait impairment within 10 years of diagnosis and 13 percent report they are unable to walk twice a week. Other research has found that 6 million to 7 million people live with stroke nationally and nearly 30 percent require assistance to walk.\n\n\"In both cases, there is a disconnect between the brain and muscles,\" said Stephen Selkirk, MD, a neurologist at the VA's Spinal Cord Injury Division and assistant professor of neurology at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine. \"This system replaces the lost connection.\"\n\nThe system includes implanted electrodes that tie into nerves that control muscles collectively, called hip and knee flexors and ankle dorsoflexors. In healthy people, the muscles work in seamless coordination each step they take.\n\nWhen Bush or McGlynn walks, he pushes a button on an external controller, which sends signals to a pulse generator, which then sends electrical pulses to the electrodes. The pulses stimulate the nerves, which in turn stimulate the muscles in both of Bush's legs and McGlynn's left leg.\n\n\"Both guys were taking steps the first time we turned the systems on,\" said Ron Triolo, a professor of orthopaedics and biomedical engineering at Case Western Reserve and executive director of the Advanced Platform Technology (APT) Center. \"When Robert Bush took a step, it wasn't' pretty, but we saw the potential.\"\n\nIn each patient, \"the pulses are sent in a pattern that is close to how normal muscles work,\" said Rudi Kobetic, a principal investigator at the Stokes Cleveland VA and APT Center. \"We try to time the pattern to stimulation so that it's integrated with their ability. Similar to regular physical therapy, we can see results.\"\n\nBoth men gained strength and endurance through repeated use of the systems and fine-tuning by the researchers.\n\nBush went from the two steps to consistently walking more than 30 yards during the trial. In that time, he used a walker to help maintain his balance.\n\n\"When they turned it on the first time, I was surprised how well it worked,\" said Bush, who had to give up his construction career due to the disease. \"I lifted my knee like I was high-stepping. Once we got it fine-tuned and I got walking, I thought it was amazing. I still think it's amazing.\"\n\nMcGlynn's gait became noticeably more symmetrical and energetic, the researchers said. His gait without the system was about 19 yards per minute; with the system, 47 yards per minute. Training with the system improved McGlynn's speed when it was turned off to 23 yards per minute, indicating therapeutic benefit.\n\n\"Distance is a challenge,\" he said. Initially, he could walk 83 yards but improved to 1,550 yards--nearly a mile--at the faster gait. \"I work up a good sweat and that makes me feel good,\" he said.\n\nDue to his improvements, the research team is developing a system that McGlynn can use at home and outside.\n\n\"I'll be able to walk for exercise and hopefully be able to walk into church and into a restaurant,\" McGlynn said.\n\nWhen Bush's trial ended, surgeons removed his implanted electrodes. The researchers are seeking funding to fit him with a permanent FES system in a clinical trial.\n\nIn the meantime, Bush is now back to using a wheelchair but working to maintain his strength and flexibility, repeatedly standing and sitting while holding onto a rail or standing for long periods of time. \"I'm keeping things ready for when they get the green light,\" he said.\n\nOther researchers who contributed to the two studies are the APT Center's Lisa Lombardo, physical therapist; Kevin Foglyano, biomedical engineer; and Gilles Pinault, MD, a surgeon and co-director of the center.", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "The release doesn\u2019t rely on sensational language.

They find:\n\nA plant-based vegetarian diet is associated with total cholesterol that's 29.2 mg/dL lower in observational studies. In clinical trials, a plant-based diet lowers total cholesterol by 12.5 mg/dL.\n\u2022 In observational studies, a plant-based vegetarian diet is associated with a 22.9 mg/dL reduction in LDL cholesterol and a 3.6 mg/dL reduction in HDL cholesterol, compared to control groups following an omnivorous diet.\n\u2022 In clinical trials, a plant-based vegetarian diet lowers LDL cholesterol by 12.2 mg/dL and reduces HDL cholesterol by 3.4 mg/dL, compared to control groups following an omnivorous, low-fat, calorie-restricted, or a conventional diabetes diet.\n\u2022 A plant-based vegetarian diet is not associated with statistically significant changes in triglyceride levels in observational studies or in clinical trials.\n\nThe authors predict the strong correlation between vegetarian diets and lower cholesterol levels may be due to the association a plant-based diet has with a lower body weight, a reduced intake of saturated fat, and an increased intake of plant foods, like vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, and whole grains, which are naturally rich in components such as soluble fiber, soy protein, and plant sterols.\n\nThe study authors hypothesize that the greater risk reduction for total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol levels observed in the longitudinal studies is likely due to long-term adherence to plant-based eating patterns and changes in body composition.\n\n\"The immediate health benefits of a plant-based diet, like weight loss, lower blood pressure, and improved cholesterol, are well documented in controlled studies,\" says study author Susan Levin, M.S., R.D., C.S.S.D. \"Our goal with studying plasma lipids throughout the lifespan is to capture the net risk reduction of using a vegetarian diet to control lipid levels.

Within the first month of making the dietary change, he effortlessly lost 10 pounds. Within a year, Dr. Ross traded a 34-year career of practicing emergency medicine for a new career path: lifestyle medicine. After 5.5 years of making the career switch, he continues to host free biweekly nutrition classes for his primary care patients and the community. More than 700 people have enrolled to learn how to lose weight, eliminate the need for medications to treat type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and elevated cholesterol, and to simply feel better. His former hometown of Roseburg, Ore., is now a Blue Zones community. He is a part-time instructor at the College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific Northwest and hopes to set an example for future physicians.\n\n\"I no longer work for a living,\" notes Dr. Ross, who now resides in Westfir, Ore. \"I wake up every day eager to hear about how a plant-based diet and a healthful lifestyle is changing and saving lives in our community.

The 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans highlights a healthy vegetarian diet as one of three healthful eating plans to follow.\n\nThe study authors also note hyperlipidemia, or elevated cholesterol and triglycerides, is often underdiagnosed and undertreated. A 10 percent increase in the prevalence of treatment for hyperlipidemia can prevent 8,000 deaths each year. Taking small steps, like those proposed by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel 3, which include assessing heart disease risk, making lifestyle and dietary recommendations, and assessing the need for future follow-up appointments and pharmaceutical interventions, could prevent approximately 20,000 heart attacks, 10,000 cases of coronary heart disease, and save almost $3 billion in medical costs each year.\n\n\"To make any form of health care work and to truly power economic mobility, we have to get healthy,\" says Levin. \"The first place to start is by building meals around nutrient-packed, plant-based foods, which fit into nearly every cultural template, taste preference, and budget.\"\n\nTo request a copy of the study or to request an interview with a study author, please contact Jessica Frost at 202-527-7342.\n\nFounded in 1985, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine is a nonprofit organization that promotes preventive medicine, conducts clinical research, and encourages higher standards for ethics and effectiveness in research.", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "Overall, the release did not raise any of our red flags for sensational language.

(1)\n\nThis paper emphasized that overall diet quality, rather than individual foods, may have a greater impact on reducing risk of physical function impairments. Specifically, diet quality traits most associated with reduced rates of incident physical impairment were higher intake of fruits and vegetables; lower intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, trans fat, and sodium; and moderate alcohol intake. Among food components, the strongest relations were found for increased intakes of oranges, orange juice, apples, pears, romaine or leaf lettuce, and walnuts.\n\n\"There's a lot of research that looks at specific health conditions in aging, such as diabetes and heart disease, but less attention to research on quality of life and ability to maintain independence with aging,\" said Dr. Francine Grodstein, ScD, professor of medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. \"The simple message from this study is that eating an overall healthy diet, including certain foods, such as walnuts and other whole foods, may help women with the ability to do key everyday tasks as they age, like carrying groceries or dressing themselves.\"\n\nThe researchers looked at data from 54,762 women in the Nurses' Health Study, which tracked women for over 30 years. Between 1992 and 2008, the women were asked questions about their physical function, including their ability to perform basic activities of daily living. This new paper prospectively examined the association between the dietary habits of the participants and subsequent impairment in physical function. Diet was assessed using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI-2010), a measure of diet quality that incorporates foods and nutrients predictive of chronic disease risk based on scientific evidence.\n\n\"These results add to the large body of evidence that outline the many benefits of a healthy diet for women. Additional research is needed to better understand how diet and lifestyle choices can help maintain our health and well-being as we age,\" said Dr. Grodstein.\n\nThere are numerous possible active properties in walnuts that may be contributing factors in providing health benefits. Walnuts are unique among nuts in that they are primarily composed of polyunsaturated fat (13 grams per ounce), which includes alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), the plant-based omega-3 fatty acid. They are the only nut to contain a significant amount of ALA with 2.5 grams per one ounce serving.\n\nSome study limitations should be considered. The sample only included women, so these results may not be generalizable to men. Additionally, participants were not assigned to eat walnuts or other foods, and were just asked about their dietary choices. It is also possible that subjects may have misreported their dietary intake since this information was collected by questionnaires. In addition, because this is an observational study, residual confounding cannot be ruled out (i.e. that other lifestyle habits which are more common in adults who eat walnuts could contribute to the study findings); and, thus, the results should be interpreted with caution.\n\nThis research was supported in part by the California Walnut Commission (CWC). The CWC has supported health-related research on walnuts for more than 25 years. While the CWC does provide funds and/or walnuts for various projects, the actual studies are conducted independently by researchers who design the experiments, interpret the results and write the manuscripts.\n\nThe California Walnut Commission, established in 1987, is funded by mandatory assessments of the growers.

The authors then examined memory performance based on whether stimulation arrived during low- compared with high-functioning brain states.\n\nThe team then statistically analyzed the results and found that people scored slightly higher than usual on words when stimulation arrived during a low or foggy state \u2014 and worse, when the pulse arrived in a high state. \u201cThe average enhancement effect was about 12 to 13 percent,\u201d Dr. Kahana said. \u201cAnd when stimulation arrived in a good state, the average was about 15 to 20 percent worse than usual.\u201d\n\nDr. Doris Greenblatt, a psychiatrist who participated in the trial at Emory, said she sought the surgery because her epilepsy had long caused memory problems. \u201cEach seizure I had tore at the fabric of memory, and it was as if my memories weren\u2019t attached to anything,\u201d Dr. Greenblatt said.\n\nShe agreed to the memory testing for the study. \u201cIt was a little humiliating, to be honest,\u201d she said of the testing. \u201cI would remember one or two items from a list of objects in a kitchen, for instance, then think, \u2018Oh no, what else was there?\u2019 \u201d", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "No quotes or even framing seem to have been copied from a news\u00a0release\u00a0posted by the University of Pennsylvania.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Those are also symptoms of a deficiency of B12, a key nutrient needed to make red blood cells and DNA and keep the nervous system working right.\n\nVitamin B12 deficiency is officially considered rare, affecting about 1 in 1,000 Americans, according to a 2005 study.

The 50 women treated had progressed despite a median 5 previous treatment regimens. Twenty-seven percent of these heavily pretreated patients saw clinical benefit from the drug, with at least \"stable disease\" at 24 or more weeks after the start of treatment. These data led to two subsequent Phase Ib studies, resulting in tucatinib earning FDA fast-track status and the expansion of this study once meant only to demonstrate drug safety into the \"pivotal\" trial that will determine approval.\n\n\"Usually we expect the results of a phase 1 clinical trial to give us data that we can use to guide the results of future treatments. This is a great case in which, for many of these patients, the results were immediate. There are women who are alive today because of this drug,\" says Virginia Borges, MD, MMSc, director of the Breast Cancer Research Program and Young Women's Breast Cancer Translational Program at the University of Colorado Cancer Center. Borges has been a major driver of the drug's development from its invention at Array Biopharm in Boulder, CO and now through clinical trials of the drug, which is licensed to Cascadian Therapeutics of Seattle, WA.\n\nTucatinib is a small molecule inhibitor of the HER2 growth factor receptor. The drug works by targeting the HER2 \"tyrosine kinase\" - a link in the chain of communication that allows HER2 receptors to signal the growth of the cell. The fact that it is a small molecule means the drug is able to pass through the blood-brain barrier to act against brain metastases of the disease. HER2+ breast cancer is more likely to affect younger women and also more likely than other breast cancers to metastasize specifically to the brain.\n\nWorking with Borges's Young Women's Breast Cancer Translational Program at CU Cancer Center, young investigator Elena Shagisultanova, MD, PhD, recently earned a $1.4m competitive ASPIRE grant from Pfizer, Inc., to conduct a clinical trial exploring the use of tucatinib against so-called \"triple positive\" breast cancer - those cancers driven by both estrogen and progesterone receptors and the HER2/neu oncogene.\n\n\"When both [estrogen and HER2] are positive, they counteract the therapy aimed at one or the other, playing off each other like kids splitting parents,\" Borges says. More specifically, when both avenues are present, the crosstalk leads to tumors being resistant to treatment, as either avenue can allow the cancer to survive therapy. Previous trials concurrently targeting estrogen and HER2 have been, according to Borges, \"lackluster,\" resulting in no changes to the standard of care.\n\nThe forthcoming trial lead by Shagisultanova will be a multi-center clinical trial with CU Cancer Center as the lead site, testing the combination of three drugs - tucatinib plus the anti-estrogen receptor drug letrozole and the cell cycle inhibitor palbociclib - against breast cancers positive for both HER2 and estrogen receptors.\n\n\"Tucatinib could be a substantially practice-changing drug,\" Borges says, meaning that in addition to the drug's current investigations as a third-, fourth-, or more-than-fifth-line treatment, she envisions its use sooner in the arc of breast cancer treatment and with far more patients.\n\n\"I think this drug has an extremely high likelihood of being approved for women with HER2+ breast cancer for use after previous treatments,\" Borges says. \"And it's going to be an especially important drug due to its ability to control brain metastases. The opportunity to study it as a front-line drug for recurrent triple positive breast cancer could even someday help us prevent or delay these brain metastases.\"\n\nBecause the drug is taken in pill form and has a very favorable side effect profile, Borges points out that it is relatively patient-friendly, allowing women to avoid treatments in infusion centers and also many of the side-effects associated with chemotherapies.\n\nOngoing updates are expected in journals and meetings later in 2017.", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "The use of unjustifiably glowing language arguably is the news release\u2019s most serious\u00a0flaw.

It may be possible to predict autism in infants as young as 6 months who have older siblings with the disorder, according to a new study by a national network of researchers.\n\nInfants in such families are at increased risk of developing autism, which is typically diagnosed when a child is 2- to 3-years-old and develops symptoms such as challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, delayed speech or nonverbal communication.\n\nResearchers used magnetic resonance imaging \u2014 or MRI \u2014 to scan the brains of 343 infants when they were 6 months, 12 months and 24 months old. Two-thirds of the infants were high risk, having an older sibling with autism. The scans showed that 70 percent of high-risk toddlers diagnosed with autism at age 2 had an elevated amount of cerebrospinal fluid around their brains at 6 and 12 months, compared to toddlers who were not diagnosed with autism. Cerebrospinal fluid is a clear, colorless liquid that bathes the brain and spine.\n\nThis excess fluid \u201ccould possibly be an early biological marker for autism,\u201d said Mark Shen, the lead author of the article, published in Biological Psychiatry, and a post-doctoral fellow at the University of North Carolina\u2019s Carolina Institute for Developmental Disabilities. Additional studies are needed to confirm the finding, he said.\n\nSuch a marker would allow doctors to identify infants at high risk of developing autism before symptoms are present.\n\n\u201cThe earlier we can get biological markers for autism, the earlier intervention can be initiated, and the greater the chance of better outcomes, \u201d said David Kennedy, Ph.D., co-director of the Child and Adolescent NeuroDevelopment Initiative at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Typically, therapists work with children and parents to improve eye contact, social interactions and communication skills.\n\nRelated: See the special bond between a boy with autism and a deaf shelter dog\n\nThe study results are \u201cvery exciting,\u201d said Dr. Adriania Di Martino, a professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at NYU Medical School. Excess brain fluid may be more than an early marker for autism, Di Martino said. It may also be a mechanism in the development of autism, and it opens up new possibilities for research, she said. \u201cYou can start thinking about conditions that might lead to increased cerebrospinal fluid.\u201d\n\nShen and his colleagues are already looking for genes associated with excess brain fluid. Normally, the liquid, refreshed four times a day, washes away byproducts that build up in the brain. But if the fluid is not flowing properly, these byproducts hang around and cause inflammation, which could \u201champer brain development\u201d and lead to autism, said Shen.\n\nCompletely different mechanisms may be at work for kids without an older sibling with autism, said Shen and Dimartino.

In addition to flushing out the brain\u2019s garbage, brain fluid also delivers signals to the brain that tell it how and when to grow. In a study published last month in Nature, 80 percent of infants diagnosed with autism as toddlers had an increased rate of growth in the surface area of their brains in their first year, compared to toddlers who were not diagnosed with autism.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to combine those two markers to see if we can improve the prediction closer to the 90 percent range, where it could be really clinically useful,\u201d said Shen.\n\nAbout 1 in 68 children develop autism in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, But as many as 20 out of 100 infants with an older sibling with autism will develop the disorder, said Di Martino.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not appear to rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "At workshops and conferences across the country, students, counselors and psychologists in private practice throng lectures on mindfulness. The National Institutes of Health is financing more than 50 studies testing mindfulness techniques, up from 3 in 2000, to help relieve stress, soothe addictive cravings, improve attention, lift despair and reduce hot flashes.\n\nSome proponents say Buddha\u2019s arrival in psychotherapy signals a broader opening in the culture at large \u2014 a way to access deeper healing, a hidden path revealed.\n\nYet so far, the evidence that mindfulness meditation helps relieve psychiatric symptoms is thin, and in some cases, it may make people worse, some studies suggest. Many researchers now worry that the enthusiasm for Buddhist practice will run so far ahead of the science that this promising psychological tool could turn into another fad.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very open to the possibility that this approach could be effective, and it certainly should be studied,\u201d said Scott Lilienfeld, a psychology professor at Emory. \u201cWhat concerns me is the hype, the talk about changing the world, this allure of the guru that the field of psychotherapy has a tendency to cultivate.\u201d\n\nBuddhist meditation came to psychotherapy from mainstream academic medicine. In the 1970s, a graduate student in molecular biology, Jon Kabat-Zinn, intrigued by Buddhist ideas, adapted a version of its meditative practice that could be easily learned and studied. It was by design a secular version, extracted like a gemstone from the many-layered foundation of Buddhist teaching, which has sprouted a wide variety of sects and spiritual practices and attracted 350 million adherents worldwide.\n\nIn transcendental meditation and other types of meditation, practitioners seek to transcend or \u201close\u201d themselves. The goal of mindfulness meditation was different, to foster an awareness of every sensation as it unfolds in the moment.\n\nDr. Kabat-Zinn taught the practice to people suffering from chronic pain at the University of Massachusetts medical school. In the 1980s he published a series of studies demonstrating that two-hour courses, given once a week for eight weeks, reduced chronic pain more effectively than treatment as usual.\n\nWord spread, discreetly at first. \u201cI think that back then, other researchers had to be very careful when they talked about this, because they didn\u2019t want to be seen as New Age weirdos,\u201d Dr. Kabat-Zinn, now a professor emeritus of medicine at the University of Massachusetts, said in an interview. \u201cSo they didn\u2019t call it mindfulness or meditation. \u201cAfter a while, we put enough studies out there that people became more comfortable with it.\u201d\n\nOne person who noticed early on was Marsha Linehan, a psychologist at the University of Washington who was trying to treat deeply troubled patients with histories of suicidal behavior. \u201cTrying to treat these patients with some change-based behavior therapy just made them worse, not better,\u201d Dr. Linehan said in an interview. \u201cWith the really hard stuff, you need something else, something that allows people to tolerate these very strong emotions.\u201d\n\nIn the 1990s, Dr. Linehan published a series of studies finding that a therapy that incorporated Zen Buddhist mindfulness, \u201cradical acceptance,\u201d practiced by therapist and patient significantly cut the risk of hospitalization and suicide attempts in the high-risk patients.\n\nFinally, in 2000, a group of researchers including Dr. Segal in Toronto, J. Mark G. Williams at the University of Wales and John D. Teasdale at the Medical Research Council in England published a study that found that eight weekly sessions of mindfulness halved the rate of relapse in people with three or more episodes of depression.\n\nWith Dr. Kabat-Zinn, they wrote a popular book, \u201cThe Mindful Way Through Depression.\u201d Psychotherapists\u2019 curiosity about mindfulness, once tentative, turned into \u201cthis feeding frenzy, of sorts, that we have going on now,\u201d Dr. Kabat-Zinn said.\n\nMindfulness meditation is easy to describe. Sit in a comfortable position, eyes closed, preferably with the back upright and unsupported. Relax and take note of body sensations, sounds and moods. Notice them without judgment. Let the mind settle into the rhythm of breathing. If it wanders (and it will), gently redirect attention to the breath. Stay with it for at least 10 minutes.\n\nAfter mastering control of attention, some therapists say, a person can turn, mentally, to face a threatening or troubling thought \u2014 about, say, a strained relationship with a parent \u2014 and learn simply to endure the anger or sadness and let it pass, without lapsing into rumination or trying to change the feeling, a move that often backfires.\n\nOne woman, a doctor who had been in therapy for years to manage bouts of disabling anxiety, recently began seeing Gaea Logan, a therapist in Austin, Tex., who incorporates mindfulness meditation into her practice. This patient had plenty to worry about, including a mentally ill child, a divorce and what she described as a \u201charsh internal voice,\u201d Ms. Logan said.\n\nAfter practicing mindfulness meditation, she continued to feel anxious at times but told Ms. Logan, \u201cI can stop and observe my feelings and thoughts and have compassion for myself.\u201d\n\nSteven Hayes, a psychologist at the University of Nevada at Reno, has developed a talk therapy called Acceptance Commitment Therapy, or ACT, based on a similar, Buddha-like effort to move beyond language to change fundamental psychological processes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shift from having our mental health defined by the content of our thoughts,\u201d Dr. Hayes said, \u201cto having it defined by our relationship to that content \u2014 and changing that relationship by sitting with, noticing and becoming disentangled from our definition of ourselves.\u201d\n\nFor all these hopeful signs, the science behind mindfulness is in its infancy. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which researches health practices, last year published a comprehensive review of meditation studies, including T.M., Zen and mindfulness practice, for a wide variety of physical and mental problems. The study found that over all, the research was too sketchy to draw conclusions.\n\nA recent review by Canadian researchers, focusing specifically on mindfulness meditation, concluded that it did \u201cnot have a reliable effect on depression and anxiety.\u201d\n\nTherapists who incorporate mindfulness practices do not agree when the meditation is most useful, either. Some say Buddhist meditation is most useful for patients with moderate emotional problems. Others, like Dr. Linehan, insist that patients in severe mental distress are the best candidates for mindfulness.\n\nA case in point is mindfulness-based therapy to prevent a relapse into depression. The treatment significantly reduced the risk of relapse in people who have had three or more episodes of depression. But it may have had the opposite effect on people who had one or two previous episodes, two studies suggest.\n\nThe mindfulness treatment \u201cmay be contraindicated for this group of patients,\u201d S. Helen Ma and Dr. Teasdale of the Medical Research Council concluded in a 2004 study of the therapy.\n\nSince mindfulness meditation may have different effects on different mental struggles, the challenge for its proponents will be to specify where it is most effective \u2014 and soon, given how popular the practice is becoming.\n\nThe question, said Linda Barnes, an associate professor of family medicine and pediatrics at the Boston University School of Medicine, is not whether mindfulness meditation will become a sophisticated therapeutic technique or lapse into self-help clich\u00e9.\n\n\u201cThe answer to that question is yes to both,\u201d Dr. Barnes said.\n\nThe real issue, most researchers agree, is whether the science will keep pace and help people distinguish the mindful variety from the mindless.\n\nA variety of meditative practices have been studied by Western researchers for their effects on mental and physical health.\n\nAn active exercise, sometimes called moving meditation, involving extremely slow, continuous movement and extreme concentration. The movements are to balance the vital energy of the body but have no religious significance.\n\nStudies are mixed, some finding it can reduce blood pressure in patients, and others finding no effect. There is some evidence that it can help elderly people improve balance.\n\nMeditators sit comfortably, eyes closed, and breathe naturally. They repeat and concentrate on the mantra, a word or sound chosen by the instructor to achieve state of deep, transcendent absorption. Practitioners \u201close\u201d themselves, untouched by day-to-day concerns. Studies suggest it can reduce blood pressure in some patients.\n\nPractitioners find a comfortable position, close the eyes and focus first on breathing, passively observing it. If a stray thought or emotion enters the mind, they allow it to pass and return attention to the breath. The aim is to achieve focused awareness on what is happening moment to moment.\n\nStudies find that it can help manage chronic pain. The findings are mixed on substance abuse. Two trials suggest that it can cut the rate of relapse in people who have had three or more bouts of depression.\n\nEnhanced awareness through breathing techniques and specific postures.

But here's something the medical world is just realizing: that the gastric bypass operation has other even more dramatic effects. It can force type 2 diabetes into almost instant remission and it appears to reduce the risk of cancer.\n\nSurgeons have been performing bariatric, or weight loss operations since the 1950s, but they're much safer than they used to be. They're typically done laparoscopically now, where doctors use tiny surgical tools and video cameras instead of making big, deep incisions.\n\nDespite the increase in obesity, only a small number of people have had the gastric bypass operation.\n\nmet some people who were once morbidly obese.\n\nThere was Tony Sideman, who underwent surgery in April 2007 and has lost 140 pounds; there was Janet Rovak, who lost 90 pounds in the eight months since her surgery; and there was Travis Goodbou, who lost 260 pounds in the seven months since he underwent the operation.\n\nDr. Neil Hutcher from Richmond, Va. has performed more than 3,000 bypass surgeries. Asked how many people gain the weight back, Dr. Hutcher tells Stahl, \"You know I think when you're dealing with an incurable disease that kills many people, if you have an 85 to 90 percent success rate, that's pretty darn good.\"\n\n\"Is that what you have?\" Stahl asks.\n\nThere's no diet, no exercise regimen, and no pill with a success rate like that. These patients lose a ton of weight and keep it off.\n\nHere's how Hutcher does the surgery: first, he sections off a small pouch of the upper part of the stomach, which is then attached to a lower part of the small intestine, bypassing most of the stomach, so that there's not a lot of room for food.\n\nIt used to be that roughly one in 100 people died from this operation. Hutcher says it's now about one in 1,000, which makes it less deadly than most major surgeries.\n\n\"It's less than gall bladder surgery. It's about one-tenth of cardiac surgery,\" he explains.\n\nIt's safer because of new surgical techniques which have also made it more effective. For instance, they can make the stomach pouch smaller than they used to.\n\n\"Even if I wanted to eat a whole cheesecake, my stomach is very tiny. It holds four ounces max, stretched to the max. And that's not even one piece of cheesecake,\" a female patient explained.\n\nA big reason the operation works is because it seems to suppress appetite. \"If you listen to your patients, they come back and they say, 'Doctor, you put the fire out,'\" Hutcher says.\n\n\"When you see a sign for fast food or\u2026she's already shaking her head at me,\" Stahl asked a patient.\n\n\"Don't want it,\" the female patient replied. \"I used to crave sweets all the time.

He owns a doughnut shop with his siblings, but he's able to resist the cravings. \"Before I'd have cravings for everything. Now I really don't,\" he told Stahl.\n\nFor most patients the cravings really do disappear. One theory is that's because the operation suppresses the levels of a stomach hormone called \"grelin\" that activates the sensation of hunger.\n\nYet most people who have this operation do not get skinny. Dr. David Cummings, an expert on appetite at the University of Washington, says as a rule these patients end up just one third lighter.\n\n\"Most people with severe obesity who undergo gastric bypass do not become fully normal, in terms of body weight. They go from severely obese to mildly obese, or from obese to overweight. But nevertheless it's an enormous change,\" Dr. Cummings explains.\n\nAnd not just in terms of weight loss.

In this context, Sylentis has participated at this event presenting the pre-clinical and clinical results of various compounds that are being developed for the treatment of ocular disorders. Among these, the abstract \"Tivanisiran a new treatment for Dry Eye Disease, that improved signs and symptoms in clinical trials\" (Posterboard number: 925 - B0103) is highlighted, the compound improving the ocular inflammatory parameters, tear quality and a reduction in ocular pain associated with dry eye disease is also underlined1.\n\nThe novel mechanism of action of tivanisiran, based on genetic silencing through RNA interference (RNAi), is targeted at the treatment of the signs and symptoms of this pathology, making it a firm candidate for the treatment of dry eye disease.\n\nAccording to Ana Isabel Jim\u00e9nez, Director of R&D at Sylentis, \"we trust in our technology, innovative in this field, and we hope that tivanisiran will soon become a real alternative for the treatment of millions of people that suffer dry eye disease around the world.\"\n\nIn this respect, Jim\u00e9nez points out that \"this is a significant step forward in the development of innovative drugs in different therapeutic areas through a novel technology of genetic silencing based on the RNA.\"\n\nSylentis is a pioneer in RNAi research, and is one of the few in Europe that applies this technology to the field of ophthalmology. It also continues with its research on new therapies for ophthalmological and inflammatory illnesses.\n\nIt must be empathized that this pathology affects more than 5 million in Spain, between 10% and 20% of the population, mostly women, and almost 100% of these being elderly , . In this context, the phase III \"Helix\" study is being carried out in more than 30 hospitals in Spain, Germany, Estonia, Portugal, Slovakia and Italy, in 300 patients to evaluate the efficacy of this compound in the treatment of the sign and symptoms of dry eye syndrome.\n\nTivanisiran is a drug based on RNAi that is administered as preservative-free eye drops; it selectively inhibits production of the transient receptor potential cation channel (TRPV1). These receptors are ion channels that mediate the transmission of ocular pain. Tivanisiran is a small synthetic double-stranded RNA oligonucleotide (siRNA) with a novel and highly selective mechanism of action. Non-clinical studies conducted by Sylentis with SYL1001 have demonstrated it has high ability to inhibit this specific target and block the perception of ocular pain in animals3.\n\nTivanisiran is a product under development for the treatment of signs and symptoms related to dry eye syndrome and has the potential to be developed for other pathologies that cause ocular pain (corneal lesions, refractive surgery, etc.) , , .\n\nRNA interference (RNAi) is a natural cellular process that regulates the expression of certain genes, providing a role in innate defense and development in animals and plants. This process is used to specifically silence genetic transcripts that encode protein-causing diseases. The therapeutic application of targeted siRNAs is booming given the specificity of gene silencing for a particular protein in a given tissue and the lack of side effects. This new approach to drug discovery is a promising technology that is rapidly moving in the translational research space , .\n\nDry eye syndrome is a multifactorial disease of the tear film and ocular surface that produces symptoms of ocular discomfort, eyesight disorders, and tear film instability with potential damage to the ocular surface. Dry eye syndrome is accompanied by such symptoms as ocular pain, itching, stinging, and irritation of the eye tissues.

The study led by researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania is the first to show that lisdexamfetamine (LDX) improved subjective and objective measures of cognitive decline commonly experienced in menopausal women. Results of the study are published online today in the journal Psychopharmacology.\n\n\"Reports of cognitive decline, particularly in executive functions, are widespread among menopausal women,\" said lead author, C. Neill Epperson, MD, professor of Psychiatry and Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and director of the Penn Center for Women's Behavioral Wellness. \"There are approximately 90 million post-menopausal women living in the US alone, and with the average age of onset occurring at 52, the great majority of those women will live in the postmenopausal state for at least one-third of their lives. Therefore, promoting healthy cognitive aging among menopausal women should be a major public health goal.\"\n\nThe Penn-led team administered a once-daily dose of LDX for four weeks to 32 healthy, non-ADHD-diagnosed women between the ages of 45 and 60 experiencing difficulties with executive functions as a result of mid-life onset menopause, and as measured using the Brown Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (BADDS). All participants served as their own controls by being randomly assigned to cross-over to a placebo for an additional four weeks.\n\nThe researchers found a 41 percent overall improvement in executive functions for women receiving LDX, compared to a 17 percent improvement when taking placebo medication. There were also significant improvements in four out of the five subscales for women taking LDX: organization and motivation for work; attention and concentration; alertness, effort, and processing speed; and working memory and accessing recall.\n\nWhile psychostimulants such as LDX are primarily marketed for the treatment of ADHD, they have been successful in treating cognitive complaints in some patients including postmenopausal women. They work by promoting the release of dopamine, which is impaired in ADHD and other disorders characterized by executive function problems.\n\n\"Although we observed that short-term use of LDX was well tolerated and effective in several subjective and objective areas, long-term studies of menopausal women receiving LDX are needed, similar to those conducted for ADHD patients,\" said Epperson. \"It is also important for clinicians to confirm that a woman's complaints of worsening memory are in the executive function domains, are temporally related to the transition to menopause, and are not indicative of some other pathological cognitive impairment before prescribing a trial of LDX.\"\n\nIn addition to Epperson, other Penn co-authors are Sheila Shanmugan, Deborah R.

Nelson, M.D., Professor and Chair, Obstetrics and Gynecology at Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, Calif. \"Kyleena is highly effective at preventing pregnancy and may be an appropriate choice for women who want a low-dose, non-daily birth control method.\"\n\nKyleena is a small, flexible plastic T-shaped device containing 19.5 mg of a progestin hormone called levonorgestrel. Kyleena is placed by a healthcare provider during an in-office visit and prevents pregnancy for up to five years, but may be removed by a healthcare provider at any time.\n\n\"With the approval of Kyleena, women have an important new birth control option that provides pregnancy prevention for up to five years,\" said Dario Mirski, M.D., Senior Vice President and Head of Medical Affairs for the Americas, Bayer. \"Kyleena expands Bayer's IUD portfolio and is part of our commitment to provide women and their healthcare providers with a variety of contraceptive choices to meet their individual needs.\"\n\nThe use of long-acting reversible contraception (LARCs) has increased nearly five-fold in the last decade.3\n\nBecause Kyleena slowly releases levonorgestrel into a woman's uterus, only small amounts of the hormone enter the blood. For the first 3 to 6 months, a woman's period may become irregular and the number of bleeding days may increase. Women may also have frequent spotting or light bleeding. Some women have heavy bleeding during this time. After using Kyleena for a while, the number of bleeding and spotting days is likely to lessen. For some women, periods will stop altogether. When Kyleena is removed, menstrual periods should return.\n\nAbout the Clinical Trial for Kyleena1\n\nThe contraceptive efficacy of Kyleena was evaluated in a clinical trial that enrolled generally healthy women aged 18 to 35, of whom 1,452 received Kyleena. Of these, 40% (574) were nulliparous women, 870 (60%) women completed 3 years of the study, 707 (49%) elected to enroll in an extension phase up to a total of 5 years, and 550 (38%) completed 5 years of use. The trial was a multicenter, multi-national, randomized, open-label study conducted in 11 countries in Europe, Latin America, the U.S. and Canada. Women less than six weeks postpartum, with a history of ectopic pregnancy, with clinically significant ovarian cysts or with HIV or otherwise at high risk for sexually transmitted infections were excluded. A total of 563 (39%) were treated at U.S. sites and 889 (61%) were at non-U.S. sites. The racial demographics of enrolled women who received Kyleena was: Caucasian (80%), Black/African American (5.1%), Other (2.6%) and Asian (1.2%); 11% indicated Hispanic ethnicity. The clinical trial had no upper or lower weight or BMI limit. The weight range was 38 to 173 kg (mean weight: 68.7 kg) and mean BMI was 25.3 kg/m2 (range 15.2\u201357.6 kg/m2). Of Kyleena-treated women, 22% discontinued the study treatment due to an adverse reaction, 5.0% were lost to follow-up, 2.3% withdrew for unspecified reasons, 1.2% discontinued due to a protocol deviation, 0.9% discontinued due to pregnancy, and 20% discontinued due to other reasons.\n\nThe pregnancy rate calculated as the Pearl Index (PI) in women aged 18-35 years was the primary efficacy endpoint used to assess contraceptive reliability. The PI was calculated based on 28-day equivalent exposure cycles; evaluable cycles excluded those in which back-up contraception was used unless a pregnancy occurred in that cycle. The Year 1 PI was based on 2 pregnancies and the cumulative 5-year pregnancy rate was based on 13 pregnancies that occurred after the onset of treatment and within 7 days after Kyleena removal or expulsion.\n\nAbout 71% of 163 women who desired pregnancy after study discontinuation and provided follow-up information, conceived within 12 months after removal of Kyleena.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (occurring in \u2265 5% users) were vulvovaginitis (24%), ovarian cyst (22%), abdominal pain/pelvic pain (21%), headache/migraine (15%), acne/seborrhea (15%), dysmenorrhea/uterine spasm (10%), breast pain/breast discomfort (10%), and increased bleeding (8%). In the combined studies, 22% discontinued prematurely due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (> 1%) leading to discontinuation were increased bleeding (4.5%), abdominal pain/pelvic pain (4.2%), device expulsion (3.1%), acne/seborrhea (2.3%), and dysmenorrhea/uterine spasm (1.3%). In the clinical trials, serious adverse reactions occurring in more than a single subject included: ectopic pregnancy/ruptured ectopic pregnancy (10 subjects); pelvic inflammatory disease (6 subjects); missed abortion/incomplete spontaneous abortion/spontaneous abortion (4 subjects); ovarian cyst (3 subjects); abdominal pain (4 subjects); depression/affective disorder (4 subjects); and uterine perforation/embedded device (myometrial perforation) (3 subjects).\n\nIndication for Kyleena \n\nKyleena\u2122 (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system) is a hormone-releasing IUD that prevents pregnancy for up to 5 years.\n\u2022 If you have a pelvic infection, get infections easily, or have certain cancers, don't use Kyleena. Less than 1% of users get a serious pelvic infection called PID.\n\u2022 If you have persistent pelvic or stomach pain or if Kyleena comes out, tell your doctor. If Kyleena comes out, use back-up birth control. Kyleena may attach to or go through the uterus and cause other problems.\n\u2022 Pregnancy while using Kyleena is uncommon but can be life threatening and may result in loss of pregnancy or fertility.\n\u2022 Ovarian cysts may occur but usually disappear.\n\u2022 Bleeding and spotting may increase in the first 3 to 6 months and remain irregular. Periods over time usually become shorter, lighter, or may stop.\n\nKyleena does not protect against HIV or STDs.\n\nOnly you and your healthcare provider can decide if Kyleena is right for you.

Stein said.\n\nAdditional results for PCSK9 inhibitor drugs are expected to be presented at the annual American College of Cardiology meeting which begins Saturday in Chicago, he said.\n\nThe REGN727 study included three trial arms. Two arms used 72 healthy volunteers who were either injected with a single dose of the drug in increasing amounts to test for side effects, which is the purpose of a phase one clinical trial. A third arm included 21 people with a family history of high cholesterol, and 30 people with nonfamilial high cholesterol. All of those subjects were also receiving treatment with the statin Lipitor.\n\nA control group of subjects with nonfamilial high cholesterol was treated only with a special diet. None of the subjects who received REGN727 discontinued the study because of adverse effects, and the subjects who received REGN727 had a striking reduction of 60 to 65% in LDL cholesterol, according to Stein.\n\nStein characterized the results of the trial as \u201cpretty dramatic.\u201d\n\nA PCSK9 inhibitor, Stein said, differs from statins \"because it's unlike any other drug.

At the top of the list? Salt. Consuming too much salt was associated with 9.5 percent of the deaths.\n\nNext \u2014 and I sympathize with all of you who love to eat these \u2014 high intake of red meat and processed meats such as bacon was linked to 8 percent of the deaths. And sugary drinks were a factor in 7.4 percent of the deaths.\n\nWe know, it may be tough to cut back on foods you love. Bacon is so alluring to many that it has even been called the 'gateway' to meat for vegetarians!\n\nBut, here's the flip side: The researchers also found there's a significant risk in eating too little of certain healthy foods. So, think of it this way: You can start consuming more of the foods that are protective.\n\nFor instance, the study found that low consumption of nuts and seeds was linked to about 9 percent of deaths.\n\nIn addition, diets low in seafood, whole grains and fruits and vegetables were found to contribute to about 6-8 percent of the deaths.\n\n\"The good news is that we now understand which foods we need to target to prevent Americans from dying prematurely from cardiometabolic diseases,\" says lead study author Renata Micha, a public health nutritionist and epidemiologist at the Friedman School at Tufts University.\n\nIn 2012, about 700,000 Americans died from these diseases. Diet was linked to nearly 319,000 of these deaths. \"This is a remarkable burden, nearly 1,000 deaths each day\" linked to dietary habits, says senior study author Dariush Mozaffarian, dean of the Friedman School at Tufts.\n\nSo, changing Americans dietary habits could have a significant impact, the authors argue. \"Our research suggests that nearly half of the risk can be reduced [by] eating a healthy diet,\" Mozaffarian says.\n\nThe new analysis is based on data from the federal survey known as NHANES, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Researchers asked some 8,500 participants about their eating habits. In addition, Mozaffarian and his colleagues estimated associations of diet and disease from prior studies and clinical trials.\n\nNow, the task of estimating death or disease linked to diet is tricky. Scientists use statistical methods to try to tease apart the impact of diet as part of people's overall lifestyle.\n\nOne challenge: People who have healthy diets often have other healthy habits, too \u2014 such as getting regular exercise. Dietary habits also track with socio-economic status. So, people with lower incomes are more likely to have poorer diets compared with wealthier people.\n\nThe Tufts researchers used studies that had controlled for these lifestyle factors, but it's not a perfect science.\n\n\"Relying on evidence from observational studies...carries the potential limitation of confounding bias,\" states an editorial that was published alongside the study. The editorial raises the possibility that the effect of confounding factors such as socioeconomic status and physical activity could be substantial. \"For instance, it's possible that processed meat consumption merely reflects a Westernized dietary pattern.\"\n\nMozaffarian acknowledges the limitations. \"At the end of the day, our findings might modestly over - or under-estimate the health burdens,\" he told us.\n\nHe says the bigger point is this: \"Whether poor diet is causing 1,000 cardiovascular and diabetes deaths per day, or 500, it remains among the leading causes of preventable suffering.\"\n\nPoor diets are also linked to billions of dollars in healthcare spending. For instance, diabetes costs the U.S. $245 billion a year. In the U.S., a women with diabetes incurs, on average, about $283,000 in lifetime health care costs. (Many cost studies don't separate Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.)\n\nIf you love foods that are associated with cardiovascular risks, you don't have to give them up entirely. As most nutrition studies show, it's excessive consumption that drives up the risk.\n\nFor instance, dietary guidelines recommend limiting sugar consumption to no more than 10 percent of daily calories.

And, the FDA has already approved it.\n\n\"Our data suggests that PPF, working in combination with TMZ and radiation, could limit glioblastoma invasion and improve the clinical outcome for brain tumor patients,\" said Dr. Tran, the study's senior author.\n\nThis study was funded, in part, by The Ben & Catherine Ivy Foundation.\n\n\"GBM is one of the most aggressive of all cancers and it affects people of all ages,\" said Catherine (Bracken) Ivy, founder and president of The Ben & Catherine Ivy Foundation. \"Funding research focused on helping patients survive longer is critical, and studies such as this advance our goal of not only improving treatments for brain cancer, but eventually finding a cure.\"\n\nOne of the primary treatments for glioblastoma is surgical removal of the tumor. However, because of the aggressive way glioblastomas invade surrounding brain tissue, it is impossible to remove all parts of the tumors, and the cancer eventually returns and spreads. This insidious cancer invasion also limits the effectiveness of chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy.\n\nTGen found that PPF works to limit the spread of glioblastomas by targeting and knocking down the expression of the TROY protein. TGen researchers have linked TROY to the cellular mechanisms that enable glioblastomas to invade normal brain cells, and resist anti-cancer drugs.\n\n\"New therapeutic strategies that target the molecular drivers of invasion are required for improved clinical outcome,\" said Dr. Harshil Dhruv, a TGen Research Assistant Professor and lead author of the study. \"Propentofylline may provide a pharmacologic approach to targeting TROY, inhibiting cell invasion and reducing therapeutic resistance in glioblastomas.\"\n\nOne of the fundamental challenges in treating brain cancer with drugs is what is known as the blood-brain barrier that separates circulating blood from the brain extracellular fluid in the central nervous system. This barrier works to protect the brain from toxins. However, this security system is so effective at protecting the brain that it prevents many life-saving drugs -- all but some small molecules -- from being able to treat cancer and other diseases of the brain.\n\nAs a result, there has been little progress in recent decades in finding new effective treatments for GBM. Median survival for newly diagnosed GBM patients is only 14.6 months. Only 5 percent of patients survive more than 5 years.\n\n\"Clinical trials revealed that PPF can cross the blood-brain barrier, and has minimal side effects,\" Dr. Tran said. \"PPF could be easily translated to the clinic as an adjuvant therapy in combination with standard of care treatment for GBM patients.\"\n\nThis study -- Propentofylline inhibits glioblastoma cell invasion and survival by targeting the TROY signaling pathway -- also was funded by the National Institutes of Health under grants NS86853 and P50 CA108961.

A very high consumption of non-fermented dairy products, on the other hand, was associated with an increased risk of incident coronary heart disease. The findings were published in the British Journal of Nutrition.\n\nEarlier studies have shown that fermented dairy products have more positive effects on blood lipid profiles and on the risk of heart disease than other dairy products. Examples of fermented dairy products include cheese, yoghurt, quark, kefir and sour milk. However, research into the topic remains scarce.\n\nThe Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study ongoing at the University of Eastern Finland explored the associations of fermented and non-fermented dairy products with the risk of incident coronary heart disease. Approximately 2,000 men participated in the study. Their dietary habits were assessed at the beginning of the study in 1984-1989, and they were followed up for an average of 20 years. During this follow-up, 472 men experienced an incident coronary heart disease event.\n\nThe study participants were divided into groups on the basis of how much they ate different dairy products, and the researchers compared the groups with the highest and lowest consumption, while also taking various lifestyle and nutrition factors into consideration.\n\nWhen the study participants were divided into four groups on the basis of their consumption of fermented dairy products with less than 3.5% fat, the risk of incident coronary heart disease was 26% lower in the highest consumption group compared to the lowest consumption group. Sour milk was the most commonly used low-fat fermented dairy product. The consumption of high-fat fermented dairy products, such as cheese, was not associated with the risk of incident coronary heart disease.\n\nHowever, the researchers found that a very high consumption on non-fermented dairy products was associated with an increased risk of incident coronary heart disease. Milk was the most commonly used product in this category, and a very high consumption was defined as an average daily milk intake of 0.9 litres. Lower consumption levels were not associated with the risk.\n\n\"Here in Finland, people's habits of consuming different dairy products have changed over the past decades.

According to the recently released 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, small shifts in food choices can make a big difference; including a shift from solid fats to oils, like the oil in fresh avocados. On the heels of this advice, a new meta-analysis (considered the best evidence and an unbiased overview of the body of knowledge on a specific topic), published in the Journal of Clinical Lipidology, adds to the growing body of research that supports the use of avocados in lieu of solid fats (and foods that have higher saturated fat content) to significantly change lipid profiles.\n\nThe research, \"Impact of avocado-enriched diets on plasma lipoproteins: A meta-analysis,\" conducted at the University of the Pacific and independently funded , looked at 10 unique avocado studies with 229 participants, assessing the impact of avocados on cholesterol levels. Researchers found avocado consumption (1 to 1.5 per day) significantly reduced total cholesterol (TC), \"bad\" low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides (TG) when they were substituted for sources of saturated fat. Additionally, avocado consumption did not impact \"good\" high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL). However, the optimal amount of avocado and frequency of use needs further evaluation along with the nutritional similarities and differences between other different MUFA sources. Larger trials looking at the impact of avocados on major adverse cardiovascular events are warranted. (See conclusion of study)\n\n\"Interestingly, our results indicate that even healthy subjects with a relatively normal baseline TC (100 to 240 mg/dL), LDL-C (75 to 150 mg/dL), and TG (50 to 175 mg/dL) had significant reductions,\" says Sachin Shah, PharmD, corresponding author and expert in cardiovascular health.\n\nAs we head into American Heart Health Month (February) it's important to remind people that they have the power to help control their risk factors for developing heart disease by exercising regularly, knowing cholesterol levels and keeping them under control and maintaining a healthy weight. Cardiovascular disease is responsible for one out of every four deaths; it is the number 1 killer of American women and men, and it is a leading cause of disability.\n\n\"Fresh avocado, as part of a balanced diet, and as a cholesterol-free substitute for solid fats, can help be part of the solution for maintaining normal cholesterol levels,\" says Nikki Ford, PhD, Director of Nutrition, Hass Avocado Board. \"Beyond their naturally good fats, avocados are also a delicious way to boost fiber (8 percent of DV) and fruit intakes, both of which are under consumed in American diets.\"\n\nThe Hass Avocado Board (HAB) continues to be a leader in educating health professionals and consumers on the benefits of avocados. HAB recently created a series of simple, quick to prepare interactive meal makeovers to show people how to make small shifts in their diets by substituting fresh avocados for other foods or ingredients higher in saturated fats.\n\n\"This study supports the body of research showing the many benefits that fresh avocados have to offer when consumed in everyday healthy eating plans,\" says Emiliano Escobedo, Executive Director, HAB. \"Through our nutrition research program, established in 2010, we are committed to increase awareness and improve understanding of the unique benefits of avocados to human health and nutrition.

This morning, she'll be getting two of them drilled the old-fashioned way. But the third is a decay that is not so advanced, and Dr. Jin-Ho Phark, her dentist, is going to use a treatment he's testing that involves no drilling -- \"which is nice because many patients don't like the sound of the drill, and the feeling or the pain that might be associated with it,\" Phark says.\n\nThat cringe-worthy sound may be on the way out. A new procedure used by Phark and other doctors claims to stop the progress of cavities without drills or Novocain.\n\nThe treatment, called Icon, is one of several new cavity treatments that avoid drilling. Icon was developed in Germany and has been available in the U.S. for just over a year. It's intended for patients whose decay has not gone beyond the tooth enamel.\n\nTo Drill Or Not To Drill\n\nPhark says that when decay is caught very early or very late, dentists have a clear course of action: Early problems can often be reversed with better brushing, fluoride or calcium-containing toothpastes -- and late-stage cavities need to be filled. But at the intermediate stages, dentists don't have many options.\n\n\"In many of those cases we decide, 'OK, this lesion is too small to be treated with a filling.' So, we are actually waiting until the lesion grows bigger and bigger and becomes deep enough and worthy to be drilled out and be filled,\" Phark says.\n\nGerman researcher Sebastian Paris is a dentist and one of the drill-less cavity treatment's developers.\n\n\"We aim to treat these intermediate lesions -- not the very early ones, but the intermediate ones -- where usually, as a dentist, you are not sure whether you should make a filling or not,\" Paris says.\n\nWhen tooth decay begins, minerals, like calcium, are leached out of the tooth enamel, leaving behind sponge-like pores in the enamel. If the decay process is allowed to continue, the pores grow and form a hole, known as a cavity.\n\nThe new treatment uses a coating of mild acid that is applied to the decay to open up a route to the pores and clear out decayed enamel. Then the open pores are filled with a clear resin.\n\nParis says the key to getting the treatment to work was finding a filling material that wasn't thick and goopy so the porous enamel would immediately suck it up like a sponge.\n\n\"When you take a sugar cube and you put it into your coffee, you will see that it is soaked up with the coffee,\" Paris says. \"But if you put your sugar cube into honey, you can imagine that it will take ages to soak into the sugar cube.\"\n\nAvoiding the drill has the advantage of preserving and extending the life of the natural tooth. However, some dentists argue that any time before a cavity actually forms, tooth decay can be stopped -- and even reversed -- by the patients themselves, using, for example, fluoride toothpaste.\n\n\"An alternative could simply be brushing better in a certain location and not drinking Coca-Cola all day long,\" says Mark Wolff, a professor of dentistry at New York University who specializes in cariology, or the study of tooth decay.\n\nWolff says that while the no-drill approach to treating this type of tooth decay has promise, fluoride treatments and other patient-applied methods are still more inexpensive, less invasive and have a much longer track record of success.\n\n\"Might this be a good application to help that person recover or prevent this decay from advancing? Absolutely. I think the jury is still out on the product a little bit. Hopefully it works. It's just still in its earliest stages,\" Wolff says.\n\nBecause it's so new, it's still unclear how the Icon resin filling holds up over time. And clinical studies have shown that the treatment fails to stop decay from advancing up to 15 percent of the time.\n\nBut Wolff says that for patients who aren't able or willing to change their dental hygiene habits, or who are predisposed to tooth decay, this may be a good solution for keeping the dentist's drill at bay.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "\n\n\nThe story does not appear to be based on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The growing number of patients who claim marijuana has helped them drop their painkiller habit has intrigued lawmakers and emboldened advocates. Many are pushing for cannabis as a treatment for the abuse of opioids and illegal narcotics such as heroin, and as an alternative to painkillers.\n\nIt's a tempting sell in New England, hard hit by the painkiller and heroin crisis. But there's a problem: There is very little research showing marijuana works as a treatment for such addictions.\n\nAdvocates argue a growing body of scientific literature supports the idea, pointing to a study in the Journal of Pain this year that found that chronic pain sufferers significantly reduced their opioid use when taking medical cannabis. Another study, published last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found cannabis can be effective in treating chronic pain and other ailments.\n\nThe research falls short of concluding marijuana helps wean people off opioids - Vicodin, Oxycontin and related painkillers - and heroin, though. Many medical professionals say there's not enough evidence for them to confidently prescribe it.\n\nIn Maine, which is considering adding opioid and heroin addiction to the list of conditions that qualify for medical marijuana, Michelle Ham said marijuana helped her end a years-long addiction to painkillers prescribed for a bad back and neck. Tired of feeling \"like a zombie,\" the 37-year-old mother of two decided to quit cold turkey, which she said brought on convulsions and other withdrawal symptoms. Then, a friend mentioned marijuana, which Maine had legalized in 1999 for chronic pain and scores of other medical conditions. Ham gave it a try in 2013 and said the pain is under control and she hasn't gone back on the opioids.\n\n\"Before, I couldn't even function. I couldn't get anything done,\" Ham said. \"Now, I actually organize volunteers, and we have a donations center to help the needy.\"\n\nBolstered by stories like Ham's, doctors are experimenting with marijuana as an addiction treatment in Massachusetts and California. Supporters in Maine are pushing for its inclusion in qualifying conditions for medical marijuana. Vermonters are making the case for addiction treatment in their push to legalize pot.\n\nAuthorities are also desperate to curb a sharp rise in overdoses; Maine saw a 31 percent increase last year, and drug-related deaths in Vermont have jumped 44 percent since 2010. Vermont officials also blame opioid abuse for a 40 percent increase over the past two years of children in state custody.\n\n\"I don't think it's a cure for everybody,\" said Maine Rep. Diane Russell, a Portland Democrat and a leader in the state effort to legalize marijuana. \"But why take a solution off the table when people are telling us and physicians are telling us that it's working?\"\n\nMost states with medical marijuana allow it for a list of qualifying conditions. Getting on that list is crucial and has resulted in a tug of war in many states, including several in which veterans have been unsuccessful in getting post-traumatic stress disorder approved for marijuana treatment.\n\nThis month, Pennsylvania became the 24th state to legalize medical marijuana. Sen. Mike Vereb, a Republican, called on lawmakers to take on what he called \"the number-one killer in Pennsylvania\" - opioid abuse.\n\n\"Opioid abuse has no party, has no color, has no religion,\" Vereb said. \"Let's face it, that's the killer. What we're doing today is the healer.\"\n\n\"It's hard to argue against anecdotal evidence when you are in the middle of a crisis,\" said Patricia Hymanson, a York, Maine, neurologist who has taken a leave of absence to serve in the state House. \"But if you do too many things too fast, you are sometimes left with problems on the other end.\"\n\nIn New Hampshire, where drug deaths more than doubled last year from 2011 levels, the Senate last week rejected efforts to decriminalize marijuana.\n\nThere are some promising findings involving rats and one 2014 JAMA study showing that states with medical marijuana laws had nearly 25 percent fewer opioid-related overdose deaths than those without, but even a co-author on that study said it would be wrong to use the findings to make the case for cannabis as a treatment option.\n\n\"We are in the midst of a serious problem. People are dying and, as a result, we ought to use things that are proven to be effective,\" said Dr. Richard Saitz, chair of the Department of Community Health Sciences at the Boston University School of Public Health.\n\nCannabis could have limited benefits as a treatment alternative, said Harvard Medical School's Dr. Kevin Hill, who last year authored the JAMA study that found benefits in using medical marijuana to treat chronic pain, neuropathic pain and spasticity related to multiple sclerosis. But he urged caution.\n\n\"If you are thinking about using cannabis as opposed to using opioids for chronic pain, then I do think the evidence does support it,\" he said. \"However, I think one place where sometimes cannabis advocates go too far is when they talk about using cannabis to treat opioid addiction.\"\n\nThe findings in the Journal of Pain study that found chronic pain sufferers reduced their opioid use when using medical pot were limited because participants self-reported the data.\n\nSubstance abuse experts argue there are already approved medications. It would also be wrong to portray marijuana as completely safe, they say, because it can also be addictive. But supporters point to doctors like Dr. Gary Witman, of Canna Care Docs, who has treated addicts with cannabis at his offices in Fall River, Stoughton and Worcester, Massachusetts. Since introducing the treatment in September, Witman said 15 patients have successfully weaned themselves off opioids. None have relapsed.\n\n\"When I see them in a six-month follow up, they are much more focused,\" Witman said. \"They have greater respect. They feel better about themselves.

(Vanda) (NASDAQ: VNDA) today announced that HETLIOZ\u00ae, a circadian regulator, demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful benefits in nighttime and daytime symptoms of jet lag disorder. HETLIOZ\u00ae is currently approved in the US and Europe for the treatment of Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder, a rare and chronic circadian rhythm sleep disorder.\n\nJet lag disorder is a common circadian disorder frequently observed in millions of travelers who cross multiple time zones. Jet lag disorder is characterized by nighttime sleep disruption, a decrease in daytime alertness and impairment to social and occupational functioning.\n\nThe clinical efficacy results reported today are from the JET8 Phase-III clinical study (3107) (the JET8 study). In the JET8 study, 318 healthy volunteers were admitted to a sleep unit and were subjected to a circadian challenge of an 8 hours advance to their usual bedtime. The JET8 study design induced the circadian challenge experienced by travelers who cross 8 times zones, which leads to jet lag disorder. This clinical design allowed for the study of HETLIOZ\u00ae without the confounding effects of sleep deprivation and variable light conditions.\n\nResults from the JET8 study showed significant and clinically meaningful effects of HETLIOZ\u00ae 20 mg on the primary endpoint of the study as well as multiple secondary endpoints. The pre-specified primary endpoint was the amount of sleep time in the first two thirds of the night. Secondary endpoints included measures of sleep parameters (TST, LPS, WASO) and next day alertness (KSS and VAS). (Table 1).\n\nThe results of the JET8 study shown above demonstrate the effectiveness of HETLIOZ\u00ae in treating jet lag disorder. The magnitude of the total sleep time benefit of 85 minutes improvement over placebo is significant and clinically meaningful. The demonstration of benefits in measurements of next day alertness on both KSS and VAS is meaningful and it underscores the ability of HETLIOZ\u00ae to address both nighttime and daytime symptoms of jet lag disorder.\n\nVanda previously reported on the JET5 study (3101) that examined the effects of HETLIOZ\u00ae in a circadian challenge of 5 hours advance of the subjects' usual bedtime. The results of that study were published in The Lancet in 2009.1 The observation that HETLIOZ\u00ae is effective in treating the symptoms caused by an abrupt advance of the circadian cycle of a magnitude of 5 or 8 hours suggests that HETLIOZ\u00ae will be an effective therapeutic tool in the treatment of individuals that experience symptoms of jet lag. HETLIOZ\u00ae will be potentially useful under circumstances of rapid eastward transmeridian travel experienced by frequent travelers, the rapid deployment of military troops and any circumstances that will necessitate the abrupt phase advance of the sleep wake cycle.\n\nJet lag disorder affects millions of individuals annually who cross multiple time zones during their travel. Jet lag disorder symptoms are more severe during eastward travel. It is reported that more than 30 million US residents make trips abroad each year to overseas destinations. Of these, 60% (approximately 20 million) travel to destinations in Europe, Middle East and Asia. It is also reported that 8% (approximately 1.6 million) travel in Business or First class.2\n\n\"We are extremely pleased with the outcome of this study which establishes the utility of HETLIOZ\u00ae in the treatment of jet lag disorder as HETLIOZ\u00ae was shown to overcome a significant circadian challenge of an 8 hour phase advance. This challenge is equivalent to eastward travel across 8 time zones as experienced for example on travel from Los Angeles to London, Washington DC to Moscow, Paris to Tokyo, or London to Singapore. HETLIOZ\u00ae improved both nighttime sleep and next day alertness potentially offering significant benefits to millions of travelers,\" said Mihael H. Polymeropoulos, MD, Vanda's President and CEO.\n\nVanda intends to seek marketing approval for the use of HETLIOZ\u00ae in the treatment of jet lag disorder. Vanda believes that if HETLIOZ\u00ae is approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of jet lag disorder it will potentially offer a therapeutic solution to many travelers and will likely represent an important commercial opportunity for the company.

According to a study published in Nature today, researchers discovered that these drugs may activate stem cells in the brain to stimulate myelin producing cells and repair white matter, which is damaged in multiple sclerosis. The study was partially funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), part of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nSpecialized cells called oligodendrocytes lay down multiple layers of a fatty white substance known as myelin around axons, the long \u201cwires\u201d that connect brain cells. Myelin acts as an insulator and enables fast communication between brain cells. In multiple sclerosis there is breakdown of myelin and this deterioration leads to muscle weakness, numbness and problems with vision, coordination and balance.\n\n\u201cTo replace damaged cells, the scientific field has focused on direct transplantation of stem cell-derived tissues for regenerative medicine, and that approach is likely to provide enormous benefit down the road. We asked if we could find a faster and less invasive approach by using drugs to activate native nervous system stem cells and direct them to form new myelin. Our ultimate goal was to enhance the body\u2019s ability to repair itself,\u201d said Paul J. Tesar, Ph.D., associate professor at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine in Cleveland, and senior author of the study.\n\nIt is unknown how myelin-producing cells are damaged, but research suggests they may be targeted by malfunctioning immune cells and that multiple sclerosis may start as an autoimmune disorder. Current therapies for multiple sclerosis include anti-inflammatory drugs, which help prevent the episodic relapses common in multiple sclerosis, but are less effective at preventing long-term disability. Scientists believe that therapies that promote myelin repair might improve neurologic disability in people with multiple sclerosis.\n\nAdult brains contain oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), which are stem cells that generate myelin-producing cells. OPCs are found to multiply in the brains of multiple sclerosis patients as if to respond to myelin damage, but for unknown reasons they are not effective in restoring white matter. In the current study, Dr. Tesar wanted to see if drugs already approved for other uses were able to stimulate OPCs to increase myelination.\n\nOPCs have been difficult to isolate and study, but Dr. Tesar and his colleagues, in collaboration with Robert Miller, Ph.D., professor at George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C., developed a novel method to investigate these cells in a petri dish. Using this technique, they were able to quickly test the effects of hundreds of drugs on the stem cells.\n\nThe compounds screened in this study were obtained from a drug library maintained by NIH\u2019s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS). All are approved for use in humans. NCATS and Dr. Tesar have an ongoing collaboration and plan to expand the library of drugs screened against OPCs in the near future to identify other promising compounds.\n\nDr. Tesar\u2019s team found that two compounds in particular, miconazole (an antifungal) and clobetasol (a steroid), stimulated mouse and human OPCs into generating myelin-producing cells.\n\nNext, they examined whether the drugs, when injected into a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, could improve re-myelination. They found that both drugs were effective in activating OPCs to enhance myelination and reverse paralysis. As a result, almost all of the animals regained the use of their hind limbs. They also found that the drugs acted through two very different molecular mechanisms.\n\n\u201cThe ability to activate white matter cells in the brain, as shown in this study, opens up an exciting new avenue of therapy development for myelin disorders such as multiple sclerosis,\u201d said Ursula Utz, Ph.D., program director at the NINDS.\n\nDr. Tesar and his colleagues caution that more research is needed before miconazole and clobetasol can be tested in multiple sclerosis clinical trials. They are currently approved for use as creams or powders on the surfaces of the body but their safety administered in other forms, such as injections, in humans is unknown.\n\n\u201cOff-label use of the current forms of these drugs is more likely to increase other health concerns than alleviate multiple sclerosis symptoms. We are working tirelessly to ready a safe and effective drug for clinical use,\u201d Dr. Tesar said.\n\nThis work was supported by the NINDS (NS085246, NS030800, NS026543), the New York Stem Cell Foundation and the Myelin Repair Foundation, New York City.\n\nThe NINDS is the nation\u2019s leading funder of research on the brain and nervous system. The mission of NINDS is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease.\n\nThe National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences is a distinctly different entity in the research ecosystem.

These findings suggest the pills may help protect against death in patients with pneumonia.\n\nStatins such as Lipitor, Crestor, and a generic called simvastatin are widely prescribed to lower so-called \u201cbad\u201d or LDL cholesterol \u2014 a risk factor for heart disease \u2014 and are credited with being among the most successful drugs in helping to prevent heart attacks and strokes.\n\nSeparate research published in March found that lowering cholesterol levels could help the body\u2019s immune system fight infections, a finding that appears to be supported by Tuesday\u2019s study.\n\n\u201cStatins are safe, cheap, and an easy intervention in terms of delivery,\u201d said Ian Douglas, a lecturer in epidemiology at the LSHTM who led the research.\n\n\u201cGiven the potential low number needed to treat to prevent a death suggested by this study, we believe that a strong case exists for randomized trials of statins in people with serious infection to determine if a simple and practical intervention at the point of diagnosis of pneumonia has a beneficial effect.\u201d\n\nDouglas\u2019s team, whose research was published in the British Medical Journal, used data from computerized medical records of doctors\u2019 practices in Britain to identify statin users.\n\nThey then matched each statin user \u2014 who was aged over 40 when first prescribed a statin between 1995 and 2006 \u2014 with up to five non-statin users for comparison.\n\nPatients with a record of pneumonia were followed for six months to see if they died, and the researchers found that 13 percent (109 out of 847) of statin users died compared with 20 percent (578 out of 2,927) of non-statin users.\n\nDouglas noted that since this study looked at patients who were already taking statins when they developed pneumonia, a full randomized clinical trial was needed to find out whether starting a statin at the time of diagnosis has a similar effect.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story seems to have taken several\u00a0quotes and passages almost directly from this news release put out by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine without stating this was the case.\nExample:\nStory: \u201cPatients with a record of pneumonia were followed for six months to see if they died, and the researchers found that 13 percent (109 out of 847) of statin users died compared with 20 percent (578 out of 2,927) of non-statin users.\u201d\nPress release: \u201cPatients with a record of pneumonia were followed for six months to see if they died and the scientists found that 13% (109 out of 847) of statin users died compared with 20% (578 out of 2927) of non-statin users\u201d.

Seven randomized trials with zinc acetate and zinc gluconate lozenges found that the duration of colds was shortened on average by 33%.\n\nZinc lozenges appear to influence the common cold through the release of free zinc ions into the oro-pharyngeal region. However, zinc ions can bind tightly to various chemical complexes in such a way that little or no free zinc ions are released. Previously zinc lozenges containing citric acid were shown to be ineffective in treating colds because citric acid binds zinc ions very tightly and no free zinc is released.\n\nZinc acetate has been proposed as the most ideal salt for zinc lozenges since acetate binds to zinc ions very weakly. Zinc gluconate is another salt that has been frequently used in zinc lozenges. However, gluconate binds the zinc ion more tightly than acetate does. Because of the somewhat stronger binding, zinc gluconate has been proposed to be less suitable constituent for lozenges. Although the binding difference between zinc acetate and zinc gluconate is a fact, it is not evident whether that causes significant differences at the clinical level for treating the common cold.\n\nIn the meta-analysis, Dr. Harri Hemil\u00e4 from the University of Helsinki, Finland, collected randomized trials on zinc acetate and zinc gluconate lozenges and compared their observed efficacies. Three trials had used zinc acetate lozenges and found that colds were shortened on average by 40%. Four trials had used zinc gluconate lozenges and colds were shortened on average by 28%. The 12% difference between the average effects of the two kinds of lozenges was explained purely by random variation. Furthermore, one of the zinc gluconate lozenge trials was an outlier inconsistent with all the other six zinc lozenge trials. If that outlier trial was excluded, the difference between the three zinc acetate and the three zinc gluconate trials shrinked to just 2%, i.e., a 40% vs. 38% reduction in common cold duration. Thus, properly composed zinc gluconate lozenges may be as effective as zinc acetate lozenges.\n\nDr. Hemil\u00e4 also analyzed the dose response relationship between the elemental zinc dose and the observed efficacy in reducing common cold duration. There was no difference in the efficacy between five trials that used 80 to 92 mg of zinc per day and the two trials that used 192 and 207 mg of zinc per day. Thus, zinc doses of over 100 mg per day do not seem to provide any more benefit.\n\nAccording to Dr. Hemil\u00e4, there is no justification for the popular phrase that \"there is no cure for the common cold\" because of the strong evidence that zinc lozenges can shorten common cold duration by over 30%. However, in future studies the optimal composition of zinc lozenges should be investigated. The optimum frequency of their administration also warrants further investigation. Nevertheless, he also considers that \"the current evidence of efficacy for zinc lozenges is so strong that common cold patients should be encouraged to try them for treating their colds, but the patients should ascertain that the lozenges do not contain citric acid or its salt citrate.\"", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "The release doesn\u2019t rely on sensational or unjustifiable language.

Medicare advisers will meet next Wednesday to discuss the drug, which was developed by Dendreon, a Seattle-based biotechnology company.\n\nProvenge is the first so-called therapeutic cancer vaccine \u2013 meaning it works by training the patient\u2019s immune system to attack the tumor \u2013 to win F.D.A. approval. The treatment is made for each patient from his own blood. Sales have been small so far because Dendreon\u2019s manufacturing capacity has been limited.\n\nWhile Medicare generally pays for drugs that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, its debate over paying for Provenge has raised concerns among some cancer patients, doctors and investors who say the government is sending a warning shot that it will not automatically pay for high-priced medicines.\n\n\u201cNot only is C.M.S.\u2019s action contrary to Congress\u2019s intent to ensure beneficiary access to drugs and biologicals used in an anticancer chemotherapeutic regimen, but it threatens to stifle future innovation and cancer research for years to come,\u2019\u2019 Dr. Al B. Benson III, president of the Association of Community Cancer Centers, said in a comment submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nBut others say the health care system cannot afford to continue paying high prices for all therapies, particularly cancer drugs that extend lives by only a few months.\n\nWith expensive medicines there is already a sort of dual approval system, especially with private insurance companies. First a drug must get F.D.A. approval and then a manufacturer often must go through a lengthy process of persuading insurers to pay for the drug.\n\nMedicare is not supposed to consider price when determining whether to cover a drug, however.\n\nSome analysts have assumed that Medicare will pay for Provenge when used for the patients specified in the drug\u2019s label \u2013 those with advanced prostate cancer that is resistant to hormone-deprivation therapy but who are experiencing no or minimal symptoms.\n\nThe Medicare review might be more designed to limit off-label use of the expensive drug, such as for patients who already have symptoms. The review for Medicare said there was insufficient evidence to judge whether Provenge would work if used off-label.\n\nThe F.D.A. declined to approve Provenge in 2007, setting off protests by patients and Dendreon investors. After Dendreon completed another trial, which reaffirmed a survival advantage for the drug, Provenge was approved this April.\n\nBut the analysis for Medicare said that there were issues in how the trials were designed that made it difficult to assess how effective Provenge really was. One big issue was that the placebo used in the control arm was not really inert.\n\nRobyn Karnauskas, a biotechnology analyst at Deutsche Bank, said in a note to clients Wednesday that the assessment of moderate evidence in support of Provenge boded well for reimbursement. \u201cHistorically, moderate means that CMS will reimburse the product for its on-label indication,\u2019\u2019 she wrote.\n\nDendreon\u2019s shares rose more than 5 percent in trading after the close of the market.\n\nThe assessment was done by a technology evaluation group at the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association under contract to the government\u2019s Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "\n\n\nThe story does not rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "CLEVELAND, Ohio (October 8, 2018)--Microablative fractional CO2 lasers are energy-based devices designed to help manage troublesome menopause symptoms such as painful sex, dryness, itching/burning, urinary frequency, and incontinence. Although there is ongoing debate regarding the safety and effectiveness of vaginal laser surgery, a new study suggests that it may be effective, especially after multiple treatments. Study results are published online in Menopause, the journal of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS).\n\nCollectively known as the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), the various genital and urinary problems associated with menopause have created a market for new therapies and treatments to help women regain sexual function and bladder control. Vaginal laser surgery represents one of the newer and more hotly contested approaches.\n\nIn the case of microablative fractional CO2 laser surgery, a series of microscopic laser beams using fractionated energy penetrate the skin to remove old and damaged skin cells, intended to rebuild the vaginal pathway. In this new study, GSM symptoms were evaluated up to12 months after the last laser surgery and compared based on the number of total therapies applied (up to a total of five).\n\nThe results of this small, retrospective, non-sham-controlled study demonstrated that this type of laser surgery was particularly effective in reducing the intensity of dyspareunia (painful sex) and dryness. It further demonstrated that four or five laser therapies may be superior in lowering the intensity of GSM symptoms compared with three laser therapies in both short- and long-term follow-up. Study results are published in the article \"Microablative fractional CO2 laser for the genitourinary syndrome of menopause: up to 12-month results.\"\n\n\"This study adds to the literature on vaginal laser therapy for GSM.

In the study, researchers were able to reprogram skin cells to become vascular cells in badly injured legs that lacked blood flow. Within one week, active blood vessels appeared in the injured leg, and by the second week, the leg was saved. In lab tests, this technology was also shown to reprogram skin cells in the live body into nerve cells that were injected into brain-injured mice to help them recover from stroke.\n\n\"This is difficult to imagine, but it is achievable, successfully working about 98 percent of the time.

Patients were tracked from four to 12 years, with a median of 9.2 years. The research builds on a 2006 Lancet Neurology study that followed patients for a median of 5.2 years, beginning with a group of 137 volunteers with mild cognitive impairment.The new study is important because of the long follow-up period, according to Adam Brickman, assistant professor of neuropsychology at Columbia University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research.\n\nKnowing which patient with mild cognitive impairment patients may go on to develop Alzheimer's is vital information for researchers, who are looking for treatments for the fatal brain disease. The current thinking is that interventions will be most effective when given to a patient as early as possible, Brickman said. Clinical trials can better focus their efforts if patients are known to be in the early stages of Alzheimer's. Generally, about 30% to 60% of patients with mild cognitive impairment show evidence of underlying symptoms of Alzheimer's, so not everyone with this condition is a good candidate for an Alzheimer's trial.\n\nResearchers focused on two biomarkers previously thought to be involved in Alzheimer's disease: a kind of protein called beta-amyloid, and another protein type called tau. Experts believe a decrease in beta-amyloid in the fluid of the spinal cord is associated with a toxic buildup of that protein in the brain, which causes the formation of plaques linked to Alzheimer's disease. Tau has been tied to neurofibrillary tangles in the brain; researchers find that an increase in tau in cerebrospinal fluid is associated with Alzheimer's also.\n\nThe results from the study suggest that beta-amyloid is a much earlier predictor of Alzheimer's disease than tau, which supports the hypothesis that beta-amyloid accumulation in the brain occurs first in the course of the disease.\n\nSome of the participants, who were originally found to be stable with mild cognitive impairment after about five years, went on to develop Alzheimer's disease during the longer follow-up. That suggests that a five-year follow-up period is not long enough to determine how well biomarkers can predict which patients will develop Alzheimer's disease, researchers say.\n\nThe association between biomarkers in the fluid and Alzheimer's was also described in studies in December 2009 and August 2010, building on the idea that a spinal tap could be useful in predicting Alzheimer's.\n\nWhen these sorts of studies get published, Brickman and other doctors get phone calls from aging adults wondering whether they should be getting spinal taps to assess their risk. But it's too early to use this as a diagnostic tool in clinical settings, says Brickman. Down the road, the \"fantasy\" is that asymptomatic people will be able to get a biomarker test to determine whether they'll one day get Alzheimer's, but that's not possible right now, he adds.\n\n\"What I tell people is: If they\u2019re worried about their thinking abilities, that they should make an appointment with a neuropsychology or a neurologist to get an evaluation,\" Brinkman says. \"The way we diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s disease is by evaluating the behavior and the risk factor medical profile, not by looking at biological markers at this point.\"\n\nAs scientists gain more insight into predicting Alzheimer's, aging adults may struggle with the question of whether they want to know their risk, especially since there's still no cure. Some people want to enroll in clinical trials as soon as they start showing symptoms; others would rather be ignorant of their status since there is no cure.

Duckett says she felt like she missed out on a pivotal moment in her pregnancy.\n\n\"It took me a long time even to be able to say that I gave birth to Avery,\" she says. \"I felt like I didn't earn the right to say I gave birth to him, like it was taken from me somehow, like I hadn't done what I was supposed to do.\"\n\nDuckett's reaction to her C-section is unfortunately a common one, says Betsey Snow, head of Family and Child Services at Anne Arundel Medical Center, a community hospital in Annapolis, Md.\n\n\"I hear a lot of moms say, 'I'm disappointed I had to have a C-section.' A lot of women felt like they failed because they couldn't do a vaginal delivery,\" says Snow.\n\nNow some hospitals are offering small but significant changes to the procedure to make it seem more like a birth than major surgery.\n\nIn a typical C-section, a closed curtain shields the sterile operating field. Mothers don't see the procedure and their babies are immediately whisked away for pediatric care \u2014 a separation that can last for close to half an hour. Kristen Caminiti, of Crofton, Md., knows this routine well. Her first two sons were born by traditional cesarean. She was happy with their births because, she says, it was all she knew. Then, just a few weeks into her third pregnancy, Caminiti, who is 33, saw a post on Facebook about family-centered cesarean techniques catching on in England.\n\n\"I clicked on the link and thought, 'I want that,' \" she says.\n\nThe techniques are relatively easy and the main goals simple: Let moms see their babies being born if they want and put newborns immediately on the mother's chest for skin-to-skin contact. This helps stimulate bonding and breast feeding. Caminiti asked her obstetrician, Dr. Marcus Penn, if he'd allow her to have this kind of birth. He said yes.\n\nWhen Caminiti told Penn what she wanted, his first thought was it wouldn't be that difficult to do. \"I didn't see anything that would be terribly out of the norm,\" he says. \"It would be different from the way we usually do it, but nothing terrible that anyone would say we shouldn't try that.\"\n\nFamily-centered cesareans are a relatively new idea in the U.S., and many doctors and hospitals have no experience with them. Penn and the staff at Anne Arundel Medical Center quickly realized the procedure would require some changes, including adding a nurse and bringing the neonatal team into the operating room.\n\nAnd there were a bunch of little adjustments, such as moving the EKG monitors from their usual location on top of the mother's chest to her side. This allows the delivery team to place the newborn baby immediately on the mother's chest. In addition, Penn says, the mother's hands were not strapped down and the intravenous line was put in her nondominant hand so she could hold the baby.\n\nAt the beginning of October, Caminiti underwent her C-section. She was alert, her head was up and the drape lowered so she could watch the delivery of her son, Connor. Caminiti's husband, Matt, recorded the event. After Connor was out, with umbilical cord still attached, he was placed right on Caminiti's chest.\n\n\"It was the most amazing and grace-filled experience to finally have that moment of having my baby be placed on my chest,\" Caminiti says. \"He was screaming and then I remember that when I started to talk to him he stopped. It was awesome.\"\n\nAnd the baby stayed with her for the rest of the procedure.\n\nChanges like this can make a big difference, says Dr. William Camann, the director of obstetric anesthesiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and one of the pioneers of the procedure in the U.S. At Brigham and Women's, their version of the family-centered cesarean is called the gentle cesarean. Moms who opt for it can view the birth through a clear plastic drape, and immediate skin-to-skin contact follows.\n\nCamann says the gentle C-section is not a replacement for a vaginal birth; it's just a way to improve the surgical experience. \"No one is trying to advocate for C-sections. We really don't want to increase the cesarean rate, we just want to make it better for those who have to have it,\" he says.\n\nSo why has the procedure been slow to catch on? Hospitals aren't charging more for it \u2014 so cost doesn't seem to be a major factor. What's lacking are clinical studies. Without hard scientific data on outcomes and other concerns like infection control, many hospitals may be wary of changing their routines. Betsey Snow of Anne Arundel Medical Center says the family-centered C-section represents a cultural shift, and her hospital is helping break new ground by adopting it.\n\n\"It is the first time we have really done anything innovative or creative with changing the C-section procedure in years,\" she says.\n\nKristen Caminiti says her hope is that these innovations become routine. She says she'd like nothing more than to know that other women having C-sections are able to have the same amazing experience she had.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not seem to be based on any press releases.

And, increasingly, it resonates for Westerners.\n\nMove over, pomegranate and acai berry. Coconuts are the new \u201cin\u201d food, touted by natural-foods enthusiasts and chased by entrepreneurs looking for a big payday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good time to own a coconut farm, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Daniel Fabricant, vice president for government and scientific affairs at the Natural Products Association, a trade association in Washington.\n\nFabricant said companies that belong to his organization, representing natural-foods retailers and manufacturers, are increasingly offering coconut-based products.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got fiber, fats and oils, water-based compounds, and you\u2019ve got the milk,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a holistic approach.\u201d\n\nThe fruit\u2019s appeal rests, in part, on this versatility. A single coconut produces water, nectar, flesh, milk and even textile fiber. That translates into a broad slate of products. And in contrast to another natural substance that gets transformed into a wide variety of products \u2014 petroleum \u2014 coconuts are viewed as healthy.\n\nBut are they?\n\nCoconut water comes from young, green coconuts and contains a winning combination of electrolytes, sodium and potassium.\n\nIt is very healthy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an effective drink for rehydration that doesn\u2019t bring in the added sugars and the additives,\u201d said Dani Little, dietitian for the Whole Foods Market on Pearl Street in Boulder. \u201cA lot of rehydrating beverages have additives, whereas the coconut water \u2014 it\u2019s super clean.\u201d\n\nCoconut oil and milk, though, are receiving mixed reviews.\n\nCoconut fat is saturated, like the fat in lard and butter. The healthiest fats, those found in olive and canola oils, contain more monounsaturated fats, which do not raise LDL cholesterol and might even help lower it. Doctors and dietitians have warned people away from cholesterol-boosting saturated fats for years. Coconut fats are not an exception.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had clients who have added coconut oil to shakes and things like that, and their cholesterol has gone up significantly,\u201d said Jessica Crandall, a Denver dietitian who is president of the Colorado Dietetic Association. \u201cSaturated fat clogs your arteries and is not good for heart health. I was meeting with a cardiologist recently, and he said he doesn\u2019t advise (coconut oil) for any clients.\u201d\n\nThe fat issue is complicated by the types of fatty acids found in coconut, versus other saturated fats. While most other saturated fats contain \u201clong- chain\u201d fatty acids, most coconut fats are \u201cmedium-chain.\u201d\n\nThis is advantageous for coconuts because the medium-chain fatty acids are broken down more rapidly by enzymes, said Little. In general, she said, fats high in medium-chain fatty acids are more healthy than those laden with long-chain acids.\n\nIn addition, coconut fats are high in lauric acid, which many believe acts as an antimicrobial, helping prevent viruses, fungi and parasites.\n\nEven so, Little, a coconut enthusiast, doesn\u2019t recommend loading up on coconut fats. Instead of buying oils or supplements, just use the whole coconut.\n\n\u201cWhat we tend to do with our food supply is take the positive and squeeze it into a pill or jar and think that will take care of everything,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you focus on coconut oil, you lose out on the fiber and you are focusing on a concentrated source of calories. It\u2019s the whole coconut that needs to be talked about.\u201d\n\nEntrepreneurs are talking about the whole coconut these days. Some \u2014 those toiling to make money with coconut water \u2014 are worried about the coconut supply.\n\nCoconut water \u201cis much different from Red Bull or Vitamin Water,\u201d said John Craven, the founder of Bevnet.com, a trade publication for the beverage industry. \u201cIf they want to make more, they just build more factories.\u201d\n\nCraven describes the race to turn coconut water into a big market, like iced tea or energy drinks, as something akin to a gold rush.\n\n\u201cRight now, coconut water is all the rage,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the natural movement being in the forefront right now, the timing is right. In the past couple of years a couple of brands have figured out the right angle \u2014 electrolytes and hydration.\u201d\n\nCraven estimated the coconut-water market at about $100 million annually right now, but companies are doubling their sales year after year. By next year, he said, one company alone \u2014 Vita Coco \u2014 could do $100 million or more in sales. He predicted within a few years it will be a billion-dollar market.\n\nMammoth beverage companies like Coca-Cola, Dr Pepper Snapple Group, and PepsiCo have investments in coconut water. Grocers shelves add new coconut-water products regularly.\n\n\u201cDemand has increased exponentially, primarily in mainstream groceries like Walmart and Costco,\u201d said Arthur Gallego, a spokesman for the New York-based Vita Coco. \u201cIt\u2019s trickling down to the mass market.\u201d\n\nThe company is growing so quickly, he said, it had to hunt for coconuts from outside of Brazil, where it previously harvested most of its fruit. Now it also gets coconuts from Asia.\n\n\u201cThe volume is going through the roof,\u201d said Laura Sauls, a spokeswoman for Hermosa Beach, Calif.-based Zico. \u201cWe are seeing new competitors by the week.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the pure water that is exciting marketers. It\u2019s increasingly being used as an additive, too.\n\nCoconut water \u201cis very healthy, and that\u2019s our aim,\u201d said Kevin Conrad, a sales executive with GoFast, a Denver energy drink that now includes a version containing coconut-water concentrate.\n\nIt\u2019s healthy \u2014 and simple, too. That\u2019s one of the attractions, said Tom Rich, who is in charge of grocery operations for Whole Foods Rocky Mountain region.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something you don\u2019t have to figure out,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople know what it is and where it grows. It\u2019s simple all the way around.\u201d\n\nOne tablespoon of coconut oil contains 120 calories and 14 grams of fat, 12.5 grams of which is saturated.

But eventually with additional research, Rogers envisions more sophisticated use of such devices, such as real-time monitoring of how the body adjusts during military training, or even to screen people for diseases such as diabetes or cystic fibrosis.\n\nRogers, who did much of the research while at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, has long worked to develop electronic devices that can stretch and twist with the body. The skin-like sweat patch adds a capability called microfluidics, capturing and analyzing tiny amounts of body fluid.\n\nHow it works: Stick the patch on the skin and start moving. Tiny channels collect perspiration and route it to different compartments where it interacts with chemicals that change color to reflect sweat loss, the perspiration\u2019s acidity level, and concentrations of chloride, glucose and lactate.\n\nTogether, those measurements can indicate such things as hydration levels or electrolyte loss. Hold a smartphone over the patch, and an app takes a picture of the colors and interprets what they mean.\n\nIn two studies reported Wednesday, Rogers\u2019 team stuck patches to the arms and backs of 21 healthy volunteers. Nine rode exercise bikes in a gym to compare the sweat patches\u2019 performance with the decidedly lower-tech method of sweat-testing used today \u2014 taping on absorbent pads and carting the resulting wet samples to a laboratory.

Previous recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) had previously called for nasal sprays, or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), not be used during the 2016-2017 flu season.\n\nDr. Mark Loeb, lead author of the study, says his team's findings challenge the ACIP's recommendations towards flu shots, or inactivated vaccines.\n\n\"Our study is the first blinded randomized controlled trial to compare the direct and indirect effect of the live vaccine versus the inactivated vaccine,\" said Loeb, a professor in McMaster's Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine.\n\n\"Our results are important because in previous years the live vaccine had first been preferred for children.

The National Institute of Mental Health recently sponsored its first study of neurofeedback for A.D.H.D.: a randomized, controlled trial of 36 subjects.\n\nThe results are to be announced Oct. 26 at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. In an interview in the summer, the study\u2019s director, Dr. L. Eugene Arnold, an emeritus professor of psychiatry at Ohio State, noted that there had been \u201cquite a bit of improvement\u201d in many of the children\u2019s behavior, as reported by parents and teachers.\n\nDr. Arnold said that if the results bore out that neurofeedback was making the difference, he would seek financing for a broader study, with as many as 100 subjects.\n\nJohn Kounios, a professor of psychology at Drexel University, published a small study in 2007 suggesting that the treatment speeded cognitive processing in elderly people. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that neurofeedback works, that people can change brain activity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe big questions we still haven\u2019t answered are precisely how it works and how it can be harnessed to treat disorders.\u201d\n\nRussell A. Barkley, a professor of psychiatry at the Medical University of South Carolina and a leading authority on attention problems, has long dismissed claims that neurofeedback can help. But Dr. Barkley says he was persuaded to take another look after Dutch scientists published an analysis of recent international studies finding significant reductions in impulsiveness and inattention.\n\nStill, Dr. Barkley cautioned that he had yet to see credible evidence confirming claims that such benefits can be long lasting, much less permanent.\n\nAnd another mainstream expert is much more disapproving. William E. Pelham Jr., director of the Center for Children and Families at Florida International University, called neurofeedback \u201ccrackpot charlatanism.\u201d He warned that exaggerated claims for it might lead parents to favor it over proven options like behavioral therapy and medication.\n\nNeurofeedback was developed in the 1960s and \u201970s, with American researchers leading the way. In 1968, M. Barry Sterman, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, reported that the training helped cats resist epileptic seizures. Dr. Sterman and others later claimed to have achieved similar benefits with humans.\n\nThe findings prompted a boomlet of interest in which clinicians of varying degrees of respectability jumped into the field, making many unsupported claims about seeming miracle cures and tainting the treatment\u2019s reputation among academic experts. Meanwhile, researchers in Germany and the Netherlands continued to explore neurofeedback\u2019s potential benefits.\n\nA major attraction of the technique is the hope that it can help patients avoid drugs, which often have side effects. Instead, patients practice routines that seem more like exercising a muscle.\n\nBrain cells communicate with one another, in part, through a constant storm of electrical impulses. Their patterns show up on an electroencephalogram, or EEG, as brain waves with different frequencies.\n\nNeurofeedback practitioners say people have problems when their brain wave frequencies aren\u2019t suited for the task at hand, or when parts of the brain aren\u2019t communicating adequately with other parts. These issues, they say, can be represented on a \u201cbrain map,\u201d the initial EEG readings that serve as a guide for treatment. Subsequently, a clinician will help a patient learn to slow down or speed up those brain waves, through a process known as operant conditioning. The brain begins by generating fairly random patterns, while the computer software responds with encouragement whenever the activity meets the target.\n\nDr. Norman Doidge, a psychiatrist at the Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research at Columbia and the author of \u201cThe Brain That Changes Itself\u201d (Viking, 2007), said he considered neurofeedback \u201ca powerful stabilizer of the brain.\u201d Practitioners make even more enthusiastic claims. Robert Coben, a neuropsychologist in Massapequa Park, N.Y., said he had treated more than 1,000 autistic children over the past seven years and had conducted a clinical study, finding striking reductions in symptoms, as reported by parents.\n\nMaureen and Terrence Magagnos of Lynbrook, N.Y., took their 7-year-old son, Peter, to Dr. Coben after he was given a diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorder in first grade. \u201cHe had classic symptoms of autism,\u201d said Mr. Magagnos. \u201cHis speech was terrible, he made very little eye contact and he screamed for attention \u2014 literally screamed.\u201d\n\nTheir exceptionally generous insurance covered neurofeedback, so they decided to give it a try, with sessions twice a week for the next five years.\n\nAt the start of the treatment, Dr. Coben said, he discovered that Peter had been suffering tiny, asymptomatic seizures. He says neurofeedback helped stabilize the child\u2019s brain activity, eliminating the seizures. And within three months, said Mr. Magagnos, a retired police officer, Peter\u2019s teachers were calling to report remarkable improvements.\n\n\u201cToday I\u2019d say he has \u2018autism light,\u2019 \u201d he added. \u201cHe still has some symptoms, but he is much more manageable.\u201d\n\nWhether such results can be achieved with other children is a matter of debate. Still, as practitioners lobby for broader acceptance, including insurance recognition, a sure sign of neurofeedback\u2019s increasing popularity is the number of companies selling supposedly mind-altering systems to use at home.\n\nWith names like SmartBrain Technologies and the Learning Curve Inc., they offer equipment purported, respectively, to \u201cpump the neurons\u201d and \u201cmake lasting changes in attention, memory, mood, control, pain, sleep and more.\u201d\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration regulates all biofeedback equipment as medical devices. The only approved use, however, is for \u201crelaxation.\u201d\n\nPeter Freer, a former grade-school teacher who is chief executive of a North Carolina firm called Unique Logic and Technology, says that since he began his business in 1994, he has sold several thousand of his \u201cPlay Attention\u201d systems, advertised to improve a child\u2019s focus, behavior, academic performance and social behavior.\n\nThe equipment, which costs $1,800, is advertised as \u201ca sophisticated advancement of neurofeedback.\u201d Mr. Freer says his clients include more than 600 school districts. (He adds that his system, as distinct from \u201cclinical\u201d neurofeedback, aims not to change brain waves but rather to put the user in an \u201cattentive state\u201d that makes it easier to learn skills.) Neurofeedback in general is a largely unregulated, with practitioners often devising their own protocols about where on the scalp to place electrodes. Results vary widely, and researchers caution that it is extremely important to choose one\u2019s practitioner with care.\n\nWhen it comes to to the actual devices, Dr. Kerson, at the International Society for Neurofeedback and Research, cautioned that they should never be used without experienced supervision.\n\n\u201cOftentimes what people do is find a way to get one of these machines on eBay and use it at home,\u201d she said, adding that unskilled use could interfere with medications or prompt an anxiety attack or a seizure.\n\n\u201cNeurofeedback is a powerful therapy,\u201d she said, \u201cand should be treated that way.\u201d", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not appear to be based on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Obese children who cut sugar from their diets saw improvements in markers of heart disease after just nine days, a study in Atherosclerosis found.\n\nFor the study, researchers evaluated 37 children ages 9 to 18 who were obese and at high risk for heart disease and Type 2 diabetes.

And vigorous activity makes you fit, and fitness reduces your risk of disease and death,\u201d says Gary O\u2019Donovan, a researcher in physical activity and sedentary behavior at England\u2019s Loughborough University and lead author of the paper.\n\nO\u2019Donovan and fellow researchers looked at data on middle-aged adults who responded to a government-sponsored household survey conducted from 1994 to 2012. The survey included questions about health history and fitness habits. The researchers then cross-referenced this information with health department death records.\n\nThey found the risk of death from all causes was about 30 percent lower for weekend warriors, compared with adults who maintained a sedentary lifestyle. And the warriors had a 40 percent lower risk of cardiovascular death and an 18 percent lower risk for cancer-related death. The mortality rates of weekend warriors were roughly the same as those who claimed to exercise more than two days a week but for shorter durations.\n\nHowever, there are also some limitations to this study, the researchers say. More than 90 percent of the subjects were white. The information about physical activity was reported by the participants, and it\u2019s likely that many were too generous in their estimates of how much time they spent at the gym. Unfortunately, taking 20 minutes in locker room to put on your sneakers doesn\u2019t count as a workout.\n\nRelated: Severe childhood obesity is on the rise in the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s recommended that people get 150 minutes (or two and half hours) of exercise each week, based on guidelines from the American Heart Association, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other medical authorities. This could be something as simple as a brisk walk or other low-impact options for vigorous exercise about 20 minutes a day. (Experts often encourage recreational athletes to not exercise more than an hour a day.) \u201cIn theory, someone who did one bout of 150 minutes of moderate exercise is a weekend warrior,\u201d says O\u2019Donovan.\n\nThis study shows that it doesn\u2019t matter how you decide to split up the recommended weekly amount of exercise. You just need to do it.\n\nHowever, experts caution that it is possible to overdo it, and more exercise than two and a half hours a week can actually be unhelpful and even harmful. One study, published in 2014 in the journal Heart, suggests that in people with existing heart disease, the risk for cardiac arrest and stroke was the same for people who exercised more than an hour a day compared with those who didn\u2019t exercise at all. The coronary heart disease patients who stuck with the recommended 150 minutes a week had the lowest risk for heart attack and stroke.\n\nRelated: Post-workout cold immersion likely won\u2019t help you heal\n\nThere are risks that come with a weekend warrior exercise schedule, especially for people who aren\u2019t used to being active. \u201cI would be more concerned about what\u2019s happening at the point of exercise\u2014not the long-term benefits,\u201d says Dr. Howard Andrew Selinger, chair of family medicine at Quinnipiac University. He says someone who is not in good shape is at risk for sudden cardiac arrest or acute injury, such as spraining muscles or putting too much stress on joints.\n\nO\u2019Donovan encourages aspiring weekend warriors to start slowly to avoid any health problems. He says middle-aged adults should exercise moderately during the first 12 weeks and then slowly build up to more vigorous activity.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not appear to rely on a news\u00a0release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "MONDAY, Jan. 12, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Higher vitamin D levels in patients with advanced colon cancer appear to improve response to chemotherapy and targeted anti-cancer drugs, researchers say.\n\n\"We found that patients who had vitamin D levels at the highest category had improved survival and improved progression-free survival, compared with patients in the lowest category,\" said lead author Dr. Kimmie Ng, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston.\n\nThose patients survived one-third longer than patients with low levels of vitamin D -- an average 32.6 months, compared with 24.5 months, the researchers found.\n\nThe report, scheduled for presentation this week at the Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium in San Francisco, adds more weight to suspicions that vitamin D might be a valuable cancer-fighting supplement.\n\nHowever, colon cancer patients shouldn't try to boost vitamin D levels beyond the normal range, one expert said.\n\nThe study only found an association between vitamin D levels and colon cancer survival rates. It did not prove cause and effect.\n\nResearchers for years have investigated vitamin D as a potential anti-cancer tool, but none of the findings have been strong enough to warrant a recommendation, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society.\n\n\"Everyone comes to the same conclusion -- yes, there may be some benefit, but we really need to study it carefully so we can be certain there aren't other factors that make vitamin D look better than it is,\" Lichtenfeld said. \"These findings are interesting, and show that vitamin D may have a role in improving outcomes in cancer care.\"\n\nIn this study, researchers measured blood levels of vitamin D in 1,043 patients enrolled in a phase 3 clinical trial comparing three first-line treatments for newly diagnosed, advanced colon cancer. All of the treatments involved chemotherapy combined with the targeted anti-cancer drugs bevacizumab and/or cetuximab.\n\nVitamin D is called the \"sunshine vitamin\" because human bodies produce it when the sun's ultraviolet rays strike the skin. It promotes the intestines' ability to absorb calcium and other important minerals, and is essential for maintaining strong, healthy bones, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health.\n\nBut vitamin D also influences cellular function in ways that could be beneficial in treating cancer, Ng said. For example, she said it appears to reduce cell growth, promote the death of diseased cells, and inhibit the formation of new blood vessels to feed cancerous tumors.\n\nThe study authors found that certain types of cancer patients tended to have lower vitamin D levels. These included people whose blood specimens were drawn in the winter and spring months, people who live in the northern and northeastern states, older adults, blacks, overweight or obese people, and those who had lower physical activity and were in worse physical condition.\n\nThe patients were divided into five groups based on vitamin D levels, ranging from low to high. After adjusting for prognosis and healthy behaviors, the researchers found that patients in the group with the highest levels of vitamin D lived about eight months longer on average than those in the group with the lowest levels.\n\n\"We had a lot of information on their tumor, their treatment and their survival times, and their diet and lifestyle,\" Ng said. \"That really allowed us to adjust for other potential factors that could influence what we're seeing.\"\n\nIt also took longer for cancer to progress in people with higher vitamin D levels -- an average 12.2 months compared with about 10 months in the group with the lowest. No significant differences were seen with regard to the type of therapy the patients received.\n\nThis increase in progression-free survival is the most compelling evidence indicating that vitamin D makes a difference in colon cancer, said Dr. Smitha Krishnamurthi, an associate professor of hematology and oncology at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland.\n\n\"That is interesting because that's more of a cancer-specific endpoint as opposed to overall survival, which could be influenced by other factors like heart health,\" Krishnamurthi said.\n\nEveryone should maintain healthy vitamin D levels anyway, to protect their bone health, Ng and Krishnamurthi said.\n\nBased on this new study, Krishnamurthi said she would emphasize the importance of vitamin D for patients with colon cancer.\n\n\"They should take supplements to bring it into normal range, because we know it is good for bone health and it may have an anti-cancer effect,\" she said.\n\nHowever, \"if someone has a normal vitamin D level, I wouldn't take supplements to increase it because we won't know the true effect on cancer until we see the results of a clinical trial,\" she said.\n\nThe U.S. National Institutes of Health funded the study. Research presented at meetings is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.\n\nFor more on vitamin D and cancer, visit the U.S. National Cancer Institute.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "There was a news release issued by the researchers\u2019 \u00a0institution, but the story had different quotes obviously gleaned from interviews.

(Nasdaq: HOLX) announced that study results published today in a research letter in JAMA conclude that breast tomosynthesis (Hologic's Genius\u2122 3D MAMMOGRAPHY\u2122) exams reduce recall rates, and increase invasive cancer detection in women with both dense and nondense breasts. These key benefits of 3D MAMMOGRAPHY\u2122 could lower the costs associated with needless follow-up exams, and improve patient experience for women seeking a more accurate screening mammogram.\n\nDensity is only identifiable on a mammogram or other imaging system, and is a reflection of how much fibrous or glandular tissue is in the breast. Higher breast density may increase a woman's chance of getting breast cancer, make detection of cancer on conventional mammography more difficult, and increase the chances that a woman will be recalled for additional imaging.1,2 Mammograms are categorized into four density groups: almost entirely fat, scattered fibroglandular densities, heterogeneously dense, and extremely dense. The latter two groups are considered dense; however, the vast majority of women whose mammograms are considered dense have heterogeneously dense breast tissue.\n\n\"Density creates challenges for conventional mammography by obscuring the images, which often results in additional visits and exams for women,\" said Edward Evantash, MD, board certified OB/GYN and Medical Director for Hologic. \"This new analysis confirms that Genius\u2122 3D MAMMOGRAPHY\u2122 exams reduce unnecessary follow-up exams in dense-breasted women. This has the potential to provide health systems and insurance companies with significant cost savings, reduce patient stress and expenses, and alleviate challenges for referring physicians who are tasked with relaying mammography results to their patients.\"\n\nImprovements in both recall rate reduction and invasive cancer detection were greatest for women with heterogeneously dense breasts, with a 50 percent increase in invasive cancer detection and a simultaneous 14 percent reduction in recall rate. Women with heterogeneously dense breasts make up about 40 percent of the U.S. screening population (women ages 40-74) \u2014 approximately 25 million women in the U.S.\n\n\"Utilizing Genius\u2122 3D MAMMOGRAPHY\u2122 exams for breast cancer screening will reduce the need for subsequent unnecessary testing, and decrease the number of unnecessary breast biopsies\u2014 addressing concerns that were previously raised as limitations of conventional mammography while also reducing costs for health systems,\" said Pete Valenti, Hologic's Division President, Breast and Skeletal Health Solutions. \"Twenty-six states have passed legislation requiring doctors to notify women if they have dense breasts \u2014 and now these women who were previously confused about how to proceed with breast cancer screening can feel confident turning to 3D MAMMOGRAPHY\u2122 exams to reduce their chances of stressful recalls and help find more invasive cancer.\"\n\nThis study brought together the principal investigators from the groundbreaking 2014 study on 3D MAMMOGRAPHY\u2122 exams, also published in JAMA, this time led by Elizabeth Rafferty, MD, a co-author on the prior study.3 A total of 452,320 examinations (278,906 conventional mammograms compared to 173,414 Genius\u2122 3D MAMMOGRAPHY\u2122 exams), were analyzed.\n\nGenius\u2122 3D MAMMOGRAPHY\u2122 exams have been available in the U.S. since 2011, and are only available on the Hologic Selenia\u00ae Dimensions\u00ae mammography system.

Then it fell out of favor.\n\nToday, the most common reason for the surgery is \"sleep disordered breathing,\" a broad diagnosis that includes sleep apnea and snoring. About 10 percent of elementary-school-age children snore.\n\nDoctors say snoring can cause bed-wetting, behavior problems, short stature and poor school performance. That's a far cry from the 1950s and '60s, when tonsillectomy was used to fight frequent sore throats.\n\nBack then, it was the most popular surgery in the United States. In the 1960s sitcom Leave It to Beaver, Beaver Cleaver was so impressed by his dad's tales of ice cream and pretty nurses that he schemed to have his tonsils out, even though he didn't need it.\n\nThe tonsils are two glands that sit at the base of the tongue and are part of the body's immune system. The premise of tonsillectomies, back in their heyday, was that tonsils get infected themselves and no longer help fend off germs.\n\nThen doctors started noticing that kids were still getting sore throats, even after having their tonsils taken out. But it wasn't until clinical trials were completed in the early 1980s that there was proof that tonsillectomy really only helped children with severe, recurrent throat infections.\n\n\"It was becoming unacceptable to just take tonsils out because they were there or you had a few infections,\" says Richard Rosenfeld, an ear, nose and throat doctor at SUNY Downstate in Brooklyn, N.Y. \"People were growing up with their tonsils.\"\n\nBut growing up with tonsils can create another problem: snoring. Lisa Moran of Takoma Park, Md., remembers what it sounded like when her son ,Tyler Scorza, now age 7, slept.\n\n\"It was loud,\" Moran says. \"You could hear him through he closed door, down the hall, snoring, and he would occasionally stop breathing.\"\n\nAt first, Tyler's pediatrician thought he'd outgrow the snoring. But he wasn't sleeping well and often didn't have any energy. The doctor recommended a head X-Ray, and the radiologist said that though Tyler's adenoids were enlarged, they weren't that bad.\n\nBy then, Tyler had been dealing with this for almost three years. He started getting frequent nasal infections. So his parents took him to an ear, nose and throat doctor. He said, sure, the adenoids are swollen.\n\n\"But the real problem is the tonsils!\" Moran recalls. \"He showed us on the X-ray that there was a tiny passage between the tonsils and the back of his throat \u2014 very small.\"\n\nEnlarged tonsils (and adenoids) are the most common cause of sleep-disordered breathing in children. So the doctor recommended tonsillectomy.\n\nBut Tyler's parents were worried about the surgery. It's usually done as an outpatient procedure now, but with general anesthesia. That's never without some risk.\n\n\"Your child is under,\" says Moran, \"completely under. This is not a local.\"\n\nOther complications include pain after surgery and the risk of bleeding; about 4 percent of people have complications that require readmission to the hospital.\n\nDespite hundreds of studies, there's still surprisingly little research on whether tonsillectomy really helps reduce the risk of sore throats. The operation continues to be controversial.\n\nNo less a personage than President Obama dissed tonsillectomy when he was stumping for health care overhaul in July 2009. In a prime time news conference, Obama said that doctors may think: \" 'You know what? I make a lot more money if I take this kid's tonsils out.' \"\n\nRosenfeld disputes Obama's claim, saying insurers usually pay a surgeon $200 to $300 for tonsil surgery.\n\nThe picture is further clouded because not all children with big tonsils have sleep-disordered breathing or frequent throat infections. Because of that, in 2002 the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that children have a sleep study before surgery is considered.\n\nAbout 530,000 tonsillectomies are performed in the United States each year. Obviously, parents could use some help in deciding whether surgery is needed. In January, the American Academy of Otolaryngology issued its first guidelines on tonsillectomy in children.\n\nWith sore throats, the ENTs recommend waiting (and treatment with antibiotics, if needed), unless a child has more than seven infections in a year. They'd recommend surgery if a child has five or more throat infections a year for two years, or three or more in three years.\n\nThere have been very few randomized studies on the effects of tonsillectomy for sleep-disordered breathing. Most of the researchers have asked parents or children whether they noticed improvements, and looked at a single measure, like behavior or quality of life. Still, the ENTs recommend tonsillectomy for sleep-disordered breathing, saying it reduces symptoms in most children.\n\nTyler's family decided to go ahead with the surgery; they went to the hospital at 5 a.m., and Tyler was home by noon. The doctors said he would be out of school for a week, but a throat infection kept him home a second week. His classmates sent him get-well cards.\n\nA year later, Tyler is feeling great. And his snoring is gone. \"Completely gone,\" his mom says. \"You can hear a pin-drop quiet when he sleeps.\"\n\nTyler still hears snoring at night, he says. But he knows that the culprit is not him, or the family dog. It's Dad.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story definitely does not rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Newswise \u2014 ARLINGTON, Va., March 1, 2017 \u2013 Results from a new prospective clinical trial indicate that high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy administered in a single, 19 Gray (Gy) treatment may be a safe and effective alternative to longer courses of HDR treatment for men with localized prostate cancer. The study is available online in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology \u25cf Biology \u25cf Physics, the flagship journal of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO).\n\nWith brachytherapy, also known as internal radiation therapy (RT), implants are surgically inserted in or near cancerous tissue to deliver a curative radiation dose directly to the tumor while limiting exposure for surrounding healthy tissue. Reducing this exposure is of particular concern for treating tumors in the prostate, which is surrounded by multiple critical structures. In contrast to low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy, where radioactive seed implants are placed permanently in the body and gradually deposit low levels of radiation over a period of months, HDR treatments deposit the dose in one treatment, after which the radioactive implant is removed from the patient.\n\nTypically, HDR brachytherapy is administered in four to as many as nine treatment sessions, which generally requires multiple invasive procedures to insert the implants. While the number of sessions can be streamlined by increasing the dose given in each session, data on the safety and tolerability of highly escalated brachytherapy doses are still relatively new and therefore limited. In this study, researchers found that patients who received a single fraction of 19 Gy HDR brachytherapy experienced similar clinical outcomes as with LDR brachytherapy, but with the convenience of a single visit.\n\n\u201cIt is becoming apparent that patients may be treated definitively for their prostate cancer in as little as a single day with a minimally invasive outpatient procedure,\u201d said lead study author Daniel J. Krauss, MD, a radiation oncologist at Oakland University\u2019s William Beaumont School of Medicine in Royal Oak, Michigan. \u201cWe found that patients generally can resume normal activities the following day with typical side effects.\u201d\n\nThe study, which appeared in the Red Journal\u2019s January 2017 issue, presented the results of a nonrandomized, prospective clinical trial of 58 patients with low- or intermediate-risk (non-metastatic) prostate cancer, with a median follow-up period of 2.9 years. All patients received a single, 19 Gy fraction of HDR brachytherapy. The median patient age was 63 years (range 43-73), and 91 percent of the patients presented with stage T1 disease.\n\nAt an average of nearly three years following treatment, cancer control rates were favorable and the toxicity profile was highly favorable. Three patients experienced recurrence or progression, yielding an estimated three-year cumulative biochemical control rate of 93 percent. Within the six months following HDR therapy, seven patients (12.1%) experienced grade 2 urinary side effects, most commonly frequency/urgency (6.9%). No patients experienced short-term grade 3+ urinary toxicity or grade 2+ gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Rates were similarly modest for long-term side effects. Six patients (10.3%) experienced chronic grade 2 urinary toxicity and one patient (1.7%) experienced grade 3 chronic GI toxicity that subsequently resolved. No patients experienced long-term grade 3+ urinary toxicity or grade 4 GI toxicity.\n\n\u201cThis study illustrates that a potentially curative dose of radiation may be delivered safely to the prostate entirely in a single administration,\u201d said Dr. Krauss. \u201cGiving the entire dose in a single treatment theoretically could have had a greater negative impact on the normal tissues in close proximity to the prostate\u2014meaning the bladder, urethra and rectum\u2014but this was not found to be the case. Toxicity rates were extremely low, with essentially no major complications encountered in this initial group of 58 patients.\u201d\n\nWhile findings highlight the potential tolerability of a single fraction of HDR brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer, the article also emphasizes the need for additional follow-up to compare long-term cancer control rates with conventional treatment approaches, which generally administer larger cumulative doses than the 19 Gy dose used in this trial.\n\n\u201cAs the follow-up interval lengthens, 19 Gy dosing in a single fraction may or may not be sufficient to result in cure rates comparable to historical standards. One thing that this study has made clear, however, is that the extremely low toxicity and complication rates leave room to escalate the single fraction dose in subsequent trials,\u201d said Dr. Krauss. \u201cWhile additional study and longer follow-up are necessary to confirm the optimal dose for single-fraction HDR brachytherapy, we are optimistic that the single-treatment approach can eventually become a standard practice for prostate cancer treatment.\u201d\n\nFor more information or a copy of the full study, contact ASTRO\u2019s media relations team at press@astro.org.

Honey also beat out no treatment at all.\n\n\"(Honey) is a cheap and effective treatment,\" said Dr. Ian Paul, lead investigator for the study. \"Consider using this as a treatment before going to the pharmacy to pick up an over-the-counter cough and cold medicine.\"\n\nHoney has long been used by some parents as an alternative treatment for cough, although it should not be given to children under 1 year old.\n\nThe study comes at a time when parents are on the lookout for new ways to give sick children relief. A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended last month that children under the age of 6 not be given over-the-counter cough and cold medicines.\n\nFor the study, 105 children ages 2-18 with upper respiratory tract infections that kept them awake at night were given either a dose of buckwheat honey, honey-flavored cough syrup or no treatment half an hour before bedtime.\n\nOne dose measured one-half teaspoon for children aged 2-5, one teaspoon for children aged 6-11 and two teaspoons for children aged 12-18.\n\nParents of the 35 children who received honey, given either on its own or with a non-caffeinated drink, reported they coughed less and slept better than those who gave their children nothing. The group that used honey also reported more favorable results than those who used cough syrup, but since the study group was small, those differences weren't statistically significant.\n\nOne local pediatrician said she wouldn't discourage parents from trying honey with their children, but more studies are needed to draw solid conclusions.\n\n\"In older children, if it makes them comfortable and it helps them sleep at night, then there may be a potential benefit,\" said Dr. Sara Rizvi, assistant professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine who also works at a primary care clinic at Texas Children's Hospital. \"I would be reluctant to routinely recommend to all parents that they give honey, because in some rare cases children can have reactions to honey.\"\n\nPaul, a pediatrician who practices at Penn State Children's Hospital and teaches at the university's College of Medicine, said he began the study because he was frustrated no treatment had been proven beneficial to relieve the common children's cough. Several years ago, he led another study that showed over-the-counter cough medicine was no more effective than placebos.\n\nHoney is not only cheap and readily available, it's also generally safer than cough medicine, which can have side effects or be administered in the wrong dose.\n\nHoney should not, however, be given to children under the age of 1 because it sometimes contains a bacteria that causes botulism, a rare paralytic illness that can result in death. Unlike older children, infants can't fight the bacteria.\n\nPaul's group tested buckwheat honey instead of the lighter, more popular varieties because it's known to have more antioxidant and antimicrobial effects, which have been shown in other studies to help wounds heal. Honey may suppress cough because its sweetness causes salivation that coats the throat, authors of the study suggested.\n\n\"It's kind of amazing that something so simple could be an answer,\" Paul said.\n\nThe study was paid for by the National Honey Board, an industry-funded agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Delays like this result not only in the failure to diagnose and treat Ebola-infected patients, but also in individuals without Ebola being admitted to holding units where they may be subsequently infected with the virus,\" [1] explains Dr Nira Pollock, senior author and Associate Medical Director of the Infectious Diseases Diagnostic Laboratory at the Boston Children's Hospital, USA.\n\n\"This new test, on the other hand, is capable of detecting the Ebola virus in just a small drop of blood tested at the bedside, and could help us in the fight against Ebola.\" [1]\n\nIn this study, the researchers compared the diagnostic accuracy of the new RDT against the benchmark RT-PCR test (altona Diagnostics) being used for clinical diagnosis in the field reference laboratory run by Public Health England at Port Loko in Sierra Leone.\n\n106 suspected Ebola patients admitted to two treatment centres in Sierra Leone (run by the Ministry of Health and Sanitation of Sierra Leone and supported by the non-governmental organisation Partners In Health) during February 2015 were tested by both RDT (performed on a fingerstick blood sample at the point-of-care) and by standard RT-PCR (performed on plasma in the laboratory). Both RDT (on whole blood) and RT-PCR (on plasma) were also performed on 284 samples in the laboratory.\n\nThe RDT detected all confirmed cases of EVD that were positive by RT-PCR in both point-of-care (28/105 patients) and laboratory testing (45/277 patients), with sensitivity of 100% (identifying all patients with EVD as per the benchmark method), and a specificity of 92% (identifying patients who didn't have EVD).\n\nSurprisingly, the findings also revealed that the standard altona RT-PCR test, under the conditions deployed in the field, was itself an imperfect reference standard. The altona RT-PCR assay failed to detect a small number of EVD cases that tested positive by both RDT and by an alternative RT-PCR test (Trombley), all with relatively low amounts of virus. Both the RDT and altona assays failed to detect a small number of EVD cases that tested positive by the Trombley test, all with very low amounts of virus. The authors caution that given the limitations of the performance of the altona RT-PCR reference test in patients with low levels of the virus in their blood, more research is needed to assess how the new RDT will perform in patients very early in the course of EVD.\n\nAccording to co-author Dr Jana Broadhurst from Partners In Health, Boston, USA, \"This test could have an immediate impact on patient care and infection control by reliably detecting patients well into their illness who are likely to be highly infectious. Earlier test results would improve triage of patients, enabling staff to focus on those most likely to have Ebola, and reducing the opportunity for infection of non-Ebola 'suspects'. Although the RDT requires refrigeration, this is already available in many health centres in endemic areas, particularly those that store vaccines and other medical products.\" [1]\n\nWriting in a linked Comment, Dr Nahid Bhadelia from Boston University School of Medicine and Boston Medical Center, Boston, USA says, \"[This study] validates the accuracy of the ReEBOV RDT in patients who are well into their illness...suggesting it could be used to triage this subset of patients if RT-PCR is not available, particularly in those with a high index of clinical suspicion for a differential diagnosis...the data presented provide crucial information about the point of-care function of this rapid diagnostic test, such as ease of use, quality of samples taken at the bedside, and the concordance with venous samples...the results raise caution regarding the performance of the widely used altona RT-PCR assay, which the authors suggest might have underperformed because of laboratory specific technical and performance factors.\"\n\nThis study was funded by a gift from the Abundance Foundation (Stephen Kahn).

University of Pennsylvania researchers Rebecca Ashare and Heath Schmidt saw potential for a permanent cessation solution in a class of FDA-approved medications used to improve cognitive impairments from Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn a study consisting of a rat trial and a human trial, Ashare and Schmidt studied the effects of two acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, or AChEIs, called galantamine and donepezil on overall nicotine intake. The rat component showed that pretreating the rodents with an AChEI decreased their nicotine consumption. Consistent with these effects, clinical trial participants taking the AChEI, not the placebo, smoked 2.3 fewer cigarettes daily, a 12 percent decrease, and noted feeling less satisfied with the cigarettes they did smoke.\n\n\"We're very interested in screening potential efficacy of anti-addiction medications in our models,\" said Schmidt, a professor in Penn's School of Nursing and Perelman School of Medicine. \"For this study, we looked at potential smoking-cessation medications.\"\n\nThe research itself took a translational approach, what Ashare, a professor in Penn Medicine's psychiatry department, calls bi-directional. In other words, the preclinical data informed the clinical study and vice versa.\n\nAt Penn's Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Nicotine Addiction, work on smoking cessation has been ongoing since 2001. Specifically, research from Caryn Lerman, CIRNA's director and the Mary W. Calkins Professor in Psychiatry, concluded that people who quit smoking often report a decrease in what's commonly called their executive functions.\n\n\"They feel fuzzy. They're forgetful,\" Ashare said. \"Those deficits are related to their ability to quit smoking. It was this clinical aspect of smoking cessation we thought would be useful to take further.\"\n\nThat's when they turned to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.\n\nIn the brain, the neurotransmitter called acetylcholine is important to cognitive functions like learning and short-term memory. When nicotine enters the body, it binds to the same receptors in the brain that acetylcholine binds to, resulting in smoking's rewarding and reinforcement effects. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors increase acetylcholine levels in the brain and, in effect, substitute nicotine's effects.\n\nSchmidt had successfully employed such a model with other addictive substances like cocaine. He divided a group of rats into galantamine and donepezil cohorts. To mirror voluntary drug taking in humans, the rats self-administered nicotine using a lever pushed at will. Once nicotine-taking stabilized, the rats were pretreated with one of the two AChEIs.\n\nFor both drugs, \"we were able to show a reduction in total nicotine self-administered,\" Schmidt said; however, there was a caveat.\n\n\"We know from the literature that upward of 30 percent of patients will report nausea and vomiting [when taking these drugs], and this will limit their compliance,\" he said. \"We had seen that these drugs reduced nicotine self-administration, but we wanted to make sure it wasn't because the rats were sick.\"\n\nUnlike humans who can verbally report when they don't feel well and whose bodies react to nausea, rats lack the reflex to vomit. In previous research, Matthew Hayes, who has appointments in Penn Medicine and Penn Nursing, had shown that in rats kaolin clay consumption coats the stomach like an antacid and quells any ill effects. Collaborating with Hayes, Schmidt offered the animals kaolin clay, then compared how much they ate normally and with the addition of the AChEIs.\n\n\"At the doses shown to reduce nicotine self-administration, the AChEIs did not make our animals sick,\" Schmidt said. The findings sparked the CIRNA clinical trial, which has to date studied 33 smokers ages 18 to 60.\n\nPeople who were interested in quitting smoking signed on for 23 days. For the first two weeks, they continued to smoke but also took either galantamine or a placebo. Before the trial began, researchers assessed the smokers' cognitive function to get a baseline. Participants followed the regimen for two weeks and then were asked to not smoke for one full day. Two more assessments took place: after the two weeks on the cigarette-drug combination and again after that initial smoke-free day. Finally, the researchers asked the study subjects to do their best to not smoke for seven straight days, a time during which the participants still took either galantamine or a placebo.\n\n\"That week-long period is a proxy for longer-term cessation. The ability to quit smoking the first week after you make a quit attempt is highly predictive of long-term success,\" Ashare said.\n\nShe's still actively recruiting for the trial, with an aim of 80 people total. Once the trial reaches that number, she'll dig into overall quit data. What she's learned so far -- that smokers who used the FDA-approved galantamine smoked fewer cigarettes per day and enjoyed them less -- is promising, particularly given that those who don't smoke during that first crucial week are 32 times more likely to quit smoking permanently.\n\n\"Our goal in investigating these different repurposed medications is not to replace the medications that are already available,\" she said. \"We know that they're effective. Our goal is to target different populations of smokers who may be more likely to experience these cognitive deficits.\"\n\nThere's no data to suggest that a clinician treating a smoker should prescribe one of these AChEIs now. But Ashare and Schmidt are forging a path, and, if it leads where they think it might, it could provide smokers yet another option to help them quit.\n\nAshare and Schmidt published their work in the Nature journal Translational Psychiatry.", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "There was no reliance on unjustifiable language.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The two syndromes differ, though, in their constellation of symptoms. For example, psoriatic arthritis manifests most often in the lower extremities and is associated with the autoimmune skin condition called psoriasis, in which raised red, scaly patches appear on the skin. Although psoriatic rashes most often precede the onset of the arthritic stage, the reverse can also be the case.\n\nThree of the 10 top-selling drugs in the United States in dollar sales \u2014 adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab \u2014 are biologics prescribed for psoriatic arthritis as well as for the more common rheumatoid arthritis. These three drugs share a common property: They block the action of a pro-inflammatory substance called tumor necrosis factor. Secreted by various immune cells, TNF stimulates the immune response and accompanying inflammation.\n\nHowever, despite the availability of TNF inhibitors, \u201conly about half of psoriatic arthritis patients who are given TNF inhibitors get better,\u201d said Genovese.\n\nAlthough the ultimate cause of the disease remains unknown, there was a good clinical rationale for hoping it might be responsive to ixekizumab. For the last decade or so, Genovese said, another pro-inflammatory substance called IL-17 has been drawing the attention of immunologists focusing on psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.\n\nIxekizumab works by blocking IL-17. The drug, an injectable monoclonal antibody, is already commercially available for the treatment of psoriasis, for which it has been remarkably effective, said Genovese. And in an earlier Lilly-sponsored phase-3 trial, ixekizumab was shown to be effective for psoriatic arthritis patients who had not yet been treated with biologic drugs such as TNF inhibitors. (Another approved monoclonal-antibody that targets IL-17, secukinumab, was approved in 2016 for psoriatic arthritis.)\n\nOver the 24-week duration of the latest trial, 109 participants received ixekizumab every two weeks; 94 received placebo injections every two weeks; and 111 alternated every two weeks between getting injections of ixekizumab and the placebo. While 19.5 percent of patients who received only the placebo injections were judged to have met the trial\u2019s specified clinical endpoint \u2014 at least a 20 percent reduction in the number of tender and swollen joints \u2014 the response rate among those getting the real drug every four weeks was 53.3 percent. Those getting the drug every two weeks didn\u2019t do any better and were slightly more prone to side effects, such as a mild reaction at the injection site.\n\nAlthough any treatment that works by blocking the immune system\u2019s ability to mount an inflammatory response should be carefully monitored for its potential to render the body vulnerable to infectious disease, there were few observed differences in this category between recipients of placebo versus active drug given every four weeks, Genovese said.\n\nLilly has filed for approval of the drug by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

When the urge returns, out comes another slap.\n\n\n\nNow imagine those \"slaps\" occurring inside the brain, protecting you in moments of weakness.\n\nIn a report published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Stanford neuroscientists say they've achieved this sort of mind-reading in binge-eating mice. They found a telltale pattern of brain activity that comes up seconds before the animals start to pig out \u2014 and delivering a quick zap to that part of the brain kept the mice from overindulging.\n\nWhether this strategy could block harmful impulses in people remains unclear. For now the path seems promising. The current study used a brain stimulation device already approved for hard-to-treat epilepsy. And based on the new findings, a clinical trial testing this off-the-shelf system for some forms of obesity could start as early as next summer, says Casey Halpern, the study's leader and an assistant professor of neurosurgery at Stanford. He thinks the approach could also work for eating disorders and a range of other addictive or potentially life-threatening urges.\n\nAs a physician-researcher, Halpern specializes in deep brain stimulation (DBS), a surgical treatment in which battery-powered implants send electrical pulses to brain areas where signals go awry.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has approved DBS therapy for movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, tremor and dystonia \u2014 usually in people who haven't responded well to medications. Occasionally DBS is a last-resort treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\n\nAnother study published Monday in PNAS suggests that DBS could help boost memory and other research is exploring its use for substance abuse and other reward-seeking behaviors.\n\nYears ago, the Stanford team developed a mouse model to test if DBS could curb overeating. Granted, mice don't normally gorge themselves. Yet if offered fattier, tastier chow each day for just an hour, within 10 days the mice realize if they \"don't eat this now, that guy's coming back to take it away,\" Halpern says. So the animals learn to binge.\n\nBut when the researchers applied DBS stimulation to a part of the brain's reward circuit known as the nucleus accumbens, the mice quit stuffing themselves.\n\nTrouble is, the moderation wore off in a few days, and the DBS also interfered with the animals' social behavior. That got Halpern thinking about a newer system \u2014 one that doesn't stimulate continuously, like DBS, but switches on briefly only after sensing a trouble signal, much like a pacemaker monitors and responds to abnormal heart rhythms.\n\nIn 2013, the FDA approved a newer-generation device, known as a responsive neurostimulation system (RNS), that does just that. Implanted within the brain, it senses early epileptic seizures and slows their spread with small zaps to the onset area. The RNS system costs around $40,000. But with medical devices, Halpern says, hospitals pay for the hardware and insurance companies often cover the surgery, if clinical trial data are good and the treatment is FDA approved. In the current study, Halpern and coworkers tested the RNS device in the binging mice.\n\nFirst, they looked for a biomarker \u2014 an electrical blip that appears in the brain just before the animal reaches for fatty food. Next, the researchers programmed the stimulator to deliver a 10-second pulse whenever it detects this biomarker. They rigged some mice to this intermittent stimulator. For comparison, other animals got continuous DBS stimulation or random pulses.\n\nThe intermittent system controlled overeating much better than the continuous or random protocols \u2014 and nearly as well as in a separate group of mice that got zapped manually by a researcher watching their behavior on video. Plus, the treatment seemed specific to the food addiction. It did not affect anticipation associated with normal behaviors such as meeting a new mouse.\n\nThe results point to a real-time biomarker for impulsive behavior, says Dennis Turner, a Duke University neurosurgeon who was not involved in the study but wrote an October review about ongoing research on a range of potential brain stimulation biomarkers. \"That's the clear novelty.\"\n\nFiguring out if this biomarker would also work in people is challenging. Few are willing to undergo brain surgery for the purpose of research. But Halpern had a rare opportunity. One of his patients developed OCD so debilitating that he opted for DBS. He agreed to have his brain recorded during the surgery. Since food isn't allowed in the operating room, the researchers monitored the patient's brain as he anticipated payoffs in a computerized money-making task. As reported in the PNAS paper, the characteristic anticipatory signal appeared when he expected to make $5 but not for smaller sums, suggesting some level of specificity.\n\nOf course, it's hard to conclude much from a single subject. But from other research \"we know it's safe to place an electrode in the nucleus accumbens, it's safe to stimulate it electrically, and we expect to be able to tune [the electrode] as we already do with DBS. So it seems like a nice opportunity,\" says Halpern, noting that addictive disorders haven't had new therapies for decades. \"I'm motivated by the clinical need.\"\n\nEsther Landhuis is a freelance science journalist in the San Francisco Bay Area.

The NHS, however, needs to get the support of surgeons, many of whom rarely carry out the less invasive procedure.\n\nPartial replacements, also known as unicompartmental replacements, are suitable for people who have arthritis in just one side of the knee, usually the inner. They can be carried out with a smaller incision using minimally invasive surgery, but they are only suitable for people whose ligaments inside the knee are strong.\n\n\n\nResearchers from the Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS) publishing in the BMJ Open journal found that the less invasive procedure was being used less than it could be.\n\nThe main reason for the surgery is osteoarthritis.

Porteus noted in his editorial that the hemophilia therapy resulted in savings of about $200,000 a year per patient because of the elimination of clotting-factor infusions.\n\nOther experts also were impressed by the results. The hemophilia study \u201cis small but very promising, and it gives me the sense that gene therapy for hemophilia B is going to be at our disposal in no time, maybe a few years from now,\u201d said Aric Parnes, who is associate director of the Boston Hemophilia Center at the Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center and wasn't involved in the study. \u201cOne of the key things is, how long will the treatment last? Does it wane over time? So far, with a full year, it doesn\u2019t look like that is happening.\u201d\n\nLindsey George, the lead investigator and a hematologist at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said that nine of the 10 men in the trial didn't experience any bleeding episodes after the gene therapy treatment. The one patient who needed clotting factor because of bleeding used 91 percent less than before, she said.\n\n\u201cPeople were planning their lives around hemophilia, and now they are doing activities that they weren't before,\u201d George said. \u201cOne man who came in a wheelchair is now out of a wheelchair and is coaching Little League.\u201d\n\nPeople with hemophilia B inherit a gene mutation on the X chromosome that interferes with their ability to produce normal levels of blood-clotting factor IX. (Because women have two copies of the X chromosomes, the other one can compensate, so they may carry the disease but not suffer from it.) Bleeding episodes \u2014 which can result from injury or occur spontaneously \u2014 can cause extensive damage and be life threatening.\n\nThe therapy developed by Spark, a biotech company spun off from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in 2013, involves a bioengineered gene designed to prompt the body to produce increased levels of a different clotting factor. The gene is transported to the liver, where clotting factor is made, by a harmless virus called an adeno-associated viral vector. For the current trial, which is being funded by Spark and Pfizer, researchers used a clotting factor that is 8 to 10 times as strong as the normal version. The stronger factor is called Factor IX-Padua, because it was discovered in 2009 in an Italian family.\n\nPatients produced clotting-factor levels that were enough to allow blood to clot but not to spur an undesirable immune-system response, the researchers said.\n\nFDA advisers urge approval for first gene therapy for inherited disease\n\nIn a first, scientists edit genes inside a man's body to try to cure a disease.

Over time, taste and smell abnormalities (TSA) can lead to a loss of appetite and anorexic behaviors, compromising patients' ability to recuperate from the disease.\n\nIn a new paper published in the journal Food & Function, Virginia Tech College of Agriculture and Life Sciences researchers Susan Duncan and Aili Wang investigated the feasibility of lactoferrin, a highly bioactive protein found in saliva and milk, as a treatment for TSA. Their findings could bring relief to millions of patients undergoing cancer treatment.\n\n\"The underlying molecular mechanisms of TSA are not well-understood,\" said Duncan, associate director of the Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station and a professor in the Department of Food Science and Technology. \"The prevailing symptom described by patients undergoing chemotherapy is a persistent metallic flavor or aftertaste, with or without food intake.

The data was presented at the American Surgical Association annual meeting in San Diego. Locally advanced pancreatic cancer is Stage III cancer that has not yet spread.\n\nPancreatic cancer has one of the highest mortality rates of all cancers and is expected to climb from the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the U.S. to the second by 2020. Ninety four percent of pancreatic cancer patients will die within five years of diagnosis, and 74% of patients die within the first year of diagnosis.\n\n\"The STAR data adds to the growing body of evidence that IRE ablation may represent a new treatment paradigm for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer,\" said Robert Martin, M.D., Ph.D., F.A.C.S., director of the Division of Surgical Oncology, and Professor, Department of Surgery, University of Louisville, James Graham Brown Cancer Center. \"This new analysis of IRE could help change the standard of care for Stage III pancreatic cancer patients whose only treatment options until now were chemotherapy or a combination of chemo-radiation therapy, which will only stabilize the disease and not destroy the tumor. With IRE, these patients now have a surgical treatment option to augment their treatment plan.\"\n\nThe NanoKnife\u00ae IRE system is a tool that destroys cancerous cells by subjecting them to a series of short electrical pulses using high-voltage direct current that does not injure surrounding cells, blood vessels and other vital structures. IRE overcomes rapid growth of the tumor by killing all malignant cells at once so they cannot continue to grow and spread. The NanoKnife\u00ae IRE system is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the surgical ablation of soft tissue. It is not approved for use in specific cancers.\n\nSTAR was a retrospective analysis of IRE performed on 200 consecutive patients diagnosed with locally advanced (Stage III) pancreatic cancer (LAPC) at six centers in the U.S. The centers that collaborated on the study included University of Louisville, Louisville, KY; Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI; Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH; Piedmont Hospital, Atlanta, GA; Swedish Medical Center, Denver, CO; and Cancer Treatment Centers of America, Atlanta, GA.\n\nFrom July 2010 to October 2014, patients with radiographic Stage III LAPC were treated with IRE and monitored under a multicenter, prospective IRB-approved registry. Perioperative 90-day outcomes, local failure, and overall survival were recorded and compared to standard of care data for Stage III LAPC. All patients underwent induction chemotherapy with 52 percent receiving chemo-radiation, for a median of 7 months (range, 5-13) prior to IRE. IRE was successfully administered to all patients. Nineteen percent sustained complications with a median grade of 2 (range 1-3). Median length of stay was 6 days (range, 4-58) with a median follow-up of 25 months. Six patients (3%) had local recurrence. Median overall survival in both groups was 23.5 months.\n\nAbout the University of Louisville Physicians Group and The James Graham Brown Cancer Center:\n\nThe James Graham Brown Cancer Center is a key component of the University of Louisville Health Sciences Center.

Standard stroke treatment relies on powerful blood-thinning medications that break up the clot and restore blood flow to the brain.\n\nBut when those drugs don't work, doctors now can turn to a new catheter-based device that will physically remove the blood clot, said Dr. William Powers, lead author of the updated AHA guidelines and chair of neurology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nThe tool, called an endovascular stent retrieval device, is made up of wire mesh that resembles a tiny ring of chicken wire, Powers said.\n\nSkilled surgeons run the device up through a person's arteries via a catheter, and then open it smack in the middle of a stroke-causing blood clot.\n\n\"If you actually deploy or open one in the middle of a clot, it smooshes out and the clot gets caught in the chicken wire, and then you pull the whole thing out back through the artery,\" Powers said.\n\nThe new guidelines were published June 29 in the journal Stroke.\n\nThe AHA issued its updated guidelines based primarily on the results of six new clinical trials released within the past eight months, Powers said. All of these studies showed that the device can safely and effectively stop a stroke by removing blood clots, he added.\n\nA number of other medical societies have endorsed the AHA's new guidelines, including the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and the Society of Vascular and Interventional Neurology.\n\nAs with other stroke treatments, time is of the essence. The procedure must start within six hours of the onset of a stroke, which means that emergency teams and hospitals will have to move fast, Powers said.\n\nThe guidelines provide added incentive to quickly transfer stroke victims from a local hospital to a major stroke center capable of advanced treatment, said Powers and Dr. David Kandzari, director of interventional cardiology and chief scientific officer for the Piedmont Heart Institute in Atlanta.\n\nLocal hospitals currently are urged to \"drip and ship\" people experiencing a major stroke -- essentially, start an IV drip of the powerful clot-busting drug called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and then ship them by ambulance or helicopter to the nearest comprehensive stroke center for further treatment, Kandzari said.\n\nStent retrieval devices make that quick hospital transfer even more important, since the gadgets provide a crucial backup for tPA but are more tricky to use.\n\n\"These are procedures performed by very specialized individuals,\" Kandzari said. \"They are not regularly performed by cardiologists or radiologists or neurologists. Hospitals must make plans to get people to other centers that are capable of this catheter-based therapy,\" he explained.\n\nPowers said, \"I think what's going to happen is that we will develop systems of rapid triage and rapid transport. A lot of this at this point depends on logistics and manpower. The people who do this are specially trained. You need a lot of special training to get those catheters up into the brain and pull things out.\"\n\nThe guidelines specifically recommend using a stent retrieval device for people who:\n\u2022 Didn't have any significant disability prior to their current stroke.\n\u2022 Received tPA within 4.5 hours of their stroke onset, and can start the procedure within six hours after stroke symptoms started.\n\u2022 Are at least 18 years old, as clinical trials have not been conducted with children.\n\u2022 Have imaging scans that show more than half of the brain on the side of the stroke is not permanently damaged.\n\u2022 Have a clot blocking a large artery supplying blood to the brain.\n\nThat last point is especially important, because the stent retrieval device will not fit into the smaller blood vessels that branch out further into the brain, Powers said.\n\nThe major risk of using the device is that it could tear an artery and cause bleeding in the brain, particularly since it will be used on people who have already received very potent blood thinners, Kandzari said.\n\nBut clinical trials have shown that the risk of brain bleeding for people who received tPA and then went through mechanical clot removal is no greater than for people who just receive the blood thinner, Powers said.\n\n\"The outcomes were uniformly positive in all of the trials,\" he said. \"It's really, really good evidence.\"\n\nFor more about stroke, visit the National Stroke Association.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story quotes the author of the guidelines, and one other expert who is not an author.

But tailoring those guidelines to better fit individuals could prevent many more heart attacks and strokes, say developers of a computer model that makes those calculations.\n\nTheir study, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, estimated the effects of using \u201cindividualized guidelines\u201d to make decisions on treating high blood pressure.\n\nIt found that the tailored approach could prevent 43 percent more heart attacks and strokes than the simpler, general recommendations used now.\n\nCurrently, U.S. guidelines recommend treatment if blood pressure rises above 140/90 mm Hg, or above 130/80 mm Hg if a person has diabetes or chronic kidney disease.\n\nDoctors generally add their own judgment to that decision as well. If, for instance, a person has slightly elevated blood pressure but is otherwise at low risk for heart problems, then lifestyle changes might be enough.\n\nBut the new study looked at a more sophisticated way of estimating individual patients\u2019 needs. Researchers used a computer-based \u201crisk calculator\u201d that took into account a person\u2019s age, cholesterol levels, family history of heart disease and any diabetes diagnosis.\n\nIt also factored in what\u2019s known about different types of patients\u2019 responses to various blood pressure medications.\n\nThe researchers then used data from a long-term study of 15,800 Americans to estimate the effects of applying the individualized guidelines.\n\nOverall, they found, the tailored method could prevent 43 percent more heart attacks and strokes than national guidelines, if healthcare costs were kept the same.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the number of heart attacks and strokes prevented were kept the same, the individualized guidelines would accomplish that result at a 67 percent cost savings versus the national guidelines.\n\nThe goal of using the risk calculator \u201cis the same as the physician\u2019s desire to take into account the \u2018whole patient\u2019 when discussing treatment options with patients,\u201d said lead researcher Dr. David M. Eddy.\n\nThe problem with the old-fashioned way, he told Reuters Health in an email, is that there are many pieces of information about a patient to consider.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible for the human brain to digest it all and estimate accurately the patient\u2019s risks or how they would benefit from treatments,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Eddy, risk calculators like the one in the study could, eventually, help doctors give patients real numbers. A doctor might tell you, for example, what your risk is of developing diabetes in the next 20 years, and how much you could cut that risk if you lose a certain amount of weight (and keep it off).\n\nEddy is a founder of Archimedes, Inc., a San Francisco-based company that has developed a computer-based mathematical model to aid in healthcare decisions. The calculator used in this study is a simplified version of that model.\n\nEddy said that the calculator, or others like it, could be integrated into electronic health records. A patient\u2019s information could be automatically fed to the calculator, and the results would then be displayed on a computer for the doctor and patient to discuss.\n\nA researcher not involved in the work said it was a \u201cnice study\u201d that is a first step toward showing that tailored guidelines could have benefits.\n\n\u201cThis shows that there might be better ways for physicians to choose who gets treated and who does not,\u201d said Dr. Douglas K. Owens of the VA Palo Alto Health Care System in California, who wrote an editorial published with the study.\n\nGeneral guidelines, like those for treating high blood pressure, are kept fairly simple so they are easy to remember, Owens told Reuters Health in an interview. Doctors, ideally, then adapt those guidelines to individual patients\u2019 situations.\n\nHowever, Owens said, \u201cit\u2019s hard to do all of that in your head. This gives them a tool.\u201d\n\nNow the looming questions are how to implement risk calculators in doctors\u2019 practices \u2014 and, Owens said, whether that benefits patients\u2019 health in the real world.\n\n\u201cThe general theme is that we can do better, and we may have an opportunity to improve patients\u2019 health outcomes,\u201d Owens said. \u201cThat\u2019s the hope.\u201d\n\nHe said he thinks electronic health records will be key to putting individualized guidelines into practice.\n\nAnd right now, there is a way to go before most doctors will have those systems in place.\n\nA recent government survey found that the percentage of U.S. doctors using electronic health records is on the rise, but still fairly low.\n\nAbout one-quarter of surveyed doctors said they had \u201cbasic\u201d electronic medical record systems in their offices. Only about 10 percent had a \u201cfully functional\u201d system that included extensive information on patients\u2019 medical history.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "It\u2019s clear that the story did not rely solely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "TUESDAY, Feb. 23, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- A popular nutritional supplement -- extract of bitter melon -- may help protect women from breast cancer, researchers say.\n\nBitter melon is a common vegetable in India, China and South America, and its extract is used in folk remedies for diabetes because of its blood-sugar lowering capabilities, according to the researchers.\n\n\"When we used the extract from that melon, we saw that it kills the breast cancer cells,\" said lead researcher Ratna Ray, a professor of pathology at Saint Louis University.
