[{"article": "Two personalized cancer vaccines have been found to be safe and effective at treating people with melanoma, scientists have announced.\n\nCancer vaccines that are personalized to the patient\u2014designed to help the immune system identify tumors as foreign bodies and destroy them\u2014have been considered as a potential treatment for a number of years. But working out the unique mutations of each person\u2019s cancer, a time-consuming and complicated process, must first be identified before a vaccine can be developed for them.\n\nIn two studies published in the journal Nature, researchers have shown promising results from Phase I clinical trials. While they are very small scale\u2014one was on six participants, the other 13\u2014the findings mean researchers can move ahead with the vaccines, which could potentially lead to new, more effective cancer treatments.\n\nIn the first study, scientists led by Catherine Wu developed a vaccine for people who had been treated for melanoma with surgery, but who had received no other treatment. They sequenced the DNA from the tumors then created a personalized vaccine that contained neoantigens (targets for the immune response) for predicted mutations.\n\nSix patients were given a full series of vaccinations, including five priming injections and two booster vaccinations. Four of the six had no recurrence of the disease after 25 months.\n\nIn the other study, by Ugur Sahin and colleagues, tested a personalized vaccine based on RNA (an essential link in the production of proteins encoded by DNA). They used a similar approach to Wu and her team to identify the mutations, then tested the vaccine on 13 people who were being treated for melanoma. All participants were found to have a boosted immunity against the antigens specific to their tumors. Eight were still tumor free after 23 months.\n\nBoth vaccines were deemed safe and are expected to be taken forward for further research.\n\nThese vaccines are not necessarily the future of personalized cancer treatment. Cornelius Melief, from the Leiden University Medical Center, Netherlands, said in an accompanying News & Views article that controlled, randomized Phase II clinical trials will be needed to work out if the vaccines are effective. He added, however, that the studies confirm the potential of cancer vaccines.\n\nElizabeth Williams, from the School of Biomedical Sciences at Queensland University of Technology, tells Newsweek the two studies \u201cdescribe tantalizing complementary and consistent results in Phase 1 trials in melanoma patients using vaccines.\"\n\n\"The vaccines are personalized for each individual\u2019s tumours by harnessing technologies that enable the comprehensive analysis of the molecular fingerprint of the tumour,\u201d she says. \u201cThe data shows that it is a safe and well tolerated strategy that stimulates relevant anti-tumor immune responses.\u201d\n\nHowever, the treatment has its downsides: \u201cAs the vaccine therapies are designed and generated specifically for each individual there is a lag time from enrollment to commencement of treatment\u2014approximately four months\u2014which may be too long from some patients with advanced cancer. As technologies and processes continue improve this is likely to be reduced,\" she continues.\n\n\u201cIt is still unknown whether these vaccines will extend the survival of cancer patients, or whether they are more effective than other recently developed immunotherapies. Additional clinical trials will be required to determine the utility of these individualised neoepitope vaccines.\u201d\n\nCatherine Pickworth, science communication officer at Cancer Research UK said: \u201cThe promising results from these two small, early-stage studies show that personalized cancer vaccines designed to treat skin cancer are safe to use, and that for some patients, they can successfully harness the power of the body\u2019s own immune system to kill cancer cells. The next step will be to test these personalized vaccines in larger clinical trials to see if they are better than existing treatments, if they improve survival, and what their long-term side effects could be.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "We give the story credit for making an important point that waiting for the vaccine to be made might be detrimental to patients with advanced cancer.

Most of those trials were funded and run by the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture Prozac and Effexor \u2014 Eli Lilly and Wyeth, respectively.\n\nThey included 12 studies of Prozac in adults and four each in elderly patients and youth, as well as 21 trials of immediate- or extended-release Effexor in adults. About 9,000 participants were included.\n\nMore adults and kids taking Prozac, known generically as fluoxetine, had at least a 50 percent improvement in scores on depression tests after six weeks compared to those assigned to take a placebo pill.\n\nFifty-five percent of adults on Prozac responded to treatment, compared to 34 percent in the placebo group. In youth, 30 percent on Prozac had significant symptom improvement, compared to just six percent of the comparisons.\n\nThe benefits were seen regardless of how severe patients\u2019 symptoms were before starting treatment.\n\nHowever, in the elderly the differences between the treatment and placebo groups were much smaller, and the researchers calculated that 17 older patients would have to be treated with Prozac for one to gain from it.\n\n\u201cClearly the efficacy of antidepressants is age-dependent, (and) largest, most interestingly, in youth, which I don\u2019t think would be the mainstream view in psychiatry,\u201d Gibbons told Reuters Health.\n\nThe findings, he added, \u201craise other questions that need to be followed up (including), what\u2019s going on in the elderly?\u201d\n\nBoth types of Effexor, or venlafaxine, also seemed to help adults with mild to severe depression, with slightly more patients responding to the immediate-release dose.\n\nSome of the study\u2019s authors have testified for or received funding from drug companies, though the report itself was funded by national health agencies.\n\nThe researchers said they couldn\u2019t be sure there would be similar improvements with other types of antidepressants \u2014 especially given the more limited data in kids and the elderly \u2014 or that the longer-term benefits would be as clear.\n\nOne recent study suggested that up to a fifth of patients on the antidepressant Cymbalta (duloxetine) might actually benefit more from placebo pills (see Reuters Health story of December 9, 2011.)\n\nIrving Kirsch, who studies antidepressants and placebos at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said the new report didn\u2019t make him more optimistic about the drugs.\n\nIf five or more patients need to be treated with an antidepressant for one to substantially improve, most don\u2019t get much out of it, he pointed out.\n\n\u201cMore than 80 percent of the patients are not getting a significant benefit from the drug \u2014 either they\u2019re not getting better or they would get the same benefit with placebo,\u201d he told Reuters Health.\n\n\u201cThere are alternative treatments for depression that also produce about the same symptom reduction as the drugs do, but without the risk of side effects,\u201d Kirsch added, including psychotherapy and exercise.\n\nStill, Gibbons said that the improvement in symptoms for the average patient wasn\u2019t insignificant.\n\n\u201cDefinitely it doesn\u2019t look like antidepressants are placebos,\u201d he concluded.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "There was at least the acknowledgement that these drugs do carry side effects \u2013 but none was specified nor quantified.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "A comparison between less-expensive, over-the-counter hearing assistance devices and a conventional hearing aid found that some of these devices were associated with improvements in hearing similar to the hearing aid, according to a study published by JAMA.\n\nPresently, hearing aids can only be purchased in the United States through a licensed professional, with an average cost of $4,700 for two hearing aids (uncovered by Medicare). According to nationally representative estimates, less than 20 percent of adults with hearing loss report hearing aid use.

It significantly raises the risk of stroke.\n\nPatients in the Medtronic-sponsored trial who underwent the cryoablation procedure \u2014 which involves using a catheter to freeze away the heart tissue where the problem originates \u2014 was just as safe as drugs used to treat the condition and far more effective, meeting the study\u2019s primary goal of eliminating atrial fibrillation one year after the procedure.\n\nDubbed Stop-af, the Medtronic trial showed that almost 70 percent of patients who had cryoablation remained free of the condition after one year, compared with just 7 percent of patients who received drug therapy, according to data presented at the American College of Cardiology meeting in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cThis is the best data we have at this point in support of cryoablation (to treat atrial fibrillation),\u201d said Dr. Douglas Packer of Mayo Clinic, the lead investigator of the study.\n\nOver 3 percent of patients treated by cryoablation experienced a serious condition \u2014 a narrowing of the pulmonary vein in 7 out of 228 patients, one of whom required another procedure to widen the vein.\n\nDamage or irritation to the nerve that controls the diaphragm was reported in 11 percent of the cryoablation procedures, but none of the cases was considered serious, with 98 percent resolved by the 12-month follow-up.\n\nComplications related to the atrial fibrillation itself were also monitored. During the follow-up period, 97 percent of patients who got the procedure and 92 percent of the drug therapy patients did not suffer heart attack, stroke or death.\n\nLess than 1 percent of patients treated with cryoablation were hospitalized for a recurrence of the disease, compared with 6 percent in the drug group.\n\nPatients in the pilot study had advanced atrial fibrillation and tended to have other medical problems, such as high blood pressure, diabetes or coronary artery disease,\n\nPacker, who also led the pilot study, dubbed Cabana, acknowledged that the main limitation of this study was its small size, but said it lays the foundation for a larger one.\n\nHe said the larger study, which will include 180 centers, is currently enrolling patients.\n\nAnti-arrhythmic drugs eliminate atrial fibrillation in about half of all patients but can have adverse side effects.\n\nCryoablation is an alternative that is growing in popularity. Over the past decade, more patients have been referred for ablation procedures when drugs proved ineffective.\n\nCatheter ablation involves inserting a thin tube into a blood vessel, usually through a site in the upper leg or neck, and then threading it though the body until it reaches the heart. When it reaches the area of the heart that causes abnormal rhythms, the tissue is ablated, or destroyed.\n\nThe procedure has been used to treat arrhythmias for years.

Kelly Nichols, O.D., Ph.D., a dry eye expert and dean of the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Optometry, conducted research studies for the parent drug company to explore the efficacy and safety of lifitegrast in treating this eye condition that affects more than 16 million adults in the United States.\n\nInflammation associated with dry eye may eventually lead to damage to the surface of the eye.\n\n\u201cDry eye is a common complaint to eye care professionals, with millions of U.S. adults experiencing the symptoms of this often chronic disease,\u201d Nichols said. \u201cIt is critical for eye care professionals to have a dialogue with patients who report symptoms because dry eye can be a progressive ocular surface disease.\u201d\n\nThe twice-daily eye drop solution of 5 percent lifitegrast ophthalmic solution is the only prescription eye drop indicated for the treatment of both signs and symptoms of dry eye, and it is the first new dry eye prescription drop approved in the last 13 years.\n\nNichols and a team of researchers studied 1,181 patients, of whom 1,067 received lifitegrast in four placebo-controlled 12-week trials. Signs and symptoms were assessed at baseline and at weeks two, six and 12.\n\nIn all four studies, eye dryness was significantly reduced, with two of the studies showing improvements at week two. Results from inferior corneal staining tests \u2014 used by physicians to detect abrasions on the cornea \u2014 showed improvement in three of the four studies.\n\nNichols continues to push for funding and advancement for dry eye research and treatment. Prior to FDA approval of the lifitegrast eye drop, Nichols presented a congressional briefing in Washington, D.C., addressing research into dry eye for the National Alliance for Eye and Vision Research. She focused on the cause and potential therapies for dry eye that are being funded through the National Eye Institute and in private industry.\n\nFocusing her research on all aspects of the eye, Nichols discussed the mechanics of the three layers of the tear film and the importance of each from the cornea outward:\n\u2022 Mucin layer: helps tears adhere to the eye\n\u2022 Aqueous layer or water layer: nourishes and protects the cornea\n\u2022 Lipid or oil layer: lubricates and prevents evaporation and provides smooth refractive surface needed for optimal vision\n\n\u201cWe are unsure which of the 200-plus different lipids and 500-plus unique proteins are most important for protecting and lubricating the eye, and the absence or insufficiency of which results in dry eye,\u201d Nichols said.\n\nThere are more than 30-plus new dry eye basic, translational and clinical studies being funded by the NEI/National Institutes of Health to further explore these lipids and proteins, with more than 50 papers being published monthly.\n\n\u201cFunding from NIH is helping the optometry world make significant strides in understanding the cause and treatment of dry eye,\u201d Nichols said. \u201cWe still have a long way to go, but prevention and early detection are major goals. There is hope for dry eye patients worldwide.\u201d\n\nDiagnosis of dry eye is identified by an eye care professional based on careful evaluation of signs and symptoms, including dryness, discomfort, vision changes and damage to the surface of the eye.

The balloons take up space in the stomach, which presumably makes people feel fuller faster, the FDA said in its announcement Tuesday.\n\nBut the device can only be used for six months at a time, and it is not likely to be an alternative for people who require lap-band surgery, stomach stapling or other forms of bariatric surgery, said Dr. Mitchell Roslin, chief of obesity surgery for Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\n\"It's going to be effective for short-term weight-loss,\" Roslin said, \"but there is still an overwhelming question whether these devices provide any long-term benefit for obesity.\"\n\n\"I don't think it's going to be part of the medical algorithm for treating obesity,\" he added. \"I think it's going to be for people who want to lose weight fairly rapidly.\"\n\nIn a clinical trial, the ReShape system helped people more than double their weight loss compared to those trying to lose weight through diet and exercise, an FDA news release said. That clinical trial was funded by the company that makes the ReShape system, according to a presentation from the Obesity Society annual meeting in Boston.\n\nThe device is available to obese people who often don't qualify for surgical weight-loss procedures, according to the FDA. Obese people who have a body-mass index (a rough estimate of body fat based on your height and weight) between 30 and 40 and at least one obesity-related health condition are eligible for the new procedure, the agency said. Obesity-related health conditions include high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol.\n\nIt's also intended for those who have been unsuccessful in trying to lose weight through diet and exercise alone, the agency said.\n\nDoctors insert the balloons through a scope snaked down the throat and into the stomach, and then fill them with saline containing a blue dye. It takes about eight minutes to place the balloons, and about 14 minutes to remove them, according to Dr. Jaime Ponce, medical director of the bariatric surgery program at Hamilton Medical Center in Dalton, Ga. Ponce was the principal investigator of the clinical trial on the ReShape system.\n\nThe device doesn't change the stomach's natural anatomy, according to the FDA. Patients are told to follow a medically supervised diet and exercise plan, to help them lose weight while they have the device in their stomach and to maintain weight loss after the device is removed.\n\nA pair of connected balloons are used because earlier single-balloon versions tended to dislodge and migrate down the digestive tract, blocking the bowels, Roslin explained.\n\nWith ReShape, if one of the balloons ruptures then the other balloon will keep it in the stomach. The blue dye that filled the balloon will turn a patient's urine blue, letting the person know that one of the balloons has ruptured. Doctors can then go back in and retrieve the entire device.\n\nNausea is a common side effect of the device. In the clinical trial, about 15 percent of patients had to have the balloons removed prematurely due to intolerable nausea, according to Ponce.\n\n\"The first few days are associated with a fair amount of nausea, and you will need some coaching to get through that,\" Roslin said.\n\nAnother troubling side effect is gastric ulcers caused by the balloons rubbing against the stomach wall. About 35 percent of patients in the clinical trial suffered ulcers, but researchers said most of the ulcers were small and superficial.\n\nRoslin also believes that, for now, patients will have to pay cash for the ReShape. \"It is not going to be reimbursed by insurance, at least for the first generation and certainly for the foreseeable future,\" he said.\n\nThe balloons have been available in Europe since 2011, where their average price is about $6,200, according to the manufacturer, ReShape Medical Inc. in California.\n\nThe people who initially will use the ReShape are people who can afford to pay for it out-of-pocket and need to drop some pounds quickly, Roslin said.\n\nIn the clinical trial, the 187 participants who used the device lost an average of more than 14 pounds, or about 7 percent of their total body weight.

Administering the hormone soon after a child's autism is diagnosed might help him or her develop more normally, she said.\n\n\"It's possible it can become a cure, if it's given early when the problems are detected in the little kids,\" Sirigu said. \"We can change the way these patients interact with people from childhood.\"\n\nBecause previous research has indicated that some people with autism might have abnormally low levels of oxytocin, conducting tests to identify those people and administering them the hormone might help as well, said Karen Parker, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine.\n\n\"If you can find someone who appears to have deficits in oxytocin biology, giving them what you might argue would be replacement oxytocin may be helpful,\" Parker said.\n\nAutism is a baffling disorder that can cause a variety of symptoms, including speech and learning problems and profound, disabling difficulties understanding emotions and social cues when interacting with people. The number of children found to have autism has been increasing for reasons that remain mysterious.\n\nOxytocin is produced naturally in the bodies of humans and animals. It plays a key role in social interaction, promoting maternal behavior and monogamy in animals. The hormone also heightens social sensitivity, social awareness, generosity and trust in people.\n\nPrevious U.S. studies found that people with autism who received the hormone intravenously were less likely to engage in repetitive behavior that is another hallmark of autism and were more likely to be able to identify emotions in voices. Another study being published in the journal Biological Psychiatry found that 16 autistic males in Australia ages 12 to 19 who received the hormone through a nasal spray were better able to recognize other people's facial expressions.\n\n\"All the data seem to suggest that manipulating the oxytocin system has a powerful effect on the core symptoms of autism,\" said Eric Hollander, director of the compulsive, impulsive and autism spectrum disorders program at the Montefiore Medical Center in New York.\n\nWhile cautioning that more research is needed on children and additional patients to make sure oxytocin is safe and effective, advocates for families with children with autism welcomed the findings. Oxytocin has been in use for several years as an \"alternative\" therapy for autism.\n\n\"Many families are using it with success and reporting improvement,\" said Wendy Fournier, president of the National Autism Association. \"Getting double-blind clinical studies like this one published helps to bring credibility to parental reports.\"\n\n\"We need to be mindful of the fact that the majority of human studies of oxytocin have been conducted using adults, including this study, and only one paper has included individuals between the ages of 12 and 18. We have to be careful about the safety and efficacy of oxytocin on pediatric populations,\" said Clara Lajonchere, vice president of clinical programs for Autism Speaks.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The study was of relatively short duration and no side effects were reported.

In two scenarios, participants spent a night being sleep-deprived in a lab and then spent 45 minutes in dim or bright light before a driving test. For a third test, people got a good nights\u2019 sleep at home and then went to the lab for 45 minutes of bright light exposure before a driving test.\n\nAfter sleep deprivation in the lab, five people exposed to dim light therapy got in car accidents during the driving simulations. None of the people who slept at home crashed, and neither did any of the sleep-deprived people who got bright light therapy before getting behind the wheel, the study found.\n\n\u201cWe experience severe sleepiness toward the end of the night shift, and this may overlap with our commute time,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Ralph Mistlberger of Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada.\n\n\u201cSleep deprivation makes this worse of course, and together with the clock, this conspires to impair our ability to sustain attention to task (e.g., driving), and avoid distraction, and react quickly to external stimuli like traffic lights, brake lights in front of you, road signs, etc,\u201d Mistlberger added by email.\n\nSleepiness is a leading risk factor for automobile accidents because it can make drivers less vigilant, slow reaction times and dull cognitive abilities, researchers note in Sleep Medicine.\n\nShift workers with chronic sleep deprivation also face an increased risk of accidents. Strategies like drinking coffee or soda, napping before a drive or blasting music or rolling down the windows in the car may help increase alertness behind the wheel, but none of these strategies is fool-proof.\n\nFor the current study, researchers wanted to see if bright light might help reduce driving impairments related to sleep deprivation.\n\nThey found participants had lower body temperatures after spending a sleep-deprived night in the lab, as well as longer reaction times and increased sleepiness.\n\nExposure to bright light didn\u2019t appear to improve reaction times or sleepiness. But light was associated with better driving.\n\nBeyond its small size, other limitations of the study include the reliance on lab conditions for sleep deprivation and light exposure, which may not match what shift workers would experience on the job, the authors note.\n\n\u201cThere is evidence that the use of bright light at the office (or even at home directly prior to beginning the work shift) may be beneficial in preventing sleep deprivation-related motor vehicle collisions,\u201d said Russell Griffin, a researcher at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\n\u201cThat said, there is not enough evidence to date to fully suggest the use of bright light therapy to avoid collision,\u201d Griffin added by email.\n\nThe proven way to avoid the effects of sleepiness on the road is to consistently get enough sleep, said Dr. Flaura Koplin Winston, a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania and the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\n\u201cDrowsy driving is perhaps the most under-recognized cause of serious crashes and sadly, the evidence is not there on how to counter it,\u201d Winston said by email.\n\nMore research is needed on the potential of bright light therapy to make exhausted drivers safer, said Dr. Donald Redelmeier, a researcher at the University of Toronto who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\nBut there are still things drivers can do now to stay safer on the road.\n\n\u201cSafety strategies while driving can include minimizing distractions, stopping at stop signs, respecting speed limits, yielding right-of-way, buckling a seatbelt, signaling all turns and not driving after drinking alcohol,\u201d Redelmeier said.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Exposure to light in this way isn\u2019t harmful, so we\u2019ll rate this N/A.

At this point I would say that cryoablation has the most applicability as a kind of last-ditch treatment for patients who are not good surgical candidates for a variety of reasons.\"\n\nWoodrum and his colleagues are scheduled to discuss their findings Sunday in New Orleans at the annual meeting of the Society of Interventional Radiology.

Using CT-imaging equipment, the physician inserts a small needle-like instrument directly into the tumor to deliver the freezing power (at temperatures as low as minus 100 degrees Celsius) of liquid nitrogen to cancer cells, while sparing healthy surrounding tissue.\n\nTo date, the team behind the new study has used the procedure to tackle a total of 36 tumors in 22 American and French patients --13 men and nine women -- whose average age was 60. Fifteen patients had just one tumor, while the rest had two or more. None of the patients was deemed eligible for standard surgical interventions.\n\nThe targeted tumors were less than 3.5 centimeters (about 1.4 inches), which Woodrum described as being \"small to medium in size.\"\n\nThe procedure was performed under either general anesthesia or conscious sedation, and lasted anywhere from 45 minutes to nearly three hours. Typically, patients were able to return home the following day.\n\nThe result: Among the 15 patients seen roughly three months post-procedure, tumor control was found to be 100 percent, although six patients were found to have developed new lung tumors in the interim.\n\nAmong five patients seen six months after the procedure, tumor control continued to be 100 percent.\n\nThe authors noted that side effects were minimal, typically involving air or fluid around the lungs after the procedure, and in all cases were resolved quickly.\n\nThe team concluded that cryoablation appears to be both safe and effective, at least in the short-term. But they acknowledged that more research needs to be done to track the treatment's impact over the long haul.\n\n\"It would be overreaching to say that we're curing cancer with this,\" Woodrum said. \"But this is one of many therapy options that is looking to turn cancer into a chronic fight, and to give patients for whom the choices are limited a chance at a good quality of life with minimal treatment complications.\"\n\nFor his part, Dr. David Carbone, a professor and director of the James Thoracic Center at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, said that the findings regarding cryoablation are \"not incredibly novel,\" given that the procedure has been around for years.\n\n\"And I would say that there are multiple different technologies for doing this kind of very localized approach,\" he added.

There are no drugs to treat the condition, which typically sets in around the age of two, and many families have tried intensive training of their children by therapists, with mixed results. Pact instead trained the parents to help their children.\n\nProf Jonathan Green at the University of Manchester, who led the study published in the Lancet medical journal, said they had not found the cure for autism, but he and his team believed it had great potential and hoped it would be widely adopted.\n\n\u201cThe advantage of this approach over a direct therapist-child intervention is that it has potential to affect the everyday life of the child,\u201d he said. \u201cOur findings are encouraging, as they represent an improvement in the core symptoms of autism previously thought very resistant to change.\n\n\u201cThis is not a cure, in the sense that the children who demonstrated improvements will still show remaining symptoms to a variable extent, but it does suggest that working with parents to interact with their children in this way can lead to improvements in symptoms over the long term.\u201d\n\nThe trial involved 152 children aged two to four. The families visited a clinic twice a week for six months, where parents were videoed with their children and a box of toys. Autistic children might not interact with their parents at all, but when eventually a child did offer a toy or made a noise that could be interpreted as a request, the incident was rerun on video and the parent encouraged to respond. If the child offered a toy, the parent reciprocated. If the child said a word, the parent repeated it and added something. The practice was repeated at home every day.\n\nThe therapy continued with the parents for the next six months with less intensity. At the end of the first year, the researchers could see the children had improved, but the most dramatic development was seen at the follow-up six years later. At the start of the trial, 50% of those in the control group who did not get the therapy and 55% of those who did were assessed as severely autistic. The children in the intervention group, though, got better. The proportion assessed as severe in the control group was 63% by the end of six years, compared with 46% in the intervention group.\n\nOther experts applauded the work. \u201cI can see why these researchers are excited,\u201d said Dorothy Bishop, professor of developmental neuropsychology at the University of Oxford. \u201cThese results at follow-up are pretty consistent in showing the benefit of this early intervention for autism across a range of measures.

Nevertheless, for parents of children with autism, even a modest reduction would be worthwhile.\u201d\n\nDr Max Davie, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said it offered \u201ca hugely cheering message for families\u201d, while Uta Frith, emeritus professor of cognitive development at University College London, called it \u201ca remarkably positive story, because the intervention itself was neither intensive nor invasive\u201d.\n\nThe absence of any hope, as well as the very sudden regression in children\u2019s behaviour, led many parents to believe in the discredited theory of Andrew Wakefield that the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine was the cause of autism.\n\n\u201cParents commonly tell us that they fight for a diagnosis but when they finally get it the cupboard is bare, with little information or tailored support available to them,\u201d said Dr James Cusack, director of science at the charity Autistica. \u201cToo often, parents fall victim to the false claims of charlatans who prey on desperate families.

For instance, he explained, ''a woman 65 who has microscopic involvement in a single lymph node and an estrogen-receptor positive cancer would be very different from a 38-year-old who has three lymph nodes involved and so-called triple-negative breast cancer.\" The younger woman, he said, would typically be advised to get radiation.\n\nThe older woman, because her risk is lower, should have a discussion with her doctor to decide if the benefit outweighs the risk, Edge noted.\n\nAndrews said that one take-home message for patients is to expect the surgeon to have consulted with the radiation oncologist and others on her team. If a woman's doctor tells her she does not need radiation after a mastectomy, the woman should be told why and she should ask if the radiation oncologist weighed in on the decision.\n\nEdge was a panel representative from the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which created the guidelines along with the American Society for Radiation Oncology and the Society of Surgical Oncology.\n\nAll three groups published the guidelines online this week in their respective journals: the Journal of Clinical Oncology, Practical Radiation Oncology and the Annals of Surgical Oncology.\n\nTo learn more about radiation in breast cancer treatment, visit BreastCancer.org.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does address the need to \u201cweigh the risks and benefits.\u201d The story notes: \u201cSide effects can include redness of the skin, swelling and skin breakdown severe enough to compromise future breast reconstruction.\u201d Those are important points, and we\u2019re glad the story made them.\nWe wish the story had also discussed that there can also be more serious health effects from radiation, including the possibility of increased risk of a second cancer.

Rick Perry signed legislation that will require Texas insurance companies to cover the test for men 45 to 75 years old, and for women between 55 and 75, at intermediate or greater risk of heart attack. The law, the first in any state, takes effect Jan. 1.\n\nThe legislation was introduced in 2007 and passed quietly this year. It eventually attracted attention in cardiology circles, where the scans' costs and benefits are the subject of much debate. The scans are sometimes criticized as an example of expensive new technologies being adopted before proof is established that they're better than cheaper existing methods \u2014 an issue at the heart of the health care reform debate.\n\nThe test, a CAT scan of the heart that measures plaque buildup in the arteries, is popular because heart disease, the nation's No. 1 killer, strikes many people without the sort of very high cholesterol that usually predicts it. Doctors say they get many patients who want to know more about their risk because their father suffered a heart attack and died young.\n\nCritics note that no study has linked the use of CT scans with better patient outcomes. They say the test's value is limited because it doesn't identify which plaque are stable and which could rupture and cause a heart attack.\n\nCT scanning, which costs from $100 to $500, has grown exponentially in recent years. One Houston doctor said that there was just one scanner in Houston in the mid-'90s, and now the $1 million machines are all over the city. The Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography estimates more than 200,000 Americans had the test in 2008 at a cost of about $50 million.\n\nThe American Heart Association did not endorse the legislation, which Khera estimates could result in millions of Texans being screened.\n\nThe Texas legislation was pushed by Screening for Heart Attack Prevention and Eradication, a private organization that has called for CT scans on all asymptomatic men 45 to 75 and all asymptomatic women 55 to 75 \u2014 or some 50 million Americans.\n\nTexas Rep.

The more damage there is to the heart, the more troponin there will be in the blood. Existing tests measure troponin T or troponin I. The new study looked at a highly sensitive type of troponin I test that may be more accurate in less time. The findings appear in the Dec. 28 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nResearchers led by Dr. Till Keller at the University Heart Center in Hamburg, Germany, compared the new highly sensitive troponin I test with the current test and other blood markers for heart attack among 1,818 people who showed symptoms of a possible heart attack. Of these, 413 were deemed to be having a heart attack. The troponin tests were more predictive than other biomarkers used to make the diagnosis, the study showed.\n\nThe new test was more sensitive than the existing one. This means that if a test result is negative, the person is not having a heart attack. Another measure, specificity, rules in disease with a high degree of confidence. The issue with available troponin testing has been that they must be repeated two more times over the next 12 to 16 hours for accurate readings. The new test yields sensitive results in three hours.\n\nThe study was partially funded by Brahms AG and Abbott Diagnostics. Abbott Diagnostics developed both the new and the conventional troponin tests used in the study.\n\n\"We can rule out heart attacks more quickly with the new test,\" said Dr. Sandra Chaparro, a cardiologist at the University of Miami Hospital in Florida. \"If the patient presents to an emergency room less than three hours after chest pain, we can make a diagnosis of a heart attack.\"\n\nMany people come to the emergency room with chest pain.

Not all EKG readings are abnormal during a heart attack, Chaparro explained.

In the U.K., Oxford University recently launched a \u00a310 million ($13 million) program to \u201cidentify new medical therapies through research into the molecular, cellular and systems mechanisms of cannabinoids.\u201d Meanwhile, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has now approved several medications derived from THC.\n\nMany scientists are currently looking at its potential use as a treatment for neurological conditions, including multiple sclerosis, epilepsy and Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nIn a study published in Nature Medicine on Monday, researchers led by Andreas Zimmer, from the University of Bonn, Germany, have shown how THC can provide significant benefits to mice when it comes to age-related cognitive decline.\n\nTHC interacts with receptors in the brain\u2019s endocannabinoid system, which is involved in many physiological functions, including pain, mood, memory and appetite. Previous research has also shown activity in the endocannabinoid system declines as we get older, indicating it plays a role in the progression of aging.\n\nTo study what effect THC has on the aging brain, scientists gave low doses of THC to mice at three different life stages\u2014two months, 12 months and 18 months. The latter two groups represented mature and old age.\n\nThe team carried out three experiments. The first involved a water maze, where mice have to learn and then remember how to navigate their way to the end. In a control group, mature and old mice performed worse than the young group. However, when treated with THC, the older groups improved at the task, while the young mice fared far worse. (The study\u2019s authors noted that this was in \u201cgood agreement with the known detrimental effects of THC on cognition in young animals and humans.\u201d\n\nNext, they created a task where mice had to locate a specific object.

This is a challenge faced by anyone wanting to develop a therapy for a human disorder such as dementia. Human lifespan is very extensive. So the question would be, when would be the most appropriate time to give these kinds of medications? Over what period of time do you need to evaluate the effects? In humans it could be years before an effect is noticed.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinally, there is the issue surrounding safety.

But when all 96 original participants were included in the analysis, the researchers found no significant difference in weight loss between the two treatment groups.\n\nPrevious studies have shown eating a high-fiber diet can help reduce the hunger pangs that may lead to over-eating and derail a healthy diet plan.\n\nStill, the new results should be treated with caution, according to Dr. Maria Vazquez Roque, who has worked on alginate-based gels at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, but was not involved in the study. Just looking at the effect of the supplement on people who finished the treatment can bias the findings, she said.\n\nFor Mette Kristensen, one of the study\u2019s authors, the message seems clear: \u201cIf you actually comply with the treatment, you do have the improvement in weight loss.\u201d\n\nHowever, effects on blood pressure were less promising. Systolic blood pressure \u2014 the top number on a blood pressure reading \u2014 fell by almost six points on average in the placebo group over the 12-week study, but by just over one point in the treatment group. At times during the trials, systolic blood pressure increased in the alginate group by one to two points.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the higher sodium content of the alginate drink \u2014 a little over one gram per dose, or about half a teaspoon of salt \u2014 could have offset any potential blood-pressure reducing effect of the supplement. The American Heart Association recommends that adults eat less than 1.5 g of sodium per day.\n\nQuestions remain about the safety of the fiber supplement over the long term. Five people taking the fiber gel left the study due to problems with stomach bloating, nausea and diarrhea. Two people taking a placebo supplement, which didn\u2019t contain the seaweed fiber, experienced similar problems.\n\nThere are many different types of alginate, said Richard Mattes, who has studied the effect of alginate fiber on appetite at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana \u2014 so the trick is to find the right alginate in the right dose.\n\nAnd just feeling less hungry due to a supplement won\u2019t make you lose weight unless you eat fewer calories, said Mattes, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nThe research group is working on a new supplement that uses 80 percent less alginate, with less sodium, better taste and fewer side effects than the current formula, Astrup told Reuters Health.\n\nAlginate as an aid to weight loss is already commercially available in pill form and costs around $45 for a seven-day supply.

Scientists are hard at work trying to determine how and why that\u2019s that case, as well as which bacteria are beneficial\u2014and how to protect them. A recent study published in adds to the growing evidence that fiber might be a critical gut-nourishing nutrient. (Unfortunately, less than 3% of Americans eat the government-recommended amount daily.)\n\n\u201cYou really hold the reins to guiding this community [of bacteria] through the choices you make,\u201d says Justin L. Sonnenburg, PhD, associate professor in the department of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University School of Medicine and author of . Sonnenburg was not involved with this study, but research from his lab also suggests that fiber plays a big role in promoting good bacteria.\n\nThe authors of the new study wanted to look at what changes in diet do to one particular gut microbe species: a strain that\u2019s been associated with leanness and better glucose tolerance in mice. They wrangled a group of 49 overweight and obese adults, took stool and blood samples and asked them to follow a six-week calorie-restricted diet (between 1,500-1,800 calories per day) while increasing their fiber intake. The diet was followed by six weeks of eating normally. They kept a food journal throughout, and the researchers biopsied their fat tissue.\n\nThe people who had more in their gut from the very start had better clinical measures after they completed the diet, compared to the people with less of the bacterium. Both groups of people lost the same amount of weight, but the high- group had a stronger decrease in visceral fat than the others, says study author Patrice D. Cani, PhD, professor and group leader of the Metabolism and Nutrition Research Group at Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain in Belgium. \u201cWe discovered that the patients who exhibited higher amounts of were the patients who had a very strong improvement in cholesterol, in glycemia, in waist to hip ratio and also a reduction in different parameters in both cardiovascular disease and risk factors.\u201d\n\nHigher levels of , the findings suggest, seem to have favorable effects on health.\n\nThe good news is that your initial levels are not your fate. People who started out with lower stores of had more after they followed the fiber-rich calorie-restricted diet. You can increase these bacterial populations by eating fiber, Cani\u2019s research suggests, which acts as a prebiotic in the gut and has a beneficial effect on some bacteria.\n\nNow, Cani says he is working on an experiment with obese and diabetic patients to administer alone, without any dietary modifications, to see what effect it has on insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease risk factors. \u201cIf we can improve these different parameters, that would be something great,\u201d he says.\n\nHere\u2019s why fiber is so important to intestinal flora: your gut microbes feed on it and produce short-chain fatty acids, which get absorbed into the bloodstream and regulate the immune system and attenuate inflammation, Sonnenburg says. \u201cThat means if you\u2019re not eating dietary fiber, your immune system may be existing in kind of a simmering pro-inflammatory state,\u201d he says\u2014the very state that predisposes us to different Western diseases. \u201cOur diet and deteriorated microbiota are really a major piece of the puzzle in trying to understand why Western diseases are rising like crazy.\u201d\n\nSonnenburg says that when researchers try on mice what many of us do on a regular basis\u2014eat food depleted of dietary fiber\u2014their gut microbes behave erratically. \u201cThey turn and start eating the mucus lining of the intestine,\u201d says Sonnenburg, \u201cbecause that\u2019s also a carbohydrate source and it\u2019s kind of a fallback food for them.\u201d In mice on a low-fiber diet, the mucus lining thins to about half of its normal width, he says. It\u2019s so far unclear whether the same thing happens in humans, but Sonnenburg thinks it might. \u201cWe start to see these correlates that we think over the course of decades in a human could lead to something problematic,\u201d he says.\n\nLoading up on fiber-fortified processed foods isn\u2019t likely a good way to increase the kind of fiber that benefits the gut. Studies done on single fibers\u2014those, like inulin, which are added to foods\u2014haven\u2019t shown to have the same effects as fiber that occur naturally in whole foods. \u201cAll of the vegetables we\u2019re encouraged to eat by our mothers and by the government guidelines, these are all filled with fiber, and filled with a diversity of fiber, and probably the best route for encouraging a diverse microbiota,\u201d Sonnenburg says.\n\nNuts, seeds, whole grains, legumes and even dark chocolate are high in fiber\u2014as are vegetables. \u201cYou can eat massive amounts of plant material and it can be incredibly good for you, you can feel really satisfied and full,\u201d Sonnenburg says. \u201cI find that a really nice way to eat\u2014just kind of gorging myself on plant material.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not discuss risks associated with increasing your intake of dietary fiber.

The results of one new study may be less than hoped for, but the science is sound: The study concluded that injecting stem cells into the spinal cords of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is safe in most, though not all, cases. Unfortunately, the procedure provided no benefit to patients, though it caused substantial pain to two of the study participants.\n\nDr. Jonathan D. Glass, a professor of neurology and pathology at the Emory University School of Medicine and the director of the Emory ALS Center, specifically focused on human spinal cord-derived neural stem cells.\n\n\"We put them into the spinal cord, and they came from a human spinal cord. The idea was that they would find a familiar and supportive environment,\" explained Glass.\n\nIn previous studies , Glass and his colleagues had transplanted such stem cells into the spinal cords of rodents with ALS and discovered that the treatment delayed the disease and improved survival.\n\nNext, in a study of 12 patients , Glass tested the safety of injecting the stem cells into the spinal cords of humans. What he discovered during that experiment was that none of the patients suffered long-term effects (from either the surgical procedure or the implantation of stem cells), and no unusual acceleration of disease occurred. Importantly, one patient showed some improvement, though he and his colleagues noted that this outcome \"must be interpreted with caution\" since the study wasn't designed to measure effectiveness of the treatment.\n\nFor the new study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, Glass and his colleagues tested increasing amounts of stem cells injected into 15 patients who were not enrolled in his previous study.\n\nWhat ALS does to the body\n\nWhen someone gets ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, their motor network rapidly disintegrates. Nerve cells that communicate and control the voluntary muscles of the body (such as those in the arms, legs and face) degenerate or die. When communication between the brain and muscles ceases, the result is a gradual weakening and wasting away of muscles.\n\n\"My father was actually 69 when he was diagnosed. Someone can go for two years without being diagnosed properly, and that was the case with my father,\" Pharr said.\n\nNeither his primary care physician nor his neurologist could identify the cause of his deterioration. In fact, they first believed he had suffered a stroke. After all, ALS is rare, and in up to 90% of all cases, there is no family history and no known risk factors, as was the case with Pharr's father.\n\nALS affects men more often than women, usually between the ages of 40 and 70. Though more common between the ages of 60 and 69, this neurodegenerative disease can develop at any age, progressing rapidly. Most people with ALS die within three to five years after their symptoms begin, though about 10% survive for 10 years or longer. In Pharr's father's case, the progress of disease was rapid.\n\n\"He did not want to go on the ventilator,\" she said, adding that many people prefer a \"natural death.\" ALS often ends with respiratory failure since muscles in the diaphragm and chest walls eventually stop functioning. \"There's no cure, and we don't even have a treatment,\" she said.\n\nAccording to Goldstein, this isn't entirely a negative. \"One of the things ALS has going for it is, since it has no effective treatment or cure, you throw anything you can at it,\" he said. While for many other diseases, the researchers are focused on just one modality, ongoing ALS research uses each of the four key modes of medical treatment: small molecules, proteins and biologics, gene therapy and stem cells.\n\nWas this research necessary -- and ethical?\n\nThe ethics of human experimentation were thoroughly examined before the study began.\n\n\"Ethical review happens at several levels: at the NIH, at the Food and Drug Administration and most importantly at University Institutional Review Boards at each institution where a faculty member is participating in a trial,\" Glass explained.\n\nIn Pharr's opinion, this and other stem cell studies are certainly fair from a participant's perspective, since beforehand, \"patients are presented with all the risk factors involved so they can make an informed decision.\" Besides, she added, \"you automatically assume anyone with ALS can participate, but not everyone meets the criteria for a particular study.\"\n\nThe results of the study: Most participants fared well. However, severe complications occurred in two of the patients as a result of the surgery involved. One developed partial paralysis, and another experienced \"incapacitating pain.\"\n\n\"People who do these studies should be considered medical heroes,\" Goldstein said, adding, \"The selflessness of these people when they're told they're gonna die.\"\n\nSadly, disappointment is part of it, according to Pharr, who typically hears the frustration of people who go through a study that worked for another person but not for them. \"It may have had a different effect on someone else,\" she said. \"But that's why we don't have a treatment yet: because it doesn't work for everyone.\"\n\nThese early stages may be painful for some of the \"medical heroes\" involved, but the goal is clear: providing an effective and safe treatment for future patients who suffer from a devastating condition.\n\n\"Importantly, people should understand that, at least for neurological diseases like ALS, we are just now getting started with testing our hypotheses about using stem cells as therapeutics,\" Glass said. \"We do not know if these treatments will work, and it will take time to test these therapies in a systematic and safe way.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story provided a lot of detail on the harms noted in the study, earning it\u00a0a Satisfactory rating in this criterion, albeit with caveats.\nCertainly, the bar for safety may be lower for ALS than for other diseases, but we think the story misleads by calling the treatment \u201cgenerally safe.\u201d As the story explains,\u00a0two of the 15 patients developed \u201csevere complications,\u201d including partial paralysis and \u201cincapacitating pain.\u201d More detail is warranted here.

But there are currently no curative treatments available for vascular dementia or Alzheimer's disease, the most common causes of dementia. Also, the cells lining the brain's blood vessels are tightly packed, forming a blood-brain barrier that prevents large molecules from crossing into the brain tissue. This limits the types of drugs and cell therapies that could be made available to treat dementia.\n\nShimokawa and his team had conducted previous studies showing that LIPUS improved blood vessel formation in pigs with myocardial ischemia, a condition where there is reduced blood flow to the heart. Other studies have reported that LIPUS increases the production of proteins involved in nerve cell survival and growth, in addition to a role in promoting nerve regeneration. Focusing LIPUS treatment on a region in the brain called the hippocampus, which is involved in memory, has also been found to improve dementia in mice, but the details of how it does this need to be more fully investigated.\n\nThe Tohoku University team wanted to find out if whole-brain rather than focused LIPUS is effective in treating mouse models of dementia, and if it was, what was happening at the molecular levels to achieve this.\n\nThey found that cognitive impairment markedly improved in mice with conditions similar to vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease when LIPUS was applied to the whole brain three times a day for 20 minutes each time.

BTK plays a crucial role in B cell activation, growth and maturation and mast cell and basophil activation, the latter two cells being responsible for immediate allergic reactions. Bochner teamed up with Northwestern oncologist Dr. Leo Gordon and colleagues to test if this BTK inhibitor could shut down an enzyme inside cells that is involved when you have an allergic reaction.\n\n\"Ibrutinib is considered a game changer in these two types of cancers,\" said Gordon, the Abby and John Friend Professor of Cancer Research at Feinberg. \"We understood that it might have some biologic effects in what Bruce is interested in, so we were happy to participate in his study. It's an interesting repurposing of that drug.\"\n\nWhile the study was small - only two patients qualified out of about 35 that were screened for allergies - the implications are much larger for later phases of this study. Bochner and his colleagues Drs. Anne Marie Singh and Melanie Dispenza are now testing how successful the drug is at targeting allergies to food, such as tree nuts and peanuts.\n\n\"Preventing or lessening the severity of an allergic reaction to a food you've ingested that you're allergic to is kind of the holy grail of food allergy treatment,\" Bochner said. \"I don't know if this or similar drugs will ever make it possible for a peanut-allergic person to eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but we're excited to use this approach to teach us how to lessen the risks of food allergy reactions.\"\n\nCurrently, the study is being expanded to adults with food allergy to see if their skin test and basophil activation test responses show a similar reduction with just a few doses of ibrutinib and how long such benefits might last. If the results are favorable, the next step would be to get funding to actually test whether taking a BTK inhibitor will improve the ability of food-allergic adults to eat foods they're allergic to.\n\n\"The hope is that drugs like BTK inhibitors will protect people with food allergies from having anaphylaxis, or at least increase how much of that food they can eat without reacting,\" Bochner said. \"Maybe they'll increase from being able to eat just one peanut to 10 before they react. Or maybe they'll be able to eat a full meal's worth of peanuts. We want to know if this would safely change their actual ability to eat foods that they currently need to avoid.\"\n\nThe study was funded by a 2016 Dixon Translational Research Grant.", "question": "Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Readers of this release get no alert that the labeling of ibrutinib warns of potentially life-threatening bleeding, infections, decreased blood cell counts, heart rhythm problems and also that patients commonly suffer diarrhea.

For women age 55 to 79, aspirin is recommended to prevent strokes, with the same caveat.\n\nThe new work, by Alfred Bartolucci of the University of Alabama at Birmingham and colleagues, was supported by aspirin-maker Bayer AG.\n\nThe research team pooled the results of the nine trials that have tested the drug in the prevention of heart disease so far, including three that weren\u2019t part of the 2009 USPSTF review.\n\nAbout 100,000 men and women age 45 and up took part in the studies.

DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research at McMaster have developed the first widely protective vaccine against chlamydia, a common STI that is mostly asymptomatic but impacts 113 million people around the world each year and can result in infertility.\n\nIn a study, recently published in the journal Vaccine, the researchers show that a novel chlamydial antigen known as BD584 is a potential vaccine candidate for the most common species of chlamydia known as Chlamydia trachomatis.\n\nAs most C. trachomatis infections are asymptomatic, chlamydia can often go untreated and lead to upper genital tract infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, and infertility. This is why the promise of a vaccine would be extremely beneficial, says David Bulir, co-author of the study.\n\n\"Vaccine development efforts in the past three decades have been unproductive and there is no vaccine approved for use in humans,\" said Bulir, who just finished his PhD in medical sciences at McMaster.\n\n\"Vaccination would be the best way to way to prevent a chlamydia infection, and this study has identified important new antigens which could be used as part of a vaccine to prevent or eliminate the damaging reproductive consequences of untreated infections.\"\n\nIn the research team's study, BD584 was able to reduce chlamydial shedding - a symptom of C. trachomatis - by 95 per cent. The antigen also decreased hydrosalpinx, another C. trachomatis symptom which involves fallopian tubes being blocked with serous fluids, by 87.5 per cent.\n\nThe results look very promising, said senior author James Mahony, a professor of Pathology and Molecular Medicine for McMaster's Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine and a researcher at St. Joseph Healthcare Hamilton's Research Institute where the work was performed.\n\nCo-author and McMaster PhD student, Steven Liang, explains, \"not only is the vaccine effective, it also has the potential to be widely protective against all C. trachomatis strains, including those that cause trachoma.\"\n\nTrachoma is an eye infection caused by chlamydia and is the leading cause of preventable blindness affecting millions of people in many resource-poor regions of the world.\n\n\"The vaccine would be administered through the nose. This is easy and painless and does not require highly trained health professionals to administer, and that makes it an inexpensive solution for developing nations,\" he said.\n\nThe next step is more testing for effectiveness against different strains of Chlamydia and in different formulations.

The score, published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal), can also identify patients at risk of subsequent heart issues after discharge.\n\n\"We have developed a simple lab score that is superior to using cardiac troponin alone for the identification of patients at low and high risk for heart attack or death at emergency department presentation,\" say Dr. Peter Kavsak, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario. According to Professor Andrew Worster, also from McMaster University, \"This lab score may reduce both the number of blood tests and time spent in the emergency department for chest pain patients.\"\n\nPatients with chest pain symptoms require multiple blood tests over several hours before a diagnosis is reached. Previous studies using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin alone to rule out and rule in heart attacks have not consistently demonstrated sufficient safety to use in clinical practice.\n\nIn this international study, researchers from Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Germany combined common laboratory blood tests available at many hospitals around the world to create a single laboratory score, or clinical chemistry score, to diagnose heart attack. These blood tests are part of the World Health Organization's list of essential in vitro diagnostics tests for health care facilities with clinical laboratories.\n\nThe researchers validated the clinical chemistry score as a predictor of heart attack or death within 30 days using data on 4245 patients from emergency department studies in the four countries. Within one month of the emergency department visits, 727 heart attacks or death in patients occurred. A negative (or low-risk) clinical chemistry score at emergency department presentation missed only one of these events compared with up to 25 missed heart attacks/death when using a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin test alone. A positive (or high-risk) clinical chemistry score also identified about 75% of patients at high risk of heart attack or death when positive compared with a low of 40% detected when the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin test alone was positive. The clinical chemistry score worked equally well in men and women.\n\nThe authors suggest the score can be useful for standardizing diagnoses and improving safety.\n\n\"Adoption of the clinical chemistry score algorithm would standardize reporting of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin test results, how the tests are interpreted in the normal range, and represent an option less susceptible to both analytical and preanalytical errors.

The vegetarian diet consisted of vegetables, grains, legumes, fruits and nuts, with animal products limited to a maximum of one portion of low-fat yoghurt per day; the conventional diabetic diet followed the official recommendations of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD). Both diets were restricted by 500 kilocalories per day compared to an isocaloric intake for each individual.\n\nThe vegetarian diet was found to be almost twice as effective in reducing body weight, resulting in an average loss of 6.2kg compared to 3.2kg for the conventional diet.\n\nUsing magnetic resonance imaging, Dr. Kahleov\u00e1 and colleagues then studied adipose (fat-storage) tissue in the subjects' thighs to see how the two different diets had affected subcutaneous, subfascial and intramuscular fat (that is, fat under the skin, on the surface of muscles and inside muscles).\n\nThey found that both diets caused a similar reduction in subcutaneous fat. However, subfascial fat was only reduced in response to the vegetarian diet, and intramuscular fat was more greatly reduced by the vegetarian diet.\n\nThis is important as increased subfascial fat in patients with type 2 diabetes has been associated with insulin resistance, so reducing it could have a beneficial effect on glucose metabolism. In addition, reducing intramuscular fat could help improve muscular strength and mobility, particularly in older people with diabetes.\n\nDr. Kahleov\u00e1 said: \"Vegetarian diets proved to be the most effective diets for weight loss. However, we also showed that a vegetarian diet is much more effective at reducing muscle fat, thus improving metabolism.

Patients on blood-thinning drugs, such as dabigatran (Pradaxa), who suffer a type of bleeding that occurs inside the skull (intracranial hemorrhage) are at high risk of complications or disability. Idarucizumab (Praxbind) is an antibody that chemically binds and neutralizes the blood-thinning effects of dabigatran.\n\nAn interim analysis of the first 90 patients in a study called RE-VERSE AD (REVERSal Effects of idarucizumab in patients on Active Dabigatran) showed that idarucizumab effectively reversed dabigatran's anticoagulant effects, said Richard A. Bernstein, M.D., Ph.D., lead study author and director of the stroke program at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nBernstein presented the results of 90 brain hemorrhage patients enrolled in the REVERSE-AD study. This included 11 men and seven women (average age 79).\n\nIn patients who received two 2.5-gram of idarucizumab infusions in a 15-minute period, blood tests revealed that dabigatran's blood-thinning effect was 100 percent reversed in all 18 patients with brain bleed.\n\n\"This is definitely good news,\" Bernstein said. \"Idarucizumab rapidly and completely reverses the effect of dabigatran in patients with brain hemorrhage. Once the dabigatran is reversed, we can focus on taking care of the patient without worrying about the blood thinner.\"\n\nThe new results are part of a large on-going phase III study testing idarucizumab in a range of patients who take dabigatran and have dangerous bleeding or need urgent surgery or other procedures that carry serious bleeding risks.\n\nIdarucizumab was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in October 2015 as the first medicine designed to reverse dabigatran.\n\nResearchers say before idarucizumab was available, patients on dabigatran who needed emergency surgery were given purified clotting factors, which carry the risk of patients' clotting systems forming dangerous blood clots.\n\n\"Idarucizumab gets rid of the dabigatran, but doesn't seem to carry with it any tendency to increase clotting. This should make perioperative management easier and safer,\" Bernstein said.\n\nIdarucizumab's success so far might persuade more people to take a blood thinner when their doctors recommend it. \"The biggest problem we face in preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation is that almost half of patients don't take any blood thinner at all,\" Bernstein said. \"I see the biggest impact of idarucizumab as providing reassurance to patients that if bleeding while taking dabigatran does occur, we can quickly reverse the dabigatran.

It includes criteria like whether the doctor can feel a nodule through rectal examination, and whether a tumor is detected through a test called trans-rectal ultrasound.\n\nTen years ago, the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer decreed that doctors should use these types of clinical staging tests to help decide how to treat cancers.\n\n\"Our findings question the utility of our current staging system for localized prostate cancer,\" says Dr. Adam Reese of the University of California at San Francisco, lead author of the study.\n\nTo begin with, doctors err in using this prostate test 35 percent of the time. When these errors occur, the study says, doctors most often conclude the cancer is less serious than it really is.\n\nBut even when researchers allowed for these errors, they found the test doesn't predict how patients ultimately do.\n\nDr. Gerald Andriole of Washington University, who was not involved in the study, told Shots he wasn't surprised by the results. Recently, he says, urologists \"have begun to realize these criteria are not adequate. But this is the first study that quantifies the magnitude of the inadequacy.\"\n\nEven so, Andriole says, the findings may not make too much difference in the real world. Before treatment recommendations are made, doctors put most prostate tumors through other tests, too, like the Gleason score, and they look at the percentage of biopsies that are positive for cancer cells.\n\n\"I use all those parameters to tell a patient what his chances of a good outcome are,\" Andriole says.\n\nStill, both study author Reese and Andriole say the new study may serve as a wakeup call to those who are over-relying on the clinical staging system.\n\nThey say what's really needed is a set of tests that classify prostate tumors by what genes are turned on or off in the cells.\n\nOnce this is sorted out, doctors treating prostate cancer will be less like the blind men who try to guess what kind of creature they're dealing with when they grasp the elephant's trunk or tail.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story mentioned that doctors \u2018erred 35% of the time\u2019 with clinical staging and this leads doctors to conclude that a given prostate cancer \u201cis less serious than it really is.\u201d\u00a0 However \u2013 this is only half of the story.\u00a0 There\u2019s also a significant harm that occurs from overtreatment of lesions that were never destined to be problematic. \u00a0To be balanced and complete, the story should have mentioned this as well because it is another important problem.\nFor example, a MedPageToday story addressed this issue:\u00a0 \u201cFor those men with prostate cancer found to have been staged incorrectly, the assigned clinical stage was too low 55.1% of the time \u2014 and too high in 44.9% of cases.\u201d", "answer": 0}, {"article": "TUESDAY, March 8, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Acupuncture may help reduce the severity of hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause, according to a small study.\n\nThe research included 53 postmenopausal women, with about half receiving traditional Chinese acupuncture twice a week and the others given sham acupuncture treatments.\n\nAfter 10 weeks, the women in the traditional acupuncture group had significantly less severe hot flashes and mood swings than those who'd gotten the fake treatment.

Such fasting already shows benefits after only six weeks. This is according to a study by Kyoung-Han Kim and Yun Hye Kim in the journal Cell Research which is published by Springer Nature. Intermittent fasting in mice helped to kick-start the animals' metabolism and to burn fat by generating body heat. The research team was led by Hoon-Ki Sung of The Hospital for Sick Children in Ontario, Canada.\n\nResearch has shown that our unhealthy eating habits and sedentary lifestyles are playing a major role in the development of lifestyle-related metabolic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and obesity. For this reason, dietary interventions like intermittent fasting are gaining popularity to treat conditions such as obesity.\n\nThe research team in this study wanted to better understand the reactions that interventions such as fasting trigger on a molecular level in the body. They exposed groups of mice to sixteen weeks of intermittent fasting. The recurring regimen saw the animals being fed for two days, followed by one day without anything to eat. Their calorie intake was not adjusted otherwise. Four months later the mice in the fasting group weighed less than those in the control group who continued to eat the same volume of food. The lower body weight of the mice in the fasting group was not the only effect. The fasting regime helped lower fat build-up in the white fat by increasing the brown-like fat (involved in burning energy and producing body heat) of mice on the high fat diet. Their glucose and insulin systems also remained more stable. In a further experiment, similar benefits were already seen after only six weeks of intermittent fasting.\n\nThrough an analysis into the underlying biology involved, the researchers found that such intermittent fasting tempers an immune reaction in fat cells. There are changes in certain gene pathways involved in the immune system and the body's reaction to inflammation. A type of white blood cell known to play a role in fighting inflammation is triggered. Known as anti-inflammatory macrophages, these cells stimulate the fat cells to burn stored fats or lipids by generating heat. This happens during periods of intermittent fasting because there is an increase in vascular growth factor (VEGF) that help form blood vessels and activate anti-inflammatory macrophage.\n\n\"Intermittent fasting without a reduction in calorie intake can be a preventative and therapeutic approach against obesity and metabolic disorders,\" says Kyoung-Han Kim.\n\n\"Strikingly, these fasting-stimulated changes in the growth of vascular cells and subsequent immune alterations occur even after a single cycle of 24-hour fasting, and are completely reversed when mice start eating again,\" adds Yun Hye Kim.\n\nReference: Kim, K-H. et al (2017).

Its goal is to let people know that there is a link between high blood pressure, stroke and dementia.\n\nWhen blood pressure rises, it strains the tiny blood vessels that keep brain cells alive, Koroshetz says.\n\n\"With every pulse of your heart, you are pushing blood into these very small blood vessels in the brain,\" he says. And when the heart pushes too hard, as it does when blood pressure is elevated, it can cause damage that can lead to a stroke.\n\nAt least two large studies have revealed an alarming trend among stroke patients, Koroshetz says.\n\n\"If you had a stroke, even a small stroke, your risk of dementia within the next two years was greatly magnified,\" he says. \"So there's something about having a stroke that drives a lot of the processes that give rise to dementia.\"\n\nThe evidence is clearest for a type of dementia called vascular dementia.

It is believed that success rates could be hindered as a result of treating all prostate cancers in the same way.\n\nA team at the University of York and the University of British Columbia, Canada, however, have designed a test that can pick out life-threatening prostate cancers, with up to 92% accuracy.\n\nProfessor Norman Maitland, from the University of York's Department of Biology, said: \"Unnecessary prostate treatment has both physical consequences for patients and their families, but is also a substantial financial burden on the NHS, where each operation will cost around \u00a310,000.\n\n\"Cancers that are contained in the prostate, however, have the potential to be 'actively monitored' which is not only cheaper, but has far fewer negative side-effects in patients with non-life threatening cancer.\"\n\nIt is now understood that to find the different levels of cancer, scientists have to identify genes that have been altered in different cancer types. The team analysed more than 500 cancer tissue samples and compared them with non-cancer tissue to search for patterns of a chemical group that is added to part of the DNA molecule, altering gene expression.\n\nA person's age, what they eat and how they sleep, for example, impacts on chemical alterations to genes and which ones are turned on and off. This is part of the normal functioning of the human body and can tell individuals apart, but the process can sometimes go wrong, resulting in various diseases.\n\nProfessor Maitland said: \"In some diseases, such as cancer, genes can be switched to an opposite state, causing major health issues and threat to life.\n\n\"The challenge in prostate cancer is how to look at all of these patterns within a cell, but hone in on the gene activity that suggests cancer, and not only this, what type of cancer - dangerous or manageable?\n\n\"To put it another way: how to do we distinguish the tiger cancer cells from the pussycat cancer cells, when there are millions of patterns of chemical alterations going on, many of which will be perfectly healthy?\"\n\nThe team needed to eliminate the 'noise' of the genetic patterns that make individuals unique, to leave them with the patterns that indicate cancer. They were able to do this using a computer algorithm, which left the team with 17 possible genetic markers for prostate cancer.\n\nDr Davide Pellacani, who began these studies in York, before moving to the University of British Columbia, said: \"Using this computer analysis, not only could we see which tissue samples had cancer and which didn't, but also which cancers were dangerous and which ones less so.\n\n\"Out of almost a million markers studied, we were able to use our new tools to single out differences in cancer potency.\"\n\nTo take this method out of the laboratory, the team are now investigating a further trial with new cancer samples, and hope to involve a commercial partner to allow this to be used for patients being treated in the NHS.\n\nThe research, published in the British Journal of Cancer, was funded by The Freemasons of the Province of Yorkshire (North and East Ridings) and The Masonic Samaritan Fund.

But you can also tell by the ads: TV spots selling remedies for drippy, congested noses, itchy eyes and other symptoms are in heavy rotation.\n\nNew this year: ads for Flonase, a nasal steroid spray from GlaxoSmithKline that just became available over the counter. It joins Sanofi's Nasacort, a spray in the same class that went from prescription to over-the-counter status a year ago. And they both sit on store shelves next to antihistamines such as Claritin, Allegra and Zyrtec that were prescription drugs just a few years ago. Older over-the-counter antihistamines, such as Benadryl, and decongestants, such as Sudafed and Afrin, remain available as well.\n\nDon't expect the ads to help you sort out what might work best for you. Here's what some top allergists say you need to know about these non-prescription options.\n\nBelieve (some of) the hype about the newly-accessible steroid nasal sprays.\n\nThese drugs work by fighting inflammation and they are in the \"single most effective drug class\" for treating nasal allergies, according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Other expert groups have made similar statements. \"These are first-line treatments\" that can prevent allergy symptoms, not just treat them, says Jackie Eghrari-Sabet, an allergist in Gaithersburg, Md.\n\nBut that does not mean they work for everyone, says James Sublett, a Louisville allergist and president of the allergy group. People with mild to moderate symptoms have the best chance of full relief, he says.\n\nPossible side effects include nasal irritation and nose bleeds. Labels caution that some children using the sprays may experience slower growth, so a doctor should be consulted if a child needs them for more than two months.\n\nWhen prescription drugs are first available over the counter, most consumers end up paying more, because their insurers no longer cover the cost. The non-prescription steroid nasal sprays are selling for about $17 to $23 for a one-month supply (at the typical two-squirts per nostril adult starting dose). Worth knowing: so far, insurers have continued to pay for similar prescription sprays, Eghrari-Sabet says. The various sprays have never been studied head to head, so it's impossible to say whether they vary in effectiveness, she says.\n\nThere's a right way to use these sprays.\n\nThey should be used daily during your vulnerable season or seasons, ideally starting before symptoms do, Eghrari-Sabet says. The idea is \"to turn an army of inflammatory cells around before they recruit more soldiers,\" she says.\n\nIt's also important to administer the sprays correctly, so that they end up inside your nasal passages, not just your nose, where they might cause irritation, Sublett says. Packages contain instructions, and Sublett has an added tip: bend over and look at your toes while holding the bottle up and squirting.\n\nThese drugs target histamine. That's a chemical your body releases, causing sneezing, a runny nose and itchy eyes, when you come in contact with allergy-triggering substances. Antihistamines work faster than the steroid sprays, which can take a week or so to reach full effectiveness. They also can be cheaper, because they are available in store-brand versions. For example, Walmart sells Equate loratadine tablets (the same active ingredient as Claritin) for about $7 for 60 24-hour doses\n\nAntihistamines make perfect sense for someone who suffers a few sneezy days each season and doesn't want to use a spray for weeks or months, Eghrari-Sabet says. Look for one that does not make you sleepy, Sublett says. It's a myth, he adds, that older, sedating antihistamines, such as Benadryl, are extra effective against nasal allergies.\n\nDecongestants such as Sudafed work by shrinking swollen blood vessels in the nose. They can raise blood pressure and cause jitters, and some people are more susceptible than others. Some decongestant sprays such as Afrin \u2014 unlike the steroid nasal sprays \u2014 can be used for just few days at a time, because they otherwise cause rebound symptoms.\n\nSo use these medications sparingly, Sublett says.\n\nKeep your medical providers in the loop.\n\nOver-the-counter treatments should not take the place of professional care \u2014 especially if you have never been formally diagnosed with allergies, if you have additional medical problems or if your symptoms persist or worsen, Eghrari-Sabet and Sublett say. An allergist can test you to find out what's causing your symptoms and offer additional treatments. Those include allergy shots and, for a few patients who qualify, newer immunotherapy pills that desensitize people to grass and ragweed pollens.\n\nAlso important to remember: While medications can be helpful, the first rule of allergy control is to avoid the substances that make you sniffle and sneeze. If you are allergic to mold spores or to pollen from trees, grasses or ragweed, that means knowing when levels are high (by checking pollen.com or the National Allergy Bureau) and then taking steps such as these recommended by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and & Immunology:\n\u2022 Keep windows closed at home and in your car.\n\u2022 Use air conditioning if possible.\n\u2022 Try to stay indoors, and avoid mowing lawns or raking leaves.\n\u2022 If you need to be outside for a long period, wear a pollen mask.\n\u2022 After time outside, take a shower, shampoo your hair and change clothes.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story goes into the side effects of steroid nasal sprays, antihistamines and decongestants.

It really is big news,\u201d said Dr. Bernard Zinman, director of the Diabetes Centre at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, who led the three-year study of 7,000 people.\n\nBecause about one-half of the deaths in people with type 2 diabetes are caused by cardiovascular disease, reducing cardiovascular risk is considered essential to diabetes care. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the disease and is linked to obesity.\n\nJardiance, a once-a-day pill which won U.S. approval last year, belongs to a new family of treatments called SGLT2 inhibitors that include Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Invokana and AstraZeneca Plc\u2019s Farxiga. They lower blood sugar by inhibiting reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys.\n\nZinman, in an interview, predicted the new study would prompt medical societies to recommend that Jardiance be used by type 2 diabetics who have a history of heart disease or who are at risk of cardiovascular events.\n\nAbout 26 million Americans have type 2 diabetes, according to federal data for 2014. The vast majority of those patients could be candidates for Jardiance, which costs over $4,000 per year, Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said.\n\n\u201cThe big news here is that the drug reduced cardiovascular stuff.

There was no significant difference in non-fatal heart attacks or non-fatal strokes.\n\nThose taking Jardiance had a 32 percent lower risk of dying from any cause, and a 35 percent lower rate of hospitalizations from heart failure.\n\nThe benefits were especially impressive because they added to protection that patients received from taking cholesterol fighters and other life-saving heart drugs, Zinman said.\n\n\u201cThis is a wonderful thing,\u201d said Dr. Jerome Tolbert of Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital in New York. He has not prescribed Jardiance and similar drugs as frequently as treatments like Januvia, but expects that may change based on the new data.\n\nZinman noted that Jardiance, like other SGLT2 drugs, causes weight loss and reduced blood pressure, besides lowering both blood sugar levels and body fat, and also reduces swelling, which all help the cardiovascular system.\n\nLilly and Boehringer last month disclosed that Jardiance met its primary study goal, becoming the first diabetes drug to show heart-protective results in a large cardiovascular trial.

Treatment of unstable fractures is either surgical or nonsurgical (using externally applied casts). Neither method yields an entirely satisfactory outcome in older adults. Traditional casting techniques are associated with poor fracture alignment and healing, as well as plaster-related sores. Surgery is often complicated by poor implant fixation (bone healing), wound problems, and infection. A modified casting technique has been developed, close contact casting, which uses minimal padding compared with traditional casting and achieves fracture reduction by distributing contact pressure by close anatomic fit.\n\nKeith Willett, M.B.B.S., F.R.C.S., of the University of Oxford, United Kingdom, and colleagues randomly assigned 620 adults older than 60 years with acute, unstable ankle fracture to surgery (n = 309) or casting (n = 311). Casts were applied in the operating room under general or spinal anesthesia by a trained surgeon.\n\nAmong the 620 adults (average age, 71 years; 74 percent women) who were randomized, 96 percent completed the study. Nearly all participants (93 percent) received assigned treatment; 52 of 275 (19 percent) who initially received casting later converted to surgery. At 6 months, casting resulted in measures of ankle function equivalent to that with surgery. Infection and wound breakdown were more common with surgery (10 percent vs 1 percent), as were additional operating room procedures (6 percent vs 1 percent).\n\nRadiologic malunion (abnormal healing of a fracture) was more common in the casting group (15 percent vs 3 percent for surgery). Casting required less operating room time compared with surgery. There were no significant differences in other secondary outcomes: quality of life, pain, ankle motion, mobility, and patient satisfaction.\n\n\"Close contact casting was delivered successfully for most participants, substantially reducing the number of patients requiring invasive surgical procedures at the outset and additional operations during a 6-month period,\" the authors write.\n\nThe researchers add that close contact casting may be an appropriate treatment for older adults with unstable ankle fracture.\n\nEditor's Note: Please see the article for additional information, including other authors, author contributions and affiliations, financial disclosures, funding and support, etc.\n\n\"The results reported by Willett et al demonstrate that most unstable ankle fractures in older patients can be treated with a cast without the need for surgery,\" writes David W. Sanders, M.D., M.Sc., F.R.C.S.C., of Western University, London, Ontario, Canada, in an accompanying editorial.\n\n\"However, many patients who were initially treated by casting subsequently required repeat casting or surgery. Further studies are needed to help identify which patients will not benefit from casting. Although close contact casting may be unfamiliar to some orthopedic surgeons, it can avoid surgery for older patients with ankle fractures, yet result in equivalent functional outcomes. This technique is worth considering when treating this challenging clinical problem.\"\n\nEditor's Note: The author has completed and submitted the ICMJE Form for Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest and none were reported.\n\nTo place an electronic embedded link to these articles in your story These links will be live at the embargo time: http://jama. http://jama.", "question": "Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "A release devotes a fair amount of space to harms from casting as compared with surgery:\n\u201cRadiologic malunion (abnormal healing of a fracture) was more common in the casting group (15 percent vs 3 percent for surgery).

We ask: Should you believe this?\n\nThe Claim: If you drink coffee you\u2019ll live forever! Well, almost: nurses and other health professionals who drink coffee (regular or decaf) had a lower risk of premature death than coffee abstainers.\n\nThe Backstory: . . . is enough to make STAT cross-eyed. Decades of studies have examined links between coffee drinking and health outcomes. Overall, the conclusions have been pro-coffee. Lots of research has linked coffee drinking to a lower risk of dying early, including this, this, and this. Other studies have found associations with lower risk of specific conditions, like this on cardiovascular disease (by many of the same authors as the new study), this on stroke, this on heart failure, and this on diabetes. Most research has found the greatest benefits with daily consumption of around three or four cups \u2014 usually 6 to 8 ounces, and without distinguishing regular from decaf. Fewer studies link coffee to a higher likelihood of dying prematurely, but this classic found a link between 6-plus cups a day and dying of cardiovascular disease, while this 2013 paper, on 43,727 people followed for a median of 17 years, concluded that adults under 55 who averaged more than 4 cups a week had a 56 percent (men) or 130 percent (women) higher risk of dying over the study period than non-coffee drinkers.\n\nFirst Take: The new research, published in Circulation on Monday and funded by the National Institutes of Health, mined three large, ongoing epidemiological studies (74,890 women in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, 93,054 women in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study 2, and 40,557 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study), following them for at least 20 years. Overall, the heaviest coffee-drinkers (more than five cups a day, regular or decaf) had a tiny 2 percent additional risk of dying compared with coffee abstainers. Those drinking 1.1 to 3 cups, and 3.1 to 5 cups, had slightly (9 percent and 7 percent) lower risks of dying.\n\nThen the researchers, led by Dr. Frank Hu of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, did something clever: they ran the analysis on nonsmokers only. That eliminated the stereotypical coffee-swilling, cigarette-sucking types. Result: people drinking 1.1 to 3 cups a day had an 8 percent lower mortality risk, while the 3.1-5-cup crowd had a 15 percent lower mortality risk, mostly due to lower risk of deaths from cardiovascular disease, neurological diseases, type 2 diabetes, and suicide. Even the 5-plus\u2019s had 12 percent lower mortality.\n\nA co-author of the 2013 study linking heavy coffee drinking to higher mortality called the new one \u201cvery good,\u201d especially since it controlled for the deadly effects of smoking, which the earlier one did not. It \u201csupports the safety and efficacy of even high doses of coffee in non-smokers,\u201d said Dr. Carl Lavie, a cardiologist at Ochsner Health System. But given the 2013 research suggesting \u201ctoxicity of high coffee doses\u201d in some people, he said, \u201cto me the most reasonable approach would be to keep coffee intake to two to three cups most days.\u201d\n\nSecond Take: STAT knows better than to get between coffee lovers and their cup o\u2019 joe, so if you want to take this study as permission to keep beating a path to your Keurig, we\u2019re not going to slow you down.\n\nThis is another observational study, where researchers look for associations between people\u2019s freely-chosen diet and other lifestyle decisions and subsequent health outcomes. Correlations do not establish causation: a link between Behavior A and Health Outcome B might or might not mean that A caused B. It might mean instead that a third factor \u2014 another behavior, socioeconomic status, even personality or genetics \u2014 might go hand in hand with Behavior A and be the true cause of Outcome B. Maybe people who drink coffee have some genetic, psychological, or behavioral trait (drinking fewer sugary beverages? eating less junk food?) that causes the observed benefit.\n\nBut surely the population in this study is so huge and socioeconomically similar (all health professionals) that correlation is more likely to reflect causation?\n\nMore likely, yes, but don\u2019t count on it. This same Nurses Health Study, for instance, infamously found a correlation between post-menopausal hormone therapy and lower risk of cardiovascular disease and death, here and here. That turned out to be wrong. The definitive, randomized Women\u2019s Health Initiative study showed that hormone therapy raised the risk of cardiovascular disease, contradicting the NHS and shocking nearly everyone.\n\nTakeaway: Observational studies that associate coffee drinking with health benefits are strongly suggestive but not definitive. If you do want to infer causation from this latest study, know that drinking coffee reduced the absolute mortality risk from 6.8 deaths a year per 1,000 people to, at best, 5.8. That is, each year, coffee would be keeping 1 person in 1,000 from dying.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "This STAT story explained the slightly increased risk of death in those participants in the current study who drank\u00a0very high\u00a0amounts of coffee,", "answer": 1}, {"article": "PITTSBURGH, Dec. 1, 2016 - In the first analysis of how to treat patients on anticoagulants who suffer a major bleeding event, a clinical practice that routinely gives doctors pause, while also evaluating a new drug, University of Pittsburgh researchers aim to provide much-needed guidance to clinicians trying to balance the risks of stroke versus bleeding when determining the best treatment.\n\nThe analysis, published today in the journal Stroke, determined that resuming anticoagulation therapy after a person suffers a major bleeding event was associated with a higher likelihood of stroke-free survival than discontinuing anticoagulation. Furthermore, restarting therapy with the new oral anticoagulant dabigatran was associated with a lower risk of recurrent hemorrhage in these cases than the old standby drug warfarin.\n\nPeople take anticoagulants to avoid blood clots when they have a risk for stroke or heart attack, but the downside is that these medications increase a person's risk of severe bleeding--such as in the brain or gut--because the blood isn't clotting as well as it otherwise might.\n\n\"If a patient who is on an anticoagulant to avoid a stroke has a major bleeding event, doctors are faced with a catch-22: Discontinue the anticoagulant to avoid future bleeding, but again place their patient at increased risk of stroke; or resume the anticoagulant to continue avoiding a stroke, but then have to worry about another bleeding event,\" said lead author Inmaculada Hernandez, Pharm.D., Ph.D., an assistant professor in Pitt's School of Pharmacy, who completed this work as a doctoral student at Pitt's Graduate School of Public Health.\n\n\"It causes a lot of uncertainty for physicians, especially because patients at highest risk of recurrent bleeding also are at highest risk of stroke,\" said co-author Yuting Zhang, Ph.D., associate professor of health policy and management at Pitt Public Health, and Hernandez's doctoral dissertation committee chair.\n\nThe Pitt research team obtained data from 2010 to 2012 for a random sample of Medicare beneficiaries. They then followed nearly 90,000 people who had filled prescriptions for the anticoagulants warfarin, which has been used as a medication since 1954, and dabigatran, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2010. More than 1,500 of those people suffered a major bleeding event while using one of the drugs. About half of those people resumed one of the two anticoagulants a few months after the bleeding, while the others did not.\n\nThe risk of dying from any cause or having a stroke was 23 to 34 percent higher in patients who discontinued anticoagulation therapy compared to those who resumed it. People who took dabigatran after their initial bleeding event had nearly half the risk of another major bleeding event within one year compared with those who took warfarin.\n\n\"Our results should encourage clinicians to seriously consider resuming anticoagulation among patients who survived a major bleeding event, particularly if the source of bleeding was identified and addressed,\" said senior author Samir Saba, M.D., associate professor of medicine and associate chief of cardiology at UPMC Heart and Vascular Institute. \"They should also take into account that the benefit-to-risk ratio of post-hemorrhage use of anticoagulation is not the same for all medications.\"\n\nAdditional authors on this research are Maria M.

That compares to about 5 percent of patients given the standard therapy, interleukin, the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) says.\n\nThat means 60 percent of patients are not living that long \u2014 but it\u2019s still far more than the usual 11-month survival with advanced melanoma.\n\n\u201cIt is definitely a huge benefit over what we have seen in the past,\u201d said ASCO president Dr. Julie Vose, a specialist in blood cancers at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.\n\nMelanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer.

Melanoma is easy to cure when caught early, but it is often hard to tell if a mole or freckle has turned cancerous.

About 15 percent of these patients have what\u2019s called a complete remission, meaning there is no trace of their tumors.

Tumor cells make PD-L1 turn on PD-1 when immune cells approach. Keytruda, an engineered immune protein called a monoclonal antibody, disrupts this signal and lets the immune cells attack the tumor cell.\n\nThe drug works far better in patients whose tumors express more PD-1, meaning they have a lot of PD-1 activity, so the drug will optimally be used jointly with a test for PD-1. There are side-effects, including fatigue, itchiness and rash. It was bad enough for 8 percent of patients that they stopped taking it.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration gave Keytruda accelerated approval for melanoma in 2014.

It is the most common cause of job-related disability. Low back pain affects men and women equally.\n\nMost back pain is short-term, but about 20 percent of people affected by acute low back pain go on to develop chronic low back pain lasting a year or more. A compressed and herniated disk, in which the rubbery cushion between vertebrae impinges on and irritates nearby nerves, is a major cause of low back pain that can radiate to the legs.\n\n\"The nerve root is a sensitive structure that when pinched becomes inflamed and causes pain,\" said lead investigator Alessandro Napoli M.D., Ph.D., an interventional radiologist at Sapienza University of Rome. \"The body reacts with muscle constriction, which decreases the distance between vertebrae, and a vicious cycle is created.\"\n\nThe single-center prospective study included 80 patients experiencing at least three months of low back pain due to a herniated disk that had not responded to conservative treatments including exercise and medication.\n\nThe patients underwent a minimally invasive interventional radiology procedure in which, with the help of CT imaging, a needle is guided to the location of the bulging disc and nerve root.

Data on this drug are slated to be reviewed this summer by an FDA advisory panel. The FDA is not obligated to follow the advice of its expert panels, but it usually does.\n\nPhentermine quickly suppresses appetite, while the controlled-release topiramate decreases appetite and increases satiety throughout the day. \u201cWhen the hunger comes back, the topiramate kicks in,\u201d says study author Suzanne Oparil, MD, a professor of medicine, physiology, and biophysics and director of the vascular biology and hypertension program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

Those who took the medium dose of the pill lost 8% of their body weight at six months and 8.2% by one year.

A subset of four VOCs\u2014called carbonyl compounds because of their carbon base\u2014have been discovered in the exhaled breath of lung cancer patients. Being able to identify this lung cancer \u201csignature\u201d through a simple breath test has emerged as one of the most promising ways to diagnose the disease. Now the test is being used to monitor for disease recurrence.\n\nErin M. Schumer, MD, MPH, Victor van Berkel, MD, PhD, and colleagues from the University of Louisville analyzed breath samples collected before and after surgery from 31 lung cancer patients and compared their carbonyl VOCs levels with samples from 187 healthy patients.\n\nThe researchers found a significant decrease in overall carbonyl VOC levels following surgery; in fact, three of the four carbonyl VOCs normalized after surgery, matching levels in the control group.\n\n\u201cThe rapid normalization of almost all of the four compounds after surgery provides strong evidence that they are directly produced by the tumor environment,\u201d said Dr. Schumer. \u201cThis study confirms that the technology is accurate.\u201d\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death. The American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates that more than 224,000 Americans will be diagnosed with lung cancer this year, and more than 158,000 lung cancer patients will die\u2014that translates to 433 lung cancer deaths per day in the United States.\n\nDr. Schumer said those grim statistics underscore the need for early detection, \u201cWe hope that breath analysis will allow us to diagnose patients with primary or recurrent lung cancer long before they suffer from symptoms, when we have more options for treating them, giving them the best chance for cure.\u201d\n\nCurrently, lung cancer patients are followed after surgery with chest computed tomography (CT) scans, which can be inconvenient, expensive, and expose the patient to radiation. \u201cWe hope that the breath analysis can serve as the primary screening tool for cancer recurrence and a CT scan ordered only if the breath test suggests that there has been a change,\u201d said Dr. van Berkel.\n\nHow the Breath Test WorksThe process of breath analysis is relatively simple. The patient blows a single breath into a specialized balloon. The balloon is then connected to a pump that pulls the breath over a small microchip (smaller than a quarter), trapping the chemicals. The microchip is sent to the lab, where the chemicals are analyzed within hours. Breath collection can be performed in the doctor\u2019s office. The pump is reusable; the balloon, microchip, and lab test together cost around $20, all supporting the increasing acceptance of breath tests as a cost-effective, easy-to-perform, non-invasive, and rapid option for the diagnosis of lung cancer.\n\n\u201cThe great potential with breath analysis is detecting lung cancer at any point, both as a primary screening tool and to follow patients after disease has been treated,\u201d said Dr. van Berkel. \u201cThe technology is pretty robust.

In a study of women age 65 and older, just 30 minutes a day of light exercise\u2014like running errands and cleaning the house\u2014was linked to a lower risk of death.\n\nModerate-intensity exercise, like leisurely bike riding or brisk walking, was associated with an even greater reduction in risk. The authors say that improving doing more light and moderate physical activity could be almost as effective as rigorous exercise at preventing disease and prolonging life. \u201cThe paradigm needs to shift when we think about being active,\u201d says senior author Andrea LaCroix, professor of family medicine and public health at the University of California San Diego.\n\nFor the study, LaCroix and her colleagues asked 6,000 women, ages 65 to 99, to wear activity-tracking accelerometers for seven days as they went about their daily activities. The women were then followed for an average of three years.\n\nBased on the data from the women\u2019s activity trackers, the researchers found that those who got at least 30 minutes of light physical activity a day were 12% less likely to die, compared to those who got less. Those who got an additional 30 minutes of moderate activity were 39% less likely to die.\n\nLight physical activity includes just about any type of behavior that isn\u2019t sitting down: walking to the mailbox, strolling around the neighborhood and doing laundry. Activities like these account for more than 55% of older adults\u2019 daily activity, says LaCroix, so the fact that they were protective in this study is very good news.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been told that this type of activity isn\u2019t enough to do you good,\u201d says LaCroix. \u201cBut what we have here is solid evidence that light physical activity reduces a woman\u2019s risk of dying over the next three to four years\u2014and we see the benefits are substantial and independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.\u201d\n\nThe study could not show a cause-and-effect relationship between activity level and risk of death, only an association. But the link was present in all types of women in the study, including those of all races and ethnicities, women who were obese and those who were not, women with high and low functional abilities and women older and younger than 80.\n\nAs adults get older, they expend more energy doing the same activities they did when they were younger, LaCroix says\u2014so they don\u2019t need to exercise as much, or as intensely, to burn the same amount of calories or get their heart rate up. \u201cWe know that people of different ages need different amounts and intensities of exercise to get the same result,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not one size fits all.\u201d\n\nBut national guidelines still recommend that adults over age 65 follow the same guidelines as younger people: to get at least 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week. And recent analyses, compiled from studies in which adults self-reported their levels of physical activity, have suggested that older adults have to log moderate-to-vigorous exercise in order to reduce their risk of early death.\n\nLaCroix says her new study refutes that research and shows that older adults can still benefit at levels below the moderate-to-vigorous guidelines. Questionnaires used in self-reported studies don\u2019t do a good job of encompassing all the ways people get physical activity throughout the day, she says, which may have skewed previous study results. \u201cWhat makes our study stronger than those others is that we used a device that was able to measure all of the movements we do in our daily lives,\u201d she says.\n\nThe researchers hope their work sparks more discussion about how people\u2014especially older ones\u2014think about exercise and their goals for being active. \u201cI think the current guidelines are discouraging to older people who don\u2019t believe they can do 150 minutes of hard exercise,\u201d LaCroix says. \u201cThey throw up their hands and think, \u2018that\u2019s not for me.\u2019 But everyone does light physical activity, and the idea that doing more of it can have substantial health benefits should be welcome news.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "As the NIH has noted, the benefits of physical activity far outweigh the risks.

Upon walking into a public restroom, you'd likely do just the opposite--abruptly limiting the flow of air through your nose.

Autistic children go right on sniffing in the same way, no matter how pleasant or awful the scent.\n\nThe findings suggest that non-verbal tests related to smell might serve as useful early indicators of ASD, the researchers say.\n\n\"The difference in sniffing pattern between the typically developing children and children with autism was simply overwhelming,\" says Noam Sobel of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.\n\nEarlier evidence had indicated that people with autism have impairments in \"internal action models,\" the brain templates we rely on to seamlessly coordinate our senses and actions. It wasn't clear if this impairment would show up in a test of the sniff response, however.\n\nTo find out, Sobel, along with Liron Rozenkrantz and their colleagues, presented 18 children with ASD and 18 normally developing children (17 boys and 1 girl in each group) with pleasant and unpleasant odors and measured their sniff responses. The average age of children in the study was 7. While typical children adjusted their sniffing within 305 milliseconds of smelling an odor, the researchers report, children on the autism spectrum showed no such response.\n\nThat difference in sniff response between the two groups of kids was enough to correctly classify them as children with or without a diagnosis of ASD 81% of the time. Moreover, the researchers report that increasingly aberrant sniffing was associated with increasingly severe autism symptoms, based on social but not motor impairments.\n\nThe findings suggest that a sniff test could be quite useful in the clinic, although the researchers emphasize that their test is in no way ready for that yet.\n\n\"We can identify autism and its severity with meaningful accuracy within less than 10 minutes using a test that is completely non-verbal and entails no task to follow,\" Sobel says. \"This raises the hope that these findings could form the base for development of a diagnostic tool that can be applied very early on, such as in toddlers only a few months old.

Teixobactin is a recently discovered natural antibiotic which many in the international scientific community believe could lead to creation of the first commercially viable new antibiotic drug in 30 years.\n\nThe Lincoln team has successfully synthesized new simplified versions of teixobactin which harness the same powerful antibiotic effects in a way that could be produced on a commercial scale. Their findings are published in the Royal Society of Chemistry's journal, Chemical Science.\n\nUntil now, scientists attempting to synthesise teixobactin believed they needed to use cationic (or positively charged) amino acids which bind to the bacterial target using a 'side chain'. This meant they had to use either the very rare amino acid found naturally in teixobactin, called enduracididine, or alternative ones which had lower potency against superbugs.\n\nEach amino acid sits at a specific place in teixobactin's structure, and the Lincoln team has now successfully replaced enduracididine - which holds position ten - with two alternative amino acids which are not positively charged. These amino acids lack the 'binding' part, over-turning the prior understanding that enduracididine is essential for to so-called 'target binding' to be highly potent against superbugs.\n\nWith this new knowledge, synthesised versions of teixobactin can be more easily developed, taking the process from up to 30 hours to just ten minutes for a single coupling step - a significant step towards turning teixobactin into a viable new drug. Importantly, the two new simplified forms of teixobactin have also proven to have identical potency against superbugs as the natural form of teixobactin.\n\nDr Ishwar Singh, a specialist in novel drug design and development from the University of Lincoln's School of Pharmacy, is leading the research team. He explained: \"When teixobactin was discovered it was ground breaking in itself as a new antibiotic which kills bacteria without detectable resistance including superbugs such as MRSA. We have been investigating a way to simplify the design while retaining the high potency against resistant bacteria such as MRSA.\n\n\"This simplified design and more efficient synthesise will enable work to be carried out at a commercial level. Enduracididine was severely limiting our ability to do this because of its scarcity, a complex multistep synthesis, and long and repetitive steps of between 16 and 30 hours with high failure rate and very low yields.\n\n\"We needed to make a change to the structure so that we could make the molecule more viable for drug development. We had tried replacing it with other amino acids with a similar make up, but they all were less potent in comparison to the natural form of teixobactin. Now, we have discovered that we can in fact use amino acids which are structurally different, and are commercially-available. They are also 16 times more potent than a clinically-used antibiotic in killing the superbug MRSA, and they were also highly potent against other antibiotic-resistant infections, such as vancomycin resistant enterococci, and tuberculosis.\"\n\nThe work builds on the success of the team's pioneering research to tackle antimicrobial resistance over the past 18 months. Dr Singh is working with colleagues from the School of Life Sciences and the School of Chemistry at the University of Lincoln to develop teixobactins into a viable drug.\n\nIt has been predicted that by 2050 an additional 10 million people will succumb to drug resistant infections each year.

Nearly half the pregnancies among American women are unintended \u2014 unwanted now or within the next two years. And among sexually active teenagers and young adults, the rate of unplanned pregnancy is even higher.\n\nFully 43 percent of these pregnancies follow incorrect or inconsistent uses of contraception. Of course, some couples fail to use any contraception, but others rely on contraceptive methods that have significant failure rates even when properly used.\n\nThese facts prompted a committee of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists this month to urge its members to introduce women of all ages to the most effective and underused methods of reversible contraception: IUDs and hormonal implants. Once inserted, these long-acting methods remove the risk of patient error when a sexually active woman wishes to avoid pregnancy. Their effectiveness rivals that of sterilization.\n\nIn a 2012 study of 7,486 women aged 14 to 45, long-acting reversible contraceptives, or LARCs, were shown to be 20 times as effective in preventing pregnancy than the pill, contraceptive patch or vaginal ring. The risk of an unwanted pregnancy with these other methods was especially high among women under 21, whose rate of unintended pregnancy was nearly double that among older women.\n\nYet fewer than 10 percent of sexually active women currently rely on long-acting reversible contraception, and a major reason is doctors\u2019 reluctance to recommend them. Only about half of obstetrician-gynecologists offer the implant, the committee said, and many physicians use \u201coverly restrictive criteria\u201d when deciding whether to recommend an IUD, especially for adolescents and women who have not yet been pregnant.\n\nGreater LARC use can reduce birthrates among adolescents and, for women of all ages, a reliance upon abortion to prevent unwanted births, the experts wrote in the October issue of Obstetrics & Gynecology.\n\nFurthermore, the higher upfront costs of LARC methods are no longer an impediment for women with insurance obtained through the Affordable Care Act. Megan L. Kavanaugh, a senior research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, which studies reproductive health, said in an interview that \u201call new insurance plans obtained through the act\u2019s exchanges fully cover all contraceptive methods without any co-payments or other out-of-pocket costs.\u201d Title X family planning clinics and Planned Parenthood clinics are more likely than other sources to offer LARC methods, she said.\n\nIn a paper published two years ago, European experts predicted that \u201cafter decades of dominance by \u2018the Pill,\u2019 it is likely that in the future, long-acting reversible contraceptives will become the first-line contraceptive option, owing to their superior contraceptive effectiveness in real-life use, cost effectiveness as well as their established safety profile.\u201d\n\nHere is a summary of the advantages of LARCs, listed by the committee:\n\n\u25a0 They are independent of the sex act and do not depend on the user\u2019s motivation and reliability.\n\n\u25a0 Compared with other reversible methods, they are more effective and have higher rates of continued use and user satisfaction.\n\n\u25a0 There is no need to get frequent supplies and no additional costs once they are inserted, making them highly cost effective.\n\n\u25a0 There are few contraindications for their use, and fertility returns quickly after removal.\n\nFurthermore, the committee stated, \u201calmost all women are appropriate candidates\u201d for the LARC methods currently available. They are an implant that slowly releases the hormone etonogestrel over a period of three years, and four IUDs: the copper T that can be used for up to 10 years, and three IUDs containing the hormone levonorgestrel (two approved for use up to three years, and one approved for up to five years).\n\nIn real-world use, these methods are associated with a one-year pregnancy rate of less than one per 100 women. In contrast, women using the pill, patch or vaginal ring face an annual pregnancy risk of 9 percent; the diaphragm is associated with a 12 percent pregnancy rate, and with condoms, cervical caps and sponges, the rate is 18 percent.\n\n\u201cWhile there is no one best contraceptive method for every woman or every couple, women should have access to all methods and should know how effective the LARCs are,\u201d Dr. Kavanaugh said.\n\nThe etonogestrel implant is a small plastic rod resembling a matchstick that is inserted under the skin in the upper arm. The hormone, a form of progesterone, prevents ovulation and thickens the cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to reach and fertilize an egg. Though the implant can remain in place and effective for three years, it can also be removed sooner if, for example, a woman decides she wants to become pregnant. Typically with the implant, menstrual bleeding diminishes, and after a year, one woman in three stops having periods. However, some women develop longer, heavier periods, and some have increased spotting between periods.\n\nLikewise with the hormonal IUDs. Levonorgestrel, also a progesterone, changes the cervical mucus, blocking the transport of sperm and fertilization of an egg. It also suppresses growth of the uterine lining and thus reduces cramping and heavy menstrual bleeding. Women using it report a significant reduction in menstrual blood loss.\n\nThe copper IUD does not contain hormones. Rather, the copper is toxic to sperm, preventing them from fertilizing an egg. Because it also prevents a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus, the copper IUD can serve as emergency contraception for up to five days following unprotected intercourse.\n\nBoth the implant and IUD can be used by women who are breast-feeding, as well as those who cannot take estrogen. There are few contraindications; nearly all women are eligible for an implant or IUD, according to guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

(May 1, 2018)--An estimated 45 percent of people are at risk of developing knee osteoarthritis (OA) in their lifetime. According to a network meta-analysis research article published in the May 1, 2018 issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (JAAOS), the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) naproxen was ranked most effective in individual knee OA treatment for improving both pain and function, and is considered a relatively safe and low-cost treatment method.\n\nNonsurgical treatments for knee OA supported by previous research evidence include strength training, low-impact aerobic exercises, NSAIDs, and weight loss in individuals with a body mass index over 25. This new research analyzed data from multiple trials to determine the relative effectiveness of various nonsurgical treatments for knee OA. The treatments that were compared and ranked included acetaminophen; ibuprofen; intra-articular (IA) or joint injections of cortisone; platelet-rich plasma (PRP); hyaluronic acid (HA); several NSAIDs, such as naproxen, celecoxib, and diclofenac; and both oral and IA placebo.\n\n\"This is the first comprehensive mixed-comparison analysis comparing best-evidence scientific research and excluding lower quality studies that can bias the outcomes,\" said lead author and orthopaedic surgeon David Jevsevar, MD, MBA. \"Using a statistical ranking technique, we worked to provide evidence regarding which of the most common NSAIDs are most likely to decrease pain and improve function, and we attempted to fill in the gaps in evidence for more inconclusive treatments such as HA, PRP, and corticosteroids.\"\n\nAuthors analyzed 53 randomized controlled trials that examined knee OA treatments for at least 28 days and included a minimum of 30 participants per study group. Knee OA treatments were ranked on a scale of one to five, with one being the most effective. They found the following:\n\u2022 For pain reduction, cortisone injections provided the greatest short-term (4 to 6 weeks) pain relief, followed by ibuprofen, PRP injections, naproxen, and celecoxib.\n\u2022 Naproxen ranked the highest for probability for improving function, followed by diclofenac, celecoxib, ibuprofen, and PRP injections.\n\u2022 Naproxen was ranked the most effective individual knee OA treatment for improving both pain and function followed by cortisone injections, PRP injections, ibuprofen and celecoxib.\n\u2022 HA injections did not achieve a rank in the top five treatments for pain, function, or combined pain and function. An analysis of 12 articles also found that results with HA are not significantly different from those with IA placebo for treatment of knee OA.\n\n\"Because knee OA has both a high disease burden and high treatment costs, additional prospective studies using similar outcomes, timelines, and measures of clinically important changes are needed,\" explained Dr. Jevsevar. \"While the information in this analysis is helpful to physicians, patients also can benefit from these findings and use it with their doctors to weigh all possible treatment options.\"\n\nAlthough the use of NSAIDs for arthritic conditions such as knee OA has potential risks, including heart attack and stroke, existing evidence indicates that naproxen has less potential for adverse cardiovascular events.\n\nMore information about the AAOS and JAAOS\n\nFollow the AAOS on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram \n\nFollow the conversation about JAAOS on Twitter\n\nFrom the Department of Orthopaedics, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH (Dr. Jevsevar), American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, Rosemont, IL (Mr. Shores, Mr. Mullen, Ms. Schulte, and Dr. Cummins), and Franciscan Orthopedic Associates, Tacoma, WA (Dr. Brown).

Then again, this may be a realistic population to study, given that many candidates for hormone therapy are likely to have such health issues.\n\nA $45 million study financed by the National Institute on Aging is under way at 12 medical centers to see if a year of treatment with testosterone will help 800 men aged 65 and older with low levels of the hormone and problems with physical functioning, fatigue and sexual or cognitive performance. The study, in which the men are being randomly assigned to receive the hormone or a look-alike placebo, will also evaluate the hormone\u2019s effects on cardiac risk factors.\n\nStill, this study will not answer the question of whether it is safe to use the hormone for years, even decades, which would be necessary to maintain any benefits. A major concern is whether long-term use would promote the growth of prostate cancer, which is present but hidden in as many as half of older men.\n\n\u201cThere are not many good studies of testosterone in older men,\u201d Dr. William J. Bremner, a urologist at the University of Washington in Seattle, said in an interview. \u201cThe studies are small and the longest of them lasted only three years. We need the same kind of study for testosterone as the Women\u2019s Health Initiative \u2014 several thousand men followed for maybe 10 years. Currently, we\u2019re in limbo as to how to advise patients.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged that the need for such a study for men is \u201cless compelling\u201d because, in contrast to women, who experience an abrupt drop in estrogen at menopause, often with disruptive symptoms, hormone decline in aging men is far more gradual, and symptoms, when they occur, are commonly viewed as normal signs of aging, not hormone deficiency.\n\nA large European study published in the same issue of the journal sought to better determine who, among middle-aged and elderly men, might be candidates for testosterone replacement. Among a sample of 3,369 men aged 40 to 79, researchers at eight European medical centers found that \u201climited physical vigor\u201d and three sexual symptoms \u2014 diminished sexual thoughts and morning erections and erectile dysfunction \u2014 were most closely linked to low levels of testosterone.\n\nAlthough low hormone levels are widely thought to increase a man\u2019s risk of depression, the researchers found that \u201cpsychological symptoms had little or no association with the testosterone level.\u201d\n\nThere are four main approaches to testosterone therapy available in this country: intramuscular injections every one to three weeks; skin applications through a patch or gel; and pellets implanted under the skin that last for months. The patch can cause skin irritation, and the gel can be transferred to others through skin contact unless care is taken to cover the area where it is applied. But oral administration is rarely used because of toxic effects on the liver.\n\nThe most common reason men seek testosterone therapy is waning sexual desire or performance, although the ability of the hormone to relieve sexual symptoms is unpredictable. More than one-quarter of men with normal testosterone levels have such symptoms, and many men with subnormal levels do not. Dr. Bremner said he typically suggests a trial of therapy for up to a year to see if sexual function or other symptoms improve.\n\nCiting the results of many small studies, Dr. Bremner said, \u201cThere is good evidence that testosterone administration can improve muscle mass and strength and increase bone density\u201d in men with subnormal levels. Dr. Abraham Morgentaler, a urologist at Harvard Medical School and author of \u201cTestosterone for Life\u201d (McGraw-Hill, 2009), said in an interview that other noted benefits include a decrease in body fat and total cholesterol and improved blood sugar metabolism.\n\nIn a report on the risks of testosterone therapy, written with Dr. Ernani Luis Rhoden and published in 2004 in The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Morgentaler noted that testosterone has widespread effects throughout the body, but he and Dr. Rhoden concluded that with proper monitoring, any looming hazards can be readily detected.\n\nBefore the most recent study, at doses considered normal, the testosterone gel showed little or no effect on cardiovascular risk, the two doctors reported. Injections could result in harmful thickening of the blood, however, especially if above-normal blood levels of the hormone result.\n\nAlthough testosterone can cause overgrowth of the prostate, studies have not shown harm to urinary function, Dr. Morgentaler said. The risk of prostate cancer is of greater concern, given that suppressing the body\u2019s natural production of testosterone can cause this cancer to regress.

The participants fell into four groups: those with no use or low use of marijuana, early chronic users, those who only smoked during their teens and those who began using it later and continued using the drug. The early chronic users smoked a great deal -- a peak of more than 200 days per year on average when they were 22 years old.\n\nThe researchers found no links to physical or mental health issues -- including depression, psychotic symptoms or asthma -- in any group, even those with very high use.

But there were none.\n\nThey also found no link to a wide range of other health issues: cancer, asthma, respiratory problems, depression, anxiety, allergies, headaches or high blood pressure.\n\nBechtold said the researchers wanted to \"help inform the debate about legalization of marijuana\" but that this is a very complicated issue and one, study, including his own, should not be taken in isolation and should be viewed in context of other studies on teenagers' marijuana use.\n\nOne major limitation of the study is that it ends when the men are in their 30s \"which may be too early for decrements in health to emerge,\" the authors acknowledge. \"Therefore, continued data collection and longer follow-ups are needed.\"\n\nUpdate: The study's findings generated significant controversy along with requests for supplemental analysis, according to the editors of the Psychology of Addictive Behaviors. In a lengthy clarification issued in December 2015, the journal said that by applying different models to look at the data they confirmed that there did not appear to be any link between marijuana use and health issues. However, the reanalysis regarding psychotic disorders contradicted the earlier conclusions -- that there indeed appeared to be a higher risk of psychotic disorders among marijuana users in the study versus non-users that approached statistical significance when using a more liberal test.\n\nYour office thermostat is set for men's comfort.

The women were enduring hot flashes at least twice a day.\n\nThirty women each received real acupuncture that also included a bit of an electric buzz or the inactive placebo pill, 32 women got sham acupuncture, and 28 women received gabapentin (Neurontin). The drug is typically used to treat seizures and nerve pain.\n\nThe women documented their hot flashes in diaries, noting frequency and severity, for 8 weeks of treatment, and then continued to keep track of their hot flashes up to 24 weeks total. The investigators used a hot flash score to see how much frequency and severity changed from when the study started to what the women reported at 8, 12 and 24 weeks.\n\nAcupuncture had the greatest effect on overall hot flash scores at 8 weeks, when all interventions ended, followed by sham acupuncture and then gabapentin. At 24 weeks, 16 weeks after treatments ended, acupuncture was still associated with the greatest reduction in hot flashes. But even those who had sham acupuncture or placebo pills had steeper drops in hot flash scores at 24 weeks than those who took gabapentin.\n\n\"The placebo effects for both acupuncture and drugs are quite intriguing, as they both seem to persist over time,\" Mao said. \"The magnitude of the placebo effect for acupuncture is bigger than for the drug.\"\n\nThe results with the sham acupuncture, which bested gabapentin, suggest that \"there is more than a placebo effect with the sham acupuncture,\" said Dr. Gary Deng, interim chief of the integrative medicine service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. \"There is a component of behavior of doing a sham procedure, so it psychologically may trigger a different kind of reaction from patients versus taking the placebo pill.\"\n\nDeng pointed out that clinicians have come to realize that the placebo effect is very important in treatment. \"In fact, in clinical practice, every doctor uses it all of the time,\" he said. \"The so-called bedside manner or communication with patients -- all of these enhance the effect of the patients feeling they're getting something.\"\n\nNo one is quite sure why placebos work for some people and not for others, said Deng. \"It's like psychotherapy,\" he added. \"Why does it work for some people and not others?\" He suggested that differences in anatomy and genetics might be possible explanations, but said \"there is a fertile field for further research.\"\n\nSome patients might wonder if acupuncture that's helpful for hot flashes among breast cancer patients might be helpful for the hot flashes associated with natural menopause. But Mao pointed out that hot flashes in breast cancer patients are more common, more severe and longer lasting than menopausal hot flashes.\n\nHowever, Deng said that both might have similar causes related to lower estrogen levels. \"Breast cancer survivors have hot flashes because of hormonal repression,\" he said. Menopause also is linked to declining estrogen levels.\n\nOne big distinction between the two populations, though, is that breast cancer survivors do not have the option of hormone replacement therapy open to them because those hormones are linked to breast cancer. Some women undergoing natural menopause still might have that option available. For this reason, most studies of acupuncture for hot flashes have focused on breast cancer survivors, Deng explained.\n\nBut should a woman undergoing natural menopause try acupuncture for hot flashes?\n\n\"For patients suffering symptoms, they can look for all kinds of possible solutions and are better off talking to their doctor to find out what's most appropriate for them,\" Deng said.\n\nVisit the U.S. National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health for more on acupuncture.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Acupuncture is likely safe but we have no idea if the women who received it, the sham acupuncture or gabapentin experienced any adverse effects of those treatments.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "THURSDAY, Jan. 5, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Preliminary findings suggest a drug used to treat another disease might also reduce painful flare-ups in gout patients starting new medication regimens.\n\nIn a new study, the protein-inhibitor drug rilonacept (Arcalyst) appeared to markedly lower the risk of gout flare-ups during the first few months of treatments aimed at lowering uric acid levels.\n\nWhile effective in lowering the risk for gout attacks in the long-term, uric acid-lowering treatment can initially boost the risk for flare-ups as it breaks up and releases the uric acid crystal deposits at the source.\n\n\"To reduce deposits of crystals in the joints, we advise patients to initiate treatment with medications that lower levels of uric acid in the blood,\" study author Dr. H.

Clinics have opened around the United States promising instant relief with their \u201cunique\u201d doses of ketamine in IVs, sprays or pills.

Compared to opioids such as morphine, ketamine isn\u2019t as addictive and doesn\u2019t cause breathing problems. And some studies have shown that ketamine can ease symptoms within hours for the toughest cases.\n\nIts potential effects on depression were discovered in animal experiments in the late 1980s and early 1990s showing that glutamate, a brain chemical messenger, might play a role in depression, and that drugs including ketamine that target the glutamate pathway might work as antidepressants.\n\nConventional antidepressants like Prozac target serotonin, a different chemical messenger, and typically take weeks to months to kick in \u2014 a lag that can cause severely depressed patients to sink deeper into despair.\n\nKetamine\u2019s potential for almost immediate if temporary relief is what makes it so exciting, said Dr. Jennifer Vande Voort, a Mayo Clinic psychiatrist who has used ketamine to treat depression patients since February.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of things that provide that kind of effect.

That amounts to about one-third of the roughly 300 million people with depression worldwide.\n\n\u201cIt truly has revolutionized the field,\u201d changing scientists\u2019 views on how depression affects the brain and showing that rapid relief is possible, said Yale University psychiatrist Dr. Gerard Sanacora, who has done research for or consulted with companies seeking to develop ketamine-based drugs.\n\nBut to become standard depression treatment, he said, much more needs to be known.\n\nLast year, Sanacora co-authored an American Psychiatric Association task force review of ketamine treatment for mood disorders that noted the benefits but said \u201cmajor gaps\u201d remain in knowledge about long-term effectiveness and safety. Most studies have been small, done in research settings and not in the real world.\n\nWhen delivered through an IV, ketamine can cause a rapid increase in heart rate and blood pressure that could be dangerous for some patients. Ketamine also can cause hallucinations that some patients find scary.\n\n\u201cThere are some very real concerns,\u201d Sanacora said. \u201cWe do know this drug can be abused, so we have to be very careful about how this is developed.\u201d\n\nDr. Rahul Khare, an emergency medicine specialist in Chicago, first learned about ketamine\u2019s other potential benefits a decade ago from a depressed and anxious patient he was preparing to sedate to fix a repeat dislocated shoulder.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Doc, give me what I got last time. For about three weeks after I got it I felt so much better,\u2019\u201d Khare recalled.\n\nKhare became intrigued and earlier this year began offering ketamine for severe depression at an outpatient clinic he opened a few years ago. He also joined the American Society for Ketamine Physicians, formed a year ago representing about 140 U.S. doctors, nurses, psychologists and others using ketamine for depression or other nonapproved uses.\n\nThere are about 150 U.S. ketamine clinics, compared with about 20 three years ago, said society co-founder Dr. Megan Oxley.\n\nKhare said the burgeoning field \u201cis like a new frontier\u201d where doctors gather at meetings and compare notes. He has treated about 50 patients with depression including Pestikas. They\u2019re typically desperate for relief after failing to respond to other antidepressants. Some have lost jobs and relationships because of severe depression, and most find that ketamine allows them to function, Khare said.\n\nTypical treatment at his clinic involves six 45-minute sessions over about two weeks, costing $550 each. Some insurers will pay about half of that, covering Khare\u2019s office visit cost. Patients can receive \u201cbooster\u201d treatments. They must sign a four-page consent form that says benefits may not be long-lasting, lists potential side effects, and in bold letters states that the treatment is not government-approved.\n\nAt a recent session, Pestikas\u2019s seventh, she leaned back on a reclining white examining-room chair as a nurse hooked her up to a heart and blood pressure monitor. She grimaced as a needle was slipped into the top of her left palm. Khare reached up with a syringe to inject a small dose of ketamine into an IV bag hanging above the chair, then dimmed the lights, pulled the window curtains and asked if she had questions and was feeling OK.\n\nPestikas listened to music on her iPhone and watched psychedelic videos. She said it was like \u201ca controlled acid trip\u201d with pleasant hallucinations. The trip ends soon after the IV is removed, but Pestikas said she feels calm and relaxed the rest of the day, and that the mood boost can last weeks.\n\nStudies suggest that a single IV dose of ketamine far smaller than used for sedation or partying can help many patients gain relief within about four hours and lasting nearly a week or so.\n\nExactly how ketamine works is unclear, but one idea is that by elevating glutamate levels, ketamine helps nerve cells re-establish connections that were disabled by depression, said ketamine expert Dr. Carlos Zarate, chief of experimental therapies at the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\nA small Stanford University study published in August suggested that ketamine may help relieve depression by activating the brain\u2019s opioid receptors.\n\nJanssen Pharmaceuticals and Allergan are among drug companies developing ketamine-like drugs for depression. Janssen leads the effort with its nasal spray esketamine. The company filed a new drug application in September.\n\nMeanwhile, dozens of studies are underway seeking to answer some of the unknowns about ketamine including whether repeat IV treatments work better for depression and if there\u2019s a way to zero in on which patients are most likely to benefit.\n\nUntil there are answers, Zarate of the mental health institute said ketamine should be a last-resort treatment for depression after other methods have failed.\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

Hormone treatment gives the body a smoother landing from menopause to post-menopause.\n\nBut in 2002, when concerns were raised by a set of studies by the Women\u2019s Health Initiative of the National Institutes of Health showing hormones correlated with elevated breast cancer, heart disease and stroke risk, women and their doctors hit the brakes.\n\nFor most women, menopausal symptoms degrade quality of life for at least some amount of time, maybe two years, maybe as long as 12. Even after the Women\u2019s Health Initiative news broke, some women couldn\u2019t face the changes without hormone treatment.\n\nNow doctors are once again saying they shouldn\u2019t have to.\n\nThe difference? For one thing, the conclusions of the study have been discredited by subsequent studies. Many women in the Women\u2019s Health Initiative study were well past menopause, were obese or were smokers and therefore already at risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nFor another, the formulations used were less safe in their dosage, mix of hormones and delivery method (pills, which travel through the liver and can cause clots).\n\nThe sheer number of choices today and the need for a thorough initial health assessment make the decision on hormone therapy highly dependent on close communication between a woman and her doctor, experts say.\n\n\u201cSome women need higher doses, some need lower doses. Once a woman is educated, then she knows what to go in and ask for. If a doctor won\u2019t work with you, then find another doctor,\u201d says Dr. Marina Johnson, a Dallas endocrinologist and pharmacist and author of Outliving Your Ovaries: An Endocrinologist Weighs the Risks and Rewards of Treating Menopause With Hormone Replacement Therapy.\n\nDr. Noushin A. Firouzbakht, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Fort Worth, says that despite the alarm provoked by the Women\u2019s Health Initiative study, much was learned, especially about the ideal candidate for hormone replacement.\n\n\u201cWe also learned that we see fewer strokes and heart attacks from non-oral methods like a patch or a cream,\u201d she says. \u201cThe rule of thumb now is the lowest dose for the shortest amount of time. It\u2019s no longer that you need to stay away from hormone replacement therapy, it\u2019s that you need to use it wisely.\u201d\n\nThat wisdom comes from a careful medical assessment and ongoing surveillance of blood pressure, blood work, breast changes, side effects and effectiveness.(Women who\u2019ve had breast cancer cannot take hormone replacements.)\n\n\u201cThis requires a thorough exam and a thorough history, and individualized care, but women need to know: It\u2019s not a death sentence or a dependence. It\u2019s an unfortunate thing that that\u2019s out there,\u201d Firouzbakht says, \u201cbecause women also need to know: You don\u2019t have to suffer, you don\u2019t have to have incontinence or vaginal prolapse or hot flashes. There is help available. It\u2019s a process, but hormone replacement therapy is helping women have a better life in an era when they live longer.\u201d\n\nJohnson, Firouzbakht and other experts will tell you that hormone therapy protects against heart disease, a much more common killer of women than breast cancer, as well as against dementia, colon cancer, osteoporosis and other health issues.\n\nThe doctors emphasized not just the medical benefits, but that the treatment can enable and boost a woman\u2019s overall day-to-day existence, too. Too many women have been taught to accept suffering in this stage of life, they say. Johnson notes that in her book, she included chapters aimed at young women far from menopause in an effort to dispel that notion.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when most women were just patted on the head and told, \u2018Honey, that\u2019s just what happens when you get old,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cBut this is going to help you improve the quality of your life and prevent serious diseases. Why wouldn\u2019t you want to learn about it?\u201d\n\nBio-identical hormones, which come from plants, are getting a lot of attention and add to the confusion about the treatment. Johnson, who runs the Institute of Endocrinology and Preventive Medicine in Dallas, says she only trusts the quality-controlled, safety-tested pharmaceutical bio-identical hormones that are made by drug companies and approved by the Food and Drug Administration. (Bio-identical hormones are made from plants. Still commonly prescribed synthetic drugs are made from the urine of pregnant mares, and, although they are FDA-approved, she considers them less effective and less safe.)\n\nJohnson, who runs the Institute of Endocrinology and Preventive Medicine in Dallas, says she only trusts the quality-controlled, safety-tested formulations that are made by pharmaceutical companies and approved by the Food and Drug Administration, whether the hormones come from plants or equine sources. (Older, still available drugs are made from the urine of pregnant mares).\n\nFirouzbakht prescribes pharmaceutical hormones and also works with a pharmacy she trusts to develop bio-identical hormone combinations for some patients. Such custom compounds are not FDA-approved.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what formulation of the hormones you are using, it\u2019s the surveillance of it all that is very important,\u201d Firouzbakht says. \u201cWe need to know about side effects, unwanted adverse effects; those risk factors don\u2019t go away with bio-identical hormones.

They speculate that good nutrition may promote brain growth and cognitive development.\n\n\"We have found some evidence to suggest that a diet associated with increasing consumption of foods that are high in fat, sugar and processed foods in early childhood is associated with small reductions in IQ in later childhood,\" said lead researcher Kate Northstone, a research fellow in the department of social medicine at the University of Bristol.\n\nA more health-conscious diet was associated with small increases in IQ, she said.\n\nChildren should be encouraged to eat healthy foods from an early age, she said. \"We know this is important for physical growth and development, but it may also be important for mental ability,\" she added.\n\nFor the study, published online Feb. 7 in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, Northstone's team collected data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children on 3,966 children born in 1991 and 1992.\n\nThe children's parents had answered questions about their kids' diets at age 3, 4, 7 and 8.5 years. The children's IQs were measured using the standard Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children when they were 8.5 years old.\n\nThe researchers identified three basic diets: \"processed,\" crammed with fats, sugar and convenience foods; a \"traditional\" diet high in meats and vegetables; and a \"health conscious\" diet with lots of fruit, vegetables, salads, fish, rice and pasta.\n\nChildren who ate a diet high in processed foods at age 3 had a lower IQ at 8.5 years than kids with a healthy diet. For every one point increase in processed foods consumption, they lost 1.67 points in IQ. Conversely, every one point increase in healthy eating translated into a 1.2 point increase in IQ, the researchers found.\n\nThe key seemed to be the diet at age 3, since diet at 4 and 7 seemed to have no effect on IQ, the research team noted.

Diet has been extensively studied as a modifiable risk factor in the development of breast cancer but epidemiologic evidence on the effect of specific dietary factors is inconsistent.\n\nThe Mediterranean diet is known for its abundance of plant foods, fish and especially olive oil. Miguel A. Mart\u00ednez-Gonz\u00e1lez, M.D., of the University of Navarra in Pamplona and CIBEROBN in Madrid, Spain, and coauthors analyzed the effects of two interventions with the Mediterranean diet (supplemented with extra virgin olive oil [EVOO] or nuts) compared with advice to women to follow a low-fat diet. Study participants in the two intervention groups were given EVOO (one liter per week for the participants and their families) or mixed nuts (30 grams per day: 15 grams of walnuts, 7.5 grams of hazelnuts and 7.5 grams of almonds).\n\nThe study was conducted within the framework of the large PREDIMED (Prevenci\u00f3n con Dieta Mediterr\u00e1nea) trial, which was designed to test the effects of the Mediterranean diet on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2009, 4,282 women (ages 60 to 80 and at high risk of cardiovascular disease) were recruited. Women were randomly assigned to the Mediterranean diet supplemented with EVOO (n=1,476), the Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts (n=1,285) or the control diet with advice to reduce their dietary intake of fat (n=1,391).\n\nThe women were an average age of 67.7 years old, had an average body mass index of 30.4, most of them had undergone menopause before the age of 55 and less than 3 percent used hormone therapy. During a median follow-up of nearly five years, the authors identified 35 confirmed incident (new) cases of malignant breast cancer.\n\nThe authors report that women eating a Mediterranean diet supplemented with EVOO showed a 68 percent (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio of 0.32) relatively lower risk of malignant breast cancer than those allocated to the control diet. Women eating a Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts showed a nonsignificant risk reduction compared with women in the control group.\n\nThe authors note a number of limitations in their study including that breast cancer was not the primary end point of the trial for which the women were recruited; the number of observed breast cancer cases was low; the authors do not have information on an individual basis on whether and when women in the trial underwent mammography; and the study cannot establish whether the observed beneficial effect was attributable mainly to the EVOO or to its consumption within the context of the Mediterranean diet.\n\n\"The results of the PREDIMED trial suggest a beneficial effect of a MeDiet [Mediterranean diet] supplemented with EVOO in the primary prevention of breast cancer. Preventive strategies represent the most sensible approach against cancer. The intervention paradigm implemented in the PREDIMED trial provides a useful scenario for breast cancer prevention because it is conducted in primary health care centers and also offers beneficial effects on a wide variety of health outcomes. Nevertheless, these results need confirmation by long-term studies with a higher number of incident cases,\" the authors conclude.\n\nIn a related editor's note, Mitchell H. Katz, M.D., a deputy editor of JAMA Internal Medicine, writes: \"Of course, no study is perfect. This one has a small number of outcomes (only 35 incident cases of breast cancer), the women were not all screened for breast cancer with mammography, they were not blinded to the type of diet they were receiving, and all were white, postmenopausal and at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Still, consumption of a Mediterranean diet, which is based on plant foods, fish and extra virgin olive oil, is known to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and is safe. It may also prevent breast cancer. We hope to see more emphasis on Mediterranean diet to reduce cancer and cardiovascular disease and improve health and well-being.\"\n\nEditor's Note: Authors made conflict of interest and funding/support disclosures.

But up to 20 percent of patients with a high risk of relapse are not cured. That could change with the results from a clinical trial co-led by investigators from NYU Langone Medical Center, which shows giving high doses of a commonly-used chemotherapy drug increases the survival rate for these patients.\n\nThe high-dose methotrexate protocol outlined in the study - along with a parallel finding that the steroid decadron is beneficial for younger (but not older) patients - has quickly become the standard practice for the treatment of high-risk ALL patients in North America, the researchers report in the April XX issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\nFor more than 50 years, ALL patients have been treated with a combination of steroids and methotrexate, among other agents. Patients classified as high risk for relapse--those with a high white blood cell count or who are more than 10 years old--are treated with a standard phase of therapy where methotrexate is given in a gradual, escalating dosage. The current study showed that an alternative schedule of high-dose methotrexate was superior. Prior to the release of the initial study results, which were first presented last year at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the standard of care for high-risk ALL patients in North America was escalating methotrexate.\n\n\"One of the improvements in outcome for ALL overall has been using methotrexate in a more intense fashion, by giving higher doses,\" said senior investigator William L. Carroll, MD, the Julie and Edward J. Minskoff Professor of Pediatrics, director of the Stephen D. Hassenfeld Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders at NYU Langone and director emeritus of NYU Langone's Perlmutter Cancer Center. \"We designed this study to compare high dose and escalating methotrexate to determine the best way to use this drug to increase the survival of high-risk ALL patients.\"\n\nThis was a large-scale study involving pediatric cancer centers across the country. More than 3,000 patients with high-risk ALL were enrolled in the randomized clinical trial, which was run by the Children's Oncology Group, a multi-institutional clinical trials consortium supported by the National Cancer Institute. The investigators found that patients in either arm responded very well overall to treatments, but those in the high dose group had a significantly better outcome, by 5 to 6 percent, which translated into a significantly decreased relapse rate for these patients.\n\nThe clinical protocol also examined how to best use a steroid formulation called decadron to treat high-risk ALL patients. Steroids as a class of drugs are one of the most effective medications in the treatment of ALL. Previous studies by the Children's Oncology Group showed that in standard risk ALL patients--those with low white blood cell counts or under 10 years of age--decadron prevented relapse in both the spinal fluid and in the bone marrow. Decadron, however, can increase the infection rate, particularly in high-risk ALL patients, when given for the full 28-day induction period.\n\nDuring this clinical trial, the investigators decreased the duration of decadron from 28 days to 14 to determine if patients could avoid the side effect of increased infection while still benefiting from the steroid's anti-leukemic effects. They found that patients 10 years and older saw no benefit from decadron, and, in fact, were at much higher risk for a debilitating bone condition called osteonecrosis. Patients under 10 years of age, however, did benefit from the shorter decadron exposure with no increased side effects.\n\n\"The improvement in cure rates for ALL over the last few decades, for the most part, has not come through the introduction of new medications, but through using existing medications in new ways, in terms of their dose and schedule,\" Dr. Carroll said. \"This clinical trial illustrates that despite what seem to be remarkable outcomes for kids with ALL, we have not reached a plateau.

The other men were told to continue their regular diet but not to eat any tree nuts.\n\nWalnuts are the only nuts with appreciable levels of omega-3 fatty acids, which some studies of male infertility have linked to better sperm quality, says researcher Wendie Robbins, PhD, of the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. Animal and human studies have shown that omega-3 fats and other polyunsaturated fatty acids \u201cplay critical roles in sperm maturation and membrane function,\u201d Robbins\u2019 team writes.\n\nPrevious research has shown that men with poor sperm counts saw improvement after taking fish oil supplements high in omega-3 fats, Robbins says. And a study of men attending a fertility clinic, published in May by the journal Human Reproduction, found that high intake of omega-3 fats was linked to more normal sperm size and shape, while high intake of saturated fats was related to lower sperm concentration.\n\nIn the new study, most of the walnut eaters snacked on the shelled whole nuts straight out of the package, Robbins says. Others mixed them with applesauce and cinnamon in a blender or chopped them up and added them to meatloaf, hamburger, and spaghetti sauce.\n\nBefore and after the experiment, the men\u2019s semen quality was analyzed by a researcher who did not know which ones had eaten walnuts.

(1)\n\nThis paper emphasized that overall diet quality, rather than individual foods, may have a greater impact on reducing risk of physical function impairments. Specifically, diet quality traits most associated with reduced rates of incident physical impairment were higher intake of fruits and vegetables; lower intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, trans fat, and sodium; and moderate alcohol intake. Among food components, the strongest relations were found for increased intakes of oranges, orange juice, apples, pears, romaine or leaf lettuce, and walnuts.\n\n\"There's a lot of research that looks at specific health conditions in aging, such as diabetes and heart disease, but less attention to research on quality of life and ability to maintain independence with aging,\" said Dr. Francine Grodstein, ScD, professor of medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. \"The simple message from this study is that eating an overall healthy diet, including certain foods, such as walnuts and other whole foods, may help women with the ability to do key everyday tasks as they age, like carrying groceries or dressing themselves.\"\n\nThe researchers looked at data from 54,762 women in the Nurses' Health Study, which tracked women for over 30 years. Between 1992 and 2008, the women were asked questions about their physical function, including their ability to perform basic activities of daily living. This new paper prospectively examined the association between the dietary habits of the participants and subsequent impairment in physical function. Diet was assessed using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI-2010), a measure of diet quality that incorporates foods and nutrients predictive of chronic disease risk based on scientific evidence.\n\n\"These results add to the large body of evidence that outline the many benefits of a healthy diet for women. Additional research is needed to better understand how diet and lifestyle choices can help maintain our health and well-being as we age,\" said Dr. Grodstein.\n\nThere are numerous possible active properties in walnuts that may be contributing factors in providing health benefits. Walnuts are unique among nuts in that they are primarily composed of polyunsaturated fat (13 grams per ounce), which includes alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), the plant-based omega-3 fatty acid. They are the only nut to contain a significant amount of ALA with 2.5 grams per one ounce serving.\n\nSome study limitations should be considered. The sample only included women, so these results may not be generalizable to men. Additionally, participants were not assigned to eat walnuts or other foods, and were just asked about their dietary choices. It is also possible that subjects may have misreported their dietary intake since this information was collected by questionnaires. In addition, because this is an observational study, residual confounding cannot be ruled out (i.e. that other lifestyle habits which are more common in adults who eat walnuts could contribute to the study findings); and, thus, the results should be interpreted with caution.\n\nThis research was supported in part by the California Walnut Commission (CWC). The CWC has supported health-related research on walnuts for more than 25 years. While the CWC does provide funds and/or walnuts for various projects, the actual studies are conducted independently by researchers who design the experiments, interpret the results and write the manuscripts.\n\nThe California Walnut Commission, established in 1987, is funded by mandatory assessments of the growers.

The study began in the 1980s, and along the way has recorded valuable data from participants, including diabetes test data.\n\nSelvin's group analyzed that data, and reported that a positive result for glucose and HbA1c from just a single blood sample can confirm type 2 diabetes.\n\nThis could change care, \"potentially allowing a major simplification of current clinical practice guidelines,\" Selvin said in a university news release. \"Doctors are already doing these [glucose and HbA1c] tests together -- if a patient is obese, for example, and has other risk factors for diabetes, the physician is likely to order tests for both glucose and HbA1c from a single blood sample.\n\n\"It's just that the guidelines don't clearly let you use the tests from that one blood sample to make the initial diabetes diagnosis,\" she explained.\n\nDiabetes is treatable, but about 3 million Americans with the disease don't know they have it.\n\n\"I'm hoping that these results will lead to a change in the clinical guidelines when they are revised in early 2019, which could make identifying diabetes a lot more efficient in many cases,\" Selvin said.\n\n\"Diabetes moves fast, and the cost of diabetes has increased more than 20 percent since 2012,\" noted Dr. Robert Courgi.

That previous finding was \u201cvery good news in the field,\u201d said Dr. Bruce Johnson of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, who treats lung cancer patients and reviewed the results for Reuters Health.\n\nThis latest study, published in the journal Lung Cancer, looked at death rates in a different, smaller population of heavy smokers, and estimated that those who received up to two CT scans would have between a 36 and 64 percent lower risk of dying, compared to those who went unscreened.\n\nThe data are \u201cconsistent\u201d with earlier studies but there are still many issues to resolve regarding lung cancer screening, Johnson said.\n\nFor one, scientists haven\u2019t yet worked out how often to screen people, and when to start. It is not clear when or how guidelines for lung cancer screening could be drawn up, and until they are, insurers including government programs such as Medicare are unlikely to pay the average $300 cost of a scan.\n\nFurthermore, an April study showed that 21 percent of a patient\u2019s initial lung CT scans show suspicious lesions that turn out not to be cancer, but lead to needless invasive follow-up procedures and radiation exposure, as well as stress and anxiety for patients and their families.\n\nThe high so-called \u201cfalse positive\u201d rate is an issue, said Dr. James Hanley of McGill University, who also reviewed the findings for Reuters Health, but many mammograms also find lesions that turn out to be benign. And for lung cancer, doctors know there is a high false-positive rate and have a set protocol to follow in order to determine which lesions are dangerous, added Johnson.\n\nLung cancer kills 1.2 million people a year globally and it will kill 157,000 people in the United States alone this year, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nTobacco use accounts for some 85 percent of lung cancer cases in the U.S., and one estimate puts a smoker\u2019s lifetime absolute risk of developing lung cancer between 12 percent and 17 percent. Five-year survival rates for lung cancer are low.\n\nIn recent years, CT scans, in particular, have been promoted by some hospitals and advocacy groups for lung cancer screening, even though studies had not yet shown definitively whether such screening saves lives.\n\nIn 2006, Dr. Claudia Henschke, currently based at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and Arizona State University, caused a stir when she published a study concluding that 80 percent of lung-cancer deaths could be prevented through widespread use of spiral CT.\n\nHer ideas were controversial to start with, especially when other researchers found her work had been paid for by a tobacco company.\n\nIn the current study, funded in part by manufacturers of CT scanners (along with government and other sources), Henschke and her colleagues compared outcomes for nearly 8,000 smokers and former smokers who volunteered to undergo CT scans to outcomes in two sets of people with smoking histories who were not scanned.\n\nThe three groups of people had some important differences, such as in average age and how long and heavily they had smoked, so the researchers had to use mathematical tools to try to eliminate the influence of those differences, said Hanley. For instance, to compare death rates, the researchers tracked how many people died among those who were screened, then pulled out all the people with similar underlying characteristics in the other two groups and looked at their death rates, Hanley explained.\n\nA total of 64 people died in the screened population, the authors report \u2014 but applying the death rate among people with the same underlying characteristics in one of the unscreened populations, they estimated that the number of deaths would have been 100. This translates into a 36 percent lower risk of dying among the screened population.\n\nApplying the same methods to the other unscreened population, the authors estimated that screening was associated with a 64 percent lower risk of dying.\n\nOverall, research is suggesting that CT scans of people at risk of lung cancer might make a dent in cancer mortality, and it\u2019s possible that more frequent screening might make an even bigger dent, Hanley noted. \u201cIf screening is going to work, you\u2019ve got to keep at it.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "\n\n\nWhile too many news reports take a \u201cwhy not?\u201d attitude toward medical screening tests, this story confronts some of the potential harms.

The drug could also be used to reduce postpartum bleeding, which the researchers say causes some 100,000 deaths a year worldwide.\n\nIn fact, a trial to see whether TXA can reduce postpartum bleeding has started, the team noted.\n\nLevy however, cautioned that the results of this study apply only to TXA and do not mean that people should try similar drugs hoping for similar results.\n\n\"Everybody wants to be creative, but you have to look at the data, and they used TXA,\" Levy said. \"You can't get creative and say 'Ah, one of the other drugs will do the same thing' -- you don't know that, and that's one of my concerns.\"\n\nFor more information on trauma, visit the U.S. National Institute of General Medical Science.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story correctly\u00a0states that the researchers observed no increase in clots in the patients receiving TXA, earning enough for a satisfactory.

Higher soy intake was also associated with less reported fatigue. The breast cancer survivors studied included 173 non-Hispanic white and 192 Chinese Americans including US-born Chinese and Chinese immigrants.\n\nResearchers say breast cancer survivors often experience side effects from cancer treatments that can persist months or years after completion of treatment. For example, because many treatments designed to prevent breast cancer recurrence inhibit the body's production or use of estrogen, the hormone that can fuel breast cancer growth, breast cancer patients often experience hot flashes and night sweats, among other side effects.\n\nThe lead author on the study, Sarah Oppeneer Nomura, PhD, of Georgetown Lombardi, said that while further research is needed in larger study populations and with more detailed dietary data, this project addresses an important gap in research on the possible role of lifestyle factors, such as dietary habits, in relation to side effects of treatments.\n\n\"These symptoms can adversely impact survivors' quality of life and can lead them to stopping ongoing treatments, she says. \"Understanding the role of life style factors is important because diet can serve as a modifiable target for possibly reducing symptoms among breast cancer survivors.\"\n\nWhen study participants were evaluated separately by race/ethnicity, associations were significant among white breast cancer survivors; however; while a trend was seen in the benefit for Chinese women, results were not statically significant. Researchers explain Chinese women typically report fewer menopausal symptoms. Most of them also consume cruciferous vegetables and soy foods, making it difficult to see a significant effect in this subgroup. Indeed, in this study, Chinese breast cancer survivors ate more than twice as much soy and cruciferous vegetables.\n\nWhether the reduction in symptoms accounts for longtime use of soy and cruciferous vegetables needs further investigation, says the study's senior author, Judy Huei-yu Wang, PhD, of Georgetown Lombardi's Cancer Prevention and Control Program.\n\nResults obtained in preclinical studies in animals show that biologically active compounds present in both soy and cruciferous vegetables cause breast cancer cells to grow, but have opposite effects in animals that consume these compounds well before cancer is diagnosed and continue consuming them during and after cancer treatments.\n\nUntil more research is conducted, breast cancer patients should not suddenly start eating soy, if they have not consumed it before, says Leena Hilakivi-Clarke, PhD, a professor of oncology at Georgetown Lombardi and a co-author of the study.\n\nResearchers also found suggestive associations with lower reporting of other symptoms, including joint problems, hair thinning/loss and memory less in women who consumed more soy foods, but these associations did not reach statistical significance.\n\nPhytochemicals, or bioactive food components, such as isoflavones in soy foods and glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables may be the source of the benefit, researchers say. Isoflavones bind to estrogen receptors and exert weak estrogenic effects, among other effects. Glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables influence levels of metabolizing enzymes that can modulate inflammation and levels of estrogen, possibly attenuating treatment-related symptoms.\n\nCo-authors of the study include Chiranjeev Dash, MBBS, MPH, PhD, Leena Hilakivi-Clarke, PhD, and Yun-Ling Zhen, MPH, PhD, from Georgetown Lombardi; Yi-Tin Hwang, PhD, from National Taipei University, Taiwan; Scarlett Lin Gomez, MPH, PhD, from the Cancer Prevention Institute of California; Teresa T.

Forty-nine of the deep brain stimulation patients, or 40%, had 82 serious adverse events, compared with 11% of the drug patients, who had 19 serious adverse events.\n\nWeaver said 99% of the adverse events were resolved within six months, including some cases in which an infection required the removal of the generator from the chest.\n\nThere also was one death related to the surgery involving a patient who had bleeding in the brain, went into a coma and died several days later, she said.\n\nDeep brain stimulation also is expensive. At Froedtert Hospital the procedure costs about $120,000, an amount that generally is covered by Medicare and private insurance.\n\nThe hospital has done about 300 of the procedures since 2005, said Brad Hiner, an associate professor of neurology at the Medical College of Wisconsin and neurologic director of the hospital's deep brain stimulation program.\n\n\"This (the JAMA study) is the largest, most complete and thorough analysis of deep brain stimulation to date,\" Hiner said.\n\nSome neurologists remain unconvinced about the benefits of the therapy.\n\n\"You are doing something pretty invasive,\" said Paul Nausieda, director of the Regional Parkinson's Center at Aurora Sinai Medical Center in Milwaukee. \"It's got too many downside issues.\"\n\nNausieda said much of the benefit found in the study could be due to a placebo effect.\n\nBeyond that, doctors need to do a better job of optimizing drug therapy, he said, noting that there are thousands of potential combinations of drugs that can be used to control symptoms.\n\nNausieda said that of the more than 5,000 Parkinson's patients he has seen, only about 100 were candidates for deep brain stimulation.\n\n\"It's certainly not a breakthrough,\" he said.\n\nStill, deep brain stimulation and several other potential therapies in the growing field of neurostimulation have created a buzz in the medical community.\n\nClinical trials involving different forms of neurostimulation are looking into its effectiveness in treating a range of disorders, including epilepsy, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and tinnitus, although doctors acknowledge they don't know how the treatments actually work.\n\nIn a sense it's a field of science that works backward: Stimulation is applied to the brain, some people get better, and doctors try to figure out why.\n\n\"We haven't the foggiest notion,\" said UW's Montgomery. \"(But) we used aspirin long before we knew how it worked. God watches out for fools and little children.

It reduces risks to an \"absolute minimum\" by moving the catheter insertion to the arm, the judges said, replacing a complex wire-guided procedure through the neck, which is typically used to monitor the heart during a hospital stay for very ill patients.\n\nHis breakthrough was also chosen by hospital-based clinical experts to participate in the 2010 Innovation Celebration, a national program run by Premier, a hospital-owned group purchasing organization. Premier Chief Operating Officer Mike Alkire says the products selected have the potential to improve safety and quality while cutting the cost of health care.\n\nReavill plans to hire 13 to 20 disabled vets to get the production off the ground \u2014 with the goal of hiring up to 18,000 if the device goes national. He recently procured a bank loan agreement and is hoping the award recognition and hospitals' willingness to try the catheter will attract a venture capitalist.\n\nCalled the ReavillMED CV, the Food and Drug Administration-cleared device includes a catheter called a PICC line, IV tubing that sheathes it to provide sterility, and a transducer that can directly measure blood pressure to help determine needed fluid levels. The catheter is inserted into the arm and travels to the heart within 20 to 30 seconds via the bloodstream. Traditional heart catheterization through a vein in the neck can take 20 minutes or longer.\n\nReavill likes to say it's \"stupidly simple\" because the individual parts have been around for decades, but no one had thought of this particular configuration before.\n\n\"It's old technologies put together in a different way to enable established medical treatments to be done earlier,\" Reavill says.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether that saved time will result in saved lives. But because it's self-contained, the catheter theoretically should provide little margin for contamination that can lead to infection. It can be inserted in a nonsterile environment such as an emergency room.\n\nIn 1994, Reavill says, his father survived a complicated angioplasty with a high mortality rate, only to die three weeks later of a staph infection that was caused by a central line catheter inserted into his heart through a neck vein.\n\nA venous heart catheter inserted through the neck, the traditional approach, requires painstaking preparation of the insertion area and a \"pseudo-operative field,\" says Dr. Andrew Dennis, attending surgeon at Stroger Hospital's trauma and burn units and a clinical researcher.\n\nDennis believes the ReavillMED CV shows a \"tremendous amount of promise,\" and he wants to test the first 50 catheters Reavill can provide. If the device lives up to expectations, the hospital will probably use it in patient resuscitation, Dennis said. He also plans to research whether quicker central venous catheterization improves patient resuscitation efforts.\n\nDennis adds that the catheter could prove useful in patients with sepsis, or blood poisoning, which strikes about 750,000 Americans every year. Of those, between 28 and 50 percent die, according to the National Institute of General Medical Sciences.\n\n\"Once a person presents with septic shock, the catheter is an early aid that can guide the way a patient is managed,\" Dennis says. \"You get an objective number and it becomes less art, less gestalt and more evidence-based.\"\n\nSouthern Illinois Healthcare, a three-hospital system that is considering use of Reavill's catheter, has a team of specially trained nurses who install catheters in the neck, says Dr. James Miller, chief medical officer.

Rather than prepping patients with iodine-alcohol \u2014 a common antiseptic combination in C-sections \u2014 the research indicates that chlorhexidine-alcohol is significantly more effective. The researchers argue that the evidence is strong enough to change standard skin-prep practices for C-sections.\n\nThe study appears online Feb. 4 in The New England Journal of Medicine and coincides with a presentation at the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine\u2019s Annual Meeting in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest complications of surgery, and of C-sections in particular, is infection,\u201d said first author Methodius G. Tuuli, MD, assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology. \u201cFor a new mother who needs to care for her baby \u2014 which is stressful even when all things are equal \u2014 having an infection can really impair her ability to do that. We are very interested in clarifying the best ways to prevent these infections, reducing the burden on the patients, on their infants and on the health-care system as a whole.\u201d\n\nAn estimated 1.3 million women in the U.S. delivered their babies by C-section in 2013, with surgical-site infections complicating 5 to 12 percent of those deliveries. The average cost of treating those cesarean-related infections in the hospital is $3,500 and may be much higher for severe infections.\n\nThe research shows that patients in the chlorhexidine-alcohol group developed significantly fewer infections than patients in the iodine-alcohol group. Those who received the chlorhexidine-alcohol combination had a 4 percent infection rate, which is nearly half that of the patients who received the iodine-alcohol combination \u2014 7.3 percent.\n\nThe clinical trial included 1,147 patients who underwent cesarean sections at Barnes-Jewish Hospital from 2011 to 2015. Of 572 patients randomly assigned to receive the chlorhexidine-alcohol combination, 23 developed an infection at the site of the surgery within 30 days of the procedure. Of 575 patients who randomly received the iodine-alcohol combination, 42 developed a surgical-site infection.\n\nThe investigators pointed out that all other standard procedures for reducing the risk of infection after surgery, including giving preventive antibiotics beforehand, were the same in both groups.\n\nStudies of other types of surgeries also have suggested the superiority of chlorhexidine over iodine in preventing infection. But according to Tuuli, the unique circumstances of a C-section \u2014 that bacteria come from both skin and vagina and that a woman\u2019s immune system is altered during pregnancy \u2014 mean the results of these studies may not apply.\n\nIn addition, past trials comparing antiseptics before surgery included relatively few participants and often compared a chlorhexidine-alcohol combination with iodine alone. These studies could not determine whether the worse performance of iodine alone was due to the chlorhexidine, the alcohol or the combination.\n\nAlthough the new study was conducted at only one hospital, the researchers said the patient population was racially diverse and that more than 60 percent received public insurance. Tuuli and his colleagues also pointed out that the superiority of the chlorhexidine-alcohol combination was consistent whether the C-section was scheduled or unscheduled, whether or not the patient was obese, whether staples or sutures were used to close the wound and whether the patient had chronic medical conditions, including diabetes.\n\nHighlighting the significance of the findings, the study\u2019s senior author, George A.

Taking Prozac (fluoxetine) doubled the chances that a patient would show overall improvement, measured by their clinicians. Half of the participants taking Prozac had significant reductions in obsessive-compulsive symptoms, compared with 8% taking placebo. Side effects were mild to moderate and participants taking Prozac did not show increases in suicidal thoughts or ideas.\n\n\u201cRepetitive behavior is a core symptom of the illness,\u201d says lead author Dr. Eric Hollander, medical director of the Autism and Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum Program at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, explaining that \u201cfrom a very early age, these children have rituals and routines. For example, they like to line up their toys and they get very bent out of shape if there is any deviation.\u201d\n\nMORE: What Does a 400% Increase in Antidepressant Use Really Mean?\n\nA previous, larger study of a similar medication, Celexa (citalopram), in autistic children did not find a reduction in repetitive behaviors, but the drug did reduce irritability and was superior to placebo among children who had the highest levels of irritability. Irritability can sometimes lead to repetitive behaviors because autistic people often engage in these activities to soothe themselves.\n\nBoth Prozac and Celexa belong to a class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. Prior research on SSRIs in autistic people has also looked at Luvox (fluvoxamine) and found a reduction in repetitive behavior in adults but not children. It is not known if the differences between these studies are due to differences between the medications or other factors.\n\nObsessive behaviors may also arise in autistic people in response to the stress or discomfort of unpredictable situations. \u201cMany of these individuals have expectations for what\u2019s going to happen, and if there is an unexpected deviation, they experience a lot of discomfort and then they do all these kinds of behaviors,\u201d says Hollander. That\u2019s why people with autism may obsessively avoid locations where they previously experienced discomfort, for example, or they may engage in a repetitive habit like washing, checking, counting, touching or tapping.\n\nWhen taking Prozac, Hollander says, \u201cPatients acknowledge experiencing less discomfort. They\u2019re more able to go outside their comfort zone and to better resist their habits and rituals.\u201d One participant in Hollander\u2019s study was previously too anxious to take the subway or eat in a restaurant, but, when taking Prozac, was able to tolerate these unpredictable environments.\n\n\u201cIt takes the edge off,\u201d Hollander explains, noting that the findings were statistically significant and clinically meaningful. \u201cThe clinicians could tell that people were doing better not only in terms of OCD symptoms but overall distress and ability to function.\u201d\n\nMORE: Why Are So Many Foster Care Children Taking Antipsychotics?\n\nThe only drugs approved to treat irritability and repetitive behaviors in autistic children are the atypical antipsychotics Risperdal (risperidone) and Abilify (aripiprazole), which tend to have more severe side effects than Prozac does. Those drugs carry significant risk for weight gain, diabetes and movement disorders.\n\nResponding to the research, Yale Child Study Center director Fred Volkmar told WebMD: \u201cThe question remains, \u2018Is fluoxetine better than risperidone for this symptom?\u2019 It would be interesting to see studies comparing these two drugs head to head.\u201d\n\nHollander has previously received funding from pharmaceutical companies, but the current study was paid for by a grant from the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s \u201corphan\u201d drug program. That program funds research on rare conditions with new drugs or those no longer patented that are not likely to be pursued by industry.

So it's routine for patients to take clot-preventing drugs for some time afterward.\n\nSome doctors choose powerful anti-clotting drugs like heparin (Lovenox) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto), but it hasn't been clear whether these expensive prescription drugs work any better than cheap, readily available aspirin.\n\n\"Aspirin alone may provide similar protection compared to anticoagulation treatments,\" says Brian R. Hallstrom, M.D., an orthopaedic surgeon and associate chair for quality and safety at the University of Michigan Department of Orthopaedic Surgery.\n\nHallstrom is the lead author of a new study published in JAMA Surgery that found few patients developed a blood clot after surgery, and those patients on aspirin fared just as well as those on anticoagulants.\n\nDuring the two-year study period from 2013 to 2015, aspirin use rose from 10 percent to 50 percent among the patients cared for by orthopaedic surgeons in the Michigan Arthroplasty Registry Collaborative Quality Initiative, a statewide effort to give patients the best possible recovery and outcomes after hip and knee replacements.\n\nSince then, the shift has become even more distinct: Aspirin prescribing has risen to 70 percent among Michigan surgeons, says Hallstrom, who is co-director of the initiative and a health services researcher at U-M's Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation.\n\nBased on the experience of 41,537 Michigan patients undergoing knee replacement, the study may further the debate about the routine use of aspirin for clot prevention.\n\nA recent Canadian study looked at the issue, but the analysis had a caveat: Each of the more than 3,400 clinical trial patients received rivaroxaban the first five days after surgery. After that, they continued with the drug or switched to aspirin.\n\nThe new U-M study suggests patients may be adequately protected if they take aspirin alone from day one.\n\n\"This study is truly a real-world experience of what happened in Michigan when the majority of surgeons switched to aspirin,\" Hallstrom says. \"The incidence of blood clots, pulmonary embolus and death did not increase despite this dramatic change in practice.\"\n\nOver the past decade, surgeons have turned away from powerful anticoagulants and toward aspirin used in addition to nondrug improvements such as compression devices for thwarting clots.\n\nThese days, most patients have a generally low risk of blood clots after knee replacement for a number of reasons. Those reasons include shorter surgical times, less invasive procedures and use of regional anesthesia that allows early mobilization after surgery, Hallstrom says. Some patients are even going home the same day.\n\n\"The most important way to prevent blood clots is getting moving,\" says Hallstrom, noting that people are at risk for blood clots when they sit or lie in one position for too long, such as on an airplane or a hospital bed.\n\nThe critical care specialists who make up the American College of Chest Physicians favor heparin to reduce the risk of blood clots, while the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guidelines state that no one drug is better than another for preventing clots.\n\nThe U-M study involved patients undergoing knee replacement surgery at any of the 29 Michigan hospitals in the surgical quality group. One-third of the patients took aspirin alone; 54 percent took only an anticoagulant; and 13 percent took an aspirin/anticoagulant combination.\n\nOver three months, just 1.16 percent of aspirin patients developed a serious blood clot. That was true for 1.42 percent of anticoagulant patients, according to the Michigan study. This was not statistically different.\n\nSo, neither drug appeared better than the other -- but aspirin has some obvious advantages.\n\n\"Aspirin is easy to take and much less expensive,\" Hallstrom says. \"Patients can get it over the counter for pennies, while the other anticoagulants require monitoring, injections, frequent dose adjustments and are extremely expensive.\"\n\nThe reported cost for a 30-day supply of rivaroxaban is approximately $379 to $450; heparin is estimated at $450 to $890. Although warfarin costs a few dollars for a 30-day supply, its cost approaches that of the other anticoagulants when doctor visits for monitoring are factored in, Hallstrom says.\n\nThe study suggests most patients can have just aspirin without increasing the risk for venous thromboembolism, but doctors need to consider factors such as a patient's history of clots, obesity and ability to mobilize after surgery when determining the best measure for clot prevention, Hallstrom adds.", "question": "Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "\u201cGood old aspirin\u201d implies that aspirin is benign and without potential harms, which is not accurate, even if the harms of aspirin are typically less than those of anticoagulants.

When consumed by women before and during early pregnancy, this B vitamin plays a critical role in preventing severe brain and spinal cord defects. Thanks to mandatory fortification, the number of babies born in the U.S. with neural tube defects has dropped by roughly 35 percent \u2014 or about 1,300 babies a year \u2014 since the 1990s.\n\n\"The story of folic acid is one of the great public health stories of \u2014 ever,\" says Dr. R.J. Berry, who works with the Division of Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.\n\nBut there's one notable exception to this success story \u2014 Hispanic women \u2014 and researchers think the reason may lie in a staple of their diet: tortillas.\n\nUnder current FDA rules, tortillas, corn chips and other foods made with corn masa flour can't be fortified with folic acid. So a coalition of groups including the March of Dimes Foundation and the National Council of La Raza has petitioned the FDA to change its stance and allow corn masa flour to be fortified with folic acid.\n\nAccording to the March of Dimes, about 3,000 pregnancies in the U.S. are affected by neural tube defects each year. The rates are highest among Hispanics: Latina women are roughly 20 percent more likely to have a baby with a neural tube defect compared to non-Latina white women.\n\nThe exact cause of this discrepancy isn't known. Researchers say there may be genetic factors that predispose the children of some Hispanic women to neural tube defects. But they suspect diet is also a factor: \"Part of the reason was that these groups just weren't consuming the same level of wheat flour products. Instead, they were consuming corn masa flour products, because that was the staple grain in that diet,\" says Cynthia Pellegrini, senior vice president of public policy and government affairs at the March of Dimes.\n\nResearch has shown that women who consume at least 400 micrograms of folic acid daily have a significantly reduced risk of having a pregnancy affected by neural tube defects \u2014 including spina bifida, which can involve paralysis, and anencephaly, in which large parts of the brain are missing. The catch: Folic acid is only protective if consumed in the earliest weeks of pregnancy.\n\n\"Most women, by the time they know they're pregnant, they've already passed that critical window,\" says Dean Appling, a biochemistry professor at the University of Texas at Austin. \"If they had a problem with folic acid, it would be too late at that point to prevent the birth defect.\"\n\nMandating fortification helps ensure that women are getting enough folic acid even before they know they need it. And studies suggest that fortifying corn masa with folic acid could prevent an additional 40 to 120 cases of neural tube defects among babies born to Hispanic mothers each year.\n\nSo why does the FDA currently ban dosing corn masa flour with folic acid? It all has to do with nixtamalization, the process by which tough corn kernels are softened by soaking in an alkaline solution, usually of slaked lime. The process, which hails from ancient Mesoamerica \u2014 what's now Mexico and Central America \u2014 dates back thousands of years. It renders the corn more pliable for grinding into masa flour and gives the masa its distinctive aroma and flavor.\n\nBut the FDA worries that this alkaline treatment could also \"affect the stability of added folic acid,\" the agency told The Salt in a statement. \"The FDA is concerned that the breakdown of folic acid in corn masa flour could yield a substance that raises concerns about safety.\"\n\nThe March of Dimes and others first petitioned the FDA to allow added folic acid in corn flour masa in 2012. As part of its review, the FDA asked the petitioning groups to study whether folic acid would stay stable in corn masa flour.\n\nThe petitioners filed the results of that study in October. Michael Dunn, the Brigham Young University food scientist who led the study, cannot comment on the test results while they're under FDA review, but he has previously called them encouraging. As The Seattle Times has reported, Dunn's early results suggested no loss of folic acid in fortified masa after three months of storage.\n\nThe March of Dimes' Pellegrini says she believes the FDA will respond to the results of Dunn's study later this month. But the FDA might have more questions related to the study before making a final ruling.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story discusses the FDA\u2019s worry that a chemical used on corn flour could interact with the corn masa flour.

James Lee, professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering with Ohio State's College of Engineering in collaboration with Ohio State's Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center.\n\nResearchers studied mice and pigs in these experiments. In the study, researchers were able to reprogram skin cells to become vascular cells in badly injured legs that lacked blood flow. Within one week, active blood vessels appeared in the injured leg, and by the second week, the leg was saved. In lab tests, this technology was also shown to reprogram skin cells in the live body into nerve cells that were injected into brain-injured mice to help them recover from stroke.\n\n\"This is difficult to imagine, but it is achievable, successfully working about 98 percent of the time.

Plus, Medicare does not currently reimburse patients for routine screening with virtual colonoscopy, but does cover evaluations with colonoscopy. Add to that the aggressive public awareness campaign for colonoscopy screening led by celebrities like Katie Couric, who allowed TV cameras in as she got her first test, and it\u2019s clear why more people are familiar with the scope than with its virtual cousin.\n\nBut in spite of those challenges, Megan McHugh at the Health Research and Educational Trust in Chicago and her team report that about 17% of hospitals in the U.S. now offer the screening test, up from 13% in 2005.\n\nAs its name implies, virtual colonoscopy is way to survey the colon without actually using a scope. Patients lie in a CT scanner, which takes a series of pictures from a variety of different angles, and a computer compiles the snapshots in two different ways. The images can be viewed as two dimensional CT scans, which display any possible abnormalities protruding from the lining of the colon. Or, the images can be combined to generate a 3D view of the colon, allowing the doctors to \u201cfly through\u201d the organ looking for any suspicious growths or protrusions.\n\nThe prep for both the virtual and actual colonoscopy is the same \u2014 the dreaded \u201ccolon cleanse\u201d that many patients find is the worst part of the procedure. The night before the test, they start drinking clear liquids and take agents to loosen their stools and empty their colon so any remaining debris isn\u2019t mistaken for a tumor during the screen.\n\nWhile the virtual colonoscopy does not require the sedation and insertion of a scope that colonoscopy does, it involves exposure to a small amount of radiation. But according to Dr. Marc Gollub, director of CT and gastrointestinal radiology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, \u201cthe radiation is much lower than a regular CT scan and has not been proven to be of any risk. It\u2019s similar to [the exposure from cosmic radiation] you might get on a long airplane flight.\u201d\n\nWhile a growing body of data suggest that virtual colonoscopy is as sensitive as colonoscopy in picking up potential tumors, not all cancer experts agree that it\u2019s a good alternative to the gold-standard scope. While the American Cancer Society, the American College of Physicians and other gastroenterology experts recommend virtual screening every five years, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a congressionally mandated but non-federal, independent group of medical experts, concluded the evidence wasn\u2019t strong enough to justify Medicare coverage of the service.\n\nSo which one is right for you? Virtual colonoscopy is a good option for those who can\u2019t be sedated for colonoscopy, or who simply can\u2019t tolerate the scope. In McHugh\u2019s survey, hospitals reported that these patients make up the bulk of their use. And given the relatively low cost of investing in the software and other equipment required to run a virtual scan, more hospitals may be adding the option to their patient services. The virtual scan does involve radiation exposure, and if doctors find an abnormality that needs to be removed, you\u2019ll have to undergo a colonoscopy anyway (to avoid another colon cleanse, consider scheduling a colonoscopy on the same day in case tumors need to be removed). But Gollub notes that only about 8% of healthy adults getting regularly screened actually have tumors.\n\nGiven the fact that more hospitals are offering virtual colonoscopy, it\u2019s worth discussing with your doctor.

And cancer patients may experience low platelet counts and be at risk for a clotting disorder called 'heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.'\" Dr. McBane noted that cancer and cancer treatment can be associated with kidney injury, which can limit the drug's use further. Finally, Dr. McBane says there isn't is a good antidote for this medication should a bleeding problem arise.\n\n\"More recently, a number of new blood thinners called 'direct oral anticoagulants' have become available,\" says Dr. McBane. \"As a class, these drugs have a number of advantages, including oral delivery, lack of interactions with foods or other medications, and the lack of a need for monitoring drug levels.\" He says these qualities make this class of drug much easier to use than the traditional blood thinners. However, it was unclear whether these drugs could be used safely in cancer patients until now.\n\nDr. McBane says quality of life surveys, which were taken monthly throughout the six-month trial, showed that patients markedly preferred oral apixaban over injectable dalteparin. \"We are hopeful that this medication will also improve medication compliance in cancer patients requiring blood thinner therapy.\"\n\nAs a leading institution funded by the National Cancer Institute, Mayo Clinic Cancer Center conducts basic, clinical and population science research, translating discoveries into improved methods for prevention, diagnosis, prognosis and therapy.

He is a professor of fetal medicine at Kings College Hospital in London.\n\nBut he added, \"This condition is, to a great extent, preventable.\"\n\nThe new study looked at an aspirin dose of 150 milligrams (mg) per day because some past studies with smaller daily doses of aspirin have produced conflicting results, according to Nicolaides. A baby aspirin dose is 81 milligrams.\n\nIn those studies using smaller doses, the reduction in preeclampsia risk hovered around 10 percent, he said, but the higher dose in this latest study was linked to a 62 percent reduction in risk.\n\nPreeclampsia is a serious high blood pressure disorder. It can affect all of the organs in a woman's body, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). The exact cause of the disorder is unknown, but certain risk factors make it more likely to occur, including:\n\u2022 Being pregnant with more than one baby,\n\u2022 Having chronic conditions, such as type 1 or type 2 diabetes, autoimmune disease and kidney problems.\n\nDr. Mitchell Kramer, chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Huntington Hospital in New York, said he'd add women who are severely obese and women who've had babies who had restricted growth to the list of women at high risk of preeclampsia.\n\nACOG already recommends that women who are at high risk of preeclampsia take a low-dose baby aspirin beginning between 12 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAbout 1,600 women completed the double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Just under 800 were randomly put into the daily aspirin group, while just over 800 were placed in the placebo group. The women came from 13 different maternity hospitals across Europe and Israel.\n\nInstead of relying solely on standard risk factors, the researchers combined those risk factors with measurements of maternal blood flow, blood pressure and two hormones produced by the placenta. They used an algorithm they designed to combine all those factors to select women who they believed were at a high risk of preeclampsia.\n\nBetween 11 and 14 weeks, the women began taking a daily 150 mg aspirin or a placebo. They continued taking the pills until they were 36 weeks' pregnant, or sooner if they delivered the baby early.\n\nJust 13 women in the aspirin group developed preeclampsia, while 35 women in the placebo group developed the complication, the findings showed.\n\nThe reduction in risk was even greater for early deliveries. Women who delivered at less than 34 weeks were 82 percent less likely to have preeclampsia if they were taking 150 mg of aspirin, Nicolaides said.\n\nThere were no serious side effects for expectant mothers, or adverse events for the babies related to aspirin use during pregnancy, the researchers noted.\n\nHowever, as with all drugs, women should talk to their doctor about the use of aspirin in pregnancy before taking up this regimen, because aspirin does increase the risk for bleeding.\n\nNicolaides said the aspirin may help improve blood flow from the mother to the placenta.\n\nAccording to Kramer, \"This randomized study concludes that [aspirin's] use is not only effective for reducing the incidence of preeclampsia at term, but also preterm. This is important because it will reduce the need for preterm delivery, which is risky for the baby.\"\n\nLow-dose aspirin can also help reduce the chances of eclampsia, which is seizures due to preeclampsia for high-risk women, Kramer noted.\n\nThe study is scheduled for presentation Wednesday at the Fetal Medicine Foundation meeting in Slovenia.

The NHS, however, needs to get the support of surgeons, many of whom rarely carry out the less invasive procedure.\n\nPartial replacements, also known as unicompartmental replacements, are suitable for people who have arthritis in just one side of the knee, usually the inner. They can be carried out with a smaller incision using minimally invasive surgery, but they are only suitable for people whose ligaments inside the knee are strong.\n\n\n\nResearchers from the Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS) publishing in the BMJ Open journal found that the less invasive procedure was being used less than it could be.\n\nThe main reason for the surgery is osteoarthritis. About half of all patients should be suitable for a partial replacement, but an analysis of data routinely collected by the National Joint Registry showed that of 98,147 knee replacements undertaken in 2016, only 9% were partial.\n\n\u201cThe main strength of this study is that we were able to use real data, from very large numbers of people, about their actual operations, their GP visit, and their own reported quality of life outcomes in a way that is not always possible,\u201d said Dr Rafael Pinedo-Villanueva, the co-lead researcher and NDORMS senior health economist, who is funded by the National Institute of Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre and the Medical Research Council.\n\n\u201cThis has allowed us to provide strong proof that partial knee replacements are both better for patients and cheaper for the NHS.\u201d\n\nWhether people had a partial or total replacement varied by surgeon, as did the success of the operation, the researchers discovered.

In addition, more partial knee replacements will be done and more patients will benefit from this procedure.\u201d\n\nEd Burn, first author of the paper, said they needed to get surgeons on board. \u201cFor patients and the NHS to see the benefits of partial replacements, we need the buy-in of surgeons, who would need to feel comfortable performing a greater proportion of their knee replacements as partials,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf we see surgeons carrying out this procedure more often, the proportion of knee replacements that are partials would increase from the current figure of 9% and we would see an increase in future economic and population health gains.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "What risks are associated with getting either surgery?

Thourani, MD, from Emory University in Atlanta, and colleagues from 12 other institutions in the United States found that transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a safe and effective way to treat aortic stenosis in nonagenarians who qualify for the surgical technique.\n\n\"Historically, extreme elderly patients can be at a very high risk for open surgery,\" said Dr. Thourani. \"We still believe that for those 90 year olds who are low-or intermediate risk, surgical options may be a viable procedure. However, with the advent of TAVR technology, we can now offer these extreme elderly patients a treatment option that otherwise would have been high-risk or prohibitive.\"\n\nAortic stenosis is the most common acquired valve disease in elderly patients and affects nearly 3% of those over the age of 75, according to the American Heart Association. The ability to safely treat AS patients has become increasingly important; the US government predicts that the number of Americans over the age of 85 will exceed 11 million in the next 20 years.\n\nFor the study, the researchers used two different approaches: transfemoral TAVR (TF-TAVR), which is the traditional approach performed via the groin, and transapical TAVR (TA-TAVR), which is performed via the heart muscle. TA-TAVR is an alternative for patients who are medically ineligible for TF-TAVR secondary to severe peripheral vascular disease. While the current study did not evaluate other alternative options for TAVR, these techniques may include transaortic, transcaval, transcarotid, or trans-subclavian.\n\nIn the largest series published to date, between April 2007 and February 2012, 531 nonagenarians underwent TAVR: 329 with TF-TAVR and 202 with TA-TAVR.\n\n\"We evaluated perioperative, short-, and mid-term outcomes following both TF- and TA-TAVR,\" explained Dr. Thourani. \"Compared with an age-sex-race-matched US population, the TAVR patients had a comparable risk of mortality, and quality of life improved within 6 months of the procedure. Our study shows that age alone should not preclude referral for TAVR in patients age 90 years and older.\"\n\nThe study also showed that the 30-day stroke risk was 3.6% in TF-TAVR patients and 2.0% in TA-TAVR patients. Major complications, such as bleeding or vascular issues, occurred in 35% of TF-TAVR patients and 32% of TA-TAVR patients, and more than 80% of patients were discharged home after the procedure.\n\n\"Future studies are needed to address potential differences in outcomes between TF- and TA-TAVR groups,\" said Dr. Thourani, \"but I'm thrilled that we're able to give elderly people the chance to continue enjoying life in their golden years. Many would not have had that option without TAVR.\"\n\nThourani V, Jensen H, Babaliaros V, Kodali S, Rajeswaran J, Ehrlinger J, Blackstone E, Suri R, Don C, Aldea G, Williams M, Makkar R, Svensson L, McCabe J, Dean L, Kapadia S, Cohen D, Pichard A, Szeto W, Herrmann H, Devireddy C, Leshnower B, Ailawadi G, Maniar H, Hahn R, Leon M, Mack M.

The release (and related study) looks at both TF-TAVR and TA-TAVR patients. It\u00a0notes the frequency of adverse health outcomes associated with the two procedures. For example 30-day stroke risk for TF-TAVR was 3.6 percent, and 35 percent of TF-TAVR patients had \u201cmajor complications, such as bleeding or vascular issues.\u201d Stroke risk for TA-TAVR was 2.0 percent and 32 percent of TA-TAVR patients had major complications.\nThat\u2019s useful information, but the release neglects to mention the higher mortality rate observed in the TA-TAVR group compared with TF-TAVR \u2014 a difference that was not trivial. Overall, 4.6% of patients in the TF-TAVR died within 30 days or as a complication of the procedure. Among the TA-TAVR, the rate was 13%.\nOverall, we think the lack of any mention of death rates related to the procedure unbalances the discussion of harms. We also think it\u2019s problematic that the headline of the release describes TAVR as \u201csafe,\u201d when the second half of the release makes clear that there are substantial health risks associated with the procedures. Since the patients in this study were not randomly assigned to the valve treatment or conservative care, it is difficult to know for sure how the risks compare. The release could have done more to highlight that these patients are at high risk based upon age and their valve disease, and that it isn\u2019t clear whether the complications and deaths associated with these procedures are greater than what would be expected with conservative care.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "A mind-altering drug called ketamine is changing the way some doctors treat depression.\n\nEncouraged by research showing that ketamine can relieve even the worst depression in a matter of hours, these doctors are giving the drug to some of their toughest patients. And they're doing this even though ketamine lacks approval from the Food and Drug Administration for treating depression.\n\n\"It became clear to me that the future of psychiatry was going to include ketamine or derivatives of ketamine,\" says David Feifel, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Diego, who began administering the drug to patients in 2010.\n\nKetamine was developed as an anesthetic and received FDA approval for this use in 1970. Decades later, it became popular as a psychedelic club drug. And in 2006, a team from the National Institute of Mental Health published a landmark study showing that a single intravenous dose of ketamine produced \"robust and rapid antidepressant effects\" within a couple of hours.\n\nSince then, thousands of depressed patients have received \"off-label\" treatment with ketamine.\n\nOne of those patients is Paul, 36, who lives in San Diego and is a patient of Dr. Feifel. We're not using his last name to protect his medical privacy.\n\nPaul's depression began with anxiety. \"I was an extremely anxious child,\" he says. \"I would always make choices based on fear. My life was really directed by what was the least fearful thing that I could do.\"\n\nAs Paul grew up, his extreme anxiety led to major depression, which could leave him unable to get out of bed for days. \"I lived in pain,\" he says.\n\nPaul managed to get through college and a stint in the Peace Corps. But most days were a struggle. And Paul has spent much of his adult life searching for a treatment that would give him some relief.\n\nHe tried just about every drug used for depression, as well as cognitive behavioral therapy, acupuncture, and even electroconvulsive therapy, which induces a brief seizure. But nothing worked \u2014 at least not for very long.\n\nPaul says he was increasingly haunted by \"this comforting thought of pressing a cold gun against my forehead where I felt the pain the most.\"\n\nThen one day, while investigating depression on the Internet, Paul discovered the research on ketamine. \"It was clear to me that this was real,\" he says.\n\nOrdinarily, there would have been no legal way for Paul to get ketamine. He didn't qualify for most research studies because of his suicidal thoughts. And doctors usually won't prescribe a mind-altering club drug to someone with a mental illness.\n\nBut the studies of ketamine have produced results so dramatic that some doctors, including Feifel, are bypassing the usual protocols.\n\nBy the time Feifel began hearing about ketamine, he had become frustrated with existing depression drugs. Too often, he says, they just weren't helping his patients.\n\nA major study on antidepressant medication published in 2008 seemed to confirm his suspicions. It found that current antidepressants really aren't much better than a placebo.\n\nMany psychiatrists criticized that study. But not Feifel. \"I was kind of like, I'm not surprised,\" he says. \"These really don't seem like powerful tools.\"\n\nFeifel remembers feeling \"professionally embarrassed\" that psychiatrists didn't have something better to offer their depressed patients. Something like ketamine.\n\nHe knew the drug had risks. It could be abused. It could produce hallucinations. And it didn't have the FDA's OK for treating depression.\n\nBut he also knew that doctors had a lot of experience with ketamine. It's been used for decades as an anesthetic that can rapidly stop pain without affecting vital functions like breathing. And ketamine's safety record is so good that it's often the painkiller of choice for children who arrive in the emergency room with a broken bone.\n\nSo in 2010, Feifel decided he wanted to offer low doses of the drug to some patients. The decision put him at odds with some prominent psychiatrists, including Tom Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental Health. \"While the science is promising, ketamine is not ready for broad use in the clinic,\" Insel wrote in his blog a few months ago.\n\n\"There are a lot of pundits who remain skeptical or feel we need to research this ad infinitum before it's ready, which doesn't make sense to me,\" Feifel says. It's hard to take the wait-and-see approach when you're treating patients who are desperate for help, he adds.\n\nPaul was one of those desperate patients when he was referred to Feifel in March of 2014. The referral was from a local psychiatrist who had run out of ideas, Feifel says.\n\nAnd Paul jumped at the chance to try ketamine. \"If there was even a 1 percent chance that this worked, it would have been worth it to me,\" he says. \"My life was hanging in the balance.\"\n\nAnd for Paul, the benefits of ketamine became obvious soon after one of his early injections.\n\n\"I remember I was in my bathroom and I literally fell to my knees crying because I had no anxiety, I had no depression,\" he says\n\nFor the past year, Paul has been getting ketamine every four to six weeks. He feels an altered sense of reality for an hour or two after getting the drug. The effect on depression and anxiety, though, lasts more than a month.\n\nKetamine doesn't always work that well, Feifel says. After treating more than 100 patients, he's beginning to understand the drug's limitations.\n\nOne is that its ability to keep depression at bay can fade pretty quickly. Feifel recalls one patient whose depression would disappear like magic after a dose of ketamine. But \"we could never get it to sustain beyond maybe a day,\" he says.\n\nAlso, ketamine treatment is expensive because patients need to be monitored so closely. Feifel charges about $500 for each injection and $1,000 for an intravenous infusion, which takes effect more quickly. Insurers don't cover the cost because the treatment is still considered experimental.\n\nEven so, ketamine clinics are popping up around the country and they have already treated thousands of patients willing and able to pay out of pocket. Some of the clinics are run by psychiatrists. Others have been started by entrepreneurial anesthesiologists and emergency room doctors, who are familiar with ketamine but may not know much about depression.\n\n\"We've seen ketamine clinics open up as pure business models,\" Feifel says. \"I'm a little bit concerned about that.\"\n\nFeifel fears something bad will happen to a depressed patient at one of these clinics. And that could set back efforts to make the drug more widely available.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Although there is a brief mention of possible harms, including abuse and hallucinations, the soft warnings in the story are undercut by statements such as, \u201cketamine\u2019s safety record is so good that it\u2019s often the painkiller of choice for children who arrive in the emergency room with a broken bone.\u201d Again, readers and listeners are given the impression that the drug has been scrutinized far more carefully that it actually has.\nThere is a final cautionary note from a proponent of ketamine treatment of depression that wider use could mean \u201csomething bad will happen to a depressed patient\u201d.

The group, led by NIH\u2019s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), tested 60 cerebral spinal fluid samples, including 12 from people with Parkinson\u2019s disease, 17 from people with dementia with Lewy bodies, and 31 controls, including 16 of whom had Alzheimer\u2019s disease.

Results from the study, which included researchers at The Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, were recently published online in The Lancet. The trial, funded by Bayer, included 152 sites in 21 countries.\n\nAbout 40 percent of HCC cases are diagnosed at advanced stages, a point when HCC is particularly difficult to treat.

Pillsbury, MD, chair of the Department of Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery at the UNC School of Medicine.\n\nSYNCHRONY EAS (Electric Acoustic Stimulation) Hearing Implant System, which is manufactured by Durham-based MED-EL Corporation, received FDA approval on September 16.\n\nUNC participated in the EAS System clinical trials and implanted the device in more patients than any other hearing center that participated.\n\n\u201cOur clinical trial participants were overwhelmingly receptive to this new technology,\u201d Pillsbury said. \u201cThe technology is remarkable and so were the results.\u201d\n\nThe implant relies on two auditory technologies \u2013 the SYNCHRONY cochlear implant that stimulates the auditory nerve for high-frequency hearing loss and the EAS audio processor, which has a built-in acoustic amplification for low-frequency hearing loss.\n\nThe SYNCHRONY EAS implant best assists people whose hearing loss is referred to as \u201cski-slope\u201d hearing loss, based on the steeply sloping image that appears on an audiogram when a patient has more trouble hearing higher-frequency sounds. Using traditional hearing aids, those patients often have difficulty understanding speech above the din of background noise.\n\nNinety-seven percent of patients participating in the MED-EL EAS clinical trial reported a benefit from EAS within the first year. Ninety-two percent of participants reported an improvement in their ability to hear even among background noise, one of the most challenging listening environments for people with hearing loss. And 90 percent reported satisfaction with the device overall.\n\n\u201cOn average, patients performed more than twice as well on tests of speech understanding with EAS than they did with their hearing aids preoperatively, which speaks to the benefits of this technology,\u201d Pillsbury said.\n\nThe National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders estimates that 26 million Americans between the ages of 20 and 69 have high-frequency hearing loss. While 2 percent of adults aged 45 to 54 have disabling hearing loss, the rate increases to 8.5 percent for adults aged 55 to 64. Nearly 25 percent of those ages 65 to 74 and 50 percent of those who are 75 and older have disabling hearing loss.\n\nThe EAS System FDA approval is for candidates who are 18 years old and older who have normal to moderate sensorineural hearing loss in the low frequencies, sloping to a severe-to-profound hearing loss in the high frequencies.\n\nMED-EL expects that the SYNCHRONY EAS Hearing Implant System will be available in the coming months.", "question": "Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The release has zero information about harms, actual or potential.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "WASHINGTON, March 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Vanda) (NASDAQ: VNDA) today announced that HETLIOZ\u00ae, a circadian regulator, demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful benefits in nighttime and daytime symptoms of jet lag disorder. HETLIOZ\u00ae is currently approved in the US and Europe for the treatment of Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder, a rare and chronic circadian rhythm sleep disorder.\n\nJet lag disorder is a common circadian disorder frequently observed in millions of travelers who cross multiple time zones. Jet lag disorder is characterized by nighttime sleep disruption, a decrease in daytime alertness and impairment to social and occupational functioning.\n\nThe clinical efficacy results reported today are from the JET8 Phase-III clinical study (3107) (the JET8 study). In the JET8 study, 318 healthy volunteers were admitted to a sleep unit and were subjected to a circadian challenge of an 8 hours advance to their usual bedtime. The JET8 study design induced the circadian challenge experienced by travelers who cross 8 times zones, which leads to jet lag disorder. This clinical design allowed for the study of HETLIOZ\u00ae without the confounding effects of sleep deprivation and variable light conditions.\n\nResults from the JET8 study showed significant and clinically meaningful effects of HETLIOZ\u00ae 20 mg on the primary endpoint of the study as well as multiple secondary endpoints. The pre-specified primary endpoint was the amount of sleep time in the first two thirds of the night. Secondary endpoints included measures of sleep parameters (TST, LPS, WASO) and next day alertness (KSS and VAS). (Table 1).\n\nThe results of the JET8 study shown above demonstrate the effectiveness of HETLIOZ\u00ae in treating jet lag disorder. The magnitude of the total sleep time benefit of 85 minutes improvement over placebo is significant and clinically meaningful. The demonstration of benefits in measurements of next day alertness on both KSS and VAS is meaningful and it underscores the ability of HETLIOZ\u00ae to address both nighttime and daytime symptoms of jet lag disorder.\n\nVanda previously reported on the JET5 study (3101) that examined the effects of HETLIOZ\u00ae in a circadian challenge of 5 hours advance of the subjects' usual bedtime. The results of that study were published in The Lancet in 2009.1 The observation that HETLIOZ\u00ae is effective in treating the symptoms caused by an abrupt advance of the circadian cycle of a magnitude of 5 or 8 hours suggests that HETLIOZ\u00ae will be an effective therapeutic tool in the treatment of individuals that experience symptoms of jet lag. HETLIOZ\u00ae will be potentially useful under circumstances of rapid eastward transmeridian travel experienced by frequent travelers, the rapid deployment of military troops and any circumstances that will necessitate the abrupt phase advance of the sleep wake cycle.\n\nJet lag disorder affects millions of individuals annually who cross multiple time zones during their travel. Jet lag disorder symptoms are more severe during eastward travel. It is reported that more than 30 million US residents make trips abroad each year to overseas destinations. Of these, 60% (approximately 20 million) travel to destinations in Europe, Middle East and Asia. It is also reported that 8% (approximately 1.6 million) travel in Business or First class.2\n\n\"We are extremely pleased with the outcome of this study which establishes the utility of HETLIOZ\u00ae in the treatment of jet lag disorder as HETLIOZ\u00ae was shown to overcome a significant circadian challenge of an 8 hour phase advance. This challenge is equivalent to eastward travel across 8 time zones as experienced for example on travel from Los Angeles to London, Washington DC to Moscow, Paris to Tokyo, or London to Singapore. HETLIOZ\u00ae improved both nighttime sleep and next day alertness potentially offering significant benefits to millions of travelers,\" said Mihael H. Polymeropoulos, MD, Vanda's President and CEO.\n\nVanda intends to seek marketing approval for the use of HETLIOZ\u00ae in the treatment of jet lag disorder. Vanda believes that if HETLIOZ\u00ae is approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of jet lag disorder it will potentially offer a therapeutic solution to many travelers and will likely represent an important commercial opportunity for the company.

", "answer": 1}, {"article": "MONDAY, Dec. 7, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Evidence is mounting that a marijuana-derived oil might benefit some children with epilepsy whose seizures aren't controlled by approved medications, two new studies show.\n\nCannabidiol (CBD) significantly reduced seizures in as many as half of children with epilepsy, researchers planned to report Monday at the American Epilepsy Society's annual meeting, in Philadelphia.\n\nBut experts say these positive findings may have been influenced by a \"placebo effect.\" All participants in these studies knew they were taking the oil, which could have affected reports of its effectiveness.\n\n\"We know that our placebo rates can be as high as 30 percent, and sometimes higher,\" said Dr. Amy Brooks-Kayal, American Epilepsy Society president, who wasn't involved in the studies.\n\n\"We don't know the real effect of the cannabidiol, and we won't until we complete the studies that are ongoing that are placebo-controlled and blinded,\" added Brooks-Kayal, who is also a professor of pediatrics, neurology and pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.\n\nThere also are concerns that cannabidiol may interact badly with some anti-seizure medications approved for epilepsy treatment, according to another study scheduled for presentation at the meeting.\n\nCannabidiol is a major chemical component of marijuana, said Dr. Orrin Devinsky, a neurologist at NYU Langone Medical Center's Comprehensive Epilepsy Center in New York City and co-author of one of the studies.\n\nCBD doesn't produce intoxication like pot's other major chemical compound, THC. But, researchers believe it may interact with a brain receptor that plays a role in the development of seizures, Devinsky said.\n\n\"This receptor has several effects, but one of them may be to modulate the calcium inside and outside the neuron, which is very much related to the excitability of nerve cells,\" he explained.\n\nPrevious studies have shown some benefit in adults, and word has spread. Families with adults and children with epilepsy have flocked to states where medical marijuana is legal to seek treatment, Brooks-Kayal said.\n\n\"There is a fairly active and vocal group of families in Colorado who are using cannabidiol oils that are made artisanally,\" she said.\n\nTo see whether children with epilepsy would benefit from cannabidiol treatment, Devinsky led a study involving 261 people, mostly children, whose seizures had not been controlled using current anti-seizure medications. The average age of the participants was 11.\n\nEveryone received a British-made cannabidiol oil called Epidiolex, which was administered as a drop on the tongue, Devinsky said. This was in addition to their current drug therapy.\n\nAfter three months, seizure frequency declined by an average 45 percent in all participants. Almost half experienced a 50 percent or greater reduction in seizures, and about one of every 10 patients became seizure-free, the study found.\n\n\"This was a very, very treatment-resistant group, and the response was very promising,\" Devinsky said.\n\nA second study from the University of California, San Francisco, explored the long-term effectiveness of cannabidiol for children with epilepsy, by adding the marijuana-derived oil to the regular drug regimen of about 25 kids for one year.\n\nThe study found that after a year, the treatment resulted in a 50 percent reduction in seizures for 10 participants -- about 40 percent of the group. One child remained seizure-free, but 12 of the initial participants dropped out of the study because the cannabidiol didn't seem to do them any good.\n\nAlthough he said he would prescribe CBD to people with uncontrolled seizures, Devinsky said he is \"very anxious\" to see the results of ongoing randomized, controlled clinical trials. The results of one major trial are expected in the first quarter of 2016, he added.\n\nIf CBD proves effective in controlled trials, it could be two to five years before the drug is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Devinsky noted.\n\nFederal regulators also will have to weigh potential interactions of cannabidiol with other anti-seizure drugs. Another study scheduled for presentation at the meeting found that CBD appeared to enhance the effects of the epilepsy medication levetiracetam (Keppra), when given to lab mice.\n\nHowever, the oil appeared to interact negatively with two other drugs, clobazam (Onfi) and carbamazepine (Tegretol), the University of Utah researchers found.\n\nData and conclusions presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.\n\nFor more on medical marijuana, visit the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The subheadline declares that \u201cdrug interactions remain a concern,\u201d and story includes reference to a study that found cannabidiol to interact \u201cbadly\u201d with anti-seizure medications currently approved for epilepsy treatment.

And a few of the patients seemed to do a little better in the skills of everyday living, although memory and thinking skills were not affected.\n\nThis does not mean that blood transfusions could treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease, researchers cautioned.

Then they swapped the two sides.\n\nLater, because it was taking so much time and effort, they cut the trial to just nine people and all nine knew they were getting the real thing \u2013 a unit of plasma, once a week for a month, from healthy young men under the age of 30.\n\nThere was no measurable effect on memory or thinking, the team told the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer\u2019s Disease conference in Boston.

You just cannot tell with a trial of only 18 people.\n\n\u201cI worry that people would take this information and say, \u2018I need to get this. I need to get young blood.\u2019 It\u2019s important to understand the science behind this first,\u201d Sha said.\n\nMore than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer\u2019s, and this number is expected to grow as the population ages.

In previous studies, folic acid levels have been linked to mental ability; however, until now this had not been linked with improved school performance, the study authors said.\n\n\"We know that folate plays a really critical role in brain development and brain function,\" said Dr. Daniel Armstrong, associate chair of pediatrics at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.\n\n\"We know that, in young children, folate deficiencies are associated with poorer neurocognitive function and neurocognitive development,\" he noted. In fact, folate deficiencies may be involved in the development of autism, he added.\n\nArmstrong thinks that a diet rich in folate might be important for brain functioning throughout life. \"It's one of those things that's no harm, no foul. It's not going to do us any harm and it might do us some good,\" he said.\n\nTo find out whether folate might do some good, a team led by Dr. Torbjorn K. Nilsson, from the department of laboratory medicine at Orebro University Hospital in Sweden, collected data on folic acid levels in 386 teens aged 15 years. The researchers also looked at any possible effects of socioeconomic status and genetics.\n\nThe investigators found that teens who had the highest levels of folic acid also got the best grades. None of the other factors they examined accounted for their finding, Nilsson's team noted.\n\n\"These results provide new information that points to the importance of keeping a closer watch on folate status in childhood and adolescence.

In recent years, the FDA has approved six drugs for men with metastatic disease, all of which can increase survival. In a study published in Urology\u00ae, researchers demonstrate for the first time that an aggressive combination of systemic therapy (drug treatment) with local therapy (surgery and radiation) directed at both the primary tumor and metastasis can eliminate all detectable disease in selected patients with metastatic prostate cancer.\n\nWhile the study is only a first step, one-fifth of the patients treated had no detectable disease, with an undetectable prostate-specific-androgen (PSA) and normal blood testosterone, after 20 months. The results suggest that some men who have previously been considered incurable can possibly be cured; investigators also establish a new paradigm for testing various drug combinations in conjunction with local treatment of the prostate to determine which is the best approach (ie, has the highest undetectable disease rate). Such results could not have been achieved with any single therapy alone.\n\nAccording to lead investigator Howard I. Scher, MD, Chief of the Genitourinary Oncology Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, \"The sequential use of the three different modalities helped illustrate the role and importance of each in achieving the undetectable PSA with normal testosterone level end point, which represents a 'no-evidence of disease' status.\" Longer follow-up is needed to determine whether these patients were in fact cured.\n\nTwenty men with metastatic prostate cancer, five with extra-pelvic lymph nodal disease and 15 with bone with or without nodal disease, were treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), radical surgery that included a retroperitoneal lymph node dissection as needed, and radiation therapy to visible metastatic lesions in bone. ADT was stopped after a minimum of six months if an undetectable PSA was achieved after combined modality therapy. Other patients were treated continuously.\n\nThe combined treatment regimen including surgery was well tolerated. Matthew J. O'Shaughnessy, MD, PhD, Urology Service, Department of Surgery, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, commented \"While the role of local therapy in metastatic prostate cancer is still under investigation, aggressive resection of visible disease performed by experienced surgeons was critical to the outcome.\"\n\nOf the five patients with extra-pelvic lymph node involvement, four achieved an undetectable PSA after ADT and surgery, while the fifth needed radiation to reach this milestone. However, none achieved the primary end point of undetectable PSA with testosterone recovery at 20 months after initiation of therapy with ADT alone, although one patient had a PSA of Of the 15 patients with bone metastases, 14 (93%) reached an undetectable PSA when ADT, surgery, and radiation were used. Ultimately, four (27%) achieved the proposed end point, a PSA of 150 ng/dL at 20 months after the start of ADT, which remained undetectable in two patients for 27 and 46 months, respectively. Commenting on the study, Oliver Sartor, MD, Cancer Research, Department of Medicine and Urology, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, LA, stated, \"The end point deserves special mention, as the end point of undetectable PSA after testosterone recovery has been previously discussed but rarely studied. The authors proposed that this end point may serve as a first step toward establishing a curative paradigm. Many in the field agree, but note that the longevity of effect is essential to prove the point of curability. Regardless, the movement toward a curative paradigm is much needed and the investigators are to be congratulated for setting forth a paradigm that can be used to assess the possibility of cure in a reasonable period of time.\" \"A multimodal treatment strategy for patients who present with disease that is beyond the limits of curability by any single modality enables the evaluation of new approaches in order to prioritize large-scale testing in early stages of advanced disease. The end point also shifts the paradigm from palliation to cure,\" remarked Dr. Scher.

But the mechanisms underlying the effect were not well understood.\n\nResearchers in the lab of Jun Wu, research assistant professor at the LSI, wanted to better understand cinnamaldehyde's action and determine whether it might be protective in humans, too.\n\n\"Scientists were finding that this compound affected metabolism,\" said Wu, who also is an assistant professor of molecular and integrative physiology at the U-M Medical School. \"So we wanted to figure out how--what pathway might be involved, what it looked like in mice and what it looked like in human cells.\"\n\nTheir findings, which appear in the December issue of the journal Metabolism, indicated that cinnamaldehyde improves metabolic health by acting directly on fat cells, or adipocytes, inducing them to start burning energy through a process called thermogenesis.\n\nWu and her colleagues tested human adipocytes from volunteers representing a range of ages, ethnicities and body mass indices. When the cells were treated with cinnamaldehyde, the researchers noticed increased expression of several genes and enzymes that enhance lipid metabolism. They also observed an increase in Ucp1 and Fgf21, which are important metabolic regulatory proteins involved in thermogenesis.\n\nAdipocytes normally store energy in the form of lipids. This long-term storage was beneficial to our distant ancestors, who had much less access to high-fat foods and thus a much greater need to store fat. That fat could then be used by the body in times of scarcity or in cold temperatures, which induce adipocytes to convert stored energy into heat.\n\n\"It's only been relatively recently that energy surplus has become a problem,\" Wu said. \"Throughout evolution, the opposite--energy deficiency--has been the problem. So any energy-consuming process usually turns off the moment the body doesn't need it.\"\n\nWith the rising obesity epidemic, researchers like Wu have been looking for ways to prompt fat cells to activate thermogenesis, turning those fat-burning processes back on.\n\nWu believes that cinnamaldehyde may offer one such activation method. And because it is already used widely in the food industry, it might be easier to convince patients to stick to a cinnamon-based treatment than to a traditional drug regimen.\n\n\"Cinnamon has been part of our diets for thousands of years, and people generally enjoy it,\" Wu said. \"So if it can help protect against obesity, too, it may offer an approach to metabolic health that is easier for patients to adhere to.\"\n\nNow, before anyone goes dumping tons of extra cinnamon in their egg nog in hopes of keeping holiday-season pounds at bay, Wu cautioned that further study is needed to determine how best to harness cinnamaldehyde's metabolic benefits without causing adverse side effects.\n\nThe research was supported by the Human Frontier Science Program, Edward Mallinckrodt Jr. Foundation, National Institutes of Health and American Heart Association.\n\nOther study authors were: Juan Jiang, Margo Emont, Heejin Jun, Xiaona Qiao, Jiling Liao and Dong-il Kim, all of U-M.\n\nThe study is titled \"Cinnamaldehyde induces fat cell-autonomous thermogenesis and metabolic reprogramming,\" DOI: 10.1016/j.metabol.2017.08.006.", "question": "Does the news release adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "There are no specific harms mentioned, however a disclaimer is included in the news release that \u201cWu cautioned that further study is needed to determine how best to harness cinnamaldehyde\u2019s metabolic benefits without causing adverse side effects.\u201d\nConsuming too much cinnamon can cause mouth irritation.

That means screening 1,250 women five times over a 10-year period would save one life, study author Hakan Jonsson said during a teleconference Wednesday. The research was published online Wednesday in the journal Cancer and is to be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual Breast Cancer Symposium, which starts Friday in National Harbor, Md.\n\nThe findings will no doubt do little to quell a controversy that has existed since the 1980s over the value of mammography screenings for women in their 40s.\n\nLast year, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended that women in their 40s not at high risk for breast cancer could forego mammograms until they turned 50 and, even then, it said they only needed to undergo screening once every two years.\n\nThat recommendation met with outrage from breast cancer specialists, while other organizations, including the American Cancer Society, continued to recommend annual mammograms for women in their 40s.\n\nTo further stir the pot, a Norwegian study released last week found that routine mammograms accounted for only about one-third of the decline in breast cancer death rates seen recently.\n\nThe value of mammograms for women 50 and older is not in question.\n\nSpeaking at the teleconference, Dr. Jennifer Obel, chair of the American Society of Clinical Oncology's communications committee, said: \"This study adds to our knowledge of mammogram performance in this age group. Many women aged 40 to 49 want unambiguous recommendations. While the optimal schedule of regular mammograms continues to be discussed by experts in the field, the critical message here is that all women starting at age 40 should talk to their doctor to understand the benefits and risks of screening and to understand what is best.\"\n\n\"Mammography has been shown in study after study to reduce breast cancer deaths in women aged 40 to 49,\" Obel added. \"The real message is that any time we order a diagnostic test, we need to discuss that test with our patients. It remains the best method we have available to detect breast cancer early in the general population.\"\n\nThe authors of the new research, the largest epidemiological study of its kind, looked at screening and mortality data for women in Sweden. Although screening is mandated for woman aged 50 to 69 in that country, the decision to screen earlier is made by individual counties.\n\nThe study authors compared death-registry data on women in their 40s who had been invited by their county to be screened with data on women who had not been invited. In all, more than 1 million women were involved in the study and the follow-up period was a lengthy 16 years.\n\nThe reduction was estimated at 26 percent to 29 percent, depending on the model used, according to the study. The reduction was greater when only those women that actually attended screening were considered.\n\nThe benefits were greater in women aged 45 to 49, vs. those aged 40 to 44, the researchers said.\n\nJonsson, an associate professor of cancer epidemiology at Umea University in Sweden, could not pinpoint exactly why his findings differed from those of other studies. He mentioned certain differences in methodology as a possible factor, as well as the possibility that mammographic techniques have improved over the years.\n\nIn another study released during the Wednesday press conference, researchers from M.D. Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas in Houston found that overall survival rates among breast cancer patients in the past six decades have increased, a trend due largely to earlier detection and treatments.\n\n\"There was a significant improvement in survival overall, including all patients with all stages of breast cancer...even those who had disseminated cancer,\" said study author Dr. Aman Buzdar, a professor of medicine and breast medical oncology at M.D. Anderson.\n\nAlthough the data, which covered breast cancer patients who were treated at M.D. Anderson between 1944 and 2004, came from a single institution, Buzdar said he believes the results can be generalized to other breast cancer patients.\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on mammography.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does a poor job discussing any harms of screening women starting at age 40.\u00a0 We are not told if women 40-44 had more false positive and unncessary biopsies ,or unncessary breast cancer surgery or treatments\u00a0 for pre-cancerious lesions.

Published today in the Journal of Oncology Practice, the study also determined that a systemized process of referrals resulted in significant improvements in 30-day readmission rates, hospice referral, and receipt of chemotherapy after discharge in patients with advanced cancers. This is the first study to demonstrate that among advanced cancer patients admitted to an inpatient oncology service, standardized use of triggers for palliative care consultation is associated with substantial improvement on multiple quality measures.\n\nPatients with advanced cancers often have significant symptoms that affect their emotional status, quality of life, and functional ability. The integration of palliative care improves symptom control and decreases unwanted health care use, yet many patients are never offered these services.\n\n\u201cAs cancer progresses, patients are often at high risk for physical pain and emotional distress,\u201d said Cardinale B.

Patients were eligible for this prospective cohort study if they met one or more eligibility criteria: advanced solid tumor cancer, prior hospitalization within 30 days, hospitalization for more than 7 days, or active symptoms.\n\n\u201cCare for patients with advanced cancer is often characterized by time spent on acute-care hospital wards and intensive care units, or receiving invasive procedures, chemotherapy infusions, and radiographic imaging. Such interventions drive escalating costs and are often directly in conflict with patients\u2019 prior stated wishes,\u201d said Dr. Smith.\n\nConsultation with the palliative care team included establishment of goals of care, advance care plans using standardized communication protocols, transition planning and symptom assessment and treatment using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS). The palliative team was composed of one board certified PC physician, one nurse practitioner, one social worker, a chaplain, and one to two trainees.\n\n\u201cOur results highlight the need to adopt this practice at acute care hospitals across the nation,\u201d said Dr. Smith. \u201cPalliative care involvement helps patients understand their prognosis, establish goals of care, and formulate discharge plans in line with those goals, and this study is the first to confirm the impact of using standardized criteria and automatic palliative care consultation on quality of cancer care.\u201d\n\nCo-authors of the study include Kerin Adelson, MD, Division of Hematology/Oncology at Yale University School of Medicine.\n\nAbout the Mount Sinai Health SystemThe Mount Sinai Health System is an integrated health system committed to providing distinguished care, conducting transformative research, and advancing biomedical education.

But most jails and prisons reject methadone and buprenorphine, the other government-approved medications for opioid addiction, because they are habit-forming and can be abused.\n\nJust ask Joshua Meador, 28, an inmate at Sheridan who hopes to get into the Vivitrol program before his release in January.

If the clot breaks free, it can flow into the brain and cause a stroke.\n\nTo prevent plaques from bursting, the body tries to harden them by depositing calcium salts over and around them, Shaw said.\n\nDoctors learned in the 1990s that these calcified plaques show up on CT scans, and can be used to determine whether a person is suffering from hardening of the arteries, Shaw said.\n\nUp to now, however, there's been little evidence showing that a calcium scan can provide a solid assessment of a person's long-term health risk, the study authors said in background information. Most studies involving these scans have a follow-up of five years or less.\n\nIn this new study, doctors referred 9,715 healthy patients in the Nashville area between 1996 and 1999 to a cardiology outreach screening program provided by the military's Tricare Healthcare System. The patients underwent a calcium scan, and also provided a detailed history of their heart risk factors.\n\nResearchers then tracked the participants for roughly 15 years, taking special note of the 936 patients who died.\n\nAnalysis revealed that the risk of premature death steadily increased with the amount of calcium deposits found in a person's major arteries.\n\nPatients with small levels of arterial calcium had a 68 percent increased overall risk of death, compared to those with no calcium deposits at all. But people with the largest calcium deposits in their arteries had a death risk six times greater than those with no calcium.\n\n\"This is not a new test, but these results emphasize the importance of looking at this marker in addition to the traditional risk factors,\" said Dr. William Zoghbi, past president of the American College of Cardiology and head of cardiovascular imaging for Houston Methodist Hospital.\n\nCalcium scans are currently used to help doctors determine the best treatment for patients who have no heart symptoms but do have high cholesterol or a family history of heart problems, Zoghbi said. This study confirms their usefulness in that regard, he said.\n\n\"Calcium scoring really is the earliest marker in the development of hardening of the arteries in people who have no symptoms,\" he said. \"The best use is in patients who have no symptoms, but the value of the test is not well known.\"\n\nThe results of a calcium scan can be reassuring for people with few or no calcium deposits, and can provide people with high calcium levels with added impetus to take better care of themselves, Shaw said.\n\n\"It can be a very potent motivator,\" she said.\n\nPeople with many calcium deposits can improve their long-term prospects by eating right, exercising, and taking medication to treat heart risk factors such as high blood pressure, elevated blood cholesterol and type 2 diabetes, Shaw said.\n\nShaw thinks calcium scans ultimately could become part of a person's regular physical exam, as common as blood cholesterol tests.

That means that subjecting 100 million adults to this test would be expected to result in 120,000 additional cancers.\nEven if that cancer burden were deemed acceptable, patients sent for additional testing (such as catheter imaging) or prescribed drugs or procedures would be exposed to the risks and costs of those tests and treatments.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Among the less convinced is Dr. John H. Glick, director of the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Glick tells his patients about the new data but does not suggest they skip chemotherapy. After all, he notes, the national guidelines were based on results from large randomized clinical trials. And the recent data indicating that some women can skip chemotherapy are based on an after-the-fact analysis of selected clinical trials.\n\n\"We're in an era where evidence-based medicine should govern practice,\" Dr. Glick said.\n\nFor women with breast cancer, of course, the uncertainty is excruciating. Faced with a disease that already causes indecision and anxiety, they are now confronted with incomplete data, differing opinions from different doctors and a choice that can seem almost impossible: Should they give up a taxing treatment when all the answers are not in and they have what may be a fatal disease?\n\n\"If the medical profession is not even close to being of one mind, how is the woman to know?\" said Donald A. Berry, a statistician at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, the lead author of a recent paper questioning chemotherapy's benefits in many women.\n\nBarbara Brenner, who has had breast cancer and is executive director of the advocacy group Breast Cancer Action, said, \"There's a real problem,\" and added, \"We finally tell people at the end of the day: 'You're going to get a lot of information. Trust your gut. Nobody has the answers.' \"\n\n\"I'm really glad I was diagnosed 13 years ago,\" Ms. Brenner said, \"when there were fewer choices.\"\n\nDoctors worry, too. It took two years before the National Cancer Institute and its researchers could even agree on a design for the large new American study that will test the idea that many women might safely forgo chemotherapy.\n\nThe study, which starts enrolling patients at the end of this month, will involve women whose cancers are fueled by estrogen and have not spread beyond the breast. They will be randomly assigned to have the standard treatment \u2014 chemotherapy followed by a drug like tamoxifen that starves tumors of estrogen \u2014 or to skip chemotherapy and have treatment only with a drug like tamoxifen.\n\nUnlike the American study, the one now planned in Europe will also include women whose cancer has spread beyond their breasts into nearby lymph nodes. The American study may eventually add such women, said Sheila E. Taube, who directs the cancer diagnosis program at the National Cancer Institute.\n\nDr. Taube said the debate reminded her of one a few decades ago, when the question was whether all women with cancer needed mastectomies or whether many could have a lumpectomy instead. \"To me, the situations are analogous,\" she said.\n\nThe chemotherapy question starts with American and European guidelines that say almost every woman with breast cancer that has gone beyond its earliest stages, when it is confined to the milk duct, should have the treatment. And for good reason, many cancer researchers say: a series of large studies has shown that chemotherapy saves lives and that newer and more aggressive regimens are improvements over older ones.\n\nThat has led doctors to feel most at ease giving very aggressive treatments to almost everyone.\n\n\"Part of it is that this area of medicine we're practicing in is kind of a high wire act,\" said Dr. Michael Lee, an oncologist in private practice in Norfolk, Va. \"It is more comfortable to adopt things that are aggressive.\"\n\nBut most of those studies were done at a time when doctors did not distinguish between the 70 percent of women with breast cancers fueled by estrogen and the 30 percent whose cancers were not.\n\nNow Dr. Berry, the M. D. Anderson statistician, and a group of leading cancer researchers have found that the chemotherapy benefits in those clinical trials were concentrated almost exclusively in women whose cancers were impervious to estrogen. For the others, with estrogen-sensitive tumors, the lifesaving benefit came from hormonal therapy. The results of the analysis, published recently in The Journal of the American Medical Association, were the same even if the cancer had spread to the lymph nodes.\n\nThe drawback of that study, Dr. Glick notes, is that it was not a large prospective randomized clinical trial, the gold standard in medicine.\n\nThere is also another issue. What if some women with estrogen-fed tumors do benefit from chemotherapy? How can they be identified?\n\nOne possibility is new genetic tests, which are part of the two studies that are about to begin. The cancer institute is using the Oncotype DX test, which includes genes associated with response to chemotherapy, among them genes involved with a cell's response to estrogen.\n\nThe study is ethical, said Dr. Larry Norton of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, because the only women whose treatment will be decided at random are those in a kind of gray area, not women for whom chemotherapy would be a clear benefit or clearly unnecessary.\n\n\"I think the clinical trial is really a superb one,\" Dr. Norton said. \"I would like to see it go so we have definitive data.\"\n\nIn the meantime, some physicians, like Dr. Winer, are taking their own best shot at figuring out who really benefits from chemotherapy. He asks how sensitive the tumor is to estrogen, how aggressive a pathologist believes it is, how big it is, how much has spread to the lymph nodes and whether its surface has a type of protein, HER2, that is associated with a better response to chemotherapy. After talking through the decision with his patients, he says, he is comfortable omitting chemotherapy in some who would have had it not long ago.\n\nOthers, like Dr. Francisco J. Esteva of M. D. Anderson, use a computer program to calculate a woman's risks of recurrence and give the option of no chemotherapy only to women with low-risk cancers confined to their breasts.\n\nStill others, like Dr. Glick, are starting to tell women with estrogen-fed cancers that although they still need chemotherapy, they may not need the most intense treatment.\n\nAnd while some, including Dr. Winer, predict that the use of chemotherapy will almost certainly decline in the years ahead, for now most doctors are sticking with the current guidelines, waiting for expert advice from national panels on what to do.\n\n\"I don't know that many doctors who are comfortable giving women an option about chemotherapy,\" said Fran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, an advocacy group. \"A lot of physicians talk about the data, but then they say, 'But, to be on the safe side. ...' \"\n\nStill, doctors say it is not simply that they are urging more and more chemotherapy on patients. In many cases, it is patients who want the most aggressive treatment.\n\n\"A cancer diagnosis is earth-shattering,\" said Dr. Lee, who has had cancer himself. \"You stay up at night. You wonder. Even when you're doing well, you don't know whether to trust it.\"\n\nAnd so, he said, \"a lot of people will take a treatment even if there is a very low statistical chance that they will benefit.\"\n\nThat was what happened a few months ago, when Dr. Esteva told Janice Baty of Sulphur, La., a 40-year-old mother of two, that she might not need chemotherapy. After a long discussion with Ms. Baty and her husband, Dr. Esteva left them so they could decide what to do.\n\n\"My husband said, 'Look, we have two little kids,' \" Ms. Baty recalled. \"I called the doctor back in and said, 'We're doing the chemo.' \"\n\nWomen who say they want the most aggressive treatment may not fully realize what they are asking for, said Mary Peelen, 45, of San Francisco. Ms. Peelen learned in January 2005 that she had cancer. It was small, was fed by estrogen and had spread to just two of her lymph nodes. Her oncologist was adamant: chemotherapy was her only option.\n\n\"I felt frightened and very coerced,\" she said. She had an aggressive regimen, suffered terribly and was left with painful nerve damage in her arms and hands that prevents movements like opening jars or using scissors and frequently makes her drop things.\n\nMs. Peelen feels that in a way, she just missed the revolution, perhaps one of the last women with her type of cancer who will have to suffer so much.\n\nFor now, the answers as to who should have chemotherapy are far from clear.\n\n\"I think practice should change, but it's very dicey,\" said Dr. Berry, of M. D. Anderson.\n\nHis colleague Dr. Esteva says it is one thing for a statistician like Dr. Berry to look at retrospective data, and another for a physician, like himself, to sit down with a patient who has to make what may be a life-or-death decision.\n\n\"It's not a perfect science,\" Dr. Esteva said. \"A statistically small reduction in risk may be very important to some women, while for others chemotherapy is not worth it.\"\n\nAnd so, Dr. Esteva said, he is left asking many women with early-stage breast cancer to decide what can seem like the undecidable: whether they want \"to take something potentially toxic when you have a 90 percent chance of being cured without it.\"\n\n\"My experience ,\" he said, \"is that more want to get chemo than not.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not provide enough information on the potential short-term and long-term harms of chemotherapy. There is only anecdotal evidence from one woman who developed nerve damage. Common short-term side effects of chemotherapy can include nausea and vomiting, hair loss, and fatigue.

The research is also the first to show that diet and lifestyle may play a greater role than genetics in cataract development and severity.\n\nCataracts occur naturally with age and cloud the eye\u2019s lens, turning it opaque. Despite the advent of modern cataract removal surgery, cataracts remain the leading cause of blindness globally.1 Researchers at King\u2019s College London looked at whether certain nutrients from food or supplements could help prevent cataract progression. They also tried to find out how much environmental factors such as diet mattered versus genetics.\n\nThe team examined data from more than 1,000 pairs of female twins from the United Kingdom. Participants answered a food questionnaire to track the intake of vitamin C and other nutrients, including vitamins A, B, D, E, copper, manganese and zinc. To measure the progression of cataracts, digital imaging was used to check the opacity of their lenses at around age 60. They performed a follow-up measurement on 324 pairs of the twins about 10 years later.\n\nDuring the baseline measurement, diets rich in vitamin C were associated with a 20 percent risk reduction for cataract. After 10 years, researchers found that women who reported consuming more vitamin C-rich foods had a 33 percent risk reduction of cataract progression.\n\nGenetic factors accounted for 35 percent of the difference in cataract progression. Environmental factors, such as diet, accounted for 65 percent. These results make the study the first to suggest that genetic factors may be less important in progression of cataract than previously thought. How vitamin C inhibits cataract progression may have to do with its strength as an antioxidant. The fluid inside the eye is normally high in vitamin C, which helps prevents oxidation that clouds the lens. More vitamin C in the diet may increase the amount present in the fluid around the lens, providing extra protection. Researchers noted that the findings only pertain to consuming the nutrient through food and not vitamin supplements.\n\n\u201cThe most important finding was that vitamin C intake from food seemed to protect against cataract progression,\u201d said study author Christopher Hammond, M.D., FRCOphth, professor of ophthalmology at King\u2019s College London. \u201cWhile we cannot totally avoid developing cataracts, we may be able to delay their onset and keep them from worsening significantly by eating a diet rich in vitamin C.\u201d \u201cGenetic and Dietary Factors Influencing the Progression of Nuclear Cataract,\u201d Yonova-Doing, et al.

The outcome was excellent, but the recovery was long and horrible. The orthopedist wouldn\u2019t let me drive for six weeks, or run, swim or lift weights for three months. I suffered through weeks of torturous physical therapy. It was nearly six months before I felt normal again.\n\nSo in 2014, after a nurse improperly administered a vaccination that resulted in chronic pain and an MRI revealed another rotator-cuff tear, I vowed I would not go through shoulder surgery (or its aftermath) again.\n\nCortisone injections and physical therapy didn\u2019t help, so I decided to try something else: platelet-rich plasma, a therapy that uses the body\u2019s natural healing properties to mend injuries. Its practitioners believe it will transform orthopedics. Based on my experience with it, I think they are right.\n\nIt may not work for every condition, or for everyone. But it worked for me.\n\n[PRP therapy is popular for sports injuries, but does it work?]\n\nBefore undergoing PRP treatment, I read quite a bit about it, learning that it holds promise for healing soft-tissue injuries such as tearing of the rotator cuff (the group of tendons and muscles that provide stability to the shoulder), tennis elbow, plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendinitis, patella tendinitis and hamstring tears; it may even provide relief for mild to moderate osteoarthritis.\n\n\u201c[PRP] works, and the results have been amazing,\u2019\u2019 says John Ferrell, the sports medicine physician who treated me. \u201cThere still needs to be more research done to perfect the process, but [it] will change the way orthopedics is practiced in the future. We will be more preventive. We will be able to treat ailments noninvasively, and at an earlier stage.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe procedure involves collecting several ounces of blood from a patient\u2019s arm, spinning the blood in a centrifuge to concentrate the platelets and injecting the concentrated platelets into the injury site to stimulate healing. Platelets, the blood cells that promote clotting, contain hundreds of proteins, called growth factors, that are important in repairing injuries.\n\n\u201cPRP works by acting like a stem-cell magnet,\u2019\u2019 says Ferrell, who practices at Regenerative Orthopedics & Sports Medicine, which has several offices in the Washington area. \u201cIt releases growth factors that signal stem cells to come [and] help regenerate the injured area. Rotator-cuff tendon partial tears are notorious for not healing because of the poor blood supply there. PRP actually creates new blood vessels that feed the tendon the proper nutrients it needs to heal.\u2019\u2019\n\nA recent pilot study conducted at the Glen Sather Sports Medicine Clinic at the University of Alberta on rotator-cuff tears supports this. It showed tissue healing in five of seven of the patients who received PRP, as well as improvements in their pain and function.\n\nThe researchers call the results \u201cclinically relevant,\u2019\u2019 despite the study\u2019s small size, and say the next step should be a larger, controlled clinical trial. \u201cI\u2019ve heard some skeptics call PRP a cure looking for a disease, but it is being used in so many areas of medicine now with promising outcomes,\u201d says Marni Wesner, a sports medicine physician at the clinic and one of the study\u2019s authors. \u201cThe potential for benefit from PRP is real.\u2019\u2019\n\nI had my first appointment with Ferrell last October to find out whether PRP might help me. By then, my painful shoulder had been keeping me up nights for more than a year. It bothered me while swimming and lifting weights, and while getting dressed. By performing several tests to assess my strength and range of motion, Ferrell discovered that my left shoulder \u2014 the site of the tear \u2014 was considerably weaker than my right.\n\nHe then used ultrasound to find the tear and showed it to me on a monitor. It turned out to be larger than indicated in the static MRI pictures I had obtained earlier.\n\nBefore deciding whether PRP was right for me, he had to be sure that the tear was the source of my pain and weakness. He injected an anesthetic into the tear, then he ran the strength tests again. My strength was significantly better. This meant that the tear was causing my problems, and fixing it probably would restore strength and function to my shoulder and end my pain.\n\nI had the first PRP injection on Oct. 23. It was painful, and the aching persisted for about 36 hours. I had one bad night, followed by an uncomfortable day. After that, the pain stopped. Still, Ferrell advised me to baby the shoulder \u2014 to use my other arm when holding a dog leash and to skip swimming and weights for two weeks. Running was fine. He also recommended physical therapy after two weeks.\n\nAfter what I went through in 2008, those were restrictions I could live with.\n\nFerrell told me not to use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, such as ibuprofen, for a week after the injection because the goal is to encourage, not stifle, inflammation. Other pain relievers such as acetaminophen were okay. \u201cWe want to stimulate an acute inflammatory reaction, which will trigger the healing cascade to start to work,\u2019\u2019 Ferrell says.\n\nBecause there is not yet enough research on PRP \u2014 and because some studies have shown mixed results \u2014 insurance will not cover it.\n\nStill, \u201cit has significant cost savings\u201d compared with surgery, Ferrell says. The average treatment is two injections, which costs about $1,000 at his practice, whereas rotator-cuff surgery runs about $13,000, he says, although insurance often covers most of the costs of surgery.\n\nWith additional research, insurance may ultimately pay for PRP. Unfortunately, there is little financial incentive to conduct such studies because there is nothing for the Food and Drug Administration to approve, such as a drug or device. The centrifuges already are licensed, and the procedure uses a patient\u2019s own blood, which is regarded as safe. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons \u2014 which says PRP \u201cholds great promise\u2019\u2019 \u2014 describes the risk as minimal.\n\nThose who seek this treatment must look for a clinician with considerable PRP experience \u2014 someone who does the procedure several times a day, not once or twice a month \u2014 and who has a good success rate, Ferrell says.\n\nMoreover, \u201cyou see the greatest results when the injections are done under direct visualization with ultrasound,\u201d he adds.\n\nBy February, the ultrasound showed my tear to be about 80 percent healed. The remaining tear was quite small. Ferrell recommended a second injection to finish the job.\n\nI had it on March 4.\n\nWhen I returned to see him on April 12, I was feeling pretty good. No pain, no problems. He rolled in the ultrasound machine, and I was not surprised by the results. The tear was completely gone.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The only mention of potential harms in the story comes in this statement:\u00a0 \u201cThe American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons \u2014 which says PRP \u2018holds great promise\u2019 \u2014 describes the risk as minimal.\u201d\u00a0 That\u2019s not\u00a0acceptable given that there is no explanation of what those risks might be.

Some days the pain is so bad, she says, \"By 11 o'clock in the morning, I'm on the couch in a darkened room with my head packed in ice.\"\n\nOver the years, Bradford, who is 50 years old and lives in Bedford, Mass., has searched desperately for pain relief. She's been to the doctor countless times for countless tests. \"Everything I've had, I've had twice,\" she says. \"I've had two spinal taps; I've had so many nerve blocks I've lost count.\"\n\nBradford is not alone. It's estimated that every year 12 million Americans go to the doctor seeking help for headaches. Nearly one quarter of the population suffers from recurrent severe tension headaches or migraines.\n\nPeople who go to the doctor for headaches are increasingly likely to be sent for advanced testing and treatment, a study finds. That testing is expensive, it may not be necessary and it could even be harmful, says lead researcher Dr. John Mafi, of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.\n\nMafi looked at the rates of advanced imaging like CT scans and MRIs in people with headaches, as well as referrals to other doctors, presumably specialists. He found that from 1999 to 2010, the number of diagnostic tests rose from 6.7 percent of all doctor visits to 13.9 percent. At the same time, referrals to other doctors increased from 6.9 percent to 13.2 percent. In other words, almost double what it was a decade ago.\n\nMafi says this isn't because more people are suffering headaches. The headache rate has remained virtually the same over the past decade. But what has changed is supply and demand. Today there are a lot more advanced diagnostic machines than there were a decade ago, and more patients are asking to be tested.\n\n\"Patients are more assertive than ever before,\" Mafi says. \"They do research online, are more informed and sometimes go to the doctor demanding, 'I think I need an MRI.' \"\n\nAnd while an informed patient is a good thing, Mafi says sometimes the patient gets it wrong. \"I think there's a subconscious perception that more is better, and that fancier, more expensive tests are better and that equals better care.\"\n\nMafi's study did not include patients with tumors or other serious problems that can cause headaches. He only looked at otherwise healthy patients who suffered chronic headaches. And in these cases, repeated diagnostic testing can lead to further unnecessary procedures like biopsies.\n\nOn top of that, exposure to radiation in tests like CT scans adds up over time and can increase the risk of certain cancers.\n\nFor Terri Bradford, the years of searching for effective treatment proved futile. \"I've been to four neurologists. A lot of them have given up on me because I haven't gotten any better,\" she says.\n\nEventually Bradford ended up at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where neurologist Carolyn Bernstein directs the Comprehensive Headache Center. Bernstein says she sees lots of desperate patients like Bradford. \"The majority of them have really been suffering a number of years and they're really miserable with the pain,\" Bernstein says. They say, \" 'I hope you have a magic pill,' and of course there is no magic pill.\"\n\nThere is just no single reason why people get chronic headaches, although we do know that migraines have a genetic component and usually a trigger. \"If you are a migraine sufferer and I expose you to the right trigger, you're going to have a migraine,\" Bernstein says.\n\nBut the triggers are different for different people. They can include poor diet, too much sugar or certain types of alcohol. Problems sleeping, stress, lack of exercise or a combination of any number of these things can cause chronic headaches.\n\nAt the headache center, patients receive a thorough medical history that includes headache patterns, disability and mood assessments. Then the center works with patients to try to identify what triggers their headaches and how they can avoid those triggers in the future.\n\nSome people find relief through exercise. \"I write an exercise prescription probably as often as I write a prescription for medication,\" Bernstein says. She acknowledges it's sometimes difficult to encourage a patient with cracking head pain to get up and exercise. But even a little can help, and according to Bernstein it doesn't have to be jogging for miles and miles. It can be yoga, tai chi or even just a little stretching.\n\nA big lifestyle adjustment worked for Terri Bradford. She started exercising and changed her diet, giving up gluten, dairy and sugar. And she learned how to meditate to reduce stress. All these changes, she says, have made a huge difference. She has far fewer headaches and when she does have them, they're far less severe. \"I'm finally healing,\" she says.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "A strong point of this story is that it does explore the potential harm from unnecessary diagnostic tests.

Among the study's findings:\n\nAdults in the baby-boom and older generations tended to be much more likely to experience clinically meaningful changes.\n\nObese patients experienced significant improvements, but those improvements were not retained over time.\n\nPatients who were taking opioids experienced improvements in their pain from disability in some cases but were two times less likely to experience clinically meaningful change compared to those who were not taking opioids.\n\nWhile the study results are promising, much more work needs to be done, Munk said: \"The fact of the matter is that chronic lower back pain is very complex and often requires a maintenance-type approach versus a short-term intervention option.\"\n\nAdditional investigation is needed to replicate the results of the initial study and to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of massage therapy, Munk said.\n\n\"Massage is an out-of-pocket cost,\" she said. \"Generally, people wonder if it is worth it.

In Canada, that\u2019s roughly 3.6 million people. Many of these individuals turn to adaptive devices designed to magnify objects and text, but these devices can be prohibitively expensive, uni-functional and bulky.\n\nEnter the iPad: a technological device that\u2019s relatively cheap, serves many purposes, is smaller than most books, and \u2014 according to new research from Concordia University in Montreal \u2014 is just as effective a visual aid as traditional devices.\n\nA study recently described in Good Times Magazine provides the first experimental evidence that the Apple iPad is as good as technology traditionally used in reading rehabilitation for individuals with visual impairment.\n\nAnd that could help with stigmatization of the elderly and disabled.\n\nFor the study, the Concordia-based research team recruited 100 participants who ranged in age from 24 to 97. A little over half the participants had age-related macular degeneration, a disease characterized by the deterioration of the small central portion of the retina that is normally responsible for fine detailed vision tasks such as reading.\n\nThe researchers used questionnaires and tests to gauge participants\u2019 visual ability, and then compared the Apple iPad versus two traditionally used magnification devices, to see if reading rates varied across devices.\n\n\u201cUnsurprisingly, we found that most participants found it hard to read small and medium text, while nearly a quarter of them reported that reading large text was much easier,\u201d says Elliott Morrice, an MA student in Concordia\u2019s Department of Psychology and the study\u2019s first author.\n\n\u201cWhat was interesting to note was that it didn\u2019t matter what technology was used to do the magnification: an iPad worked just as well as a traditional device like a closed circuit television system (CCTV),\u201d he says. \u201cWhen we took previous experience into account, we found that participants who had used iPads before read on average 30 words per minute faster than those who were using the iPad for the first time. But there were no significant differences in the reading rates of participants who had previous experience using the CCTV, compared to the reading rates of first-time CCTV users.\u201d\n\nAnother benefit is that many older adults feel stigmatized by using the traditional devices, because they identify them as having an impairment or disability.\n\n\u201cTablet computers offer many of the same benefits while being socially acceptable,\u201d says Aaron Johnson, the study\u2019s senior author, and an associate professor in the psychology department, and a member of the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Rehabilitation of Greater Montreal (CRIR).\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more, compared to the devices currently used by those with low vision, iPads are multi-functional, allowing the user to go online, check email, make video calls \u2014 and they cost less than the traditional devices,\u201d he says. \u201cThis cost saving can be both to the individual, and if appropriate, to the insurance companies that may provide individuals with assistive devices.\u201d\n\nPartners in research: This work was supported in part by the Vision Health Research Network, the Fonds de recherche du Qu\u00e9b\u00e9c - Sant\u00e9, the Antoine Turmel Foundation, CRIR, and the MAB-Mackay Foundation.

The results will be presented in a poster presentation titled Lung EpiCheck \u2122 - Results of the Training and Test Sets of a Methylation-Based Blood Test for Early Detection of Lung Cancer at the IASLC 19th World Conference on Lung Cancer hosted by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, to take place on September 22-26, 2018 in Toronto, Canada.\n\nIn the study, blood was prospectively collected from 20 centers and 3 biobanks in Europe and Israel. The samples were used for detection of lung cancer with the Lung EpiCheck blood test. Lung EpiCheck was validated on this independent test set comprising 181 lung cancer cases and 141 current or former smoker controls. Results show specificity of 91% and a sensitivity of 74% with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 89%. These results demonstrated similar performance to the preceding training set results from 102 lung cancer cases and 265 current or former smoker controls.\n\nIn particular, in the non-small-cell lung carcinoma group (n=162), the most prevalent type of lung cancer affecting about 85% of lung cancer patients, Lung EpiCheck was able to identify correctly approximately 70% of patients. With a correct identification of 59% of stage I patients, 77% of stage II, 76% of stage III and 83% of stage IV patients.\n\nIn the small cell lung cancer group (n=13), Lung EpiCheck was able to identify correctly 92% of the patients, with a sensitivity of 100% in the limited stage, and 86% at the extensive stage.\n\n\"Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer worldwide due to the high incidence of the disease, and the low rate of diagnosis at early and more curable stages,\" stated Prof. Mina Gaga, the President of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and a lead investigator in the study. \"Clearly, we must establish screening programs for lung cancer worldwide. At the moment, low-dose computerized tomography (LDCT) screening which has been shown to reduce mortality from lung cancer in the very large NLST study is only reimbursed in the US for high-risk individuals. LDCT screening is not reimbursed in Europe or most areas in the world while there is still a debate about its cost and safety. Screening is however necessary in order to identify lung cancer at early, operable, stages for the entire at-risk population so currently, not only CT screening but also methods of molecular screening are being tested. I am therefore very encouraged with the results of this study, showing that EpiCheck has the ability to identify both non-small-cell and small-cell lung cancer at early stages, with a high level of sensitivity and specificity. Such promising results combined with the simplicity of the test, could allow us to detect lung cancer at the early stages and hence improve 5-year survival from about 15% to about 50-70%. This will offer significant added value in the fight against lung cancer.\"\n\n\"We are very excited to present the best published clinically validated results of a blood test for the early detection of lung cancer,\" said Opher Shapira, PhD, CEO of Nucleix. \"Furthermore, these results were validated prospectively in an independent cohort. Currently, early stage lung cancer can be detected either accidentally, when testing for other conditions, or by using low-dose CT scans, which are costly, carry associated risks such as high radiation, and are employed only for a very high-risk population. Early detection of lung cancer can be a game-changer in the fight against this devastating disease, and we are looking forward to begin extensive clinical trials in the US, Europe and China next year, in order to get the test to the market as soon as possible at an affordable price.\"\n\nThe Lung EpiCheck blood test is based on a proprietary molecular biomarker technology, which combines new biochemical assays and sophisticated algorithms. The technology is based on identification and analysis of subtle changes in DNA methylation patterns, a powerful tool for distinguishing between cancer and healthy cells and thus for detection of tumors in the body. Dying tumor cells release cell-free DNA (cfDNA) into the blood, where cancer-specific methylation changes can be detected at any disease stage. The Lung EpiCheck blood test detects changes in DNA methylation in 6 markers in cfDNA associated with lung cancer.\n\nLung cancer is the deadliest and most common of all cancer types. It is estimated that there are about 1.8 million new cases of lung cancer annually worldwide and about 1.55 million die from the disease each year. The reason for the high mortality rate is that currently most cases are detected when the patient becomes symptomatic, which is usually at late stages of the disease. To date, there is no adequate screening process for the early detection of lung cancer, bringing 5-year survival rate to approximately 15%. In addition, there is a well-defined risk group for developing the disease \u2013 mostly smokers and former smokers above the age of 50. In the US, low-dose CT is available for screening of individuals 55-79 years old who smoked at least 1 pack a day for 30 years, which represent less than half of the lung cancer population. Therefore, a screening test aimed at the entire risk group to assist in the early detection of the disease is highly needed and can dramatically increase lung cancer survival.\n\nNucleix Ltd. develops, manufactures and markets innovative, non-invasive, molecular cancer diagnostic tests. Its highly sensitive and specific tests are based on identification of subtle changes in methylation patterns. Nucleix's technology is based on a combination of a new biochemical assay in conjunction with sophisticated algorithms.

All are probably still viable treatment options, but what we don't know is what each particular patient will need,\" Bronfort said, adding that it's possible a combination of treatments might be helpful, too.\n\nResults of the study are published in the Jan. 3 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine. Funding for the study was provided by the U.S. National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine.\n\nNeck pain is an extremely common problem. About three-quarters of adults report having neck pain at some point in their lives, according to background information in the study. Neck pain is responsible for millions of health care visits each year, and it can have a negative impact on quality of life.\n\nSpinal manipulation is one type of treatment that's offered for neck pain, and it can be administered by chiropractors, physical therapists, osteopaths and other health care providers, according to the study.\n\nBut, there isn't much evidence for treating neck pain with spinal manipulation. There also isn't a great deal of information on how effective medications or home exercise programs are for treating neck pain, the researchers noted.\n\nBronfort and colleagues thought that spinal manipulation might prove to be more effective than medications or home exercise therapy. To test their hypothesis, they recruited 272 people between the ages of 18 and 65 who had neck pain. Their neck pain had no known cause, such as a trauma or pinched nerve, and the patients been experiencing the pain for between two and 12 weeks when the study began.\n\nThe study volunteers were randomly selected for one of three treatment groups. One group received spinal manipulations over a 12-week period. Each individual was allowed to choose the number of spinal manipulations they felt they needed.\n\nThe second group received medications, both over the counter and prescription, depending on their needs. First-line medications included nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications or acetaminophen (Tylenol). If people didn't get relief from these drugs, narcotic pain medications and muscle relaxants were offered.\n\nThe third group was assigned two one-hour sessions of home exercise. The goal of the home-exercise program was to improve movement in the neck area. Participants were instructed to do the exercises six to eight times per day.\n\nAt the 12th week, 82 percent of people receiving spinal manipulation reported at least a 50 percent reduction in pain, compared with 69 percent of those on medication and 77 percent doing home exercises. Also at week 12, of people receiving spinal manipulation, 32 percent reported feeling a 100 percent reduction in pain, compared with 13 percent on medications and 30 percent doing home exercises.\n\nAt one year, 27 percent of those receiving spinal manipulation said they felt a 100 percent reduction in pain versus 17 percent of those on medications and 37 percent of those doing home exercises.\n\n\"For me, as an ER doctor, this study offers an interesting perspective,\" said Dr. Robert Glatter, an attending physician in emergency medicine at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"It's a small study, but it found that home exercises and spinal manipulation were effective. So, should we be referring to physical therapists, osteopaths or chiropractors from the ER?\"\n\n\"This study shows that basically neck pain will get better on its own,\" said Dr. Victor Khabie, chief of the departments of surgery and sports medicine at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. \"It would've been good if they had a no-treatment group, too,\" he added.\n\n\"Everyone heals differently. There are different pathways to healing, and whether you feel you're better off with chiropractic, home exercises or medications, this study shows that all three are basically just as effective. Whatever your pathway to healing, in about six to eight weeks, you should start to feel better,\" said Khabie.\n\nHe also noted that it's important for anyone receiving spinal manipulation to know that there are rare, but serious risks that can occur with neck manipulations.\n\nAll three experts said anyone experiencing neck pain needs to have it evaluated to make sure there isn't a serious or correctable cause of the pain.

Pavlick, head of the melanoma program at New York University.\n\nStill, doctors and patient groups welcomed the progress because until now treatment of melanoma that had spread beyond the skin to distant organs \u201cwas terrible even by routine cancer standards,\u201d said Dr. Vernon K. Sondak, chairman of cutaneous oncology at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Fla.\n\nAlso, the number of melanoma cases has been rising, unlike for many other types of cancer. Doctors say that is because of unprotected sun exposure years ago, the proliferation of tanning salons and perhaps more attention to detecting the disease.\n\nThere were about 68,000 new cases of melanoma and about 8,700 deaths last year in the United States, up from 48,000 cases and 7,700 deaths in 2000, according to the American Cancer Society. Particularly fast increases have occurred among people older than 65 and among women 15 to 39 years old.\n\nVemurafenib is the latest so-called targeted therapy, which inhibits the effects of genetic mutations that spur tumor growth and spread. In particular, the drug counters the effect of a mutation in a gene called B-RAF that was discovered in 2002 to be common in melanomas. (The drug\u2019s name comes from V600E mutation in RAF.)\n\nThe drug, which is taken orally twice a day, would be used only by the roughly half of melanoma patients whose tumors have this mutation. The drug significantly shrinks tumors in about half of these patients \u2014 or about a quarter of all melanoma patients.\n\nIt was developed by Roche and Plexxikon, a biotechnology company in Berkeley, Calif., that was recently acquired by Daiichi Sankyo of Japan. The drug is expected to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration within a few months.\n\nIpilimumab, the other new drug, releases a brake on the body\u2019s immune system, allowing it to more effectively attack the tumor. Developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, it was approved in March and is sold under the name Yervoy.\n\nA series of articles in The New York Times last year followed the development of vemurafenib, then known as PLX4032, and recounted how some patients close to death seemed to make miraculous recoveries.\n\nThe effect, however, typically lasts only about seven months before the cancer starts to grow again, though some patients benefit for more than two years.\n\nS. Taylor Chance, a 67-year-old real estate agent in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., has been taking vemurafenib in a clinical trial since March 2010. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the trial I wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d she said.\n\nIt has not been all good.

Chapman of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, 38 percent of participants had to stop taking the drug or lower the dose because of side effects, including rash and joint pain. Many patients get minor skin cancers that can be removed by dermatologists.\n\nThe trial of ipilimumab, paid for by Bristol-Myers, involved 502 patients with late-stage melanoma.\n\nLast year at this conference, researchers presented results of a trial showing a survival advantage for patients who had undergone a previous treatment. The new trial of this drug, by contrast, involved patients who were getting treated for the first time.\n\nWhile the extension of median survival of two months, from about 9 months to about 11 months, was less than some experts expected, researchers said the real benefit was that a small number of patients, perhaps 10 to 20 percent, could live a long time.\n\nBecause it unleashes the immune system, ipilimumab can have serious side effects. In the latest trial, a big one was liver damage.\n\nA course of treatment of ipilimumab costs $120,000. The price of vemurafenib has not been announced, but is expected to be at least tens of thousands of dollars per year.\n\nDoctors are eager to try the two drugs together.

Rex, director of endoscopy and professor of medicine at Indiana University, that cannot be the entire explanation because at least one study, as yet unpublished, involving California Medi-Cal patients also found the test missed many cancers on the right side of the colon.\n\nThat leaves several other possibilities.\n\nPerhaps patients did not sufficiently cleanse their bowels of fecal material, a particular problem for the right side of the colon.\n\n\u201cAfter the prep has been completed, mucus and intestinal secretions start rolling out of the small intestine and colon,\u201d Dr. Rex explained. The secretions, he added, pour from the base of the appendix into the right side of the colon and are \u201cvery sticky\u201d and can obscure polyps.\n\nOne solution, supported by six studies, is to be sure there is just a short time between when patients finish taking the strong laxative that cleanses their bowel and the colonoscopy, Dr. Rex said. That usually means taking half of the laxative the night before the screening test and the rest in the morning, something that often is not done, he added, but that he and others recommend.\n\nCancer may also be different in the right colon, researchers said.\n\nFlat and indented polyps tend to cluster in the right colon. And so do another kind, serrated lesions, which, some studies indicate, might turn into cancer much more quickly than typical polyps.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that we will never get as good a result\u201d in the right colon, said Robert Smith, director of screening for the American Cancer Society.\n\nStill, he said, that does not mean that patients should have more frequent colonoscopies. The tests are \u201chugely expensive,\u201d he said, and insurers may not pay for more frequent colonoscopies. The test also carries a small risk of perforating the bowel. Even if colonoscopies miss some cancers, colon cancer remains a rare disease and, after a colonoscopy, \u201cthe likelihood that you have cancer is very, very low,\u201d Dr. Smith said.\n\nDr. Harold C. Sox, editor of the Annals of Internal Medicine, is choosing another option. He is having a stool test, the fecal occult blood test, between colonoscopies. It looks for blood in the stool, which can arise from colon cancer.\n\nDr. Smith does not advocate that strategy, saying that the stool test can have false positives from things like red meat or broccoli that have nothing to do with colon cancer. He worries that frequent stool tests will lead to frequent false alarms and frequent colonoscopies without making much of a dent in the colon cancer death rate.\n\nCT colonoscopies, so-called virtual colonoscopies, are not a solution, some screening experts said.\n\n\u201cThe issues are prep quality, flat lesions, serrated lesions and people not being careful enough in the inspection process,\u201d Dr. Rex said. There is no evidence, he added, that a virtual colonoscopy will help with the inspection process. And, he said, \u201cit almost certainly is not as effective a technology as colonoscopy for flat and serrated lesions.\u201d\n\nInstead, patients should be compulsive about their bowel prep and be sure the test is done by one of the best colonoscopists in their area, gastroenterologists said. Doctors should find polyps in at least 25 percent of men and 15 percent of women. They should take at least eight minutes to withdraw an endoscope from the colon. And they should do a high volume of screening. Dr. Smith said a high volume was at least three or four colonoscopies a day.\n\nAfter the test, patients can ask whether the doctor got to the right side of the colon and how that was documented.\n\nColon cancer experts said people should realize that even if colonoscopies prevent just 60 percent of colon cancer deaths, that still is a lot. Mammograms, for example, prevent 25 percent of breast cancer deaths, and the PSA test for men has not been shown to prevent prostate cancer deaths.\n\n\u201cIf I was to provide one main message, it would be that colonoscopies are the way that colon cancer mortality gets reduced,\u201d Dr. Ransohoff said. \u201cColonoscopy is a good test, but it isn\u2019t completely effective. And you know what? We ought to be happy with that.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story mentions the risk of perforations, missed cancers and \"unpleasant\" preparation as the risks/side effects of colonoscopy.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Pets Help People Manage The Pain Of Serious Mental Illness\n\nAny pet owner will tell you that their animal companions comfort and sustain them when life gets rough. This may be especially true for people with serious mental illness, a study finds. When people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder were asked who or what helped them manage the condition, many said it was pets that helped the most.\n\n\"When I'm feeling really low they are wonderful because they won't leave my side for two days,\" one study participant with two dogs and two cats, \"They just stay with me until I am ready to come out of it.\"\n\nAnother person said of their pet birds: \"If I didn't have my pets I think I would be on my own. You know what I mean, so it's \u2014 it's nice to come home and, you know, listen to the birds singing and that, you know.\"\n\nMany people with serious mental illness live at home and have limited contact with the health care system, says Helen Brooks, a mental health researcher at University of Manchester in the United Kingdom and the lead author on the study, which was published Friday in the journal BMC Psychiatry. So they're doing a lot of the work of managing their conditions.\n\nBrooks says, \"Many felt deep emotional connections with their pet that weren't available from friends and family.\"\n\nBrooks and her colleagues interviewed 54 people with serious long-term mental illnesses. Twenty-five of them considered their pets to be a part of their social network. The scientists asked who they went to when they needed help or advice, where they gained emotional support and encouragement and how they spent their days.\n\nThe participants were then given a diagram with three consecutive circles radiating out from a square representing the participant. They were asked to write the people, places and things that gave them support into the circles, with the circles closest to the center being the most important.\n\nSixty percent of the people who considered pets to be a part of their social networks placed them in the central, most important circle \u2014 the same place many people put close family and social workers. 20 percent placed pets in the second circle.\n\nThe interviews with participants are poignant, and reveal the struggle and isolation that can come with mental illness.\n\n\"I think it's really hard when you haven't had a mental illness to know what the actual experience is [like],\" said one participant. \"There's like a chasm, deep chasm between us ... [Other people are] on one side of it, and we're on the other side of it. We're sending smoke signals to each other to try and understand each other but we don't always \u2014 we don't always understand.\"\n\nPeople with mental illnesses often see their social groups shrink and find themselves alienated from their friends. For many of these people, says Brooks, animals can break through the isolation. They give affection without needing to understand the disorder.\n\n\"[Pets] don't look at the scars on your arms,\" one participant said. \"They don't question where you've been.\"\n\nThe pets provided more than just emotional support and companionship, participants said. The animals also could distract them from their illness, even from severe psychosis.\n\nOne study participant placed birds in his closest social circle. When he was hearing voices, he said that they \"help me in the sense, you know, I'm not thinking about the voices, I'm just thinking of when I hear the birds singing.\"\n\nAnother participant said that merely seeing a hamster climbing the bars on the cage and acting cute helped with some difficult situations.\n\nAnd having to take care of pets keeps people from withdrawing from the world. \"They force me, the cats force me to sort of still be involved,\" said one participant.\n\nAnother said that walking the dog helped them get out of the house and with people. \"That surprised me, you know, the amount of people that stop and talk to him, and that, yeah, it cheers me up with him. I haven't got much in my life, but he's quite good, yeah.\"\n\n\"The routine these pets provide is really important for people,\" says Brooks. \"Getting up in the morning to feed them and groom them and walk them, giving them structure and a sense of purpose that they won't otherwise have.\"\n\nMany of the study participants are unemployed because of their illness, she notes. Having a pet that was well taken care of was a source of pride for them.\n\nMark Longsjo, the program director of adult services at McLean Southeast, an inpatient mental facility in Middleborough, Mass., says that the interviews in the study reflect his professional experiences. \"We have so many patients come through, and we always ask them about their support system. Sometimes its family members, sometimes its friends, but it's very common to hear about pets.\"\n\nWhen he does patient intake surveys, Longsjo says that he includes pets in their risk assessments. Patients with pets often say the animals help keep them from following through on suicidal thinking, because they know their pets depend on them.\n\nThe social workers at McLean also incorporate pets into their aftercare planning, encouraging patients to make walking and grooming their pets a part of their routine. \"I think there's significant value in considering the common everyday pet to be as important as the relationships one has with one's family in the course of their treatment,\" says Longsjo. He feels this study is important because, although there's a lot of work looking at the benefits of trained therapy animals, they can be expensive and out of the reach of many patients.\n\nBrooks hopes that more health workers will consider incorporating pets into care plans for people with mental illness. Many of her participants said that sometimes it felt like their pets could sense when they needed help the most, and were able to provide it \u2014 just like the owners took care of them.\n\nAs one person in the study said, \"When he comes up and sits beside you on a night, it's different, you know.

The company says this is a major step forward in treating PAD because, unlike stents, atherectomy \"leaves no metal behind.\"\n\nA stent is a tiny metal wire mesh tube that props open an artery and is left there permanently. But in leg arteries, the active flexing can cause a stent to break. Being able to clear the blockage just as well without stents reduces possible complications and gives greater flexibility to doctors later, said Brian Verrier, vice president and general manager of peripheral vascular for Covidien.\n\n\"This particular product plays very strongly into where we see the market going,\" he said. \"The potential is huge.\"\n\nAtherectomy is only used in about 15 to 20 percent of PAD cases, but Dr. Lawrence Garcia, a principal investigator in the study, said he expects that to change with these results.\n\n\"I think it has the potential to increase business for Covidien,\" Garcia, chief of interventional cardiology and vascular interventions at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Boston, said Thursday. He said he has no financial stake in the company.\n\nThe study is the largest to look at the effectiveness of atherectomy, Covidien said, and enrolled 800 patients at 47 centers in the U.S. and Europe. Doctors found that Covidien's SilverHawk and TurboHawk devices, which are snaked down through a small incision near the groin and basically shave away and remove the plaque, performed as well after 12 months as angioplasty and stenting.\n\nThe devices had been developed at EV3 Inc., a Plymouth med-tech company that Covidien acquired in 2010.\n\nThomas Gunderson, a senior analyst for Piper Jaffray & Co., said the Covidien study could lead to greater use of atherectomy and a bigger market.\n\n\"It's a good opportunity,\" Gunderson said. \"This will reawaken both the users and the nonusers to say, wait a second, now we have data.\"\n\nAlso of note, Garcia said, is that the procedure proved as effective at improving blood flow for patients with diabetes as those without diabetes. It's a key finding, because patients with diabetes usually suffer from more advanced PAD and the blood vessels re-clog faster than for those who do not.\n\nCovidien, based in Ireland, has its U.S. headquarters in Massachusetts.

It\u2019s an emotional decision that women often make quickly, considering that surgeries often take place within days of their cancer diagnosis.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about the women who are on the fence and make a very quick decision before really considering the other options or the fact that it is an irreversible procedure,\u201d said Dr. Todd Tuttle, the U\u2019s chief of surgical oncology and lead author of the study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\nWhen diagnosed with cancer in her right breast last year, Debra Elmore-Nesheim talked with her new husband and other relatives about the appropriate treatment. But the 43-year-old\u2019s instinct was to have both breasts removed.\n\n\u201cPart of it is emotional,\u201d said Elmore-Nesheim, a pediatric nurse who lives in St. Paul. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t do as much as possible to eliminate the cancer, I would feel like I was almost waiting for the other shoe to drop.\u201d\n\nWomen removing a single cancerous breast have a 1 percent chance per year of suffering cancer in the other breast. That makes removing both breasts a better option for younger women with longer life spans. Many oncologists also recommend it for women with genetic predispositions for breast cancer.\n\nFor other women, a double mastectomy might eliminate another breast cancer, but it won\u2019t stop cancer from resurfacing in vital organs, Tuttle said. He hopes women aren\u2019t making the choice believing it will result in longer life, because the evidence is sketchy at best.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then we have a problem on our hands, because we\u2019re not providing adequate information to our patients,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s happening because of fear or the common reason I hear \u2013 \u2018I just want to be done with it\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s a different situation.\u201d\n\nTuttle\u2019s study found 60 percent of women with breast cancer chose lumpectomies, which remove only the tumors, not the whole breasts. Research has found this procedure is equally effective, particularly with smaller tumors and often when used in combination with radiation.\n\nOf the women in Tuttle\u2019s study who received mastectomies in 2003, 11 percent chose to have both breasts removed. That is an increase from 4.2 percent in 1998.\n\nThe rising use of magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, is likely contributing to the increase in double mastectomies, said Dr. Joseph Leach, a medical oncologist with Park Nicollet Health Services. Such scans are becoming standard for women who appear to have cancer in one breast, and half the time they raise suspicions about the other breast.\n\nWhile these suspicions rarely end up as cancer, they do often result in follow-up tests such as biopsies and ultrasounds that can frighten patients, Leach said.\n\n\u201cOur own impression is that women in some ways are getting sort of scared into having prophylactic mastectomies because of having these uncertain tests,\u201d Leach said.\n\nBoth Leach and Tuttle are pursuing research studies to address the why question.\n\nWomen choosing to have both breasts removed face higher surgery costs and slightly higher risks of post-surgery complications and infections.\n\nMost women are satisfied after double mastectomies, but a Mayo Clinic survey showed that as many as 10 percent are unsatisfied because of their appearance or medical complications. The survey results came a decade ago, however, when the safety of breast implants was a major issue, said Mayo\u2019s Dr. Lynn Hartmann.\n\nThe safety concerns have been reduced and cosmetic procedures have improved, but some women still probably regret the decision, she said.\n\nHartmann said doctors could take pressure off women by performing lumpectomies first to eliminate their cancer tumors. Then the women can have genetic tests and assess their risks for follow-up cancers before deciding whether to have one or both breasts removed.\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019ve just put some time on the table for them rather than trying to have them make this major decision \u2026 in a brief period of time,\u201d she said.\n\nElmore-Nesheim, the nurse with breast cancer, said cosmetic concerns played a role. She wondered with age what she would look like with an implant on one side and a healthy breast on the other. But mostly, she was scared for her life.

If not for a new surgical technique, a minimally invasive procedure which uses 3-D printing technology, the adventurous Berg might never have been able to return to her passions of traveling, snorkeling and cooking.\n\nIt began in September 2016 when Berg was rushed to the hospital after experiencing a major heart attack in her car.\n\nBut the heart attack wasn't the only danger. After a series of tests, the doctors made a shocking discovery. Parts of her aorta, the largest blood vessel in the body, were so enlarged that it could rupture at any moment. The deadly condition is called an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and Berg had not one but two of them \u2014 measuring 5 centimeters and 6.5 centimeters wide \u2014 making surgery dangerous.\n\n\u201cIt was a life-and-death situation,\u201d says Berg. \u201cI was not a candidate for open surgery. When they would open me up [the aorta] could just blow.\u201d\n\nThe bulge in the large artery that carries blood away from the heart can be immediately life-threatening if it grows large enough to rupture. The chance of survival when it ruptures is less than 10 percent.\n\nAccording to the Society for Vascular Surgery, every year, roughly 200,000 Americans are diagnosed with abdominal aortic aneurysms. These aneurysms often grow slowly, without symptoms, but some people may notice a pulsating feeling near the belly button, back pain, or nausea \u2014 often signs of impending rupture.\n\nIf an AAA is found, doctors sometimes use a stent to repair the aorta, but it doesn't always work since the aneurysms are often in places where a stent can\u2019t fit. And even if the stent does fit, patients often undergo a long, painful recovery.\n\nRelated: Heart Attack Risk With Painkillers Starts Within a Week: Study Says\n\nA personalized approach pioneered by vascular surgeon and lead researcher, Dr. Gustavo Oderich, at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota creates customized stents that are specifically designed for each patient. By using 3-D printing technology, Oderich's team can create an individualized model of the patient's aorta. Using a minimally invasive endoscopic vascular surgical technique, patient recovery times are quicker.\n\n\u201cEach anatomy of the patient is different and that's the problem, that\u2019s why we need stents that are actually specific for the patient,\u201d says Oderich. \u201cThe 3-D prints are used to rehearse the operation. We can anticipate challenges by practicing the procedure beforehand.\u201d\n\nSo far doctors at Mayo Clinic have done this personalized procedure on more than 450 patients. They are now training doctors nationally.\n\n\"The use of 3-D printing to personalize aortic repair is fascinating,\" said Dr. Ramesh Gowda, director of interventional cardiology at Mount Sinai Beth Israel. \u201cEvery patient differs in their aortic anatomical geometry so it can be hard to precisely ascertain the perfect sized graft, despite advances in CT imaging techniques, but newer patient-specific 3-D printed models may circumvent these challenges.\"\n\nThe cardiology community now prefers the endovascular approach.\n\n\"There is a fair amount of clinical research to support this,\" said Gowda. \"The data shows that similar clinical outcomes are had when you look at the traditional open approach versus the endovascular approach but the endovascular approach provides the added benefit of shorter hospital stays and a faster recovery.\"\n\n\u201cI\u2019m unsure where the technology will go but it is a very fascinating discovery.\u201d\n\nAfter her surgery, Berg is now back to back to enjoying her life. \u201cI feel absolutely terrific,\u201d says Berg. \u201cAn aneurysm in no way means that you're going to die.

They could have just asked people if they liked eating eggs for breakfast.\n\nInstead, they recruited 20 volunteers who were overweight or obese and assigned them to a week of either egg breakfasts or ready-to-eat cereal breakfasts.

Both types of breakfasts had the same number of calories, but the egg breakfasts contained \u201chigher protein quality,\u201d according to an abstract for the study, posted online here.\n\nThe folks who carried out this egg industry-funded research were from the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, La. This place conducts some serious research on diet and weight. So to assess whether people who ate egg breakfasts were better off than their counterparts who ate cereal, they took blood samples and measured the concentration of two key hunger hormones: acylated ghrelin (which stimulates hunger) and PYY3-36 (which is how the intestines let the brain know that you\u2019re full).

This week an unprecedented travel advisory was given for southern Florida after more than a dozen people were diagnosed with Zika after being bitten by \"homegrown\" mosquitoes.\n\nZika virus is most dangerous to pregnant women, because it can cause severe birth defects in babies if they are infected in the womb.\n\nRelated: Could We Nave New Zika Vaccine Soon?\n\nRight now, just one of those three vaccines will be progressing to clinical trials. That vaccine \u2014 dubbed ZPIV for purified inactivated Zika virus \u2014 uses a more traditional vaccine approach and depends on dead virus particles.\n\nTo develop the vaccine, researchers kill the virus with chemicals, leaving behind harmless proteins that the body can learn to recognize as foreign invaders. Using those proteins as targets, the immune system can then produce antibodies to latch onto live virus particles and destroy them. This kind of vaccine is much safer than ones that depend on live virus particles to foster immunity.\n\nRelated: Company Gets OK to Test New Zika Vaccine\n\nThe researchers gave 16 monkeys an initial dose of ZPIV and then a booster four weeks later. Then the monkeys were exposed to active forms of the virus. In tests afterwards, the monkeys showed antibodies against Zika and no detectable virus in their blood or urine, meaning that the protection from the vaccine was complete. Monkeys that got a sham vaccine developed no antibodies.\n\nThe results were \u201cstriking,\u201d said study coauthor Dr. Dan Barouch, a professor of medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School. \u201cThe findings published today substantially increase our optimism for the potential for the development of a Zika vaccine for humans.\u201d\n\nBeyond that, \u201cthis is a promising [vaccine] candidate that can be easily produced in large quantities,\u201d said coauthor, Col. Nelson Michael, an Army doctor who specializes in flaviviruses, such as Zika and dengue.\n\nTo continue the development of the vaccine, the researchers will be partnering up with the largest pharmaceutical company solely devoted to vaccines, Sanofi Pasteur.\n\nThe researchers hope to test the vaccine in people by October, Barouch said.\n\nRelated: New Study Shows Just How Tricky the Zika Virus Is\n\nThe two other experimental vaccines described in the new report also sparked an immune response in monkeys. Both of these vaccines depend on new technology in which scientists learn the exact DNA of proteins on the surface of the virus and then create copies to be put in a vaccine. One vaccine had just the man-made proteins in it, the other wrapped a common cold virus around the proteins. The protein/cold virus vaccine was especially effective, sparking a significant immune response after just one dose.\n\nAnother experimental vaccine, developed by researchers at the National Institutes of Health, is a bit further along.\n\nTrials of that vaccine in people, which is also based on man-made copies of virus proteins, began on August 2, when the first study volunteer was given a vaccination through a needle free injector, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nResults are expected by December and if they are promising, a bigger phase II trial will be launched in Zika endemic countries\n\nThat puts the project ahead of schedule, since the original launch of the phase I trials was expected to start in September, Fauci said.\n\nStill, with many years of experience in vaccine development behind him, Fauci said, \u201cyou\u2019re never overconfident of the clinical results.\"\n\n\"But we are optimistic that this new DNA Zika is a viable platform,\" Fauci said. \"So we\u2019re cautiously optimistic.\u201d\n\nAnd if problems turn up, there are the three potential vaccine described in the new study.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always good to have multiple different vaccine candidates in both clinical and pre-clinical testing,\u201d Barouch said. \u201cThat increases the chance that we will have at least one, if not more than one, that works in the end.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The news story notes that the killed-virus vaccine is safer than another line of vaccines under development,\u00a0but it does not address the presence or absence of any side effects or potential harms/shortcomings of the new experimental vaccine if and when this vaccine is tested in humans.

Is this stuff working?\" said Stevens, 48, of La Jolla, Calif. \"Your whole life is in sort of a limbo.\"\n\nDoctors typically must wait weeks or months to see if a treatment is shrinking tumors or at least halting their growth. But researchers are exploring a new use for medical imaging that could shorten the stay in purgatory, possibly revealing within a few days whether chemo is working.\n\nThat speed could save both lives and money. It would allow doctors to switch more quickly from an ineffective drug to a different one, and save health care dollars by waving doctors off expensive but futile treatments.\n\nThe same approach may also prove useful for monitoring radiation therapy.\n\nThis experimental imaging relies on a familiar hospital workhorse: PET scans, typically used for things like detecting cancer or revealing the effects of a heart attack. Unlike CT scans or MRIs, PET scans can show a tumor's internal activity, not just its size.\n\nWhen used to assess the effects of cancer treatment, it can reveal inside information about what the therapy is doing to a tumor even when there's no outward sign.\n\nTo do a PET scan, doctors inject a patient with a radioactive substance that shows up on the scan in places where certain processes are happening \u2013 like hungry cancer cells gobbling up a lot of blood sugar. Think of it as looking around your neighborhood late at night for light in bedroom windows to see who is still awake.\n\nMany cancer patients get PET scans now to assess their disease before treatment, or to spot recurrences later on. But except for lymphoma, PET scans aren't routinely used to get a quicker answer on how cancers are responding to therapy.\n\nThe new research tests both standard PET scans and a newer approach that involves injecting a different tracer substance.\n\nThe standard scan, which looks for blood sugar usage, has gotten good results in tests with a variety of tumors including breast, prostate, colorectal and esophageal cancers, said Dr. Steven Larson of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.\n\n\"I think it's going to be extremely valuable for most tumors where there are effective treatments,\" he said. Some experiments have revealed chemo's effects within 10 days to two weeks.\n\nAs a practical matter, the goal of researchers is to convince federal regulators to cover the procedure under Medicare and Medicaid, which would open the door to routine use. That might take two or three years, he said.\n\nFarther out on the research horizon is a PET scan that uses injections of a different radioactive material and has revealed chemotherapy's impact even faster. Larson figures it will be especially useful for assessing newer drugs that aim to stop a patient's cancer from growing rather than killing the tumor.\n\nThis scan is called FLT PET, after radioactive fluorothymidine. These scans show whether cancer cells are dividing. Uncontrolled division is a hallmark of active cancer, and stopping that division should be an early effect of successful chemotherapy.\n\n\"Our hope ... is you might be able to give a single dose of a chemotherapy agent and within a day or two figure out whether the tumor is going to respond,\" says Dr. Michael Graham of the University of Iowa.\n\nIf the tumor doesn't respond, doctors would \"go on to Plan B,\" he said. \"This is really ... giving us the ability to tailor the therapy to the disease.\"\n\nResearch into FLT PET is still in the early stages. Graham said there are maybe a dozen published human studies so far, most involving too few patients to draw a firm conclusion.\n\nOne report that impressed him involved 28 patients in Korea who were treated for advanced lung cancer \u2013 just like Stevens, who had to wait six weeks to learn whether it was working. The researchers reported that just one week after treatment began, they could tell with 93 percent certainty which patients would eventually respond to the drug and which would not.\n\nIn a much smaller study at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, seven patients with acute myeloid leukemia were scanned at various times during a week of aggressive chemotherapy. Normally, doctors wait a month after chemo is stopped to see if it worked. But the FLT PET scans offered an answer as soon as a day after treatment started.\n\n\"It's always hard to get too excited about a study that just involves seven people,\" said Dr. Mark Juckett, one of the authors. But \"in these few patients, it looked like we could predict those who were going to respond well to chemotherapy and those who weren't.\"\n\nOther preliminary studies suggest the new PET technology might be useful in gauging treatment for breast and brain cancers as well as lymphoma.\n\nGraham figures there's a good chance FLT PET scans will become routine for assessing therapy in the next 10 years.\n\n\"It's a terrible waste of money to spend thousands and thousands of dollars on these patients when it doesn't do any good,\" he said.\n\nGraham, president-elect of the Society of Nuclear Medicine, has been involved in discussions between the society and drug companies about incorporating FLT PET in their studies of experimental cancer drugs.\n\nThe hope is that, over time, FLT PET would prove reliable for giving a faster answer on whether an experimental treatment is working. That would save companies a lot of money, because they could spot ineffective drugs more quickly and not waste further research on them.

But it said there was not enough evidence to recommend for or against newer types of testing \u2014 including HPV tests and the \u201cliquid-based\u201d Pap tests that are now more often used than the old-fashioned version.\n\nDuring Pap tests, cells are swabbed or scraped from the cervix for examination under a microscope to find cancer or possible pre-cancerous changes. In the so-called liquid-based version, the cells are placed in special preservative liquid designed to make the specimen easier to \u201cread\u201d; those same cells can also be used for HPV testing (unlike the cells collected with conventional Pap tests).\n\nExactly what impact the new research review will have on the USPSTF recommendations is anyone's guess. A draft of the guidelines will not be published until Wednesday, when it will be available for public comment on the task force website (here: 1.usa.gov/4xXexl).\n\nA lot of research has been done since the 2003 recommendations, said Dr. Evelyn P. Whitlock, a senior investigator with Kaiser Permanente Northwest in Portland, Oregon, who led the review.\n\nBut there are still questions about the effects of HPV screening, and \u201cmore complete evidence\u201d is needed before it becomes widely used, Whitlock and her colleagues write.\n\nHPV is a common virus that causes warts, including genital warts. Usually, the immune system clears the infection, but persistent infection with certain strains of HPV leads to cervical cancer in some women.\n\nSo in recent years, tests for those \u201chigh-risk\u201d HPV strains have been developed to help in screening for the disease. A few HPV tests are approved for use, along with Pap tests, for screening women age 30 or older. (The tests are not approved for younger women because they give doctors little information; younger women commonly have HPV infections that go away on their own.)\n\nIt has not been clear exactly how HPV testing, or liquid-based Pap tests, measure up against standard Pap tests.\n\nIn their review, Whitlock\u2019s team examined four clinical trials including more than 140,000 women that compared older Pap tests with the liquid-based version.\n\nThey found that both tests had nearly the same \u201csensitivity\u201d \u2014 which refers to their ability to detect cancer or pre-cancer. The tests also had the same \u201cspecificity,\u201d which can be used to measure how often a screening test produces false-positive results.\n\nAcross studies, the false-positive rate ranged between about six percent and 16 percent for both conventional and liquid-based Pap tests.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s reassuring to know that they perform equivalently,\u201d Whitlock told Reuters Health.\n\nIn an interview, she noted that the decision of whether to do a conventional or liquid-based Pap test is not the patient\u2019s. It may not even be the doctor\u2019s \u2014 but may instead depend on whatever health system he or she is part of.\n\nSeveral other clinical trials in the review looked at HPV testing. In general, Whitlock\u2019s team found, HPV tests were more sensitive than conventional Pap tests, but they were less specific, meaning they had a higher false-positive rate.\n\nIn a 2003 trial of more than 3,000 women, for example, HPV testing caught 96 percent of potentially pre-cancerous growths, versus 65 percent with Pap tests. But the false-positive rate was 15 percent, compared with two percent with Pap testing.\n\nThe problem with that higher false-positive rate is that it could lead to needless biopsies and other tests, or treatment to remove abnormal-looking tissue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tricky thing to get your mind around,\u201d Whitlock said. \u201cIt may seem that if a test is more sensitive, it must be better. But it\u2019s more subtle than that. You\u2019re trying to make a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity.\u201d\n\nSince cervical cancer screening is repeated over time, what\u2019s needed is evidence of the longer-term effects of different tests, according to Whitlock. How often, for example, does HPV testing lead to biopsies, versus Pap testing?\n\nAnd no one knows yet whether HPV testing actually catches cervical cancer at an earlier stage, or reduces deaths from the disease, compared with Pap tests.\n\nClinical trials are ongoing, Whitlock said. \u201cThe state of the science will be changing relatively quickly, so we\u2019ll have to keep looking at this.\u201d\n\nRight now, the American Cancer Society (ACS) and other medical groups recommend that women start Pap tests at age 21 or three years after they become sexually active, whichever comes first. Those should be done every one to two years until age 30; after age 30, women who\u2019ve had three normal Pap tests in a row can be screened less often \u2014 every two to three years.\n\nPap plus HPV testing, done every three years, is considered a \u201creasonable option\u201d for women age 30 and up, according to the ACS.\n\nNationally, the cervical cancer death rate dropped by 70 percent between 1955 and 1992, and routine Pap testing is credited for most of that decline.\n\nBut many women still do not get regular Pap screening, Whitlock pointed out. It\u2019s thought that more than half of cervical cancer cases in the U.S. occur in women who\u2019ve never been screened, or haven\u2019t been in the past five years.\n\nIf more women received the screening that already exists, \u201cthat would be a huge step forward,\u201d Whitlock said.\n\nAn estimated 12,700 U.S. women will be diagnosed with cervical cancer this year, and nearly 4,300 will die from the disease, according to the ACS.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story explained the impact that false-positive tests might have if the HPV testing became routine.

The combination did lower cholesterol levels in the 12-week trial and, most importantly, did not cause the feared side effects on the heart and other organs that have plagued similar thyroid-based treatments.\n\n\"There was no doubt that eprotirome would lower LDL cholesterol. Thyroid hormone is nature's own statin,\" said Dr. Paul W. Ladenson, a professor of endocrinology and metabolism at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and lead author of a report on the trial, published in the March 11 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. \"But this is a demonstration of lipid-lowering effect without thyroid toxicity.\"\n\nDr. Bo Angelin, a professor of clinical metabolic research at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, where the drug was developed, said that the trial demonstrated that careful targeting of the drug's effect within the body could obtain the benefits of thyroid hormone on blood cholesterol levels, without causing damaging side effects. The trial was funded in part by Karo Bio, a small commercial spinoff of the institute.\n\n\"We knew that thyroid hormone could lower lipid [cholesterol] levels but would have side effects on the circulation and bones and cause diarrhea,\" Angelin said. \"Even if the lipid levels were OK, it would be overall negative for patients.\"\n\nHowever, he added, \"if we can get the thyroid effect in the liver [where cholesterol is metabolized] but not in other organs, we would be OK.\"\n\nFrequent monitoring showed no ill effects on the hearts and bones of those taking the drug, the report said.\n\nAnd though statins are widely used and most often successful, an alternative to them would be welcome, Ladenson said. Statins are not effective in up to a quarter of potential users because of unacceptable muscle pain or simple failure to lower cholesterol levels, he said.\n\n\"The first importance of the trial is that it shows hepatic [liver] targeting of hormonal action,\" Ladenson said. \"The second exciting part is its impact on lipids other than LDL cholesterol.\"\n\nThough statins lower LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol, they have no effect on other blood fats, such as lipoprotein A, which is believed to be equally damaging, Ladenson said. He said that significant reductions of blood levels of those fats were seen in the trial.\n\nLarger and longer studies are needed to determine whether eprotirome will have the hoped-for effect on blood fat levels without side effects and will ultimately reduce the risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular diseases, both Ladenson and Angelin said, adding that such trials now are in the planning stages.\n\nAt best, results would not be available for \"at least two to three years,\" Angelin said.\n\nIf eprotirome does pass all the anticipated tests successfully, its use at first probably would be in combination with a statin, Angelin said. Use as a single drug treatment for elevated cholesterol levels could follow, first in selected patients, then more widely, he said.\n\nIt's best to move cautiously, agreed Dr. Robert M.

But it is approved for another eye disease, age-related macular degeneration.\n\nSo doctors can \u2014 and some already do \u2014 use the drug off-label for the diabetic condition. With this successful Phase 3 trial, insurers will now be more likely to pay for such off-label use.\n\nSome doctors criticized the organizers of the trial for testing Lucentis rather than another Genentech drug, Avastin, which works in the same way as Lucentis.\n\nAlthough it is a cancer drug, Avastin is often used off-label for eye diseases because it is far cheaper than Lucentis, costing only $20 to $100 a dose, compared with $2,000 for Lucentis.\n\nAvastin is undercutting sales of Lucentis, which totaled $1.1 billion in the United States last year.\n\nOrganizers of the trial conceded that a major reason Lucentis was chosen was that Genentech, which is now owned by Roche, agreed to provide the drug free of charge and to contribute $9 million in additional financing \u2014 but only if Lucentis were used.\n\n\u201cObviously you can\u2019t underplay $9 million,\u201d said Dr. Ferris of the eye institute, which is part of the part of the National Institutes of Health.

Rosenfeld, a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Miami, said the decision was \u201cclearly a case of pay to play\u201d since Genentech\u2019s money dictated the choice of drugs.\n\nRetinopathy results from damage to the blood vessels in the eye. In macular edema, fluid from those damaged vessels leaks into the macula, the part of the retina that is responsible for the straight-ahead vision important for driving, recognizing faces and reading.\n\nLucentis, also known as ranibizumab, works by drying up leaky blood vessels and preventing the growth of new ones.\n\nJohn Bevan, who has diabetic macular edema, said that every two months or so he used to have an incident in which blood leaked into his eye, blurring his vision.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a paintball hits a plate-glass window \u2014 there\u2019s a big splat and it drips downward and takes three days to a week to dissipate,\u201d said Mr. Bevan, the school superintendent in north central Indiana. He said treatment with Lucentis in the clinical trial virtually eliminated those incidents.\n\nThe trial involved 691 patients, some of whom had both eyes treated, resulting in 854 total eyes. There were four treatment groups: One group got Lucentis injections into the eye as often as every four weeks, plus laser therapy. Another got Lucentis, with laser therapy used only after six months and only if needed. The third group got laser therapy plus injections into the eye of triamcinolone, a steroid sold by Allergan under the name Trivaris. The fourth group got laser therapy plus a sham injection.\n\nAfter the first year, only 3 to 4 percent of the eyes treated with Lucentis suffered a visual loss of two or more lines compared to 13 percent that got only laser therapy.\n\nResearchers said the results seem to be holding up for the second year of the three-year trial.\n\nAbout 1 percent of those getting Lucentis injections suffered an inflammation of the eye from an infection.\n\nThe steroid treatment did not improve eyesight more than laser therapy alone and caused side effects.\n\nResults of the trial were published online on Tuesday by the journal Ophthalmology.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "\u00a0While the story did include the common side effect of the drug in the study, there were other potentially important complications that were not mentioned.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The breast cancer trial, the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene, or STAR, has been a focus of intense debate. While both drugs reduced cases of breast cancer by about half from what would have been expected for the women in the study, raloxifene caused fewer cases of blood clots, cataracts and uterine cancers, making it initially appear the winner.\n\nBut raloxifene's edge in blood-clot and uterine-cancer avoidance was not statistically significant, and tamoxifen proved better at reducing the rate of noninvasive breast cancer. So, in response to the cancer institute's announcement two months ago, some experts quickly declared that raloxifene was not clearly superior, leaving women in a quandary.\n\nTamoxifen, a generic drug, is already approved for reducing the risk of breast cancer. Raloxifene, sold by Eli Lilly & Company under the name Evista, is now approved only to prevent bone-thinning.\n\nThe new information presented here and published in the medical journal included a detailed analysis of the side effects of the drugs and the results of a survey of about 10 percent of the 19,747 women in the trial concerning their physical and mental well-being.\n\nThere was no overall difference between the drugs in the women's self-rated physical health, mental health or depression. But hot flashes, vaginal bleeding, bladder control problems and leg cramps were more common in the women who took tamoxifen, while pain during sexual intercourse and joint pain were more common in the raloxifene group.\n\nThe new data are not likely to settle the debate about which drug is better. \"Although media coverage of the early release of data from the STAR trial suggests a clear 'winner' in raloxifene, the data from clinical endpoints and patient-reported symptoms suggest a less clear conclusion,\" Dr. William J.

Ganz of the University of California, Los Angeles, who presented the quality-of-life data here, said decisions should be made based on each woman's circumstances. If a woman is worried about uterine cancer, she might use raloxifene, Dr. Ganz said. If an active sex life is important to her, a woman might prefer tamoxifen.\n\nBut Dr. Ganz said that side effects of both drugs were generally mild and that it was important that women at high risk of breast cancer take one of them.\n\nRelatively few women at high risk of breast cancer take tamoxifen, and some patient advocates question whether they should, saying many women are exposed to side effects for each case of cancer prevented.\n\nThe editorial in the journal said the new data \"still may not be enough to convince primary care physicians to be more aggressive than they have been to date in breast cancer chemoprevention.\"\n\nAs for the data on vaginal and vulvar cancer prevention, they came from combining data from three trials used to test the ability of the vaccine, Gardasil, made by Merck & Company, to prevent cervical cancer.

But here's something the medical world is just realizing: that the gastric bypass operation has other even more dramatic effects. It can force type 2 diabetes into almost instant remission and it appears to reduce the risk of cancer.\n\nSurgeons have been performing bariatric, or weight loss operations since the 1950s, but they're much safer than they used to be. They're typically done laparoscopically now, where doctors use tiny surgical tools and video cameras instead of making big, deep incisions.\n\nDespite the increase in obesity, only a small number of people have had the gastric bypass operation.\n\nmet some people who were once morbidly obese.\n\nThere was Tony Sideman, who underwent surgery in April 2007 and has lost 140 pounds; there was Janet Rovak, who lost 90 pounds in the eight months since her surgery; and there was Travis Goodbou, who lost 260 pounds in the seven months since he underwent the operation.\n\nDr. Neil Hutcher from Richmond, Va. has performed more than 3,000 bypass surgeries. Asked how many people gain the weight back, Dr. Hutcher tells Stahl, \"You know I think when you're dealing with an incurable disease that kills many people, if you have an 85 to 90 percent success rate, that's pretty darn good.\"\n\n\"Is that what you have?\" Stahl asks.\n\nThere's no diet, no exercise regimen, and no pill with a success rate like that. These patients lose a ton of weight and keep it off.\n\nHere's how Hutcher does the surgery: first, he sections off a small pouch of the upper part of the stomach, which is then attached to a lower part of the small intestine, bypassing most of the stomach, so that there's not a lot of room for food.\n\nIt used to be that roughly one in 100 people died from this operation. Hutcher says it's now about one in 1,000, which makes it less deadly than most major surgeries.\n\n\"It's less than gall bladder surgery. It's about one-tenth of cardiac surgery,\" he explains.\n\nIt's safer because of new surgical techniques which have also made it more effective. For instance, they can make the stomach pouch smaller than they used to.\n\n\"Even if I wanted to eat a whole cheesecake, my stomach is very tiny. It holds four ounces max, stretched to the max. And that's not even one piece of cheesecake,\" a female patient explained.\n\nA big reason the operation works is because it seems to suppress appetite. \"If you listen to your patients, they come back and they say, 'Doctor, you put the fire out,'\" Hutcher says.\n\n\"When you see a sign for fast food or\u2026she's already shaking her head at me,\" Stahl asked a patient.\n\n\"Don't want it,\" the female patient replied. \"I used to crave sweets all the time. I couldn't go past the gift shop at work without getting a candy bar. Now I go past it and I never give it a thought.\"\n\nPaul Delios of Saugus, Mass. has lost 90 pounds. He owns a doughnut shop with his siblings, but he's able to resist the cravings. \"Before I'd have cravings for everything. Now I really don't,\" he told Stahl.\n\nFor most patients the cravings really do disappear. One theory is that's because the operation suppresses the levels of a stomach hormone called \"grelin\" that activates the sensation of hunger.\n\nYet most people who have this operation do not get skinny. Dr. David Cummings, an expert on appetite at the University of Washington, says as a rule these patients end up just one third lighter.\n\n\"Most people with severe obesity who undergo gastric bypass do not become fully normal, in terms of body weight. They go from severely obese to mildly obese, or from obese to overweight. But nevertheless it's an enormous change,\" Dr. Cummings explains.\n\nAnd not just in terms of weight loss.

Another trial in 2013, however, suggested that removing clots was not beneficial, he added.\n\nIn this latest trial, researchers found that routinely removing clots was not beneficial, Jolly said.\n\nJolly isn't sure why removing clots causes additional problems. It is possible that parts of the clot break off and travel elsewhere in the heart or brain, he said.\n\n\"This is an unexpected finding, and we want to confirm this in other studies,\" Jolly said.\n\nJolly said there are mechanical methods of removing clots, which were not tested in this study. Whether these methods would have produced better results isn't clear. \"The jury is out on that. It needs to be tested in large trials,\" he said.\n\nHowever, preliminary results from small trials of mechanical clot removal have not been promising, Jolly noted.\n\nJolly said the lesson from his team's trial is that clot removal should be used only as a rescue treatment when an angioplasty fails to clear an artery.\n\n\"As a routine therapy, clot removal is not beneficial and could have some significant downsides,\" he said.\n\nThe results of the study were published online March 16 in the New England Journal of Medicine to coincide with a planned presentation of the findings at the American College of Cardiology's annual meeting in San Diego.\n\nFor the study, Jolly and colleagues randomly assigned 10,732 patients undergoing an angioplasty after a heart attack to have clots manually removed or to not have them removed.\n\nAmong all the patients, 6.9 percent who had clots removed, and 7 percent of those who didn't, died, had another heart attack or developed heart failure in the 180 days after the procedure.\n\nIn the 30 days after the procedure, 0.7 percent of the patients who had clots removed suffered a stroke, as did 0.3 percent of those who only had angioplasty, Jolly's team found.\n\nDr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said, \"This is a very important and eagerly awaited clinical trial.\"\n\nA number of studies have suggested a benefit from manually removing clots during an angioplasty, but this trial found no clinical benefits for doing so, he said.\n\n\"These findings will likely have important implications for clinical practice,\" Fonarow said.\n\nVisit the U.S. National Library of Medicine for more on angioplasty.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story clearly states that there is no apparent benefit for clot removal and that there is some increased occurrence of strokes with the procedure.

Not even at the beach in July.\n\nToenail fungus causes nails to become thick, yellow and brittle in a way that looks pretty ugly and can be painful. Sufferers can spend years and hundreds of dollars trying to clear the infection with drugs, topical treatments and home remedies, sometimes to no avail. It tends to be a cosmetic issue for the younger set and a pain issue for older folks.\n\n\u201cThe problem is huge. It is bigger than you can imagine,\u201d says Washington podiatrist Stephen J. Kominsky. \u201cI would say 70 percent of the patients who come into my office have fungal infections on their toenails.\u201d\n\nThere may be hope. Podiatrists have begun using a laser treatment that combats the infection \u2014 or wastes their patients\u2019 money because it doesn\u2019t work, depending on whom you ask.\n\nThe treatment, in which the podiatrist aims a laser beam at the patient\u2019s toenails to kill the organisms that cause the fungus, costs about $1,000 and is not covered by insurance because it is considered an aesthetic procedure. The nails aren\u2019t immediately clear after the treatment, which takes up to an hour; the patient must wait for the fungus-free nails to grow out.\n\nLast year, the Food and Drug Administration cleared the first laser, PinPointe, for \u201ctemporary increase of clear nail\u201d in patients with onychomycosis, the medical term for a fungal infection of the nail. The FDA cleared a second one, GenesisPlus, in April. Practitioners have been using other lasers on toenail fungus since about 2009.\n\nKominsky has treated 400 to 500 patients with the PinPointe laser. Compared with oral medication, he says, \u201cthe odds of success are better with the laser; plus, there\u2019s no side effects.\u201d\n\nThe most common oral treatment, Lamisil, works for about two out of three patients, according to Lamisil\u2019s FDA-approved prescribing information, but it has been associated with rare cases of serious liver problems. Other potential side effects include diarrhea, headache, rashes and changes in taste. According to Lamisil\u2019s manufacturer, Novartis, the relapse rate is 15 percent one year after completing treatment.\n\nIn one small study about laser treatment for toenail fungus, which appeared last year in the Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association, \u201c26 eligible toes (ten mild, seven moderate, and nine severe)\u201d were treated with a laser produced by Nomir Medical Technologies, which is still seeking FDA approval. After six months, 85 percent of the toenails had improved.\n\n\u201cI never use the term \u2018cured\u2019 with toenail fungus,\u201d Kominsky says. \u201cWith a cure, people think there\u2019s no chance for a recurrence. In this case, there is a chance.\u201d\n\nEven John Strisower, the founder of PinPointe USA, says patients should expect at least a minimal reinfection within five years after laser treatment.\n\nResearch done by PinPointe, which is based in Chico, Calif., identified more than 100 organisms, including fungi, yeast, mold and bacteria, that work together to cause toenail fungus.\n\nThere\u2019s no one route of infection, but sources include pedicures and locker room showers. Fungi love moist, dark environments such as wet shoes, Kominsky says, so people such as lifeguards, landscapers and fishermen are particularly susceptible. Shoes are the reason why toenail fungus is much more common than fingernail fungus, which can also occur.\n\nThe elderly are more likely to have toenail fungus than younger people because they have had more years to be exposed to the infection and their immune systems can\u2019t always fight it off, according to Washington podiatrist Lee Firestone. He estimates that about half of people over 70 have toenail fungus.\n\nLast year, Americans spent $354 million on prescription and over-the-counter treatments for toenail fungus, according to IMS Health, a health-care information company.\n\n\u201cI think the laser can improve the appearance of the nail, but it\u2019s only temporary and it needs to be used again and again to maintain that improvement,\u201d says Firestone, who doesn\u2019t use the lasers in his practice. \u201cI\u2019ve had patients come in who have had laser procedures and not seen long-term success.\u201d\n\nFirestone also says that over-the-counter antifungal nail creams and ointments rarely work because they can\u2019t penetrate the nail root. Home remedies such as tea tree oil, bleach and vinegar also don\u2019t work, he says.\n\nYet even a superficial improvement would be an improvement for many.\n\nRichard, a retiree in Fairfax who did not want his full name associated with toenail fungus, got a laser treatment on all 10 toes in April 2010, and he says his nails were fully cleared of the yellowed, thickened look after a year.

Meanwhile, their average blood sugar levels held steady \u2014 in contrast to the non-yoga-practicing \u201ccontrol\u201d group, whose blood sugar levels rose.\n\nThe findings, reported in the journal Diabetes Care, do not suggest that yoga should replace other forms of exercise for people with type 2 diabetes \u2014 a disease commonly associated with obesity.\n\nTo really lose weight and rein in blood sugar, more-vigorous exercise would work better, according to Shreelaxmi V.

Long-term oxidative stress is believed to contribute to a host of chronic diseases.\n\nIn this study, Hegde\u2019s team measured participants\u2019 blood levels of certain chemicals that reflect oxidative stress. They found that, on average, the yoga group\u2019s levels of the chemicals dipped by 20 percent.\n\nThe significance of that is not clear. Hegde said that if such a decline in oxidative stress were sustained over time, it might lower the chances of diabetes complications, which include heart and kidney disease, nerve damage and damage to the blood vessels of the eyes.\n\nFurther, long-term studies are needed to see whether that is the case, the researchers say.\n\nAccording to Hegde, yoga may curb oxidative stress because it stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system \u2014 the part of the nervous system that basically acts as a brake against the gas pedal of the sympathetic nervous system.\n\nThere are caveats. The yoga used in this study was a gentle form, Hegde said, and parts of the practice were adapted for people who had additional health problems; certain poses were avoided in people who had heart disease, for example.\n\nIn the real world, yoga classes vary widely. Some are vigorous work-outs involving complicated poses that would not be appropriate for older adults with chronic health conditions.\n\nOlder adults with diabetes can look for yoga classes designed specifically for older people and those with chronic medical conditions.

It diagnoses prostate cancer that's going to actually cause harm,\" said Dr. H. Ballentine Carter, urology chief at Johns Hopkins University, who led the research published Tuesday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nThe study is far from proof that making health decisions based on so-called PSA velocity can really save lives.\n\nBut Carter contends the findings suggest that men should consider getting a baseline PSA test around age 40, instead of the more usual 50, to use as a comparison for future changes.\n\nPSA tests are used to screen men for prostate cancer, but they're imprecise. Too much PSA, or prostate-specific antigen, in a man's blood can indicate that he has either a benign enlarged prostate or cancer. Only a biopsy can tell the difference.\n\nIt's not even clear when is the best time to do a biopsy. Some men have cancer despite a \"normal\" PSA count of 4 or below. Yet routinely biopsying men with low PSA would worsen another problem, overdiagnosis. Many specialists say too many men today are undergoing side effect-prone treatment for tumors too small and slow-growing to ever threaten their lives.\n\nTwo years ago, Boston researchers reported that men whose PSA levels jumped more than 2 points the year before diagnosis were more likely to relapse and die despite prostate surgery. But those were men whose PSA levels were already fairly high.\n\nHopkins' Carter wondered if doctors could catch such men far sooner, when the cancer might be more treatable.\n\nHe turned to a study of aging that has been collecting and freezing blood samples from participants since 1958. The Hopkins team tracked PSA changes in that blood from 980 men, 20 of whom eventually died of prostate cancer and 104 of whom survived it.\n\nHow fast a man's PSA was rising a decade before his cancer was diagnosed \u2014 even before it reached that biopsy-triggering level of 4 \u2014 predicted his survival 25 years later, regardless of his ultimate cancer treatment, Carter concluded.\n\nThose with a higher PSA velocity \u2014 the level rose more than a count of 0.35 a year \u2014 had a 54 percent survival rate, while those whose PSA rose more slowly had a 92 percent survival rate.\n\nWhat does that mean for men today? That it's a good idea to order a biopsy for a man with a low but fast-rising PSA, Carter said. And men diagnosed with prostate cancer whose PSA is rising slowly may be ideal candidates for monitoring instead of surgery or other treatment, he added.\n\nA study with just 20 deaths is far too small to prove the value of PSA velocity, cautioned Dr. Durado Brooks, a prostate specialist with the American Cancer Society.\n\nStill, growing numbers of doctors are using the method already to help decide when to order a biopsy, and \"I think the study does raise the question as to whether PSA velocity may at some point be a helpful factor in determining prognosis,\" he said.\n\nThe work is \"another step on the road to more sophisticated\" prostate cancer screening and treatment, Dr. Timothy Church of the University of Minnesota wrote in an editorial accompanying the work.\n\nSome 234,000 U.S. men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year, and just over 27,000 of them will die, the cancer society estimates.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not mention that screening itself is associated with harms, such as physical pain from subsequent biopsies, anxiety, and problems related to a false positive (a false alarm) screening result.\u00a0 While the story does mention that many experts believe too many men are undergoing side effect prone treatments for prostate cancers which would never harm them,\u00a0 those treatments or side effects are\u00a0 not mentioned.\u00a0 The treatments\u00a0commonly include surgery or radiation, both of which can cause problems with impotence/erections, bladder control, and bowel functioning.

She recalls looking one of the physicians in the eye, defiant. \u201cI\u2019m done with this shit,\u201d she remembers saying. \u201cI\u2019m done with you guys bullying us.\u201d\n\nThen, she took out a bag and dumped the contents on the table: nine months of cancer drugs prescribed to her son, Landon, who was 4 at the time. He had been diagnosed more than a year before with an aggressive form of leukemia and undergone months of grueling treatment. But his mother was now refusing to follow his doctors\u2019 orders. \u201cListen: Here\u2019s all this chemo you told CPS he cannot live without, and if I didn\u2019t give it to him, he would relapse and die.\u201d\n\nBut Landon, who underwent only one year of cancer treatment instead of the recommended four, was still alive\u2014thriving, in fact\u2014even though he\u2019d stopped taking that massive pile of drugs prescribed for him. That\u2019s why his mother had called this meeting. She implored the CPS director\u2014whom by then she knew by first name\u2014to restrain the oncologists who had threatened to take her child away and put him in foster care. Riddle believes the doctors wanted to prove she was a neglectful, abusive mother, but she knew she could convince the world that the hospital was wrong about her son\u2019s treatment. (Due to HIPAA patient privacy laws, Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado was unable to comment on Landon\u2019s case for this story.)\n\nLandon\u2019s cancer, diagnosed in September 2012, had put Riddle in a situation that\u2019s any parent\u2019s worst nightmare: She had to watch him undergo lifesaving treatment that appeared to be killing him. Riddle says she was left with no choice but to defy his doctors\u2019 orders.\n\nRELATED: What we know about how cancer starts could all be wrong\n\nIn January 2013, nearly four months after Landon\u2019s initial diagnosis, the two went from Utah to Colorado, where Riddle purchased an alternative treatment fraught with complicated politics and plenty of skepticism\u2014especially when it comes to saving the life of a preschooler with a potentially fatal disease. At the time, Colorado was one of only about a dozen states in the U.S. that had legalized medical cannabis. It also allowed sick children to access the drug under professional guidance. Landon became the youngest patient in the U.S. at that time to receive a medical marijuana card. Riddle\u2019s decision to treat her child with cannabis landed the family in the center of a contentious national debate, as well as on prime-time television with CNN\u2019s chief medical correspondent, Sanjay Gupta. In Utah, all cannabis is illegal, so when their story went public, she and Landon had to move permanently to Colorado, so he could continue to have access to the drug. Even now, at 7, he still needs to take cannabis to cope with the long-term effects of chemotherapy and radiation, she says.\n\nBy the time of that showdown with CPS and Landon\u2019s doctors in Denver, Riddle had stopped giving her son all of the drugs prescribed by the hospital: the chemo, opiates and benzos. The latter two\u2014which included OxyContin, morphine and Ativan\u2014were prescribed to help Landon cope with the side effects of cancer treatment. None of them helped, she says, or they made him feel worse. But when Landon started the cannabis oil, his health miraculously improved. She was willing to do whatever it took to keep him on cannabis.\n\nAs laws that permit medical cannabis have expanded nationwide (29 states in the country now permit some form of cannabis use for medical purposes), cancer patients increasingly use the drug to alleviate the harsh symptoms of chemotherapy, such as nausea, anxiety, loss of appetite and insomnia. But there\u2019s also an emerging body of research that suggests marijuana might be effective as a treatment for cancer on its own, or in conjunction with standard therapies.\n\nWhen Riddle made the decision to give her son cannabis, the information on its safety and efficacy was (and still is) limited to anecdotal accounts, a handful of case reports and lab studies published in obscure medical journals. Initially, her hope was that the drug would lessen the side effects. But Riddle soon heard that certain compounds in cannabis\u2014cannabinoids\u2014have been shown to induce cancer cell death. The theory seemed to be especially promising for leukemia, at least according to studies done on cancer cells in test tubes and on mice injected with human leukemia cells. But at that point there wasn\u2019t any evidence it would work for humans. There still isn\u2019t. While cannabis is legal in many U.S. states, the drug is still classified by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a Schedule 1 narcotic (along with heroin and cocaine), which make it very difficult for scientists to conduct clinical trials on people. However, that may change as other nations, such as Israel, take the lead and fund marijuana research.\n\nThe findings so far from published lab studies suggest cannabidiol (CBD), one of more than 100 cannabinoids present in the plant, targets certain pathways in leukemia. The evidence indicates that leukemia cells have a high number of cannabinoid receptors\u2014primarily the receptor CB2. The proteins on the cell membrane (receptors) recognize the chemical compound, CBD. The shape of the receptor mirrors the shape of the compound, enabling the CBD to land and attach to the cell. \u201cIt\u2019s like a key in the lock,\u201d says Dr. Bonni Goldstein, medical director of Canna-Centers in Los Angeles and the medical adviser to Weedmaps.com, a resource for people seeking specialists to oversee their medical cannabis treatment. \u201cWhen compounds such as cannabidiol bond to receptors, it causes the cell to die.\u201d\n\nFurther studies are needed to verify that CBD could potentially kill leukemia, says Robert McKallip, an associate professor of immunology at Mercer University School of Medicine, who conducted some of the earliest research on the anti-leukemia properties of compounds found in cannabis. McKallip suggests cannabis could be used along with other treatments for leukemia. \u201cCombined with other targeted therapies, which again, specifically target the leukemia, you give it a one-two punch and hopefully reduce side effects and improve efficacy of treatment,\u201d he says.\n\nRiddle isn\u2019t a doctor, but she theorizes that while the chemo initially cleared Landon\u2019s cancer, it\u2019s the cannabis that has kept his disease from coming back. Oncologists who treat pediatric patients often tell families that when the five-year mark passes, their child is in the clear. It\u2019s been nearly five years since Riddle sat in that conference room meeting; Landon is still cancer-free. Riddle says that once he hits the five-year mark this fall, he\u2019ll set a precedent for pediatric leukemia patients in the U.S., and maybe even worldwide.\n\nRiddle, a single mother, was willing to do whatever it would take to rid Landon of the cancer in his blood that had spread to his brain and formed a tumor in his chest the size of a large grapefruit. She desperately wanted to trust the doctors at the Huntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake City, where her son was diagnosed at age 2, and who admitted to her that they weren\u2019t sure they could save his life.\n\nShe knew the leukemia treatment protocols are backed by decades of research. But they are infamously rough for a child and drag on for years. First, there would be several months of aggressive inpatient chemo and other therapies for what\u2019s known as \u201cremission reduction.\u201d After that, even when blood work showed the disease had entered remission, Landon would need years of chemo and monitoring\u2014called \u201cconsolidation\u201d\u2014to make sure his body wasn\u2019t harboring leukemia cells.\n\nThis aggressive approach is one of the main reasons pediatric leukemia, depending on its more specific classification, has at least an 80 to 90 percent survival rate. The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society estimates that nearly 5,000 kids will be diagnosed in the U.S. with some form of leukemia in 2017. For most of the kids who go through the entire course of treatment, the illness turns out to be a mere blip on the screen of childhood. Riddle hoped the same would be true for her son. But Landon appeared to be among a small percentage of children with leukemia for whom the treatment was unbearable, excruciating. The chemo caused him to vomit up to 50 times a day, which made it difficult for him to speak because his esophagus was burned and closed up. The chemo had compromised his immune system so severely that he caught every bug in the hospital, just about every strain of stomach viruses, influenza and the common cold. He eventually developed numbness, tingling, pain and weakness (neuropathy) in his feet and ankles, and was no longer able to walk.\n\nWithin the first 90 days of treatment, Landon lost half his body weight. He stopped eating for more than a month. He needed blood and platelet transfusions. Doctors kept adding prescription after prescription to alleviate the side effects of treatment\u2014narcotics, anti-depressants, anti-anxiety drugs, prescriptions for pain. \u201cThe sad thing is they didn\u2019t seem to help Landon,\u201d she says. \u201cAt this point, they kept telling us we have to keep going. I said, \u2018He\u2019s dying. It\u2019s very apparent that he\u2019s dying.\u2019\u201d\n\nLandon began to refuse chemotherapy and turn into a \u201clittle psychopath,\u201d says Riddle. He kicked and screamed when nurses forced pills into his mouth, so eventually everything needed to be administered with an IV. \u201cThe chemo actually has healed a lot of kids, but it almost killed me,\u201d he says.\n\nMost children with leukemia go into remission within the first 30 days of treatment, which was why Landon\u2019s doctors insisted on several more years of chemotherapy, says Riddle. By the time Landon was nearing the end of his first stage of treatment, Riddle says her son was on the brink of death. The doctors told her to bring him home for a two-week break from chemo, adding that they would arrange to send a hospice nurse\u2014an ominous hint that Landon was about to die.\n\nA plea for help posted on Facebook by Riddle\u2019s mother, Wendy, led the family to a group of brothers in Denver, the Stanleys, who were cultivating cannabis for medicinal purposes and had made the news for a strain they called Charlotte\u2019s Web. Riddle and her mother had seen the story about Charlotte Figi, a 6-year-old girl with Dravet syndrome, a rare type of epilepsy that was unresponsive to standard treatment. She had up to 300 seizures per day. But the seizures stopped when she began taking CBD oil supplied by the brothers.\n\nThe Stanleys visited the Riddles in Utah to educate them about Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)\u2014the psychoactive chemical in the plant\u2014and CBD. She decided to start Landon on cannabis. But to do that, the family would need to leave Utah, where all cannabis is illegal. So Riddle and Landon moved in with the brothers for about a year, says Joel Stanley, the CEO of the company that is now known as CW Hemp. \u201cIt was just so sad to see someone that young and that small going through such harsh treatment,\u201d Stanley says of Landon. \u201cHe also had elements of what I know a lot of folks would call \u2018chemo brain.\u2019 He would get very frustrated and very angry, all normal because his little body was just being invaded by this intense medication and rounds of chemotherapy treatment.\u201d Throughout that year, Riddle and her son traveled back and forth from Colorado to Utah, so he could continue chemo, but this time with the aid of cannabis, to make treatment more bearable. That meant Riddle had the drug on hand, and Landon was under its influence while in Utah, which made mother and son both felons.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not address potential harms of long term treatment with cannabis oil.

Three of them found that zinc acetate in daily doses of more than 75 milligrams (mg) shortened colds' duration by 42 percent, on average.\n\nFive trials using zinc salts other than acetate in daily doses greater than 75 mg shortened colds by an average of 20 percent, while another five using less than 75 mg per day produced no effect.\n\n\"Much of the variation in the published study findings can be explained by the daily dose of zinc administered in the zinc lozenges,\" said Hemila, who funded the research himself. \"When focusing on those studies which have used large daily doses of zinc, there is strong evidence that zinc lozenges shorten the duration of colds.\"\n\nThe study is published in The Open Respiratory Medicine Journal.\n\nDespite the popularity of zinc supplements, controversy over their effectiveness has continued since a much-publicized 1984 study first suggested a cold-limiting effect. Allowing the lozenge to dissolve instead of swallowing it seemed to provide a therapeutic effect. Since then, more than a dozen studies have been carried out, but data on the trace mineral's effectiveness has been mixed.\n\nAll of the trials examined by Hemila compared zinc lozenges to placebos. While surprised to note how strong the correlation was between daily doses of zinc and its effect on colds' duration, he said he and his colleagues still don't know why it seems to work.\n\n\"In the evidence-based medicine framework, we are primarily interested in the question whether there is an effect, and how great, whereas the mechanism of the effect is a secondary issue,\" he said.\n\nNo prior studies showed zinc lozenge use -- even up to 150 mg per day -- might cause harm aside from bad taste or constipation, Hemila said, and the most recent trial on zinc acetate indicated no significant differences between zinc and placebo groups in adverse effects even though the daily zinc dose was 92 mg.\n\nDr. Lisa Winston, an epidemiologist at San Francisco General Hospital, praised the study as a \"pretty good synthesis of the data,\" although she noted that the trials Hemila reviewed involved small numbers of participants.\n\n\"It's an area of controversy and question . . . but I don't think the evidence is strong enough, nor do I think the author is suggesting, that we can base clinical practice on it,\" said Winston, also an associate professor in the University of California-San Francisco Department of Medicine. \"I would tell my patients we still don't have a cure [for the common cold], and we don't know if zinc works.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Library of Medicine has more about the common cold.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story suggests that, \u201cNo prior studies showed zinc lozenge use \u2014 even up to 150 mg per day \u2014 might cause harm aside from bad taste or constipation\u201d We give it a pass since it does note the major side effects seen.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Despite popular lore, agency won't allow labels to say drink is good for consumers' hearts\n\nWASHINGTON - There is no credible scientific evidence that drinking green tea reduces the risk of heart disease, federal regulators said last week in rejecting a petition that sought to allow tea labels to make that claim.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration said it reviewed 105 articles and other publications submitted as part of the petition but could find no evidence to support claims of the beverage's health benefits.\n\n\"There is no credible evidence to support qualified health claims for green tea or green tea extract and a reduction of a number of risk factors associated with (cardiovascular disease),\" the FDA said on its Web site last week.\n\nIto En Ltd., a Japanese company that bills itself as the world's largest green tea company, and its U.S. subsidiary, Ito En (North America) Inc., petitioned the FDA in June, seeking to make the claim that drinking at least five ounces of green tea a day may reduce the risk of heart disease.\n\nA message left for a spokesman for Ito En Inc. was not immediately returned last week.\n\nA message left for the AAC Consulting Group, a Rockville, Md., company that filed the petition, also was not immediately returned.\n\nGreen tea is brewed from Camellia sinensis, also known as Thea sinensis.

But until now, information on the prognostic value of grip strength was limited, and mainly obtained from select high-income countries.\n\nThe current study followed 139691 adults aged between 35 and 70 years living in 17 countries from The Prospective Urban-Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study for an average (median) of four years. Grip strength was assessed using a handgrip dynamometer.\n\nThe findings show that every 5kg decline in grip strength [2] was associated with a 16% increased risk of death from any cause; a 17% greater risk of cardiovascular death; a 17% higher risk of non-cardiovascular mortality; and more modest increases in the risk of having a heart attack (7%) or a stroke (9%).\n\nThese associations persisted even after taking into account differences in other factors that can affect mortality or heart disease such as age, education level, employment status, physical activity level, and tobacco and alcohol use.\n\nA low grip strength was linked with higher death rates in people who develop cardiovascular (eg, heart attack or stroke) and non-cardiovascular diseases (eg, cancer), suggesting that muscle strength can predict the risk of death in people who develop a major illness.\n\nAccording to lead author Dr Darryl Leong from the Population Health Research Institute, Hamilton Health Sciences and McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada, \"Grip strength could be an easy and inexpensive test to assess an individual's risk of death and cardiovascular disease.

Someday, they will not be able to walk. They will not be able to stand. Eventually, they will not be able to live. The brothers, ages 6 through 11, suffer from a debilitating and deadly genetic condition called Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).\n\nYet on September 28, Max, Rowan and Charlie Vertin got dressed up. In dark suits and blue shirts, with serious expressions on their round faces, they walked to stand next to their mother in a very beige room outside Washington, D.C. The people in that room, they believed, could change the course of their lives.\n\nFor years, the Vertin brothers have been participating in a clinical trial for a new medication called ataluren, intended to keep the progression of their disease at bay. By October 24, they\u2019ll know if they will be able to keep taking that drug. That is the deadline for the Food and Drug Administration to make a choice. The agency could approve the drug, allowing the brothers and others like them to continue to take it. Or it could reject the drug for the third time and throw them into an uncertain future.\n\nAn FDA committee has already voted that data about the drug\u2019s effectiveness was inconclusive. The agency\u2019s final decision almost always echos the decisions of its committees. So, if this were any other kind of drug at any other time in FDA history, the FDA\u2019s final answer would be a very predictable no.\n\nIf they do say no, the Vertins could lose access to the drug that has stabilized their condition. But there\u2019s still a chance the FDA could approve the drug. Input from people affected by DMD may have convinced the agency once before to approve a drug for the condition despite iffy data. That is what the Vertins\u2014and the company that produces the drug\u2014are hoping will happen again.\n\n\u201cIt started out so innocent,\u201d his mother, Betty Vertin, told Newsweek. Max was a big infant, born 10 lbs, 3 oz and nearly two feet long. \u201cWhen he was missing milestones, I just thought it was because it was a big baby.\u201d Even doctors assumed that he would eventually catch up. But when he started preschool, the difference between Max and other children became more obvious. \u201cWhen other kids were running and jumping and climbing, Max wasn\u2019t doing those things. He was just behind, physically.\u201d\n\nWhen Max was 4, in 2010, a genetic test confirmed that he had DMD. Betty had never heard of it. \u201cBefore we started living this life, I was clueless,\u201d she said.\n\nDMD is one of a class of similar genetic disorders. About 15 boys out of every 100,000 in the United States under 24 years old have DMD or a milder form, called Becker muscular dystrophy. (Most of the children affected are boys.) The illness affects the way their legs, heart, and lungs work.\n\nMax\u2019s diagnosis was devastating for Betty. \u201cI feel like I walked into the room with a healthy four-year-old boy and I walked out with a child that was dying,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the family\u2019s struggles with DMD were just beginning. At the time, Rowan was 2, and Betty suspected that he also had the disease; she\u2019d seen how her son struggled to stand up onto a stepstool in the bathroom to brush his teeth. She was also ten weeks pregnant with Charlie.\n\nGenetic tests eventually confirmed both Rowan and Charlie also had DMD. Betty\u2019s two daughters, Lexi, 16, and Mary, 2, as well as a fourth son, Chance, 10, do not.\n\n\u201cI felt like we had a year and a half of the same horrible diagnosis over and over and over again,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the hardest 18 months I\u2019ve ever had and I hope I ever had.\u201d\n\nDMD always results in muscle weakness due to a lack of a protein called dystrophin. Some of the newest treatments for the condition try to fix that. One drug, which the FDA approved in 2016, works for people whose illness springs from a mutation in the gene that codes for dystrophin.\n\nThe drug, called Exondys 51 or eteplirsen, allows the genetic machinery that produces the protein to skip over the mutated part to make something that will work better. About 13 percent of people with DMD have this particular mutation, according to the FDA.\n\nThe Vertin brothers are not among them; the drug shouldn\u2019t help them at all. So they tried ataluren. (The drug\u2019s brand name is Translarna.) The company that produces ataluren, PTC Therapeutics, says that its drug forces cells to make the proteins in spite of a different kind of mutation called a nonsense mutation. Instead of having an error in the protein, the protein is accidentally cut short. This is the kind of mutation that three of Betty Vertin\u2019s children have.\n\nThe Vertins have received the drug free through the clinical trial, and expenses for their trip from Nebraska to Washington, D.C. were paid by PTC Therapeutics.\n\nAtaluren works by ordering a cell to use a slightly different piece to build the protein\u2014as if someone spray-painted the word \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d on the molecular version of a stop sign. Exactly how it does that is still mysterious. A paper published by the company\u2019s scientists in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science said it probably affected the ribosome, a key part of how proteins are put together in a cell. (Researchers not affiliated with the company did not find the same kind of activity.)\n\nRegardless of what mutation causes the illness, most people with DMD die in their 20s. Betty was told to expect her oldest son, Max, to be in a wheelchair full-time by the time he was 9 or 12.\n\nMax is 11 now. His 12th birthday is in early November. He uses an electric mobility scooter for long distances, but he can still walk. He rides a bike without training wheels and without any modifications. He has a part in a school play and goes up and down stairs to get to the stage. He even plays a trumpet in his school\u2019s band. \u201cHe\u2019s got the lung capacity to blow that thing, very loudly,\u201d Betty said.\n\nFor that, Betty credits ataluren, which Max started three years ago.\n\n\u201cHis life is\u2014it\u2019s not like his peers, but he\u2019s getting a lot of the experiences that his peers are having,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s living a sort of a typical sixth-grade life and that diagnosis\u2014I didn\u2019t know what it would look like for him. I didn\u2019t expect it to look like this.\u201d\n\nBut not everyone considers ataluren to be a miracle drug\u2014with good reason. The clinical trial results haven't been great. Most of the company\u2019s studies tested how fast a child could go about 30 feet or walk up and down stairs, or how far they could walk in six minutes. They did see some slight positive results, many of which came from a study done with the specific kind of patient the company discovered benefited most in a previous trial.\n\nThe FDA needs good data to make their decision, because when the agency approves a drug is sends a signal to the world. An approval is the FDA saying, \u201cthis drug is safe and effective. You could use it for your child, too.\u201d\n\nPTC Therapeutics has tried to get FDA approval for the drug twice before. Both times the agency refused to even consider the application. This time, the application for approval was filed over the FDA\u2019s protest. (The drug has been conditionally approved in Europe.)\n\nPart of the reason that the drug has struggled is because of this requirement: if the drug is effective, the data should show it. But that hasn't happened consistently with ataluren. Many of the clinical trials failed to satisfy the statistical requirement to prove a drug works\u2014at least not for the main outcome the company was looking at. Other, secondary measurements did seem to have good statistics. Certain groups of children seemed to have better results than others, too.\n\nPTC Therapeutics founder and CEO Stuart Peltz says the statistics aren't a reason to reject the drug. Just because a drug doesn\u2019t measure up in that way, he says, \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean the drug is not effective.\u201d\n\nBut even if the FDA agrees to overlook some of the negative data about ataluren, insurers may not. That could be a million-dollar issue for the families with affected children.\n\n\u201cIf the evidence isn\u2019t good, then insurance companies won\u2019t pay for [drugs],\u201d said National Center for Health Research (NCHR) president Diana Zuckerman. Two recently approved drugs have run into this problem: Spinraza, a drug for spinal muscular atrophy, and Exondys 51. Both drugs cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Pharmaceutical companies traditionally will not discuss prices before drugs are approved; that said, ataluren costs about \u00a3220,000 in Britain. During clinical trials, participants like the Vertins normally do not pay for the treatment.\n\nThe NCHR also presented at the FDA meeting in September to discuss ataluren, urging the agency to not approve the drug without more research. The organization\u2019s statement also raised concerns about side effects associated with the drug, specifically about the chance that it raises blood pressure and cholesterol levels in children. The company says these shifts are small and \"not clinically significant.\"\n\nIn an e-mailed statement, FDA spokesperson Sandy Walsh confirmed that the FDA\u2019s decisions are all \u201cbased on an assessment of the available data and whether the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks.\u201d That data can include the experience of patients like Max, Rowan and Charlie.\n\nTo Betty, the benefits are clear, even if they aren\u2019t easily quantified. Rowan\u2019s gait seems better. Max still doesn\u2019t need to use a wheelchair all the time, bucking the prediction she heard when he was first diagnosed.\n\nHowever, financial analysts who track the biotech sector are not optimistic about ataluren\u2019s immediate prospects. Matthew Eckler, a senior biotechnology analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said that analysts and investors are betting the FDA will not approve the drug.\n\nThe FDA hasn\u2019t said no yet. The agency still has nearly two more weeks to make a decision. Until then, Betty and her sons are living with a lot of uncertainty. \u201cI\u2019m really scared that my boys will have to go off [ataluren],\u201d she said. Will they have access to the drug if it\u2019s rejected? Would their conditions deteriorate if they didn\u2019t? What other options do they have?\n\nBetty has no good answers. She is hoping she won\u2019t need to come up with them.\n\n\u201cDMD is a progressive disease, and my boys are stable,\u201d Vertin said. \u201cIf we can just have a few more years with our boys or buy some time until there is a cure out there, that\u2019s huge.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The text briefly mentions side effects associated with the drug, increases in blood pressure and cholesterol levels, an assertion contested by the drug\u2019s manufacturer, PTC Therapeutics.

Although it's not a comprehensive evaluation and could give some consumers a false sense of security, the test does provide a starting point while drawing attention to male infertility as a legitimate health concern.\n\n\"It may provide (an opportunity for) both physicians and couples to take a closer look at ways for men to step up to the plate and optimize their reproductive potential,\" said Dr. Robert Brannigan, urologist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. \"I think anything that highlights the fact that men can have issues, that men do play a role in infertility, is important.\"\n\nApproximately 15 percent of U.S. couples of reproductive age who are trying to conceive face infertility issues, said Brannigan, an expert in male fertility.\n\nMale infertility contributes to 50 percent of those cases, he said. Male infertility alone is the cause 30 percent of the time; a combination of male and female factors account for the other 20 percent.\n\nSpermCheck Fertility is designed to help couples determine more quickly whether male infertility might be a problem for them, said Ray Lopez, CEO of SpermCheck, based in Charlottesville, Va. Many men put off having a semen analysis because they don't want to provide a sample in a doctor's office or lab, he said.\n\n\"No one wants to go through the embarrassment of jumping in that room and looking at dirty magazines,\" Lopez said.\n\nGiving men the opportunity to take a test in the privacy of their home helps get the process moving, he said.\n\nMen tend to think they're perfectly healthy, especially when it comes to their sexuality, APA's Imler said. This test, which is noninvasive, could be wake-up call for some.\n\n\"If there is a problem with him, it's identified a little quicker,\" Imler said. \"We love the idea of avoiding that heartache of that month to month struggle of trying to conceive without success.\"\n\nSpermCheck Fertility is the only FDA-approved home sperm test currently on the market and available in retail stores, Lopez said. The test costs about $40; the average cost of a semen analysis in a doctor's office is about $100.\n\nAt-home sperm tests are a fairly new idea, Imler said, but SpermCheck Fertility is not the first one. Four years ago an FDA-approved home test called Fertell, which is no longer for sale, offered an evaluation of both male and female fertility.\n\nThere are also several at-home sperm analysis kits available online. They each include a microscope and cost at least $80.\n\nAlthough it's not the first ever at-home test, SpermCheck Fertility is the first one to use the lateral flow assay method, Lopez said. When the semen sample is applied to the test strip, the liquid works its way up the paper until it reaches the results window.\n\n\"It's very, very similar to a pregnancy test,\" Lopez said. \"The concept behind our test is to keep it simple, user friendly.\"\n\nFor Brittany Scott, a Cortland resident whose husband took the SpermCheck Fertility test, however, it seemed a little more complicated than a pregnancy test. Scott said she was surprised by the number of steps involved, although none were very difficult.\n\nScott, a \"mommy blogger\" who requested and received a free test to review, said she wanted her husband to take the test to see if a recent vasectomy had worked. The result showed that the father of four's sperm count was below the test's threshold.\n\n\"It was blatantly negative. I was really glad that the test was not ambiguous at all,\" she said. \"There was no line I could mistake.\"\n\nScott said she wished the test had been available when the couple was struggling to conceive their first child. After about 11 months of trying, she had pushed her husband to get a semen analysis from a doctor.\n\n\"If this test had been around back then, he would have definitely been more willing to do it\" than the semen analysis, she said.\n\nSpermCheck Fertility tests were created after a scientist at the University of Virginia discovered a specific protein found only in the head of sperm, Lopez said. By detecting that protein, the test indicates whether or not a semen sample contains 20 million sperm per milliliter.\n\nAbout 90 percent of fertile men have sperm counts above that concentration, according to the SpermCheck Fertility instructions.\n\nBut there is not a strict cutoff point between normal or abnormal, Brannigan said. Some men might be considered in the infertile range and have no problem impregnating a woman. And others have sperm counts that seem fine, but they have difficulty.\n\n\"If his sperm concentration is indeed greater than 20 million, that's very encouraging,\" Brannigan said. \"But it's by no means a definitive marker of proven fertility because there is a significant overlap between fertile and infertile men.\"\n\nAs stated in the SpermCheck Fertility instructions, sperm count is not the only factor that contributes to male fertility. The test is not intended to be a complete semen analysis or an overall indicator of a man's fertility, Lopez said.\n\nThe male reproductive system should not be oversimplified, Brannigan said. There are several characteristics of sperm alone \u2014 at least three that aren't addressed by SpermCheck \u2014 that affect male fertility. In addition, hormones and the delivery of the sperm play a part.\n\n\"There are a number of components that lead to a man having normal fertility potential,\" Brannigan said. \"It's a complicated picture.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story points out that the test might lull men into a false sense that they have no fertility problems. \u201cA positive result from the SpermCheck Fertility test could give men a false sense that everything is all right, APA\u2019s Imler said.\u00a0It might even cause some men to delay a necessary doctor\u2019s evaluation, Brannigan said.\u201d\nThe story waited a little too long to make this point, but we were glad to see it included.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "(Reuters Health) - Women who take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to ease menopause symptoms like hot flashes and night sweats may be no more likely to die prematurely than women who don\u2019t take hormones, a new study suggests.\n\nMany women have been reluctant to use hormones for menopause symptoms since 2002, when the federally funded Women\u2019s Health Initiative (WHI) study linked the treatments containing man-made versions of the female hormones estrogen and progestin to an increased risk of breast cancer, heart attacks and strokes.\n\nThe current study, however, looked at longer-term data from the WHI study and found no increased risk of death from all causes, or from cancer or cardiovascular issues in particular, associated with hormone use.\n\n\u201cWomen seeking treatment for distressing hot flashes, night sweats or other menopausal symptoms may find the mortality results reassuring,\u201d said lead study author Dr. JoAnn Manson of Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston.\n\nWomen go through menopause when they stop menstruating, typically between ages 45 and 55. As the ovaries curb production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone in the years leading up to menopause and afterward, women can experience symptoms ranging from irregular periods and vaginal dryness to mood swings and insomnia.\n\nFor the study, researchers looked at data on 27,347 women ages 50 to 79 who joined two WHI trials between 1993 and 1998 and were followed through 2014. One trial tested estrogen alone against a placebo, or dummy pill, while the other trial tested estrogen taken in combination with progestin.\n\nWomen were 63 years old on average when they joined the trials and had already gone through menopause. They took hormones or a placebo for five to seven years and were followed for a total of 18 years altogether.\n\nDeath rates were similar - at about 27 percent - among women who took hormones and women who didn\u2019t, researchers report in JAMA.\n\nYounger women in the study appeared to have better survival odds with HRT. Over the initial five to seven years when women were randomly assigned to take hormones or a placebo, death rates were about 30 percent lower among women aged 50 to 59 when they took HRT than when they didn\u2019t.\n\nFor women who started hormones in their 60s or 70s, however, there wasn\u2019t a meaningful difference in death rates according to whether they got the treatment or a placebo during the initial years of the study.\n\nAfter 18 years, including both the treatment period and a decade or more of follow-up, women\u2019s age when they joined the study no longer appeared to significantly influence death rates.\n\nOne limitation of the study is that the WHI didn\u2019t look at different dosages of hormone pills, and the findings may be different for other dosages or different types of therapy such as gels or creams or skin patches.\n\nStill, the current study should ease concerns raised by earlier results from the WHI trials that an increased risk of breast cancer or heart attacks might translate into higher long-term mortality rates, said Dr. Melissa McNeil, author of an accompanying editorial and a women\u2019s health researcher at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nTaking a combination of estrogen and progestin is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, but advances in screening and treatment since the WHI started now mean these tumors are unlikely to be fatal, McNeil said by email.\n\nWith additional years of follow-up, it also appears that the increased heart attack risk associated with HRT in the initial results from the WHI trials is limited to older women, McNeil added.\n\n\u201cHormone therapy has been in and out of favor - first it was good for all menopausal women, then it was dangerous for all women,\u201d McNeil said. \u201cThe take-home message now is that for the right patient, hormone therapy is safe and effective.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does a good job of outlining the complicated history of findings from hormone replacement studies, and the harms and risks, and uses numbers to explain the risks.\nThere is great nuance in the findings, which can be interpreted differently for women of different ages seeking HRT.

Participants in the trial received two doses of the vaccine, with the doses given two months apart.\n\nLead researcher Professor Tony Cunningham from the Westmead Institute for Medical Research said the study shows that the vaccine stimulates production of a specific immune memory cell (CD4 T cells), generating a strong and sustained protection against the virus.\n\n\"The body has two types of immunity: protein antibodies and white blood cells known as T cells. As the virus circulates around the body, antibodies block it from entering cells. But when the virus does get into cells your T cells try to kill those infected cells.\n\n\"Our research shows that the vaccine stimulates your immune system to produce more antibodies and it generates a 24-fold increase in T cells. This is 12 times higher than other less effective shingles vaccines.\n\nThe research, published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, shows that Shingrix offers protection for up to four years, but Professor Cunningham believes it will last much longer.\n\n\"The second dose of the vaccine is important to ensure long-term protection,\" Professor Cunningham said.\n\n\"The efficacy is approximately 90% for all age groups--even for those over 70 years of age.\n\n\"This is quite remarkable because there are no other vaccines that perform nearly so well for people in their 70s and their 80s. We are seeing results comparable to those of childhood vaccinations.\n\n\"What's particularly exciting, though, is that 90% of recipients had an increased immune response sustained across the 3-year duration of the study.\n\n\"We anticipate that this protection will actually last much, much longer. We are now measuring the efficacy of the vaccine over the next 10 years and are very optimistic about the results,\" he said.\n\nShingrix is different from most other vaccines. Many vaccines are made from a weakened form of the virus, but Shingrix is made from just a single protein--known as glycoprotein E--that comes from the outer shell of the herpes zoster virus.\n\nThe vaccine also contains an adjuvant--a substance that helps your body fight off the virus. It is the first shingles vaccine to combine a non-live antigen with a specifically designed adjuvant.\n\nShingles is a viral infection, caused by the herpes zoster virus--the same virus that causes chickenpox. The incidence of shingles increases as we get older, because the body's natural immunity declines.\n\n\"When people reach their 50s and 60s, T cell immunity declines allowing shingles to strike. That's why our adult vaccine is directed specifically at T cell immunity,\" Professor Cunningham said.\n\nMost Australian adults have been infected with the herpes zoster virus and are at risk of shingles, even if they do not remember having chicken pox. By age 85, approximately 50% of the population will develop shingles.

He is a professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\n\nRoughly 250,000 such infections occur in hospitals each year in the United States, costing about $250 million, the researchers pointed out.\n\nAlthough about 20 percent of hospitalized patients get a urinary catheter, one-third of the time they aren't needed, Saint said. He believes that patients can play a role in reducing catheter use.\n\n\"A lot of patients and families don't realize that there are problems with a urinary catheter, so they may request them because they think it will allow patients to stay in bed,\" Saint said.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there are side effects with a catheter. And I've seen patients who have gotten up in the middle of the night and they trip and fall on the tubing,\" he explained.\n\n\"Patients and families should request that a catheter not be put in, and if there is one there, the patient should ask every day whether it is still needed,\" Saint suggested.\n\nFor the study, Saint and his colleagues tried the new program in 600 hospitals.\n\nAfter 18 months of using the program, infection rates among hospital patients in general wards dropped by one-third, while catheter use had dropped about 1 percent.\n\nBut there was no drop in infections or catheter use in intensive care units (ICUs), the study findings showed.\n\nHospital-acquired urinary tract infection rates rose nationwide during the same time period, Saint noted.\n\nThe program Saint helped develop -- called the \"bladder bundle\" -- includes protocols, checklists, training and information-sharing that help doctors and nurses reduce catheter use and prevent infections.\n\nIncluded in the program are:\n\u2022 Daily checks to see if a catheter is still needed.\n\u2022 Using other options to collect urine, such as bedpans.\n\u2022 Use of infection-control techniques for catheter placement and maintenance.\n\u2022 Feedback to the medical team about catheter use and infection rates.\n\nThe researchers found that catheter infection rates in the new program dropped 14 percent overall in general wards (non-ICU).\n\nThe findings were published June 2 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nDr. Susan Huang, a professor of infectious disease at the University of California, Irvine, wrote an editorial accompanying the study.

Some experts in cancer screening and statistics said its novel approach was \u201con shaky ground\u201d and used a \u201ccompletely unverifiable\u201d methodology that they had \u201cnever seen before,\u201d but others praised its \u201cintriguing and innovative approach.\u201d There was one area of agreement, however: \u201cI imagine it\u2019s going to generate some buzz,\u201d said biostatistician Ted Karrison of the University of Chicago.\n\nIf the new analysis is correct, one of the influential PSA studies, called PLCO, reduced deaths from prostate cancer by 27 percent to 32 percent, not the zero percent that PLCO researchers themselves found. For a man in the U.S., the risk of dying of prostate cancer is about 2.5 percent. A mortality reduction of 30 percent would lower the death rate to 1.75 percent, said epidemiologist Ruth Etzioni of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the study\u2019s senior author.\n\n\u201cIf a screening test reduces cancer mortality by 20 percent, it\u2019s considered a successful test,\u201d Etzioni said. \u201cI think the [prostate-cancer] mortality reduction we calculate is a significant benefit. This is a screening test that saves lives.\u201d\n\nThose gains come at some cost to health, though: For every life saved, she estimated, five men will be told they have cancer when in fact their abnormal cells would never grow, spread, or harm them. In other estimates, such \u201coverdiagnoses\u201d outnumber lives saved by 50-to-1.\n\nThe new study lands amid another shift in how experts view PSA screening, which measures blood levels of a molecule sometimes associated with prostate cancer. In 2012 the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, whose recommendations help determine that procedures insurance should cover, recommended against routine PSA tests because of their many risks and tiny benefits. Among other drawbacks, the tests lead to overdiagnosis (meaning a biopsy finds malignant cells but they are so innocuous they would never harm, let alone kill, the man) as well as incontinence and impotence from treatment (including of harmless cancers).\n\nIn April, however, the task force proposed instead that men aged 55 to 69 discuss PSA\u2019s pros and cons with their doctor and then decide what to do, factoring in that if 1,000 men get regular PSA screening for a decade it will save about one life. (Older and younger men are still advised not to have routine screening.)\n\nThe rationale for the re-analysis led by Etzioni is that the PLCO study was a bit of a mess. It assigned half of its nearly 77,000 participants, men ages 55 to 74, to have yearly PSA tests and the other half to not do so. But 46 percent of the men in the no-PSA group had yearly PSAs anyway. As a result, when researchers counted deaths in each group, it wasn\u2019t a clean comparison: Rather than comparing screened to unscreened men, they were comparing assigned-to-screening men to not-assigned-to-screening men.\n\nThe finding that assigned-to-screening men were no more likely to avoid death from prostate cancer might therefore have been because their screening behavior wasn\u2019t different enough from the \u201cunscreened\u201d (but in fact partly screened) men\u2019s, not because PSA screening doesn\u2019t save lives.\n\nIn an effort to untangle that possibility, Etzioni and 21 co-authors from 10 countries created multiple mathematical models. They all rely on estimates of \u201clead time,\u201d or how much sooner a cancer is detected because of PSA instead of because symptoms are detected. The models incorporated the records of all the PLCO men and ignored which group they\u2019d been assigned to.\n\nBottom line: Screened men\u2019s cancers were detected earlier than unscreened men\u2019s, and more frequent screening advanced detection more. That moved some prostate cancers from too-advanced-to-treat to treatable, reducing prostate cancer mortality by 27 percent to 32 percent over 11 years, Etzioni and her colleagues conclude.\n\nResearchers not involved in the study weren\u2019t convinced. \u201cThe concern is that men in the no-screening group but who chose to get screened anyway might differ in important ways from men who stayed with no-screening,\u201d Karrison said. They might be more health conscious or conscientious, or have other traits associated with longevity. If so, then those traits, not screening, might be responsible for their lower risk of dying from prostate cancer. Two prominent experts in cancer prevention and statistics agreed, but said they did not want to be publicly identified as criticizing the new analysis because some of its authors are colleagues of theirs.\n\nDr. Kenneth Lin of Georgetown University Medical Center, a former staffer at the USPSTF, said crediting PSA tests with reducing prostate cancer mortality by around 30 percent was probably an overstatement, especially since mathematical models are only models. An earlier one for the PLCO study concluded that more men died in its screening group than in the don\u2019t-get-screened group. \u201cModels are models,\u201d Lin said. \u201cNo matter how sophisticated, they shouldn\u2019t trump data from real people who participated in the randomized trials\u201d \u2014 which in PLCO found zero lives saved from PSA screening.\n\nA researcher associated with the Preventive Services Task Force, but who was not permitted to speak to reporters while the group is finalizing its PSA recommendation, said the panel would incorporate the new paper in its analysis. \u201cBut honestly,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know that this adds a great deal to our understanding.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Drawing from information produced by the USPSTF, the article concluded that the gains in prostate cancer detection \u201ccome at some cost to health, though: For every life saved, five men will be told they have cancer when in fact their abnormal cells would never grow, spread, or harm them.

They hope the technology can be commercialized and marketed to prevent the spread of seasonal flu in public places, such as schools, hospitals, and airports.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known for a century that UV light is extremely efficient at killing microbes, bacteria, and viruses,\u201d says study leader David Brenner, director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. For that reason, UV devices are often used for sterilization \u2014 for medical equipment in hospitals, for example, or drinking water for backcountry campers.\n\nBut conventional germicidal lamps aren\u2019t safe for humans to be around.

Earlier studies, on animals and humans, have shown that exposure to far-UVC light does indeed appear to be safe. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any biological damage to skin cells or eye cells, whereas with conventional UV light we\u2019ve always seen lots of biological damage,\u201d he says. Previous research has also shown that far-UVC light can kill MRSA bacteria, a common cause of infections after surgery.\n\nNow, Brenner and his colleagues have show that UVC light can effectively kill airborne influenza. In their new study, aerosolized particles of the H1N1 seasonal flu virus were released into a test chamber and exposed to very low doses of far-UVC light. The light inactivated the viruses with about the same efficiency as conventional germicidal UV light, while a control group of bacteria not exposed to light remained active.\n\n\u201cWe think that this type of overhead light could be efficacious for basically any public setting,\u201d says Brenner. \u201cThink about doctor\u2019s waiting rooms, schools, airports and airplanes\u2014any place where there\u2019s a likelihood for airborne viruses.\u201d And unlike the flu vaccine, he says, far-UVC light is likely to be effective against all airborne microbes, including newly emerging virus strains.\n\nBrenner says his team is working with a company to develop a commercially available version of the lamp, which could become a cost-effective way to battle flu epidemics on a population level. \u201cThe lamp we\u2019re using at the moment costs less than $1,000, and you can imagine that if it were put into general circulation, the price would drop dramatically,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t see cost as being a limiting factor here.\u201d\n\nUVC lamps could also have potential implications in clinical settings, as well \u2014 in the operating room during surgeries, for example. \u201cNo matter how well you sterilize a room beforehand, the medical staff can still bring in dangerous bacteria like MRSA,\u201d says Brenner. \u201cIf you have a lamp over the surgical site that can sterilize the air, you can prevent the bacteria from floating down and contaminating the wound.\u201d\n\nBrenner can\u2019t predict how long it might take for these lamps to be commercially available, but he says he\u2019s \u201cextremely optimistic\u201d about the technology. \u201cThere has been no way of killing viruses in the air in public spaces, and this is an approach that may solve that problem.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "No harms of far-UVC light are mentioned; in fact, in the opening sentence we read:\u00a0 \u201cresearchers have developed an ultraviolet (UV) lamp that kills influenza virus but isn\u2019t harmful to human skin or eyes\u2026.\u201d\nBut, again, we\u2019re given no data regarding safety.\u00a0We are not told if the previous skin or eye studies (which we\u2019re told prove the safety of this approach) were done in the laboratory or on real humans.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "A new study has found that it is possible to find a large number of \"silent\" cancers in the lungs of heavy smokers by periodically screening them with CAT scans.

Early-stage cancer is easier to treat and has a higher survival rate.\n\nThe new study provides further evidence of that.

Chan, PhD, Debbie and Andy Rachleff Distinguished Professor of Neurology, vice chief of the Division of Neuroinflammation and Glial Biology, and senior author of the new study. First approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1977 for allergies, the drug has been available over the counter in generic form since 1993.\n\nThe researchers said that the Phase II results, published online on 10 October, 2017 in The Lancet, are the first in which a drug has been shown to reliably restore any brain function damaged by a neurological disease in human patients.\n\n\"To the best of our knowledge this is the first time a therapy has been able to reverse deficits caused by MS. It's not a cure, but it's a first step towards restoring brain function to the millions who are affected by this chronic, debilitating disease,\" said the trial's principal investigator, Ari Green, MD, also Debbie and Andy Rachleff Distinguished Professor of Neurology, chief of the Division of Neuroinflammation and Glial Biology, and medical director of the UCSF Multiple Sclerosis and Neuroinflammation Center.\n\nChan and Green are co-directors of the UCSF Small-Molecule Program for Remyelination, and both are members of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences.\n\nThe new results are particularly notable, Chan said, because patients in the trial had suffered from MS symptoms caused by injury to myelin for years. \"People thought we were absolutely crazy to launch this trial, because they thought that only in newly diagnosed cases could a drug like this be effective -- intuitively, if myelin damage is new, the chance of repair is strong. In the patients in our trial the disease had gone on for years, but we still saw strong evidence of repair.\"\n\nMS is an autoimmune neurodegenerative disorder that affects nearly 2.5 million people worldwide. The disease strikes when the immune system attacks myelin, layers of fatty insulating membrane that surround nerve fibers. Unlike the rubber insulation around wires, however, myelin helps electrical signals in neurons move faster and more efficiently. As myelin damage continues over the course of the disease, neurons progressively lose their ability to reliably transmit electrical signals, resulting in progressive loss of vision, weakness, walking difficulties, and problems with coordination and balance.\n\nCurrent MS treatments aim to prevent the immune system from doing further harm, but none have been shown to repair damaged myelin. In both his 2013 research and in subsequent studies with a mouse model of MS, however, Chan and colleagues had demonstrated that clemastine fumarate promotes myelin regeneration and restores neural function, promising preclinical results that inspired the new study, known as the ReBUILD trial.\n\nBecause the visual system is often one of the first and most prominent parts of the brain to be affected in MS, and because there are well-established tools to measure the speed of neural transmission in the areas of the brain devoted to vision, the research team used a method known as visual evoked potentials, or VEPs, to assess clemastine's therapeutic effects in the trial.\n\nThe five-month Phase II trial enrolled 50 patients with relapsing but generally long-standing MS whose VEPs reflected preexisting deficits in neural transmission. The researchers showed flickering patterns on a screen to participants, and used electrodes placed over the brain's visual areas at the back of the head to gauge how long it took for the flickering signal presented to the eye to generate an electrical response that could be detected by the electrodes. The time from presentation of the pattern to the detection of the VEP is a measurement of how long it took for the signal to travel via nerve fibers from the retina, at the back of the eye, to the visual areas at the back of the brain.\n\nTo enhance the power of their study, the researchers used a \"crossover\" design: they divided the patient population in two and gave the drug, blinded to both participant and researcher, to one group, and a placebo to the other for 90 days; then they switched between the two groups, giving a placebo to the first group and the drug to the other for the next 60 days. This \"flip-flop\" technique gave the researchers the ability to compare patients to themselves -- a form of control that increased the statistical power of the study by nearly an order of magnitude, Green said.\n\nDuring the periods when each group was taking the drug, the neural signal from the eye to the back of the brain was significantly accelerated over the baseline measurements taken before the patients began the study. The effect persisted in the group that had switched to placebo, suggesting that durable repair of myelin had been induced by the drug.\n\nAlthough the research team could not directly observe evidence of rebuilding of myelin in trial participants using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Chan and Green said that this reflects a weakness of current MRI techniques as a tool for this purpose rather than evidence that myelin regeneration did not take place. \"We still don't have imaging methods that have been proven to be able to detect remyelination in humans,\" said Chan.\n\nThat myelin increases the speed of neural transmission is one of the most well-established concepts in neurobiology, and combined with the clear evidence from Chan's preclinical research showing that clemastine fumarate promotes myelin formation, myelin regeneration is the only plausible explanation for the VEP results, the authors said.\n\n\"This is the first step in a long process,\" Green said. \"By no means do we want to suggest that this is a cure-all. We want to ground-truth myelination metrics -- we're designing the crucible that's going to be used to test any future method for detecting remyelination.\"\n\nThe work was funded through generous support from the Rachleff Family.\n\nIn addition to Green and Chan, authors (all at UCSF) include Jeffrey M Gelfand, MD, MAS; Bruce A Cree, MD, PhD, MAS; Carolyn Bevan, MD; W.

Levels of the protein were markedly lower after surgical removal of a patient's tumors. The study was published in the June 24 issue of the journal Nature.\n\nPancreatic cancer has one of the lowest survival rates of any cancer, with only 4 percent of patients surviving five years after diagnosis. That is due in part to the lack of any easy way to detect the cancer in its earliest stages. The pancreas is located deep within the body, so early tumors cannot be seen or felt during routine physical exams. Patients usually have no symptoms until the cancer has spread.\n\nScientists have uncovered various markers that can be used to detect the cancer through a blood test, but those have been too unreliable to recommend widespread screening.\n\nAs a result, 80 percent of pancreatic cancer is diagnosed in later stages, when surgery is no longer an option.\n\nThe new finding could lead to a blood test that would allow doctors to screen for pancreatic cancer much more effectively.

For men at high risk for the disease -- blacks and men who have a father, brother or son found to have prostate cancer at an early age (before 65) -- that discussion should start at age 45.\n\n\"Because prostate cancer grows slowly, those men without symptoms of prostate cancer who do not have a 10-year life expectancy should not be offered testing since they are not likely to benefit,\" the society notes on its Web site.\n\nAmbivalence over the test hasn't been confined to the United States.\n\n\"In Europe, we have been reluctant to recommend that all men get PSA testing as we have felt that there has been a lack of knowledge,\" agreed lead researcher Dr. Jonas Hugosson, a professor of urology at the University of Gothenburg.\n\nHowever, he believes that with the results of the new 14-year study, \"it feels ethically difficult not at least to inform all men over the age of 50 about PSA and its possibilities. Personally, I would recommend my friends check their PSA,\" Hugosson added.\n\nThe report is published in the June 30 online edition of The Lancet Oncology.\n\nFor the still-ongoing study, Hugosson randomly assigned some 20,000 men to either PSA screening once every two years or no screening. The men were between 50 and 65 at the start of the study.\n\nMen whose PSA levels were above normal were offered more tests, such as a digital rectal exam and prostate biopsies.\n\nOver 14 years of follow-up, deaths from prostate cancer dropped by 44 percent among the screened men, compared with unscreened men, the researchers found. Overall, 44 of the men who had PSA testing died from prostate cancer, compared to 78 men who had not had been screened.\n\nAmong screened men, 11.4 percent were diagnosed with prostate cancer, compared with 7.2 percent of unscreened men. Of the men in the screened group diagnosed with prostate cancer, nearly 79 percent were diagnosed because they took part in the study, the researchers noted.\n\nIn addition, men in the screened group were more likely to have their cancer diagnosed while it was in an early stage. In the screened group, 46 men were diagnosed with advanced cancer, compared with 87 men in the unscreened group, Hugosson's team found.\n\n\"Our study has a longer follow-up than previous studies, but shows that in those men invited [to the study], the risk of dying is only half of that in the control group. In men younger than 60 at study entry, the effect was even more pronounced -- only one-quarter of expected deaths occurred,\" Hugosson said.\n\nMoreover, the risk of over-diagnosis was less than previously thought, with just 12 men needed to be diagnosed to save one life. However, since the benefit of PSA screening requires at least 10 years to be borne out, it still seems questionable to test PSA for men over 70, the researchers noted.\n\nDr. David E.

By doing so, it can save the lives of some men who would otherwise have died of the disease.\"\n\nThis study adds to previous evidence that PSA testing and screening for prostate cancer saves lives, he said. Still, the PSA test remains \"a blunt instrument,\" when it comes to determining the aggressiveness of a particular tumor, Neal said. \"We need better tests that identify more accurately those men destined to develop problems in the future from this disease,\" he said.\n\nIn the United States, PSA testing remains a routine part of most physical exams, according to Dr. Nelson Neal Stone, a professor of urology and radiation oncology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City.\n\n\"I would say 70 to 80 percent of physicians now order a PSA test,\" he said. \"So it is more or less the standard to care in America to get a PSA done.\"\n\nStone noted that screening detects a lot of early cancers, which do not need to be treated. \"When we see patients with low-risk disease we don't treat them, we observe them,\" he said.\n\n\"Younger men benefit most from screening, because they have the greatest risk of dying,\" Stone said. \"This study clearly supports PSA screening to prevent prostate cancer deaths.\"\n\nAnother expert, Dr. Anthony D'Amico, chief of radiation oncology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, added that \"people in good health will benefit from [PSA] screening, but people in poor health may not benefit at all.\" That's because if their prostate tumor is not aggressive they are more likely to die from the other, more serious conditions, he explained.\n\nFor more information on prostate cancer, visit the American Cancer Society.", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Although reporting that \u2018just 12 men would need to be diagnosed with prostate cancer in order to save one life\u2019 the story neglected to follow though and examine the harm done to the other 11 men. \u00a0There are psychological consequences of a cancer diagnosis. \u00a0In addition, it wasn\u2019t just that men were diagnosed with prostate cancer that affected the chance that they would die from prostate cancer \u00a0\u2013 at least some of these men also received treatment for prostate cancer. \u00a0There was no discussion of the possible harms that are a consequence of prostate cancer treatment.\nThese are not easy issues, but the story did not mention that the number needed to screen to prevent one cancer death was 293.\u00a0 Those who were screened and got a false positive, perhaps leading to unnecessary followup testing like a biopsy, experienced harms.

An approval for Crohn\u2019s would give the drug entry into an estimated $1.3 billion U.S. market and $2.7 billion market worldwide.\n\nThe intravenous biotech drug met the primary goal of the study as almost 40 percent of patients who received the 6 milligrams per kilogram of weight dose of Stelara achieved a clinical response \u2014 defined as a 100-point reduction in the Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) \u2014 after six weeks of treatment.\n\nThat compared with a response rate of 23.5 percent of patients who received a placebo.\n\nTwo lower doses of Stelara were also tested in the study of 526 patients with moderate to severe Crohn\u2019s disease who were not helped by, or could not tolerate, treatment with a widely used class of drugs known as TNF antagonists, such as Abbott Laboratories\u2019 Humira.\n\nThose who received 1 mg/kg had a 36.6 percent response rate and the 3 mg/kg dose led to a 34.1 percent response rate.\n\n\u201cTo see these kind of outcomes, where you have high response rates in the short term and then good remission rates out toward five or six months of therapy, it shows unequivocally that the drug is effective for treating Crohn\u2019s disease,\u201d said Dr. William Sandborn, the study\u2019s lead investigator, who presented the data at the Digestive Disease Week meeting in Chicago on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s effective in the patient population that has the greatest unmet need at this point in time,\u201d Sandborn said of patients who do not respond to anti-TNF drugs.\n\nHe said a 100-point drop in the CDAI was clinically meaningful to patients. \u201cThey\u2019ll feel measurably better.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe patient population was really quite ill and had very high disease activity, and despite that we saw nice response rates,\u201d Sandborn said.\n\nIn a second phase of the study, those who responded to Stelara after six weeks of treatment were given either a 90-mg injection of Stelara at week eight and week 16 or a placebo.\n\nAfter 22 weeks, 69.4 percent of the Stelara patients maintained a clinical response and 41.7 percent were deemed to be in clinical remission. That compared with 42.5 percent who maintained a clinical response and a 27.4 percent remission rate in the placebo group.\n\nClinical remission was defined as a CDAI score down to 150. Patients in the study on average started at 320 or 325 on the CDAI scale, researchers said.\n\nCrohn\u2019s is a chronic autoimmune disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that affects an estimated 700,000 Americans. Common symptoms are abdominal pain and diarrhea, and it can lead to bowel perforations.

And, for unknown reasons, the U.S. rate of preterm delivery has been going up in recent years.\n\nThat's why it's a pretty big deal that the Food and Drug Administration has OK'd a drug, called 17-HP, that experts say could make a dent in the preemie problem.\n\nNot a huge dent, but a significant one. The March of Dimes calculates that if all the women eligible to get the newly approved drug actually did, there would be 10,000 fewer preemies a year \u2013 out of more than half-a-million born that way.\n\n\"Although that may seem like a small percent, it's really a very extraordinary ability to impact on what is really a major public health problem,\" Dr. Alan Fleischman, the March of Dimes medical director, told Shots.\n\nAccording to the best research, the drug reduces the risk of premature birth by one-third among women who are at high risk because they had a previous preterm birth.\n\nThe drug is not for women whose prior premature births were of twins or other multiple births, or who are carrying more than one fetus in their current pregnancy. Nor is it for women who have other conditions that raise their risk of preterm birth, such as high blood pressure or infection.\n\nAnd even for the 30,000 or so women who are eligible, 17-HP, which will be marketed as Makena, isn't a magic bullet. The study showed that 37 percent of women who got weekly injections of it delivered prematurely, compared to 55 percent of women who got injections of a placebo.\n\nInterestingly, the drug is not new \u2014 it's just taken a long and circuitous route to approval.\n\nIn 1956, the FDA approved 17-HP for the treatment of certain cancers and other hormonal disorders, under the brand name Delalutin. But its manufacturer withdrew it from the market in 2000 \"for reasons unrelated to safety,\" as the FDA puts it.\n\nIn fact, as a Federal Register posting last year chronicled, there have been questions raised about whether 17-HP caused birth defects of various kinds. In the 1970s, the FDA required warnings on drugs containing progesterone, as 17-HP does, because of an increased risk of birth defects. They later revoked them.\n\nThe FDA is apparently satisfied that 17-HP is safe, but it's requiring its sponsors KV Pharmaceuticals and TherRx to conduct further studies of women who have taken it and children exposed during pregnancy.\n\nEveryone in this field is mindful of the long-running tragedy of vaginal and other cancers and male urinary disorders that resulted from the last drug thought to prevent premature birth \u2013 a synthetic estrogen called diethylstilbesterol, or DES. In 1971 researchers realized children exposed to DES in utero had a higher incidence of vaginal and breast cancers, and males were subsequently found to have urinary-tract problems.\n\nFleischman, the March of Dimes official, says there's no such risk from 17-HP, partly because it's not used before the 16th week of pregnancy, when fetal organs have already formed.\n\n\"We have been very aggressively tracking all the data,\" Fleischman says, \"and we have no reason to believe that this drug will increase birth defects.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "Good discussion of concerns and ongoing monitoring of the drug\u2019s safety.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association shows the clearest evidence yet that women carrying the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes should consider preventive surgery because they are at a very high risk for breast and ovarian cancers.\n\nIt confirms what smaller studies have suggested in the past: Women who have a family history of breast cancer can greatly reduce their chances of getting the disease by having a double mastectomy.\n\nAnd, if they also have their ovaries removed, they can further reduce the risk of breast cancer and minimize their chances of getting ovarian cancer.\n\nResearchers from around the country tracked nearly 2,500 women with the BRCA mutations who had surgery to try to prevent breast and ovarian cancer.\n\n\"We found mastectomy provided huge risk reduction of subsequent breast cancer diagnosis and death. Risk reduction [was] probably in the range of 80 to 95 percent,\" said researcher Timothy Rebbeck, an epidemiologist at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nAnd women who had ovaries removed reduced their risk of ovarian cancer by as much as 80 percent.\n\nThe study findings are extremely reassuring to Rebbeck -- no breast cancer diagnoses among women who had double mastectomies after three years of follow-up. Among the women who did not have the surgery, 7 percent were later diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nRebbeck says these decreases are big but are cautions that cancer risk will never be brought down to zero. That's because all the tissue is never completely taken out.\n\n\"Breast tissue is found throughout the torso and can't be completely removed through surgical means. And, with ovarian cancer, the ovary leaves behind cells that could go on to become cancerous. So, it's just not possible to remove all the tissue that might be at risk,\" he says.\n\nOne of the women who decided to take that chance is 61-year-old Toby of New Jersey. (Because she's worried about her health coverage, she doesn't want her last name used.)\n\nToby's mother died of ovarian cancer when Toby was in her 20s. Researchers now know that disease is linked, along with breast cancer, to genetic mutations.\n\nToby had first her ovaries and then both breasts removed after she tested positive for the BRCA genes about five years ago.\n\nBut at first, she had hoped to avoid the surgery.\n\n\"After my genetic testing, they would alternate mammogram with MRI every six months. I thought I was getting very, very good surveillance, and I thought that would probably be enough and they would be able to diagnose something very, very early and be able to cure me if I were to get breast cancer,\" she says.\n\nBut her doctors thought otherwise. Breast cancer caused by BRCA mutations is particularly aggressive. And they told Toby her lifetime risk of that type of cancer was as high as 90 percent.\n\nToby was one of the women researchers from around the country tracked in the study to see how they fared after having this surgery.\n\nWomen like Toby who chose both ovary and breast removal had dramatically lower risks of getting both cancers after the surgery. Only 3 percent of those who had surgery died, compared with 10 percent of those who did not, during the follow-up period.\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the study, Virginia Kaklamani, an oncologist at Northwestern University, says lives can be saved if women have genetic testing.\n\n\"A lot of times I see these women having had a very preventable type of breast cancer. Preventable because I can identify the fact that they had a higher risk of getting breast cancer,\" she says.\n\n\"Had they been genetically tested a few years prior to my seeing them, they would have had the option of having bilateral mastectomy. So, we could have prevented these breast cancers and we didn't,\" says Kaklamani.\n\nFor Toby, it's been about a year since her double mastectomy. She's had reconstruction. And, today, she says she feels physically strong again.

The studies simultaneously were published by the New England Journal of Medicine on a day that some experts called the \u201cSuper Bowl of lung cancer immunotherapy.\u201d\n\nThe reports underscore the increasingly important first-line role that immunotherapy, which unleashes the immune system to destroy cancer cells, is taking against the deadliest cancer.\n\n\u201cImmunotherapy is rapidly, in combination with other treatments and on its own, dramatically changing the standard of care for lung cancer,\u201d said Leena Gandhi, an oncologist at NYU Langone Health who led the study on the immunotherapy-chemotherapy combination, called Keynote-189. \u201cInstead of chemo being the backbone on which to improve, immunotherapy is now the backbone on which we build.\u201d\n\nLung cancer is the second-most-common malignancy in the United States, after breast cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates that 234,000 people will be diagnosed with the disease this year, and 154,050 will die of it.\n\nMost patients diagnosed with advanced lung cancer \u2014 disease that has spread beyond its original site \u2014 initially receive chemotherapy, which provides only marginal benefit. But the disease is so lethal that many patients don\u2019t survive long enough to try second- or third-line treatments, so researchers are trying to develop and use more effective approaches earlier.\n\nThe trial that grabbed much of the spotlight Monday is a randomized effectiveness study that involved more than 600 untreated patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer \u2014 a common type of the disease. The patients did not have cancer-causing mutations. One group was treated only with chemo, while the other got an immunotherapy drug called Keytruda plus chemo. Some of the results had been released previously, but not specific details.\n\nAfter a median follow-up time of 10.5 months, Gandhi said, the patients in the combination group were 51 percent less likely to die, compared with patients in the chemo-only arm.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, adding another drug has significantly impacted the long-term outlook for those patients,\u201d she said.\n\nScientists who weren't involved in the study agreed that it was highly significant. H. Jack West, an oncologist at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle, said, \u201cIt is literally practice-changing \u2014 immediately.\u201d\n\nRoy Herbst, an oncologist at Yale Cancer Center said that most lung cancer patients now will be offered immunotherapy in some form much earlier than before. Still, he said, the approach was not a cure and there is a lot of room for improvement. The estimated proportion of patients in the combination therapy group who were alive and whose disease had not gotten worse at a year was about 34 percent, about double the proportion for the chemo-only group.\n\nLast May, the Food and Drug Administration approved the Keytruda-chemo combination based on an early-stage trial. But many doctors did not adopt it because the trial was small and didn\u2019t initially show a survival benefit, Gandhi said.\n\nExperts said it was especially significant that the study showed that patients benefited from the Keytruda-chemo combination regardless of the levels of a protein, called PD-L1, found on their cancer cells. Researchers already had known that patients with high levels of the protein were more likely to respond to immunotherapy.\n\nLast week, in a related development, Merck, which makes Keytruda, reported that a different trial showed that the medication prolonged survival even when used alone, compared with chemo. Experts said they will have to see more details before they can determine whether the medication is better used alone or with chemo.\n\nIn a second study published Monday, researchers used two other immunotherapy medications \u2014 Opdivo and Yervoy, both made by Bristol-Myers Squibb \u2014 to treat newly diagnosed patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with a high number of mutations in their tumors.\n\nThe patients experienced a significantly longer period during which their disease did not worsen, compared with people who received only chemotherapy, said Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center oncologist Matthew Hellmann, who led the study.\n\nHe said the results established the double-immunotherapy combination as a first-line treatment for patients with a high \u201ctumor mutational burden,\u201d but that it was too early to know whether the treatment leads to longer survival. And he said the trial showed that \u201ctumor mutational burden\u201d is a reliable way to predict who will benefit from the medications.\n\nAnother study published Monday used immunotherapy in a different way \u2014 for patients with early-stage lung cancer. Researchers at Johns Hopkins and Memorial Sloan Kettering gave patients two doses of Opdivo \u2014 the first a month before surgery, the second two weeks before the operation \u2014 to try to stimulate anti-tumor activity and reduce the risk of relapse.\n\nNine of the 20 patients who got Opdivo had a \u201cmajor pathologic response\u201d \u2014 a sharp reduction in the number of cancer cells found in the tumors removed by surgery.\n\nDrew Pardoll, director of Hopkins\u2019 Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, said that it is too early to know whether the findings will translate into longer survival. But if future studies show that, he added, then immunotherapy might be used to augment or even replace chemo typically given before surgery.\n\nImmunotherapy moves to the front lines in fight against lung cancer\n\nThe cancer death rate has dropped again.

Nearly a quarter of a million people worldwide have leprosy, which causes disfiguration of the skin and mucous membranes as well as progressive and incurable nerve damage. While drug therapy exists for leprosy, it must be taken for many months, has many side effects and often is given too late to reverse the permanent damage caused by the bacterial infection. A viable vaccine to prevent and/or treat leprosy is the next step in the effort to bring this disease to an end.\n\nScientists at IDRI, along with national and international collaborators including the National Hansen's Disease Program and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, with financial support from American Leprosy Missions, have developed a promising leprosy vaccine candidate designed to help treat leprosy and prevent exposed individuals from developing disease and the resulting disabilities. Based on data generated in preclinical studies, the vaccine candidate, called LepVax, has progressed to Phase I clinical testing in the United States, the first stage of safety testing in human volunteers. The clinical trial is focused on safety, as well as evaluating the immune response to the vaccine.\n\n\"While previous attempts have used vaccines primarily developed for other diseases, this is the first totally defined vaccine candidate developed specifically for leprosy, using the latest technologies and offering no less than those exposed to leprosy deserve,\" said Steven Reed, Ph.D., IDRI President, CEO & Founder. \"The leprosy vaccine program at IDRI has benefited greatly from what we've learned in the development of tuberculosis vaccine candidates over the past two decades. Although the bacteria that cause tuberculosis and leprosy are related, leprosy vaccine development posed great challenges. This vaccine represents a unique accomplishment, requiring the most advanced technologies in molecular biology and immunology, and American Leprosy Missions has been there from the beginning.\" IDRI scientists have also developed two vaccine candidates for tuberculosis, both in clinical stages of development.\n\n\"We are thrilled that after 15 years and an investment of over $5.1 million, made possible by our faithful donors and partners, a leprosy-specific vaccine is beginning a Phase I clinical trial,\" says Bill Simmons, President and CEO of American Leprosy Missions. \"We believe this may be the most exciting breakthrough in leprosy treatment since multi-drug therapy, the current treatment for leprosy, was launched in the 1980s. We look forward to this vaccine improving the health outcomes of people diagnosed with leprosy. And, it may be that this vaccine can lead to interruption of the transmission of leprosy all together. What a tremendous legacy this would leave for millions of people worldwide.\"\n\nThe vaccine was developed through significant efforts in screening and identifying M. leprae proteins that trigger an effective immune response. IDRI scientists then produced a fusion of four leprosy proteins, which is combined with IDRI's proprietary immune-stimulating adjuvant (GLA-SE). With recent developments in vaccine technology, IDRI scientists can now induce protective responses even after infection, meaning it could be possible to prevent disease development in people already infected with the leprosy bacterium.\n\n\"This generation of a vaccine to prevent and possibly treat leprosy is the result of years of research. The development has been complicated by the fact that the organism that causes leprosy cannot be grown in culture in the laboratory,\" Reed explained. \"This is a unique example of a vaccine produced by totally synthetic methods.\"\n\nReed added that, without the foresight and support of American Leprosy Missions, there would be no leprosy vaccine candidate. \"The vision and support of American Leprosy Missions has been tremendous as we've worked with them throughout the years, moving from our work in developing a leprosy diagnostic to our current focus on a successful leprosy vaccine,\" he said. \"The progress we've had to date would not have been possible without American Leprosy Missions' financial support and guidance.\" Early results from the Phase I study should be available in 2018, and the partners are currently exploring mechanisms to advance the vaccine through later-phase clinical trials should results from the Phase I study (clinical trial NCT03302897) support further evaluation.\n\nThe vaccine candidate will serve as part of an overall strategy to end leprosy, which will require detection, prevention and treatment. IDRI had developed technology to enable a rapid, affordable, point-of-care diagnostic test, which was funded by NIAID (grant numbers 1R43AI066613-01A1 and 2R44AI066613-02.)\n\nIn addition to IDRI and American Leprosy Missions, a variety of partners are taking part in efforts to eliminate leprosy, including Novartis and the Novartis Foundation. Reed, along with scientists from a variety of scientific organizations recently published \"Innovative tools and approaches to end the transmission of Mycobacterium leprae\" in , outlining what is needed to achieve this goal. Together with scientific, government and NGO partners, the Novartis Foundation develops and implements strategies to help interrupt leprosy transmission, while Novartis donates the treatment for leprosy free of charge.\n\nAbout IDRI: As a nonprofit global health organization, IDRI (Infectious Disease Research Institute) takes a comprehensive approach to combat infectious diseases, combining the high-quality science of a research organization with the product development capabilities of a biotech company to create new diagnostics, drugs and vaccines.

It will slip under your skin and travel through the blood to your trachea, where you will swallow it and give it a free ride to your small intestine. Upon arrival, it will open its tiny jaw, dig its teeth into your intestinal wall and begin to drink your blood.\n\nAnd it could be the key to making millions of people healthier.\n\nWriting in the journal Science Translational Medicine on Wednesday, scientists report that a protein produced by hookworms eases the symptoms of asthma in mice \u2014 and could one day be made into a pill to treat humans.\n\nThe study is the latest from a surprising field of research into the potentially positive sides of parasites, one of the most maligned groups in the animal kingdom. It began years ago, when a gastroenterology surgeon approached parasitologist Alex Loukas, one of the senior authors on the new study. The doctor wanted to know whether there might be a connection between the dramatic success of deworming programs around the world and the rise of immune system problems like asthma and celiac disease.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the data that comes in from immunological studies . . . where you remove the parasites [that's] where you see the highest incidence of autoimmune diseases and allergies,\u201d said Severine Navarro, the paper's lead author and a senior research fellow in Loukas's lab at James Cook University in Australia.\n\n[Dear Science: Why do we get allergies? What's the point of a runny nose?]\n\nMany parasites have evolved the ability to hide from their host's immune systems. When a hookworm crawls into a human, it secretes chemicals that turn off the immune alarm bells and repair the tissue around it. It limits its consumption of blood to a few drops a day and doesn't leave its offspring scattered all over its host's gut. (Instead, it thoughtfully plants them in the host's poop to ensure an orderly exit from the body.) Like a very conscientious cat burglar, the hookworm knows it's best served by not making a mess.\n\n\u201cIt's almost symbiotic,\u201d Navarro said, \u201cbecause in order for it to survive and thrive, it needs its host to be happy and healthy.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the adaptations that help the parasites stay hidden also benefit their host by reining in overactive immune systems.\n\nThinking that they might be onto something, the researchers found 12 adults with celiac disease \u2014 a serious genetic disorder that causes an autoimmune response to gluten \u2014 who volunteered to have doctors infect them with a slimy, slithery hookworm. It was important that the participants be adults, because even relatively benign parasites can cause serious problems for children, pregnant women and others. Navarro also warned people with autoimmune disorders that they should not attempt to infect themselves with a hookworm, no matter how debilitating their illness might be. Parasites are no joke.\n\nFor the dozen trial participants, the hookworm did improve their tolerance of gluten.\n\nIt was an intriguing result, but it's difficult to scale that kind of study. Only so many people are willing to have a parasite put inside them for science. And because of the risks associated with parasites, going around infecting people isn't a viable treatment option.\n\n[Dear Science: How many germs are actually on a toilet seat \u2014 and should I care?]\n\nSo Navarro and her colleagues isolated the active ingredient in hookworm spit \u2014 a compound called AIP-2 \u2014 and injected it into asthmatic mice on a daily basis for five days. The animals' asthma systems substantially declined, and their airways became measurably less inflamed. These benefits persisted for 10 weeks after the mice stopped getting the treatment \u2014 \u201cI don't even know how much that is in mouse years,\u201d Navarro said.\n\nThe researchers also noticed that AIP-2 seemed to have a calming effect on the body's dendritic cells \u2014 a part of the immune system responsible for processing threats.\n\n\u201cIt is basically rewiring the cells in that tissue into promoting very efficient regulatory T cells,\u201d Navarro said, describing the cells that help modulate the immune system.\n\nThis suggests that AIP-2 might also help humans, since dendritic cells have the same function in us that they do in mice.

But the procedure had never been done in people.\n\nOn Tuesday, Dr. Todd Mainprize, a neurosurgeon at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and the University of Toronto, announced at a news conference that he had successfully breached the blood-brain barrier in a 56-year-old Canadian woman whose brain tumor, diagnosed six years ago, had recently begun to grow.\n\nMainprize performed the two-and-a-half-hour procedure last Thursday, with the patient, Bonny Hall, inside an MRI scanner. Hall felt nothing from the seconds-long bursts from 1,024 ultrasound beams aimed at different points around her skull, and an MRI scan confirmed that the brain barrier was successfully traversed.\n\nThe microscopic bubbles \u2014 roughly the size of red blood cells \u2014 had previously been injected into a vein, along with a chemotherapy drug called liposomal doxorubicin and a tracing molecule.\n\nOn Friday, as scheduled, Hall had brain surgery to remove her tumor. No damage from the ultrasound was visible inside her brain, Mainprize said, and she is recovering well from the surgery.\n\nBecause the trial was designed solely to determine the safety of focused ultrasound to the brain, the patient was not given a therapeutic dose of doxorubicin and the procedure is not expected to help in her recovery, Mainprize said. In the trial at Sunnybrook \u2014 funded by the Virginia-based Focused Ultrasound Foundation \u2014 nine others are slated to receive the same procedure.\n\nSucceeding in getting drugs across the barrier is \u201ca huge achievement\u201d said Dr. Nathan McDannold, a radiologist at Boston\u2019s Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, who has been working to open the barrier with ultrasound since he first accomplished the feat 15 years ago in animals.\n\nBut it\u2019s just one of many. New, safe doses of drugs will need to be determined, once medication is not being diverted by the blood-brain barrier, noted Dr. Gordon Li, a neurosurgeon at Stanford. \u201cIf we feel like we have a safe method of getting drugs in there,\u201d he said, \u201cit will open up a whole new slew of clinical trials.\u201d\n\nMainprize said the patient, a \u201cremarkable woman,\u201d was chosen to go first, because of the status and large size of her tumor, because it was an area of the brain that the ultrasound machinery could easily reach, and because of her willingness to help the research.\n\nIn a prepared video, Hall said she just wants to get back to living her life. \u201cI want to be a normal housewife \u2026 a normal grandma.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately explain/quantify the harms of the intervention?", "explanation": "This is a single patient and the story does mention that \u201cno damage from the ultrasound was visible inside her brain.\u201d But breaching the blood brain barrier is a big deal and likely would entail harms, especially if done repeatedly as would need to be done in many clinical treatments.

The results are published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nWhile most breast cancer is diagnosed at later ages, about 6% of women learn that they're ill before age 40 - when they are still of childbearing age. Breast cancer treatments that have shown the best results for for disease free survival include chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or both. For younger women still hoping for children, these treatments can cause devastating short-term or long-term loss of menstrual periods, and loss of fertility. While many women choose to preserve the option of having children by storing eggs before cancer treatment, the process can be costly and difficult.\n\nItalian researchers conducted a phase three study that included 281 women with breast cancer, aged 18 to 45 years and who had not experienced menopause. Patients were randomly selected to be treated with chemotherapy alone or with chemotherapy and triptorelin, a drug, called a GnRH analogue, that prevents the ovaries from releasing eggs. The researchers followed the women for one year after they had finished chemotherapy.\n\nAmong the women who had not received triptorelin, the rate of early menopause was 25.9%. Among the women who had received triptorelin, the rate of early menoapuse was 8.9%, which is 17% lower.\n\nAn accompanying editorial by Dr. Hope S. Rugo and Dr. Mitchell P. Rosen of the University of California-San Francisco says that trptorelin therapy should not be recommended as a standard treatment and should be approached with caution in women with hormone-sensitive disease.

The international study found that it protects against HPV infection in women older than 26 years. Vaccination programs worldwide currently target routine vaccination of women 26 years and younger.\n\nThe study recruited women in 12 countries across four continents. Cosette Wheeler, PhD, at The University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, was the lead author of the report.\n\nWhyThe human papillomaviruses cause cancer of the cervix, anus, and middle throat. Five types of HPV account for about 85 percent of all invasive cervical cancer cases. HPV vaccines are expected to prevent most of these cancer cases.\n\nMany countries routinely vaccinate girls and boys 25 years and younger, although vaccination rates in the United States remain low. In the US, only about 40 percent of girls and 21 percent of boys receive the three-dose vaccination series. The earlier the vaccine is given, the more efficacious it can be.\n\nThis study focused on the benefit of vaccinating women 26 years and older. Infection with HPV can take place at any time throughout adulthood and women in this age group may have already been exposed to HPV. The study showed that women in this age group were still protected from HPV infections.\n\nThe scientists followed each woman for four to seven years. They found that the vaccine protected the women against HPV infections during the follow-up period and that the women were protected from many types of HPV across a broad age range.
