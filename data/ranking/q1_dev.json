[{"article": "An experimental drug touted as a breakthrough for treating severe postpartum depression is showing some promising results in a small clinical trial.\n\nSage Therapeutics, based in Cambridge, Mass., reported on Tuesday that 7 of the 10 women who took the drug in the trial experienced significant improvement in their depression within 60 hours of the injection. That effect was maintained for 30 days.\n\nAmong the 11 women who took the placebo, just one experienced remission within 60 hours.\n\nInterestingly, none of the patients who took the drug reported psychiatric side effects, such as abnormal dreams, insomnia, and anxiety \u2014 but 5 of the 11 women on the placebo reported such symptoms. A few patients in each group experienced dizziness or a sedative effect.\n\nSage\u2019s drug is designed to change the traffic patterns in the brain. There\u2019s a natural push and pull between neurotransmitters called NMDA receptors and the GABA receptors that regulate their flow in the brain. In cases of severe depression, that equilibrium gets out of whack, and Sage\u2019s drug is meant to restore it, modulating those GABA receptors to allow NMDA to do its job.\n\nThe data could represent a \u201cparadigm shift in how the disease is thought about,\u201d CEO Jeff Jonas said in a conference call.\n\nBut before anyone shifts anything, Sage will need more data. The early results are \u201cpromising and exciting,\u201d said Dr. Allison Baker, a psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital\u2019s Center for Women\u2019s Mental Health, but \u201cwe need to see replication of this data over a much wider range in terms of numbers.\u201d\n\nThe study is small and has not been peer-reviewed; Sage disclosed the results in a press release. The company has not submitted study data to federal regulators and isn\u2019t at this point seeking approval of the drug, known as SAGE-547, for postpartum depression. Its next steps: expanding the trial to enroll more women and to determine optimum doses.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s incumbent upon us \u2026 to find a lower dose that might be just as useful,\u201d especially for nursing mothers, Jonas said.\n\nWomen in the trial were asked not to breastfeed for the first 10 days after receiving the injection. The drug has a \u201cvery, very short half-life\u201d in the body, Jonas said, meaning that it can be metabolized quickly.\n\nThe company is also testing SAGE-547 as a treatment for a rare form of epilepsy. It\u2019s in late-stage trials on that front. It\u2019s also working on an oral form of the drug.\n\nThough preliminary, the early results on postpartum depression are tantalizing. One of the drug\u2019s most promising features: It appears to work quickly \u2014 some women in the study started experiencing relief after 24 hours. By contrast, traditional antidepressants can take weeks to begin working. The only other treatment for postpartum depression is talk therapy.\n\nSAGE-547\u2019s apparent speed is what\u2019s getting the most attention in the psychiatric community, Baker said. In the early days of motherhood, women ideally build competency and confidence in their parenting. Dealing with postpartum depression derails that process, and it\u2019s linked to increased rates of anxiety and mood disorders among children, she said.\n\n\u201cIf we could essentially nip those within 60 hours or even 24 hours and then keep that at bay for at least 30 days, that\u2019s pretty compelling when you think of the alternative,\u201d Baker said.\n\nA serious mood disorder that affects as many as 1 in 7 women after childbirth, postpartum depression can lead to panic attacks, inconsolable sadness, and deep feelings of inadequacy. Some women have thoughts of harming their baby or themselves.\n\nJonas, a Harvard-trained psychiatrist, has long experience working with treatments for mental illnesses such as depression. He wrote the book \u201cEverything You Need To Know About Prozac\u201d in the early 1990s, in part to counter fear-mongering about the antidepressant.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The drug is still in early experiments, but it would have been nice to give readers some indication of how the eventual price of this drug might compare to available antidepressants.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "First marketed in the 1960s as a fertility drug, tamoxifen has been hailed as a miracle drug for its ability to prevent and treat breast cancer, and despite decades of research scientists have not been able to find anything comparable -- until now.\n\nIn a study published in The Lancet on Thursday, researchers found that a class of inexpensive, existing generic called aromatase inhibitors, which suppress hormones, reduce recurrence rates by 30 percent as compared with tamoxifen. That confirmed what researchers had believed for several years. But a separate finding about the effect of the drug on death risk was a surprise.\n\nThe study reported that \"taking aromatase inhibitors for 5 years reduced the risk of postmenopausal women with breast cancer dying of their disease by 40 percent within 10 years of starting treatment, compared with no hormonal treatment.\"\n\nThe results were part of the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group, a collaboration based at the University of Oxford, that collects and analyzes information about randomized clinical trials every few years.\n\nPaul Workman, professor and chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said in a statement accompanying the publication of the journal article that \"the evidence on aromatase inhibitors has been accumulating for well over a decade, but it has taken this huge and complex study to make sense of all the data, and provide a firm basis for clinical guidelines.\u201d\n\n\"It tends to be the discovery of new treatments that grabs the headlines, but it is just as important to maximize the benefit patients get from existing treatments through major, practice-changing studies like this,\" Workman said.\n\nThe researchers wrote in the study that a substantial number of the trial participants switched from tamoxifen to aromatase inhibitors after they heard that it could reduce recurrence, which affected their results. If this had not happened, \"the benefit of aromatase inhibitors over tamoxifen would probably have been somewhat greater,\" they surmised.\n\nA separate analysis by the same group, also published in The Lancet, looked at bisphosphonates, which are typically used for osteoporosis. Researchers at Sheffield University found that in postmenopausal women during the first 10 years after diagnosis of breast cancer, the drug could reduce the risk of death by 18 per cent.\n\nUsing the two drugs together as a one-two punch may be even more powerful.\n\nRichard Gray, a professor at the University of Oxford and who served as the lead statistician for both studies, said that half of all women with breast cancer are postmenopausal with hormone-sensitive tumors and could potentially benefit from both drugs.\n\n\u201cThe drugs are complementary, because the main side effect of aromatase inhibitors is an increase in bone loss and fractures, while bisphosphonates reduce bone loss and fractures as well as improving survival,\" he said.\n\nFDA approves breakthrough cholesterol drug, but only for certain high-risk patients\n\nOvereating may be caused by a hormone deficiency, scientists say\n\nCDC report: Lyme disease is spreading to new territories\n\nResearchers retract study claiming marriages fail more often when wife falls ill", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The Washington Post article calls aromatase inhibitors \u201cinexpensive,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t put a price tag on them.

This independent, multicenter, blinded study is one of the first studies to validate that a liquid biopsy test can predict therapeutic response and demonstrate a survival benefit. The blood test called, Oncotype DX\u00ae AR-V7 Nucleus Detect\u2122 is commercially available in the U.S. through Epic Science's partnership with Genomic Health, Inc. (NASDAQ: GHDX). The research was published online today in JAMA Oncology.\n\n\"This liquid biopsy test addresses a critical unmet need at a decision point in management to predict and select the therapy that is most likely to extend a patient's life,\" said Howard Scher, M.D., who led the study and is the co-chair, Center for Mechanism Based Therapy and Head of the Biomarker Development Initiative at MSK. \"During the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer, physicians will now be able to use AR-V7 status to determine when a patient's cancer has become resistant to androgen receptor directed therapy and will respond better to chemotherapy, enabling the patient to live longer.\"\n\nThis blinded four-year study followed 142 mCRPC patients who were treated at MSK, The Royal Marsden, or the London Health Sciences Centre. Blood samples were obtained prior to treatment with ARSi therapy or chemotherapy and tested with a validated assay for the nuclear-localized androgen receptor splice variant (AR-V7) protein in circulating tumor cells. The results were that patients positive for AR-V7 who were treated with taxane-based chemotherapy had superior overall survival (OS) relative to those treated with ARSI therapy (median OS, 14.3 vs. 7.3 months). Importantly, patients negative for AR-V7 who were treated with ARSi therapy had superior OS relative to those treated with taxanes (media OS, 19.8 vs. 12.8 months). Additionally, the authors validated the test within a prognostic risk group, to ensure that the biomarker effect was due to the biomarker rather than other clinical variables.\n\n\"We developed this test specifically to address a significant clinical question in metastatic prostate cancer that previously had no clear answer: which treatment should be pursued next? This question weighs heavily on doctors and patients, but now, with the Oncotype DX AR-V7 test, we can provide them the confidence to know whether continuing with hormonal therapy or switching to chemotherapy will result in better survival outcomes,\" said Ryan Dittamore, chief of medical innovation at Epic Sciences and a co-author on the study. \"In addition, the survival benefit gained through the utilization of our AR-V7 test could make the test as valuable to a patient's outcome as a blockbuster cancer drug.\"\n\nThis is the second blinded, multi-center clinical utility validation study utilizing the nuclear-localized AR-V7 test. Earlier this month, Dr. Andrew Armstrong of Duke Cancer Institute presented data validating the test in the PROPHECY clinical trial at the ASCO 2018 Annual Meeting. The PROPHECY study investigated the AR-V7 test in patients receiving ARSi therapy and demonstrated that patients who tested positive had worse survival by all measures and had no clinical benefit from ARSi therapy.\n\nIn March of this year, based upon earlier studies utilizing the test, Palmetto GBA, a Medicare Administrative Contractor that assesses molecular diagnostic technologies, issued a draft local coverage determination (LCD) for the Oncotype DX\u00ae AR-V7 Nucleus Detect\u2122 test. A full LCD for the test is expected in the upcoming months and would support Medicare reimbursement for applicable patients considering ARSI or taxane therapies. It is estimated that 50,000 patients a year may be eligible for and benefit from the Oncotype DX\u00ae AR-V7 Nucleus Detect\u2122 test.\n\nThe paper is entitled, \"Assessment of the Validity of Nuclear-Localized Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 in Circulating Tumor Cells as a Predictive Biomarker for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.\"\n\nAbout the Oncotype DX\u00ae AR-V7 Nucleus Detect\u2122 Test\n\nDesigned by Epic Sciences and based on results from multiple studies led by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the Oncotype DX\u00ae AR-V7 Nucleus Detect\u2122 test is the first and only liquid biopsy test of its kind that can potentially prolong the lives of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) by helping their physician identify the most effective treatment. Through a blood draw, the test detects AR-V7 protein in the nucleus of circulating tumor cells utilizing Epic Sciences' No Cell Left Behind\u00ae platform to accurately identify patients who are resistant to androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapies and who should instead switch to chemotherapy. The Oncotype DX\u00ae AR-V7 Nucleus Detect\u2122 test will be performed by Epic Sciences at its centralized, CLIA-certified laboratory in San Diego and offered exclusively by Genomic Health.

No one knows for sure what causes this process to begin, but some research suggests that the initial autoimmunity may begin early in life.\n\nFive immune system autoantibodies have been linked to type 1 diabetes. Having one of these antibodies isn't a guarantee that you'll develop type 1 diabetes, but it does indicate an increased risk for the disease. People who have two or more type 1 antibodies have between a 50 and 100 percent risk of developing type 1 diabetes, according to background information in the study.\n\nPrevious research has suggested that breastfeeding may offer some protection against the development of these antibodies, possibly because breastfeeding delays the introduction of infant formula, which contains complex proteins. Formula may somehow trigger the development of autoantibodies as these proteins are broken down for digestion.\n\nThe current study was randomized and double-blind (meaning neither the parents nor the researchers knew who was getting what), and compared regular baby formula to one that was made easier for babies to digest because the proteins were broken down (extensively hydrolyzed).\n\nBabies were offered the formula during the first 6 to 8 months of life, any time breastfeeding wasn't available. They were then followed till they were about 10 years old, according to the study.\n\nAfter adjusting the data to try to account for the duration of exposure to one of the study formulas, the researchers found that the extensively hydrolyzed formula reduced the risk of having one diabetes autoantibody by 49 percent, and the risk of having two or more autoantibodies by 53 percent.\n\nHow the highly hydrolyzed formula might reduce the risk of developing diabetes-predictive antibodies is unknown, but the researchers speculated that it might contribute to reduced gut permeability or changes in gut microflora, among other things.\n\nAccording to Knip, the take-home message from the study is that \"it is possible to reduce considerably the initiation of the diabetes disease process in at-risk children in a simple and safe way: weaning to an extensively hydrolyzed formula.\" He added that, \"based on the current results, we think that it is justified to recommend weaning to a highly hydrolyzed formula for babies in families with a member affected by type 1 diabetes.\"\n\nNot everyone agreed with that notion, however.\n\n\"The data in this study is not sufficiently strong to support recommending any changes for parents,\" said the author of an accompanying editorial, Dr. David Harlan, co-director of the Diabetes Center of Excellence at the University of Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center in Worcester.\n\n\"I think the authors designed this study to address their hypothesis that proteins present in non-hydrolyzed formula might incite an immune response, and by breaking them down, you might eliminate the immune response. But, there are quite a few steps between that and how the immune system or diabetes are triggered,\" added Harlan's editorial co-author, Dr. Mary Lee, a professor of pediatrics and cell biology and chief of the pediatric endocrine division at the University of Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center.\n\n\"I think this is an important study because we need to understand what causes type 1 diabetes,\" said Harlan, who added the caveat: \"In this study, while there is an apparent signal, there are also some causes for withholding complete faith in the conclusion that the formula caused diabetes.\"\n\nBoth Lee and Harlan stressed that there is currently no definitive evidence to suggest that the use of standard cow's milk formulas leads to an increased incidence of diabetes compared to breastfeeding.

A pathologist, examining the brain after death, would see microscopic black freckles, plaque, sticking to brain slices like barnacles. Without plaque, a person with did not have the disease.\n\nThere is no treatment yet to stop or slow the progress of Alzheimer\u2019s. But every major drug company has new experimental drugs it hopes will work, particularly if they are started early. The questions though, are who should be getting the drugs and who really has Alzheimer\u2019s or is developing it?\n\nEven at the best medical centers, doctors often are wrong. Twenty percent of people with \u2014 a and intellectual functions \u2014 who received a diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s, did not have it. There was no plaque when their brains were biopsied. Half with milder memory loss, thought to be on their way to Alzheimer\u2019s, do not get the disease. And with such a high rate of misdiagnosis, some who are mistakenly told that they have Alzheimer\u2019s are not treated for conditions, like depression or low levels of thyroid hormone or drug side effects and interactions, that are causing their memory problems.\n\nBrain scans that showed plaque could help with some fundamental questions \u2014 who has or is getting Alzheimer\u2019s, whether the disease ever stops or slows down on its own and even whether plaque is the main culprit causing brain cell death.\n\nDr. Skovronsky thought he had a way to make scans work. He and his team had developed a dye that could get into the brain and stick to plaque. They labeled the dye with a commonly used radioactive tracer and used a PET scanner to directly see plaque in a living person\u2019s brain. But the technology and the dye itself were so new they had to be rigorously tested.\n\nAnd that is what brought Dr. Skovronsky, a thin and eager-looking 37-year-old, to his e-mail that recent day.\n\nFive years ago, Dr. Skovronsky, who named his company Avid in part because that is what he is, had taken a big personal and professional gamble. He left academia and formed Avid Radiopharmaceuticals, based in , to develop his radioactive dye and designed a study with patients to prove it worked.\n\nHospice patients were going to die soon and so, he reasoned, why not ask them to have scans and then brain autopsies afterward to see if the scans showed just what a pathologist would see. Some patients would be demented, others not.\n\nSome predicted his study would be impossible, if not unethical. But the F.D.A. said it wanted proof that the plaque on PET scans was the same as plaque in a brain autopsy.\n\nThe Avid study was designed to provide that proof. And the full results, contained in the e-mail message sent that day, May 14, were the moment of truth. When he saw them, Dr. Skovronsky said they were everything he had hoped for.\n\n\u201cThis is about as good as it gets,\u201d he said that day.\n\nHe went into a rotunda that serves as Avid\u2019s lunchroom to tell the company\u2019s 50 employees. \u201cThis is a big day for us,\u201d he continued. \u201cI thought about what I would say, but I have totally forgotten it.\u201d\n\nHis employees applauded. Then they had champagne in blue plastic cups.\n\nThe type of scans used in this study, PET scans, are expensive and patients have to go to a scanning center, get injected with a radioactive dye, wait for the dye to reach their brain and then have a scan.\n\nOther tests are being studied \u2014 ones that look for amyloid in cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the brain; scans that look for shrinkage of the brain in areas needed for memory and reasoning; PET scans that look for uptake of glucose, a cellular fuel, to show areas where the brain was active and where it was not. The tests, though, were not necessarily specific for Alzheimer\u2019s and none had been studied to see if they accurately predicted plaque on autopsy.\n\nEarlier this decade, two scientists at the developed an amyloid dye that while not practical for widespread use, stunned scientists by showing it seemed possible to see amyloid in a living brain.\n\nThe researchers, Chester Mathis and William Klunk, began their work two decades ago, persevering even though they had no research money. In the first 10 years, they tested more than 400 compounds. When they finally found one that seemed promising, they tested more than 300 variations.\n\n\u201cOn and on it went,\u201d Dr. Mathis said.\n\nFinally, in late 2001, they began working with collaborators in to test their dye in humans.\n\nOn 2002, the Swedish researchers injected the first Alzheimer\u2019s patient with the dye, known as Compound B, and scanned the patient\u2019s brain.\n\nIt worked, the Swedish doctors told Dr. Mathis in an excited phone call.\n\nA PET scan showed amyloid exactly where it would be expected. The Swedish doctors were convinced they were seeing actual plaque. They told Dr. Mathis it was time to celebrate.\n\nBut Dr. Mathis worried. What if the same pattern occurred in people without Alzheimer\u2019s?\n\nTwo weeks later, he got another call from Sweden. His colleagues had scanned a person without Alzheimer\u2019s. There was no sign of telltale plaques.\n\nHis sweet reward came in July 2002, when the scans were shown to an audience of 5,000 scientists at an international conference on Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThere was an audible gasp,\u201d Dr. Mathis said. \u201cThe field was taken aback.\u201d\n\nYet there was a problem. Pittsburgh Compound B used carbon 11 as its radioactive tracer. And its half-life is 20 minutes. Researchers have to make it in a cyclotron in the basement of a medical center, quickly attach it to the dye, dash over to a patient lying in a scanner, and inject it.\n\nAnd a critical question remained: Was a PET scan with the Pittsburgh dye really equivalent to a brain autopsy?\n\nMeanwhile, others, including Dr. Skovronsky, had another idea \u2014 use fluorine 18, with a half-life of about two hours. It could be made in the morning, and used that afternoon. And fluorine 18 is made routinely for two million PET scans each year.\n\nDr. Skovronsky, starting at the and then at Avid, worked with a University of Pennsylvania chemist, Hank Kung, for nine years to find and develop the radioactive dye. The university had the patent; Avid licensed it. Finally, on June 8, 2007, a patient at Johns Hopkins had a scan with their compound. Plaque lit up.\n\nMost of the time, the scans were as expected \u2014 those with Alzheimer\u2019s had lots of plaque, those with normal memories had little if any and those with mild memory impairment were in between.\n\nBut about 20 percent of people over 60 with normal memories had plaque.\n\n\u201cThen we looked more carefully,\u201d Dr. Skovronsky said. \u201cThe 20 percent who had amyloid, though they were still statistically in the normal range, did worse on every memory test than the control group.\u201d\n\nWhat, Dr. Skovronsky asked, did that mean? Were they starting to develop Alzheimer\u2019s? If so, could dementia be stalled if there were drugs to stop amyloid from accumulating?\n\nThe definition of Alzheimer\u2019s is plaque plus memory loss and other symptoms of mental decline. But what is not known because no one could follow the development of plaque before a person died, was whether people with plaque and normal memories were developing Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always assumed the pathology has been there, that the plaque has been there years before symptoms,\u201d said Dr. Steven T. DeKosky, an Alzheimer\u2019s researcher who is vice president and dean at the School of Medicine. \u201cBut we never had a way to detect plaque in living persons,\u201d he said. And so plaque in the brains of people with normal memories has been a puzzle.\n\n\u201cOver the next couple of years, we will find out what it means.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 23, 2008, Avid and two other companies, and , that are developing fluorine 18-based dyes for amyloid scans, got a pointed question from an advisory committee to the F.D.A.: How do you know that what you are seeing on scans is the same as the amyloid you see on autopsy?\n\nIt seemed impossible to answer. If researchers wait for their subjects to die before comparing scans with autopsies they can be waiting a long time.\n\nBut Avid had a plan, and the committee agreed in principle that it would work. Hospice patients would be study subjects, some with dementia, some without. All would have memory tests and brain scans. After death, their brains would be autopsied. Avid suggested that after the first 35 died, there should be enough data to know if the scans gave a true picture of the pathology. Then the F.D.A. could decide if the results were convincing enough to approve the dye for marketing.\n\nSome doctors had misgivings, wondering how they could ask people who were sick and dying to be scanned just to help Alzheimer\u2019s research. But, they found, most patients and their families agreed and said they were grateful to have been asked.\n\nThat was evident on May 19, when Dr. Skovronsky gave a lunch for patients\u2019 families in City, Ariz., to thank them for participating.\n\n\u201cIt really touched my heart to be in this,\u201d said Dorothy Wall, whose husband, Claude E. Wall, died of in Sun City on March 3.\n\n\u201cSomething bad happens, and now something good happens.\u201d\n\nLate last year, Avid saw the initial results of its hospice study \u2014 data from the first six patients. Then, as more patients were studied, the data from them were held by a company that would analyze it. Avid did not see the results until the study was completed. But those first six were encouraging.\n\nA man diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s and cancer had a scan showing no plaque. His autopsy did not show it, either. The diagnosis was wrong. Another man with and dementia had been diagnosed as having dementia solely due to Parkinson\u2019s. His scan showed amyloid. So did the autopsy. He had Alzheimer\u2019s. A woman with mild memory loss had a scan showing no amyloid. Her autopsy also found none. Three others had clinical diagnoses of Alzheimer\u2019s, confirmed by scans and autopsies.\n\nFinally, on May 14, 35 patients had been scanned and autopsied. The Avid study was complete, and the full data will be presented at the meeting next month. Other companies, still doing their studies, did not yet have data to examine.\n\nAnd Dr. Skovronsky got that e-mail message.\n\n\u201cThis is going to have a big impact on Alzheimer\u2019s disease, guys,\u201d he told his staff that day.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "There is one glancing reference to cost. \"The type of scans used in this study, PET scans, are expensive and patients have to go to a scanning center, get injected with a radioactive dye, wait for the dye to reach their brain and then have a scan.\" How expensive?

The third in a series of studies from the Andersen lab involving PD and low-dose lithium, the results add to mounting evidence that low-doses of the psychotropic drug could benefit patients suffering from the incurable, degenerative condition.\n\nThis study, published online in Brain Research, involved Parkinsonian mice that were given Carbidopa/Levodopa (sold as Sinemet\u00ae), a drug used to boost levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is lost in PD. While the medication remains the single most effective agent in the management of PD symptoms, long-term use causes its own side effects, among them abnormal involuntary movements or AIMS. Buck professor and senior scientist Julie Andersen, PhD, says AIMS become problematic for 30 percent of patients after four to six years of treatment with Sinemet, with 90 percent of patients suffering from the complication after nine years of chronic use. \"For patients these side effects are just as devastating as the freezing that is associated with PD.\" \"In our mice we saw significant behavioral improvement.\"\n\nIn this study, Andersen and her team dosed the mice with an amount of lithium equivalent to about a quarter of what humans receive for the treatment of psychiatric diseases. Researchers found that lithium boosted the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase which increases dopamine synthesis via the inhibition of calpain-1, an enzyme that normally reduces dopamine synthesis.\n\nIn earlier studies, Andersen's team found that low-dose lithium was protective in two different mouse models of PD. Treatment in mice with a human mutation for PD began when the animals reached late middle-age, the human equivalent of about 60, which is the average age of onset of Parkinson's in humans. \"We clearly saw a prevention of the motor difficulties we would expect to see in the animals,\" said Andersen. \"The treatment also protected the area of the brain that is normally damaged by Parkinson's.\"\n\nPlans for a clinical trial of low-dose lithium for PD patients are in early stages. \"This study suggests potential therapeutic benefit in PD,\" said David K.

Simon chairs the Scientific Review Committee for the Parkinson's Study Group, a not-for-profit network of Parkinson's Centers. \"One caveat is that other agents that have shown clear efficacy in this model of PD have subsequently failed to show benefit in clinical studies in PD (e.g. CoQ10, creatine, and pioglitazone).

Gains after two years were about the same for Eylea and Lucentis (ranibizumab), contrary to year-one results from the study, which showed Eylea with a clear advantage. The three drugs yielded similar gains in vision for patients with 20/32 or 20/40 vision at the start of treatment. The clinical trial was conducted by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net), which is funded by the National Eye Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health.\n\n\u201cThis rigorous trial confirms that Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis are all effective treatments for diabetic macular edema,\u201d said NEI Director Paul A. Sieving, M.D., Ph.D. \u201cEye care providers and patients can have confidence in all three drugs.\u201d\n\nEylea, Avastin, and Lucentis are all widely used to treat DME, a consequence of diabetes that can cause blurring of central vision due to the leakage of fluid from abnormal blood vessels in the retina. The macula is the area of the retina used when looking straight ahead. The drugs are injected into the eye and work by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a substance that can promote abnormal blood vessel growth and leakage. Although the drugs have a similar mode of action, they differ significantly in cost. Based on Medicare allowable charges, the per-injection costs of each drug at the doses used in this study were about $1850 for Eylea, about $60 for Avastin, and about $1200 for Lucentis.\n\nDRCR.net investigators enrolled 660 people with DME at 89 clinical trial sites across the United States. When the study began, participants on average were 61 years old with 17 years of type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Only people with a visual acuity of 20/32 or worse were eligible to participate (to see clearly, a person with 20/32 vision would have to be 20 feet away from an object that a person with normal vision could see clearly at 32 feet). At enrollment, about half the participants had 20/32 to 20/40 vision. The other half had 20/50 or worse vision. In many states, a corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better in at least one eye is required for a driver\u2019s license that allows both day- and nighttime driving.\n\nEach participant was assigned randomly to receive Eylea (2.0 milligrams/0.05 milliliter), Avastin (1.25 mg/0.05 mL), or Lucentis (0.3 mg/0.05 mL). Participants were evaluated monthly during the first year and every 4-16 weeks during the second year. Most participants received monthly injections during the first six months. Thereafter, participants received additional injections of assigned study drug until DME resolved or stabilized with no further vision improvement. Subsequently, injections were resumed if DME worsened. Additionally, laser treatment was given if DME persisted without continual improvement after six months of injections. Laser treatment alone was the standard treatment for DME until widespread adoption of anti-VEGF drugs a few years ago.\n\nAmong participants with 20/40 or better vision at the trial\u2019s start, all three drugs improved vision similarly on an eye chart. On average, participants\u2019 vision improved from 20/40 vision to 20/25.\n\nAmong participants with 20/50 or worse vision at the trial\u2019s start, visual acuity on average improved substantially in all three groups. At two years, Eylea participants were able to read about 3.5 additional lines on an eye chart; Lucentis participants were able to read about three additional lines, and Avastin participants improved about 2.5 lines, compared with visual acuity before treatment. Eylea outperformed Avastin at the one- and two-year time points. While Eylea outperformed Lucentis at the one-year time point, by the two-year time point gains in visual acuity were statistically no different. At the end of the trial, average visual acuity was 20/32 to 20/40 among participants in all three groups.\n\n\u201cThe results of the DRCR Network\u2019s comparison of Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis will help doctors and their patients with diabetic macular edema choose the most appropriate therapy,\u201d said John A. Wells, M.D., the lead author of the study and a retinal specialist at the Palmetto Retina Center, Columbia, South Carolina. \u201cThe study suggests there is little advantage of choosing Eylea or Lucentis over Avastin when a patient\u2019s loss of visual acuity from macular edema is mild, meaning a visual acuity of 20/40 or better. However, patients with 20/50 or worse vision loss may benefit from Eylea, which over the course of the two-year study outperformed Lucentis and Avastin.\u201d\n\nThe number of injections participants needed was about the same for all three treatment groups. Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis participants on average required nine injections in the first year of the study and five in the second year.\n\nThe need for laser treatment varied among the three treatment groups. By two years, 41 percent of participants in the Eylea group received laser treatment to treat their macular edema, compared with 64 percent of participants in the Avastin group and 52 percent in the Lucentis group.\n\nThe risk of heart attack, stroke, or death from a cardiovascular condition or an unknown cause by end of the trial was higher among participants in the Lucentis group. Twelve percent of Lucentis participants had at least one event, compared with five percent of participants in the Eylea group and eight percent of participants in the Avastin group. This difference in cardiovascular rates has not been seen across all other studies, and therefore may be due to chance. Continued assessment of these serious cardiovascular events and their association with these drugs is important in future studies. Cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke are common complications of diabetes. The occurrence of eye complications, such as eye infections and inflammation, was similar for all three drugs.\n\nResults of the study were published online today in Ophthalmology, the journal of the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

Research is urgently needed to improve detection and treatment and to save lives. The findings of this project will play a crucial role in these efforts going forward.\n\nFunded by the Bowel Disease Research Foundation (BDRF) charity, the work has been published in the Lancet Oncology journal.\n\nThe study worked with data on more than 10,000 patients, examining whether current methods of checking if anal cancer has spread to lymph nodes are giving experts an accurate picture of survival rates. The research team was led from Manchester, working hand in hand with centres in Leeds and Switzerland.\n\nAnal cancer that has spread to lymph nodes is linked to a worse prognosis and lower chance of survival.\n\nThe project's findings however have uncovered a phenomenon suggesting rates of lymph node spread are being overestimated, potentially leading to overtreatment of patients with chemo radiotherapy.\n\nThis can result in damaging side-effects, and doctors are particularly keen to avoid it in cases where it offers little benefit to the patient at potentially great cost.\n\nThe results will be crucial to future large scale trials looking at optimum care for anal cancer patients. By identifying a unique phenomenon, these results will be taken into account by future work and ultimately could lead to better diagnosis of tumour stage and thus better treatment.\n\nChristie consultant and University of Manchester Professor of Cancer Studies and Surgery, Andrew Renehan, leads the Manchester Cancer Research Centre (MCRC) Anorectal Organ Preservation Research Group.

The trial was funded by Pfizer.\n\nWomen in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group took a median of 9.5 months to progress, as measured by CT and MRI scans, compared with 4.6 months in the placebo group.\n\nSome 67 per cent of the 347 women in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group showed clinical benefit - either a reduction in tumour size or control of disease for at least six months - compared with 40 per cent of the 174 women in the placebo plus fulvestrant group.\n\nSome 19 per cent in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group had a decrease in tumour size compared with 9 per cent in the placebo plus fulvestrant group.\n\nThe study also aimed to assess whether cancers with particular genetic traits responded less well or better to the combination than others.\n\nMutations to the gene PIK3CA represent the most common genetic event in breast cancer, and mutations in the gene are associated with a shorter response to hormone therapy.\n\nThe research showed that using 'liquid biopsies' that measure cancer DNA circulating in the blood to detect PIK3CA, and tests for blood hormone levels, the palbociclib combination worked in all types of hormone-receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer.\n\nPalbociclib is a first-in-class drug - with a different mechanism of action to other approved drugs - which simultaneously blocks two proteins called CDK4 and CDK6 in cancer cells. It causes less severe side-effects than traditional chemotherapy.\n\nIn the trial, severe side-effects caused by the combination were rare. Many women (81 per cent on the palbociclib arm) had a drop in their white blood cell count, but this rarely led to serious symptoms.\n\nStudy co-lead author Dr Nicolas Turner, Team Leader in Molecular Oncology at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and Consultant Medical Oncologist at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, said:\n\n\"Our research underlines the effectiveness of palbociclib with fulvestrant in metastatic breast cancer and, importantly, demonstrates its benefit in all types of hormone-receptor positive breast cancer. We hope our results lead to the adoption of this drug combination in breast cancer, where it delays the need to start chemotherapy by an average of nine months.\n\n\"Our study also sends a powerful message that in combining new drugs in innovative trials we can find better options for women with advanced breast cancer. Chemotherapy can add several months to life but it comes at a cost of often life-limiting side effects, and we need alternative treatments that are better tolerated to treat patients with advanced breast cancer.\"\n\nProfessor Paul Workman, Chief Executive of The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said:\n\n\"If we're going to drive further improvements in survival from cancer, it's essential that we find ways of prolonging life in people whose cancers have evolved and become resistant to treatment. This trial is an exciting example of one of the most promising approaches to overcoming drug resistance, by combining drugs with different mechanisms of action to block off cancer's escape routes. It's very encouraging to see such substantial delays to cancer progression.\"\n\nFor more information please contact Henry French on 020 7153 5582 or henry.french@icr.ac.uk.

He's a professor of anesthesiology at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.\n\nThe dorsal root ganglions are nerve cells, on both sides of each of the spine's vertebra, and are the gateway to pain between nerves in different parts of the body, spinal cord and brain. Stimulating this area interrupts pain signals between the painful area and the brain, the researchers explained.\n\nA pacemaker-like device implanted under the skin in the lower back sends small electronic pulses through a wire placed near the specific dorsal root ganglion associated with the pain, McCarthy said.\n\nThe pulses replace pain with tingling or numbness. The strength of stimulation, programmed by a doctor, is based on the patient's level of pain, he said.\n\nThe treatment has two advantages over spinal cord stimulation, McCarthy said. In spinal cord stimulation, a wire runs along the spinal cord sending pulses along the entire spine, but the pulses don't target the specific pain source.\n\nIn addition, dorsal root ganglion stimulation requires significantly lower levels of electric current to quell pain, McCarthy said.\n\nThe goal of this study, he said, was to judge the effectiveness of the therapy over a long period. McCarthy and his colleagues implanted the device in 67 people suffering with chronic back pain and followed them for three to 18 months. Among the participants, 17 had the device for over a year.\n\nBefore receiving the device, most patients rated their pain as an 8 on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being the worst. For most patients, the device reduced pain by 33 percent, which was significant, the researchers reported.\n\nIn addition, patients said they experienced a 27 percent reduction in disability or limitations on daily activities caused by pain. In all, 94 percent of the participants said the treatment was beneficial.\n\nThe procedure was not without complications. Five patients needed to have the wires implanted again, two patients had them removed because they were infected, and one had the device removed because of a complication.\n\nMcCarthy said the therapy is not widely available, even though it was approved by the FDA in 2016. At the moment, its use is confined to more advanced medical centers where doctors have been trained in how to implant and regulate the device.\n\nAlso, the procedure isn't covered by all insurance companies, so out-of-pocket costs to patients can be very high. It is, however, covered by Medicare, he said.\n\nFor uninsured patients, the cost of having spine stimulation devices can range from $15,000 to $50,000 or more, according to a 2008 report funded by the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries.\n\nSpine stimulation is usually approved only after patients have not responded to other treatment, according to Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other insurance companies may have varying policies.\n\nMcCarthy hopes that more doctors will be trained in the procedure and that it will become more available, especially because it has the potential to allow patients to stop taking opioids to control their pain.\n\nOne pain specialist not involved with the study saw the benefits of this procedure.\n\n\"The results of this study are very significant,\" said Dr. Kiran Patel, director of neurosurgical pain at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\nIt shows long-term data that patients experienced significant pain relief and functional improvements, she said.\n\n\"In my pain practice and career, dorsal root ganglion stimulation therapy has been one of the most effective technologies available to combat chronic pain,\" Patel said.\n\n\"I encourage chronic pain patients to seek out physicians who are trained and experienced in the application of dorsal root ganglion stimulation therapy to determine if they are a candidate,\" she said.\n\nThe findings were presented Sunday at the American Society of Anesthesiologists annual meeting, in San Francisco.

For an average black or white male of the same age, the corresponding risks would be about 1.4 percent and 5.8 percent.\n\nIn the new study from Denmark, taking low-dose aspirin continuously for at least five years appeared to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer by 27%, and using nonaspirin NSAIDs for at least five years appeared to reduce it by 30%.\n\nOn the other hand, merely having taken aspirin did not alter the colorectal cancer risk, they reported in Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\n\u201cUnless low-dose aspirin is taken continuously, there is little protection against colorectal cancer,\u201d Dr. Soren Friis from the Danish Cancer Society Research Center in Copenhagen told Reuters Health.\n\nNonaspirin NSAIDs were also protective against colorectal cancer with consistent long-term use, \u201cand there was some indication that even non-continuous use of these agents may be (marginally) effective for the prevention of colorectal cancer,\u201d Dr. Friis said.\n\nAspirin and NSAIDs carry their own risks, however. Long-term use can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, for example, so the potential reduction in colon cancer risk needs to be balanced against potential side effects, the authors warn.\n\nThe study had several limitations. For instance, the researchers only had data for users who obtained their aspirin or NSAIDs from doctors\u2019 prescriptions. They didn\u2019t include patients who made over-the-counter purchases of the medicines. Also, the researchers can\u2019t rule out the possibility that other factors may have increased participants\u2019 risk for colorectal cancer, such as obesity, dietary habits, alcohol use, and family history of colorectal cancer.\n\nDr. Friis emphasized that people should not start taking aspirin or NSAIDs on the basis of the new findings.\n\n\u201cSelf-medication with aspirin or non-aspirin NSAIDs is strongly discouraged, due to the possibility of serious adverse events,\u201d Dr. Friis said. \u201cThe public should not take any medication regularly without consulting with a physician.\u201d\n\nDr. Gurpreet Singh Ranger from Upper River Valley Hospital, Waterville, New Brunswick and Dalhousie Medical School, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, agreed with Dr. Friis.\n\n\u201cLow dose aspirin, already taken regularly by millions, reduces the risk of colorectal cancer,\u201d he told Reuters Health by email. But \u201cbefore starting to take aspirin long term, it is important to discuss the implications with your family doctor or specialist.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "No mention was made of costs, but anyone who has been to a drugstore knows that aspirin is cheap.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "Bone-health experts are making a new push to reduce rates of osteoporosis, with a particular focus on controlling the bone-wasting disease in men.\n\nAn important goal is to get greater numbers of men to be tested for osteoporosis when they come to a hospital or clinic with a fracture to the wrist, vertebrae or other bones that wasn\u2019t from a major accident or trauma.

But when they\u2019re linked to a practice that started in Finland decades ago to help babies sleep safely, they\u2019re taking on a new purpose as so-called baby boxes make their way to the U.S.\n\nParents are beginning to take baby boxes home from hospitals along with their newborns. A Los Angeles-based company has partnered with health officials to give the boxes away for free and an online initiative offers advice aimed at reducing sudden unexpected infant deaths. New Jersey and Ohio were the first to participate statewide in the program.\n\n\u2018\u2018To new moms: (SUID) was one of my biggest fears and then it happened,\u2019\u2019 said 35-year-old Chauntia Williams, of Maple Heights, Ohio.\n\nWilliams is an advocate for safe sleeping and the boxes after she unexpectedly lost her 33-day-old daughter Aaliyah nine years ago. Williams said her daughter went to sleep in a crib with cushiony bumpers, stuffed animals and an added blanket beneath the fitted sheet and never woke up. She said the coroner determined the bedding caused the death.\n\nShe now uses a box with her son, Bryce, though he\u2019s getting a little too big for it. Her message to new parents: Educate yourselves on safe sleep habits.\n\n\u2018\u2018Open your mouth and say I\u2019m concerned about this so you can get the assistance,\u2019\u2019 Williams said.\n\nSudden unexpected infant death is a broad category that includes sudden infant death syndrome and accidental suffocation and strangulation that could come from overcrowded bassinets or cribs. The boxes aren\u2019t the only option for safe sleeping, of course, but health officials say they\u2019re a useful part of a broader safe-sleep education program.\n\nOhio on Wednesday joined New Jersey in offering the cardboard boxes, which double as bassinets, for free. Each box comes filled with a mattress, fitted sheet, onesie and diapers.\n\nThe Baby Box Co. is also handing out the boxes in Minneapolis, Phoenix and San Francisco, with the goal of expanding to all 50 states. The for-profit company also operates in Canada, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Baby Box University, Baby Box Co.\u2019s educational platform, maintains a website that coordinates the educational component of the program.\n\nThe idea for baby boxes started in Finland in the 1930s, and is tied to a sharp drop in sudden infant deaths, according to Dr. Kathryn McCans, a pediatrician who chairs New Jersey\u2019s Child Fatality and Near Fatality Review Board. The boxes provide a clutter-free sleep space that has been shown to reduce accidental and unexpected deaths, she said.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the U.S. rate of sudden unexpected infant deaths has been declining since the 1990s when public health officials began recommending parents put infants to sleep on their backs. About 3,700 sudden unexpected infant deaths were reported in the country in 2015.\n\nThe boxes are a new idea for many Americans.\n\n\u2018\u2018The thought of putting the baby in a box, I was like \u2018wow that\u2019s weird,\u2019\u2019\u2019 said Dolores Peterson, of Camden, New Jersey, who became a first-time mom recently and was among the first to bring home a box.\n\nPeterson\u2019s daughter, Ariabella, just turned 3 months old. She said the program was eye-opening for how much information she learned about how to prevent sudden unexpected infant death.\n\nMcCans says the complimentary items like diapers and onesies are nice, but the more important objective behind the boxes is bringing down infant deaths and grounding parents on safe sleep practices: Place babies on their backs to sleep; Don\u2019t use bumpers in cribs; Keep stuffed animals and blankets out of infants\u2019 sleep spaces; Avoid sleeping in the same bed as infants.\n\n\u2018\u2018No one brings their baby into bed with them because they want their baby to die,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018They do it because they want to be nurturing and they are, but it\u2019s not safe.\u2019\u2019\n\nTo get the boxes, prospective moms can register through babyboxuniversity.com, watch a handful of videos on sleep safety and pass a quiz.

Doctors had ruled out a heart attack and ordered an angiogram to check for blockages in his coronary arteries. If one was found, he would undergo angioplasty, which involves placement of a metal stent to prop open the artery.\n\nShortly before the procedure, Ramesh Mazhari, the interventional cardiologist assigned to Longnecker's case, asked an unexpected question. Instead of the usual approach, in which a catheter is inserted in the groin and threaded up the large femoral artery, would Longnecker agree to Mazhari's preferred method: accessing the heart through the smaller radial artery on the underside of the wrist?\n\n\"I said, 'If you're confident doing it, fine,' \" recalled Longnecker, 70, former chairman of anesthesiology and critical care at the University of Pennsylvania. A member of the Institute of Medicine and a director of the Association of American Medical Colleges, Longnecker said he had never seen catheterization performed in this manner, and few of his physician friends who are not cardiologists had heard of it.\n\nThat is likely to change. A small but growing cadre of cardiac specialists, among them Mazhari, are embracing the newer approach, convinced it is more comfortable and safer for many patients than femoral access, the standard for more than three decades. Some recent studies have found the approach has a lower rate of complications, including severe bleeding, than femoral procedures.\n\nOnly 1 percent of the 1.2 million cardiac catheterizations performed annually in the United States are done through the wrist; the newer approach is often preferred for patients who are extremely obese or have poor leg circulation. But in Europe, Canada and Japan, about 50 percent of catheterizations are performed using the technique devised in the early 1990s. The approach allows patients to sit up immediately afterward and even walk, an impossibility in femoral procedures, which require that they lie flat on their backs for several hours to prevent severe bleeding.\n\nBecause patients tend to recover faster, Mazhari said, she discharges some patients the same day, avoiding an expensive overnight hospital stay.\n\nQuestions about the best method of performing cardiac catheterizations, one of the most common procedures in medicine and among the most profitable for hospitals -- Medicare reimburses GWU about $10,600 for an angioplasty involving one stent -- reflect some of the issues in the roiling health-care debate. Is the radial approach, which has a steep learning curve, actually superior or largely a fad? Can it cut costs by reducing hospital stays? And if patients are given a choice of catheterization sites, what factors should they consider?\n\n\"I think there is a reluctance among physicians who are used to doing procedures a certain way\" to change, said Mazhari, who learned to do the procedure last year and uses it about 80 percent of the time. She and others say they know of no other physician in the Washington area who favors the radial approach.\n\nIn Boston, a city brimming with teaching hospitals and interventional cardiologists -- heart specialists with advanced training who perform procedures -- only a handful of physicians specialize in radial catheterization, said Pinak B. Shah, director of interventional cardiology training at Brigham and Women's Hospital.\n\n\"There's no data out there to suggest it is worse and growing evidence that it may be better,\" said Shah, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, who performs 60 to 70 percent of procedures through the wrist.\n\nShah said he believes a combination of financial self-interest, the relative paucity of medical devices designed for radial access, resistance by older physicians and the general tendency of doctors to regard patient discomfort as secondary have contributed to under-use of the approach.\n\nSome senior interventional cardiologists say they worry that the method may be hyped.\n\n\"I think it's a good procedure in the right hands for the right reasons,\" said Bryan Raybuck, director of the cardiac catheterization lab at the Inova Heart and Vascular Institute in Fairfax. Raybuck, who learned to perform the procedure in Quebec 12 years ago, estimates he uses it fewer than two dozen times annually, and only when circumstances require it.\n\n\"There's a lot of buzz about this right now,\" he said of radial procedures, which account for about 150 of the 8,000 cardiac catheterizations done at his hospital annually. \"I don't think it's worth going across the river to do it. It's not that good.\"\n\nWilliam O. Suddath, an interventional cardiologist at Washington Hospital Center, home to the area's busiest cardiac catheterization lab, said doctors there also prefer the femoral approach, which has benefited from improvements in devices used to stop bleeding. \"There's an inherent conservatism in medicine for many reasons,\" he said.\n\nSuddath said he is concerned about the \"tremendous amount of competition going on in centers around the country.\" And he worries that radial procedures are being used as a \"marketing ploy\" by some hospitals \"to lure patients to particular cath labs.\"\n\nShah is familiar with such skepticism. \"I think the people who pooh-pooh it don't spend the time learning how to do it,\" said Shah, who has performed more than 250 radial procedures in the two years since he trained to do them in Canada.\n\nIn the cath lab, he noted, \"time is money\" and radial procedures are \"among the most challenging things we do.\" Until doctors achieve proficiency, they can be agonizingly slow; the fee remains the same, whether a case takes 30 minutes or five hours. Shah said it took him 50 cases \"before a lot of the butterflies in my stomach had flown away.\" Some doctors say it takes 100 cases to achieve true proficiency.\n\nOne reason for the greater difficulty is anatomical. The femoral artery, approximately the width of a pinkie, presents a direct route to the heart; to a physician, it's a straight stretch of freeway that can be navigated easily. The radial artery is thinner and offers a much more circuitous path, more like driving on a two-lane mountain road with frequent switchbacks.\n\n\"You have to be very patient and very meticulous,\" Mazhari said.\n\nSevere bleeding is a feared complication in femoral procedures; the risk of a major complication is 1 to 3 percent. Arterial spasms top the list of radial complications. They are most common, Shah said, in \"little old ladies,\" who tend to have small arteries that can clamp shut. \"There are some horror stories about that,\" he said.\n\nShah and Mazhari say that their patients, many of whom have undergone both kinds of catheterizations, much prefer the wrist approach.\n\n\"We've got a lot of repeat customers, unfortunately,\" Shah said. Lying flat and motionless for two to six hours while recovering, he said, can be hard for patients with bad backs, and many older men find it difficult to urinate in this position.\n\nWilliam Sanford, who underwent angioplasty in April, was thrilled not to be among them.\n\n\"I could get right up and go to the bathroom,\" said Sanford, 64, who lives in Silver Spring and was taken by ambulance to GWU after suffering chest pain while working the night shift as a maintenance supervisor in the Capitol. \"I was so surprised at how easy it was and how comfortable it was.\"\n\nTwo recent studies that compared the approaches found a lower rate of serious complications among patients undergoing radial procedures.\n\nA report in the August 2008 Journal of the American College of Cardiology: Cardiovascular Interventions compared outcome data for more than 593,000 procedures -- 7,800 of them radial -- performed between 2004 and 2007 at 606 hospitals.\n\nLed by Sunil V. Rao at the Duke Clinical Research Institute, the authors found that outcomes were similar but that bleeding complications were 58 percent lower in the wrist group. The reduction was most pronounced among high-risk patients, including women and those over 75.\n\n\"These data support the efficiency and safety [of radial surgery] . . . and suggest that wider application of the radial approach may enhance the safety of coronary intervention,\" the researchers concluded.\n\nIn the January issue of American Heart Journal, a meta-analysis of 28 years of studies, some of them conducted in Europe and Canada, found a 73 percent reduction in bleeding and shorter hospitals stay among radial patients.\n\nLongnecker, who lives in Annapolis, said that for him, the benefit is clear.\n\nFour years ago he underwent a spinal procedure that was performed through the femoral artery. \"Afterward I had to lie flat for eight hours with five- or six-pound sandbags on the site\" to prevent bleeding, he recalled. His groin was black and blue for two weeks.\n\nAfter his radial angioplasty, he was allowed to sit up immediately and walk. A clear wristband equipped with a small inflatable balloon was affixed to his wrist to close the artery. It was removed after about eight hours and replaced by a simple bandage.\n\n\"It was remarkably more comfortable and less constraining,\" Longnecker said. \"All that remained the next day was a little red dot. My wrist felt fine. I could have played tennis.\n\n\"If somebody offered me the option of having a procedure radially or femorally,\" Longnecker said, \"I would make the decision before their sentence was finished.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story mentions that using the wrist may better enable patients to avoid an \"expensive overnight hospital stay\" and that Medicare reimbursement was the same even though this route for catheterization may involve more physician time.

", "answer": 1}, {"article": "(PHILADELPHIA) -- When patients present with neurologic symptoms such as severe headaches or seizures, the symptoms could suggest anything from infection, cancer, or an autoimmune disease of the brain or spinal cord, leaving physicians scrambling to find the cause in a short amount of time. The differences in diagnosis can mean having mere hours to act or being able to take days or weeks to devise a treatment plan. Now, researchers at Jefferson (Philadelphia University + Thomas Jefferson University) have developed a test that could rapidly parse out infections of the brain from other diseases. The diagnostic could prove particularly useful in infants and young children.\n\n\u201cWe have many tests for making diagnoses, but the ones that conclusively indicate infection can often take more time than we\u2019d like, especially in cases of childhood meningitis or encephalitis,\u201d said Mark Curtis, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Pathology, Anatomy and Cell Biology, who also works as a hospital pathologist. \u201cOnce confirmed with additional research, our test could provide a first, rapid and less invasive way to look at what\u2019s happening in the brain and guide treatment or further testing.\u201d\n\nThe results were published in the journal PLOS ONE on October 31st.\n\nRather than testing for the presence of bacteria or virus, the researchers looked at the first tell-tale signs of infection: the cytokines produced by the patient\u2019s immune system in response to pathogens and other injury processes. \u201cCytokines are an alarm system in the body,\u201d said Dr. Curtis. \u201cInfectious agents activate a multi-pronged inflammatory response, a key component of which is the release of different combinations of cytokines tailored to combat pathogens. Changes in cytokine levels of cerebrospinal fluid offer a very early measurable sign of infection.\u201d\n\nDr. Curtis and colleagues decided to see if they could detect patterns within the cytokines that might differentiate infections from other brain diseases or disorders. In the retrospective analysis, the investigators looked at samples collected from 43 patients who had received spinal taps during their hospital stays. The researchers then tested the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) for the presence of 41 different cytokines and noticed that patients with confirmed infection of the central nervous system had a different cytokine fingerprint from those confirmed as having tumors or autoimmune disease. This suggested the test could be used to tell the conditions apart.\n\nAdditionally, within the patients identified with central nervous system infections, the CSF cytokine fingerprint was different in cases of viral infection compared to those with non-viral pathogens, such as bacteria or fungi.\n\n\u201cWith only a small amount of spinal fluid needed, CSF cytokine analysis could be used as one of the first diagnostic tests to rapidly triage serious central nervous system disorders and guide immediate intervention,\u201d said first author, Danielle Fortuna, MD, an Assistant Professor, in the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nWorldwide, meningitis and encephalitis affect more than four million adults and children each year. \u201cInfants and young children have an especially high risk of meningitis and encephalitis and the related, often serious sequelae,\u201d said Dr. Curtis. \u201cBeing able to rapidly identify a central nervous system disorder as infectious can be crucial in rapid response.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition, the test could distinguish viral from non-viral infections, a distinction that could spare a child with a viral infection from an unnecessary course of antibiotics, and tailor the care toward antiviral and supportive measures as needed,\u201d said Dr. Curtis. \u201cMoving forward, our goal is to formally validate our findings with a larger sample size that includes both adults and children for future use in the clinical arena.\u201d\n\nArticle reference: Danielle Fortuna, D Craig Hooper, Amity L Roberts, Larry A Harshyne, Michelle Nagurney, Mark T Curtis, \u201cPotential role of CSF cytokine profiles in discriminating infectious from non-infectious CNS disorders,\u201d PLOS ONE, DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0205501, 2018.", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "No costs for the test are mentioned, but a lumbar puncture can cost anywhere from about $600 to more than $2,000, with a \u201cfair price\u201d being about $1,000, according to Healthcare Bluebook.

(February 17, 2016) - U.S. children are not consuming enough vegetables, resulting in an inadequate intake of key nutrients, including potassium and dietary fiber, which are important for growth, development and overall health. Research published (January 2016) in a special supplement of the peer-reviewed journal Advances in Nutrition demonstrated that children ages 1-3 years of age consumed just 67 percent of the dietary reference intakes (DRI) for potassium and 55 percent of the DRI for fiber.\n\nAn overarching conclusion from the various papers included in the supplement, \"Science and Policy: Adopting a Fruitful Vegetable Encounter for Our Children,\" is that potatoes are a vegetable that tend to be well-liked by young children and are a good source of potassium and provide 8 percent of the recommended daily value of fiber. In fact, a study of elementary school students demonstrated that students are not consuming the majority of vegetables offered to them in school lunches. However, plate waste for white potatoes was the lowest among any type of vegetables; thus, including potatoes in school meals is one important way to help ensure children receive those key nutrients of concern.\n\n\"It's important that consumption of all vegetables, particularly those that are good sources of potassium and dietary fiber, be encouraged in children,\" says Theresa A.

EDT ) - Cardiac stem cell infusions could someday help reverse the aging process in the human heart, making older ones behave younger, according to a new study from the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute.\n\n\"Our previous lab studies and human clinical trials have shown promise in treating heart failure using cardiac stem cell infusions,\" said Eduardo Marb\u00e1n, MD, PhD, director of the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute and the primary investigator of the study. \"Now we find that these specialized stem cells could turn out to reverse problems associated with aging of the heart.\"\n\nThe study was published today by the European Heart Journal.\n\nIn the study, investigators injected cardiosphere-derived cells, a specific type of stem cell, from newborn laboratory rats into the hearts of rats with an average age of 22 months, which is considered aged. Other laboratory rats from the same age group were assigned to receive placebo treatment, saline injections instead of stem cells. Both groups of aged rats were compared to a group of young rats with an average age of 4 months.\n\nBaseline heart function was measured in all rats, using echocardiograms, treadmill stress tests and blood analysis. The group of older rats underwent an additional round of testing one month after receiving cardiosphere-derived cells that came from young rats.\n\n\"The way the cells work to reverse aging is fascinating,\" Marb\u00e1n said. \"They secrete tiny vesicles that are chock-full of signaling molecules such as RNA and proteins. The vesicles from young cells appear to contain all the needed instructions to turn back the clock.\"\n\nResults of those tests show lab rats that received the cardiosphere-derived cells:\n\u2022 Demonstrated longer heart cell telomeres, compound structures located at the ends of chromosomes that shrink with age\n\u2022 Improved their exercise capacity by an average of approximately 20 percent\n\u2022 Regrew hair faster than rats that didn't receive the cells\n\n\"This study didn't measure whether receiving the cardiosphere-derived cells extended lifespans, so we have a lot more work to do,\" said Lilian Grigorian-Shamagian, MD, PhD, co-primary investigator and the first author of the study. \"We have much to study, including whether CDCs need to come from a young donor to have the same rejuvenating effects and whether the extracellular vesicles are able to reproduce all the rejuvenating effects we detect with CDCs.\"\n\nSince Marb\u00e1n's team completed the world's first cardiac stem cell infusion in 2009, the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute has made significant contributions to decoding and understanding how cardiac stem cells regenerate damaged heart muscle. The team is studying the use of stem cells to treat patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy as well as patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, a condition that affects more than 50 percent of all heart failure patients.\n\nGeneral support for Marb\u00e1n's laboratory is provided by the National Institutes of Health. The CDCs, manufactured by Capricor Inc. (NASDAQ: CAPR) as their product CAP-1002, have been used in other human clinical trials.\n\nThe process to grow cardiac-derived stem cells was developed by Marb\u00e1n when he was on the faculty of Johns Hopkins University and further developed at Cedars-Sinai. Capricor has licensed the process from Johns Hopkins and from Cedars-Sinai for clinical and commercial development.

Cytology-based screening, known as the Pap test or Pap smear, is used to detect abnormal cells. The Pap test can also find noncancerous conditions, such as infections and inflammation.\n\nCervical cancer screening guidelines have changed dramatically over the last 15 years, following introduction of testing for the dozen high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types that cause virtually all cervical cancer and its precursors. Despite more research into HPV, and the introduction of preventive HPV vaccines, screening will remain important and comprise many millions of tests annually for decades to come. But improved screening methods have also introduced some confusion, even controversy.\n\nHPV testing is more sensitive than the Pap test for detecting precancer. The HPV test captures the known cancer causing viruses, but there are gynecologists who believe that there may be unknown cancer causing viruses and so continue to do the Pap smear (plus HPV testing).\n\nHowever, reports of rare HPV-negative, Pap-test-positive cancers are motivating continued use of both tests (cotesting) despite increased testing costs. An HPV test, in which doctors test a cervicovaginal specimen for the presence of the nucleic acids of carcinogenic types of HPV, is more sensitive than the Pap test (a microscopic examination of exfoliated cells) for detection of precancers. Thus, if a single screening method were chosen to complement HPV vaccination, primary HPV testing likely would gradually supplant the Pap test.\n\nIn the US, an interim guidance issued by a committee of experts from several clinical societies recommended primary HPV testing every three years, the same as the Pap test. Alternatively, current guidelines recommend cotesting but, in recognition of the additional reassurance provided by this approach compared with the Pap test alone, the screening interval is extended to every five years. Draft guidelines from the US Preventive Services Task Force recently recommended either primary HPV testing every five years or the Pap test every three years for women 30 to 64, and did not recommend cotesting.\n\nThe accumulated evidence supports inclusion of HPV testing in screening; thus, the main choice moving forward is between cotesting and primary HPV testing alone.\n\nResearchers were searching for realistic performance data to quantify the additional benefit of the Pap test component of cotesting, as the costs of intensive screening of all women using two screening tests are substantial.\n\nIn January 2003, just prior to US FDA approval of HPV and Pap test cotesting in mid-2003 and interim guidelines in 2004, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large integrated health care organization, introduced three-year cotesting in women aged 30 years and older. Kaiser Permanente has now screened over a million women by cotesting. This remains the most extensive experience of HPV testing incorporated into routine screening in the world.\n\nResearchers here quantified the detection of cervical precancer and cancer by cotesting compared with HPV testing alone at Kaiser Permanente, where 1,208,710 women have undergone triennial cervical cotesting since 2003. Screening histories preceding cervical cancers (n=623) and precancers (n=5,369) were examined to assess the relative contribution of the Pap test and HPV test components in identifying cases.\n\nThe analysis found that HPV testing identified more women subsequently diagnosed with cancer and precancer than the Pap test. HPV testing was statistically significantly more likely to be positive for cancer at any time point, except within 12 months. HPV-negative/ Pap test-positive results preceded only small fractions of cases of precancer (3.5%) and cancer (5.9%); these cancers were more likely to be regional or distant stage than other cases.\n\nGiven the rarity of cancers among screened women, the contribution of the Pap test to screening translated to earlier detection of at most five cases per million women per year. Two-thirds (67.9%) of women found to have cancer up to 10 years of follow-up at Kaiser Permanente were detected by the first cotest performed.\n\nThe researchers conclude that the added sensitivity of cotesting versus HPV alone for detection of treatable cancer affected extremely few women.?\n\nThe paper \"Relative Performance of HPV and Cytology Components of Cotesting in Cervical Screening\" is available at: https:/\n\nTo request a copy of the study, please contact: Daniel Luzer\n\n daniel.luzer@oup.com", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The release includes the idea of costs, but without using any numbers.

HER2 has been established as a therapeutic target in breast cancer, and breast cancers in which the HER2 gene is not amplified do not, in general, respond to HER2-directed therapeutic approaches.\n\nA few years ago, when the research teams of Dr. Matthew Ellis and others carried out a molecular characterization of breast cancer tumors, they found a new mutation in HER2 that was different from gene amplification but also resulted in tyrosine kinase being constantly activated.\n\n\"In this particular activation mechanism, the cells develop a subtle mutation within the functional part of the HER2 gene that activates the enzyme,\" said Ellis, professor and director of the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center, part of the National Cancer Institute-designated Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center at Baylor College of Medicine. \"The mutation locks the enzyme into an 'on' position.\"\n\nEllis and his colleagues developed a preclinical model to study this new HER2 mutation and discovered that the enhanced enzymatic activity could trigger tumor formation. Furthermore, these tumor cells were sensitive to an experimental drug, neratinib. With this information in hand, the researchers took the next step.\n\n\"We launched a phase II clinical trial of neratinib in patients with metastatic breast cancer carrying a HER2 mutation,\" Ellis said. \"Finding patients that are positive for a HER2 mutation required a national collaboration because we had to screen hundreds of patients to identify the 2 to 3 percent that have a tumor driven by a HER2 mutation. The results of the clinical trial were encouraging in that about 30 percent of the 16 patients treated with neratinib had a meaningful clinical response showing significant disease stabilization or regression. Neratinib was well tolerated by most patients.\"\n\n\"This is the first time we had a reasonable number of patients treated for HER2 mutations in whom we could estimate the response rate.\"\n\nThe number of patients who could potentially benefit from this new treatment approach is estimated to be in the thousands. The researchers estimate that as many as 200,000 patients are likely to be living with metastatic breast cancer today in the United States. Based on the estimate that the new mutation is present in 2 to 3 percent of cases, the researchers calculated that approximately 4,000 to 6,000 patients with metastatic breast cancer carry a HER2 mutation and are therefore potential candidates for neratinib treatment.\n\nTo identify the patients in this study who carried the new HER2 mutation, the researchers required tissue from the tumor, a biopsy, from which they could extract and sequence the genetic material to determine the presence of the HER2 mutation. This task turned out to be a major challenge because for 20 to 30 percent of the patients the researchers did not have sufficient material to make the diagnosis.\n\n\"To assist in our ability to identify patients with HER2 mutation-positive tumors, we conducted circulating tumor DNA analysis,\" Ellis said. \"The tumor's DNA is released into the human bloodstream, and we were able to determine the presence of the mutation in blood samples from the patients. Importantly the circulating tumor DNA results were highly concordant with the tumor sequencing results, and they were much easier to determine. Notably, the blood test was sensitive enough that we could use it as a tool to determine eligibility for the clinical trial.\"\n\nIn addition to bringing to the table a novel treatment for metastatic breast cancer carrying a HER2 mutation, the researchers have tested the value of the circulating tumor DNA as a disease-monitoring marker.\n\n\"A circulating tumor DNA-based blood test also could therefore be potentially used to monitor tumor progression and to determine whether patients are responding or not to treatment after just one month of therapy,\" Ellis said.\n\nEllis also is a McNair Scholar at Baylor.\n\nRead all the details of this study, the full list of contributors and their financial support in Clinical Cancer Research.", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "There was no mention of cost in this release.

Researchers found that when they gave injections to 23 patients, the treatment typically eased their tremors and improved their writing ability.\n\nRight now, there\u2019s no good way to treat MS arm tremors, said Nicholas G. LaRocca, vice-president of healthcare delivery and policy research at the National MS Society. Physical therapy and exercise have been studied, but are usually not very effective, said LaRocca, who was not involved in the new study. Surgery is sometimes used in severe cases, but it\u2019s risky and may not even have lasting benefits.\n\n\u201cExploring new treatments is important, and it\u2019s heartening to see there\u2019s some promise here,\u201d LaRocca said of the current findings. But there\u2019s still a lot to be learned, he cautioned in an interview.\n\n\u201cThis study is fairly preliminary, and it had a small number of patients,\u201d LaRocca said. Larger studies, of more-diverse groups of MS patients, are needed, he said.\n\nThe study\u2019s lead researcher agreed on the need for more work. \u201cThere are several questions that need to be answered by doing larger and longer-term studies,\u201d Dr. Anneke van der Walt, a neurologist at Royal Melbourne Hospital in Australia, said in an email.\n\nOne is how long the benefits of repeat Botox injections might last: this study tested the effects of just one Botox treatment over three months.\n\nIn real life, the injections would have to be repeated every few months, or possibly every six months for some people, according to van der Walt. Another question is whether the side effects change over time. Muscle weakness was the most common side effect in this study, van der Walt said. It affected 42 percent of the study patients, though it went away within two weeks.\n\nMuscle weakness is a potential concern in MS patients, LaRocca noted, since that problem often comes with the disease itself.\n\nThe study included 23 MS patients with mild to moderate arm tremors. Each patient received a round of Botox injections and a round of placebo injections (containing saline), three months apart. Half of the patients got the Botox first, the other half the placebo.\n\nOn average, the patients\u2019 tremor \u201cscores\u201d had gone from a 5 to a 3 six weeks after Botox treatment \u2014 which essentially means moving from \u201cmoderate\u201d to \u201cmild,\u201d LaRocca said. Their ability to write and draw a straight line had also improved by week six, and the benefits were still there at week 12.\n\nIn contrast, there were no improvements after the placebo injections.\n\nLarger studies, van der Walt said, should look at whether Botox is more effective for some tremors than others. Tremors limited to the hand and forearm, for instance, might respond better than tremors that also affect the shoulder. If Botox is eventually approved for this MS symptom, LaRocca said it will be important for doctors to get training in how to give the injections \u2014 since the drug has to go into carefully chosen locations in the muscle.\n\n\u201cSo practitioners will have to be up to speed,\u201d LaRocca said. There will also be the matter of cost. That will vary from patient to patient, depending on how many injections are needed per treatment.\n\nAccording to van der Walt, the cost could range from $500 to $1,000 Australian dollars, which are roughly equal to U.S. dollars. In the U.S., Botox treatments can cost $455-$575 per injection site.\n\nBotox maker Allergan supplied the product for the study, and two of the researchers on the work have financial ties to the company.

Brown, chief investigator for the European trial, the International Carotid Stenting Study, said that although differences in the groups studied might explain the disparate results, \u201cnobody has really shown stenting is better than surgery, so why choose a stent?\u201d\n\nDr. Brown added, \u201cEven if Crest shows little difference between the two, there are three other trials that suggest surgery is safer.\u201d\n\nStrokes are the third leading cause of death in the United States and a major cause of disability among adults. Each year, almost 800,000 Americans suffer a stroke, and more than 140,000 die.\n\nAlthough many patients take drugs like statins and medicine to reduce their risk of stroke, surgical treatment of severe blockages in the carotid artery has been shown to be more effective than medical therapy alone in preventing ischemic strokes caused by a buildup of plaque in the arteries.\n\nThe Crest trial, sponsored by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke with additional financing from the stent maker Abbott Vascular, is one of the largest randomized clinical trials to study the two major procedures used to open blocked neck arteries and restore blood flow to the brain.\n\nIt included 2,502 patients at more than 100 in the United States and Canada, who were randomly assigned to receive either surgery or stenting over a period of nine years. Most of the patients had an artery blockage greater than 70 percent. The trial included patients who had suffered a stroke or a ministroke and those who were asymptomatic.\n\nThe death rate in the trial was very low, but risks varied depending on the procedure. Within the first month after the procedure, 4.1 percent of stent patients had suffered a stroke, compared with 2.3 percent of the surgery patients. But surgery patients were at higher risk for , with 2.3 percent suffering a heart attack in the first 30 days compared with 1.1 percent of stent patients.

Koroshetz, deputy director of the institute that sponsored the North American trial, said the Crest trial was the first in which the results of stenting and surgery had been found to be equivalent \u2014 suggesting that the stent procedure had improved with time.\n\nThe most important message is that the overall death rate was extremely low, 0.6 percent, said one of the study\u2019s principal investigators, Dr. Gary S.

He added that he views the new procedure as \"a clear simple alternative\" to standard migraine treatments.\n\n\"This nasal spray option is safe, convenient and innovative,\" said Mandato.\n\nIn the new study, his team focused on 112 patients averaging about 45 years of age. All had been diagnosed with either migraines or another type of intensely painful (and cyclically occurring) headache known as cluster headaches.\n\nBefore participating in the study, patients were asked to indicate their pain levels according to a standardized scale from 1 to 10. Pre-treatment pain scores averaged more than 8, Mandato said.\n\nThe participants all underwent a session of \"image-guided therapy,\" in which a spaghetti-sized catheter was inserted through a nostril and into the nasal passage to deliver a dose of lidocaine to a nerve center known as the sphenopalatine ganglion. This was then repeated in the opposite nostril, according to the researchers.\n\nMandato stressed that no one in the study required sedation to undergo the procedure.\n\nThe target nerve bundle, explained Mandato, \"resembles a complex highway crossing with many [nerve] signals and exits going in all directions.\" And, he said, the hope was that lidocaine would essentially short-circuit that bundle's headache-causing pathway.\n\nThe day after the procedure, average migraine pain levels had dropped from about 8 to just over 4. Pain scores rose only marginally a week after the procedure, and reached an average of just over 5 by the one month post-procedure mark, according to the study.\n\nThe procedure didn't help everyone, though. Seven of the patients (about 6 percent) failed to get any benefit from the treatment, the investigators found. However, 88 percent of those in the study reported needing less standard pain relief medication after the procedure.\n\nThe researchers acknowledged that this procedure is a temporary solution that would need to be repeated.

So developing an effective treatment that can reduce the need for acute medicine would be very valuable,\" Lipton explained.\n\n\"These results sound very promising,\" Lipton added. \"Of course, it remains to be seen if the demonstrated benefit already seen holds up over a longer period of time, and with a bigger group of patients.\"\n\nMandato and colleagues are scheduled to present their findings Sunday at the Society of Interventional Radiology annual meeting in Atlanta.

However, a similar approach might work for some other mutations.\n\nDuchenne, which affects as many as 15,000 Americans, mainly boys and young men, is the most severe common form of muscular dystrophy, a disease made more prominent by years of Jerry Lewis telethons. Those with the disease make barely any dystrophin, a protein necessary for muscles to function. Patients typically lose the ability to walk as teenagers and die by age 30.\n\nWhile steroids, which reduce inflammation, can slow progression of the disease, they have undesirable side effects. Eteplirsen, which Sarepta says has shown no side effects so far, is vying with a similar drug being developed by GlaxoSmithKline to become the first medicine that works by directly countering the cause of the disease.\n\nEteplirsen could also be the first drug to reach the market for Sarepta since it was founded 32 years ago. It changed its name recently from AVI BioPharma to distance itself from its underachieving past.\n\nShares of Sarepta nearly tripled on Wednesday, closing at $44.93. And the stock had already roughly quadrupled since July, when Sarepta announced some interim results from the study.\n\nThe study measured how far the boys could walk in six minutes. Those who received the higher dose walked an average of 21 meters farther after 48 weeks of treatment than at the beginning of the trial, a gain of about 5 percent. The boys in the placebo group walked 68 fewer meters at the end than at the beginning, a decline of about 17 percent.\n\nOne possible reason for skepticism is that two of the boys on a lower dose of the drug rapidly lost the ability to walk, even though the level of dystrophin in their muscles increased substantially.\n\nWhile the company excluded those boys from its analysis as outliers, the Food and Drug Administration might not do so. That could make it harder for the Sarepta to win approval for the drug based only on this small trial, something the company hopes to do.\n\n\u201cIf you wait and require this company to do another two-year study, a lot of these boys are going to be in a wheelchair,\u201d Christopher Garabedian, the Sarepta chief executive, said in an interview.\n\nPatient groups may also put some pressure on the Food and Drug Administration to approve the drug quickly. But some also want Sarepta to make the drug available to more patients on a compassionate basis even before approval.\n\nTen-year-old Max Leclaire of Saxtons River, Vt., who has been receiving the highest dose in the trial, can now walk up stairs without having to pull himself up by the handrail, according to his mother, Jenn McNary. \u201cHe\u2019s no longer riding the handicap bus to school,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Ms. McNary said Sarepta had refused to provide the drug to Max\u2019s 13-year-old brother, Austin, who could not be in the trial because he already could not walk.\n\nMr. Garabedian said Sarepta did not have the money or the manufacturing capacity to make the drug available outside of clinical trials. \u201cThat would be the quickest path to insolvency,\u201d he said.\n\nIf eteplirsen gets to market, it would come nearly three decades after the 1986 discovery of the gene responsible for Duchenne. It would also represent a success, after decades of setbacks, for the technology eteplirsen uses, called antisense, which is a way of turning off specific genes.\n\nEteplirsen actually turns off just one part of the dystrophin gene, known as exon 51, which contains a mutation that in some patients stops production of dystrophin. By skipping over this exon, muscle cells can produce an imperfect form of dystrophin that nonetheless is at least partly functional.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Not applicable.

Lomaira should be used together with regular exercise and a reduced-calorie diet.\n\nLomaira is the only strength of phentermine hydrochloride that can be taken up to three times a day before meals. The limited usefulness of agents of this drug class (anorectics), including Lomaira, should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use.\n\n\"At KVK Tech, we are committed to developing high-quality, FDA-approved medicines that address unmet medical needs, while ensuring affordable options for all appropriate patients. With Lomaira, we're giving physicians and patients access to a low-cost, low-dose version of a weight-reduction medicine, phentermine, that has been prescribed by physicians for over 50 years. Appropriate patients can take Lomaira up to three times a day, before meals \u2013 not just in the morning as with the higher dose formulations of phentermine,\" said Anthony Tabasso, President and Chief Executive Officer of KVK Tech. \"We developed Lomaira with this dosing flexibility and affordability in mind.\"\n\nPhentermine hydrochloride, an appetite suppressant, is the most commonly prescribed drug for weight loss. Over 7 million prescriptions are written for phentermine yearly by a wide range of healthcare professionals (HCPs), including obesity medicine specialists, family practitioners, endocrinologists, internists and cardiologists. 1\n\nPhentermine hydrochloride is typically prescribed in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg and taken before or within a few hours of breakfast. The usual adult dose of Lomaira is one tablet three times a day 1/2 hour before meals. The butterfly-shaped tablet is scored to facilitate administering one half of the usual dosage for patients not requiring the full dose, enabling doctors and patients to work together to customize a weight-loss treatment plan to best meet each patient's needs. Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. Phentermine is not recommended for use in pediatric patients 16 years of age or younger. Late evening medication should be avoided because of the possibility of resulting insomnia.\n\nLomaira is reasonably priced to ensure that cost does not create a hurdle, despite the fact that two-thirds of Americans pay out-of-pocket for their weight-loss prescription medications. Through KVK Tech's , eligible patients will pay no more than 50\u00a2 per tablet for the duration of treatment.\n\n\"Obesity is a chronic metabolic disease that must be managed appropriately to reduce the risk of serious health conditions. Many physicians have used phentermine to help patients as part of a comprehensive weight-management plan. Now, the flexibility in dosing with Lomaira allows doctors to personalize dosing. They can prescribe a lower dose, a good option for some patients. They can also prescribe up to three times a day, which is particularly helpful when patients struggle to control their appetite in the afternoon,\" said Donna Ryan, MD. \"Regrettably, many patients are still not covered by insurance for weight-loss medications and the low cost for Lomaira makes it an affordable treatment option.\"\n\nIn relatively short-term clinical trials, adults with obesity who were instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs (appetite suppressants) lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 2\n\n\"Even modest weight loss can dramatically improve risk and health,\" continued Dr. Ryan. \"It is not necessary to lose a lot of weight to get a lot of benefit.\" Losing five to 10 percent of total body weight is likely to produce health benefits, such as improvements in blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood sugars.3\n\nSome side effects of phentermine that have been reported include pulmonary hypertension, valvular heart disease, palpitations, increased heart rate or blood pressure, insomnia, restlessness, dry mouth, diarrhea, constipation and changes in sexual drive. These are not all of the potential side effects of phentermine. See Full Prescribing Information.\n\nLomaira is anticipated to be available by the end of September 2016.

The possible role of phentermine has not been established, therefore the possibility of an association between heart valve disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out.\n\nIf your body becomes adjusted to the maximum dose of phentermine so that its effects are experienced less strongly, the maximum dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect.\n\nCaution is advised while engaging in potentially hazardous activity such as driving or operating machinery while taking phentermine. Phentermine has the potential to be abused. Keep Lomaira in a safe place to prevent theft, accidental overdose, misuse or abuse. Using alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction.\n\nPhentermine can cause an increase in blood pressure. Tell your doctor if you have high blood pressure, even if it's mild.

One patient, a geologist, had a good response at first, but his level of Factor IX has declined to 1 percent of normal, the level at which the disease kicks in.\n\n\u201cWe attribute this to the fact that he had an inflammation, and although we treated it promptly, we should have been quicker off the mark,\u201d Dr. Tuddenham said.\n\nThe patient cannot be injected again with the same virus because his immune system is now primed to attack it. \u201cHe\u2019s very philosophic about it, but he\u2019s a scientist, and his motivation is to help the science,\u201d Dr. Tuddenham said.\n\nTwenty more patients will be treated to assess the best dose of the virus, the goal being the highest dose that does not set off an immune system attack, Dr. Tuddenham said. \u201cWe are pretty close to the sweet spot,\u201d he said. If all goes well, a genetic treatment for hemophilia B \u201ccould be available for widespread use in a couple of years.\u201d\n\nIn a trial in 2006, a patient injected with a corrective gene produced his own Factor IX but only for 10 weeks. The designer of that treatment, Dr. Katherine A. High of Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the new therapy had worked because the delivery virus had been made more efficient and because the research team had treated the patients with steroids to suppress immune system attacks on the virus.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s incredibly exciting, and I say that even though these people are my competitors,\u201d she said. Dr. High is listed as a co-author of the report because her laboratory helped monitor the patients and provided proof for regulators that the virus would not insert its human gene into the patients\u2019 sperm and make the change hereditary.\n\nA serious problem with other delivery viruses is that they insert themselves randomly into chromosomes, sometimes disrupting a gene. The virus used by Dr. Nathwani\u2019s team, known as adeno-associated virus-8, generally stays outside the chromosomes, so it should not present this problem. Still, patients will need to be monitored for liver cancer, a small possibility that has been observed in mice.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a showstopper, but it\u2019s a critical safety issue that has to be assessed,\u201d Dr. High said.\n\nPatients have little or no immunity to the adeno-associated virus, which infects rhesus monkeys. The virus has a propensity for making liver cells its target, which is good for the therapy because these cells are the natural producers of Factor IX. However, liver cells do not live forever and slowly replenish themselves, possibly limiting how long the therapy will last.\n\nAbout 80 percent of hemophilia cases are of the type known as hemophilia A, which is caused by defects in a different blood-clotting agent, Factor VIII. Researchers have focused on hemophilia B, in part, because the Factor IX gene is much smaller and easier to work with.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does a good job noting the possible costs of this approach ($30,000 for a single treatment) and places it in the context of current costs ($300,000 annually).\u00a0 With an estimated incidence of hemophilia B at about 5 per 100,000 males, the cost of treating the disease worldwide is a important piece of the story.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Autism spectrum disorders , marked by impaired language, repetitive behaviors, and social difficulties, now affect up to one in 110 children, according to the CDC.\n\nThe research needs to be duplicated, Hertz-Picciotto tells WebMD. Still, she says, the finding points to a gene-environment interaction that may possibly help explain some cases of autism.\n\nTaking prenatal vitamins was found even more protective for mothers and children who had a high-risk genetic makeup .\n\n\"It appears that women who reported taking prenatal vitamins starting three months prior to conception and through the first month after conception seem to have a reduced chance their child will develop autism ,\" says study researcher Irva Hertz-Picciotto, PhD, professor of epidemiology and environmental health at the MIND Institute and Department of Public Health, University of California, Davis.\n\nJune 1, 2011 -- Taking prenatal vitamins may reduce the risk of having a child with autism , new research shows.\n\nThe researchers looked at three groups of children, all aged 2 to 5.

This rare genetic defect causes severe visual impairment beginning in infancy and can eventually lead to blindness. The company believes the total \"population in the US, Europe and select additional markets in the Americas and Asia/Pacific is up to approximately 6,000 individuals\" who have the mutation targeted by Luxturna, explained Monique da Silva, a spokeswoman for Spark Therapeutics.\n\nThe drug will be available in the United States in early spring, with an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 people in the US standing to benefit from this treatment, according to Spark.\n\nLuxturna is only the third gene therapy approved for use in the United States; two others were also approved in 2017. This is the first to correct an inherited genetic mutation.\n\nLuxturna is a liquid that is injected directly into the eye with a microscopic needle during a surgical procedure. The drug supplies a third gene -- a normal RPE65 gene -- to cells in the retina, a layer of tissue lining the back of the eye. This third version of the gene does not remove or replace the two mutated genes causing the disease, which remain inside the cells. However, the normal gene delivered by the treatment is able to function within the retinal cells and correct vision problems.\n\nIn the phase 3 clinical trial, 27 out of 29 participants -- 93% -- who received the gene therapy demonstrated a gain in functional vision as assessed by a mobility test performed in a maze, according to the company. Risks of the treatment include cataracts, elevated eye pressure, retinal tears and holes and inflammation.\n\nThe company's offer of unusual payer models, including rebates and installment payments, will \"help ensure patients' individual financial situation does not hinder access to treatment,\" da Silva said.\n\n\"New technologies such as gene and cell therapies hold out the potential to transform medicine,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a statement announcing the August approval of Kymriah, considered to be the first gene therapy to be approved for the US market.\n\nKymriah is a leukemia treatment made by pharmaceutical giant Novartis.

Parvalbumin, a protein found in great quantities in several different fish species, has been shown to help prevent the formation of certain protein structures closely associated with Parkinson's disease.\n\nFish has long been considered a healthy food, linked to improved long-term cognitive health, but the reasons for this have been unclear. Omega-3 and -6, fatty acids commonly found in fish, are often assumed to be responsible, and are commonly marketed in this fashion. However, the scientific research regarding this topic has drawn mixed conclusions. Now, new research from Chalmers has shown that the protein parvalbumin, which is very common in many fish species, may be contributing to this effect.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Parkinson's disease is amyloid formation of a particular human protein, called alpha-synuclein. Alpha-synuclein is even sometimes referred to as the 'Parkinson's protein'.\n\nWhat the Chalmers researchers have now discovered, is that parvalbumin can form amyloid structures that bind together with the alpha-synuclein protein. Parvalbumin effectively 'scavenges' the alpha-synuclein proteins, using them for its own purposes, thus preventing them from forming their own potentially harmful amyloids later on.\n\n\"Parvalbumin collects up the 'Parkinson's protein' and actually prevents it from aggregating, simply by aggregating itself first,\" explains Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede, Professor and Head of the Chemical Biology division at Chalmers, and lead author on the study.\n\nWith the parvalbumin protein so highly abundant in certain fish species, increasing the amount of fish in our diet might be a simple way to fight off Parkinson's disease. Herring, cod, carp, and redfish, including sockeye salmon and red snapper, have particularly high levels of parvalbumin, but it is common in many other fish species too. The levels of parvalbumin can also vary greatly throughout the year.\n\n\"Fish is normally a lot more nutritious at the end of the summer, because of increased metabolic activity. Levels of parvalbumin are much higher in fish after they have had a lot of sun, so it could be worthwhile increasing consumption during autumn,\" says Nathalie Scheers, Assistant Professor in the Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, and researcher on the study. It was Nathalie who first had the inspiration to investigate parvalbumin more closely, after a previous study she did looking at biomarkers for fish consumption.\n\nOther neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, ALS and Huntington's disease, are also caused by certain amyloid structures interfering in the brain. The team is therefore keen to research this topic further, to see if the discovery relating to Parkinson's disease could have implications for other neurodegenerative disorders as well. Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede stresses the importance of finding ways to combat these neurological conditions in the future:\n\n\"These diseases come with age, and people are living longer and longer. There's going to be an explosion of these diseases in the future - and the scary part is that we currently have no cures. So we need to follow up on anything that looks promising.\"\n\nA follow up study, looking at parvalbumin from another angle, is indeed planned for this autumn. Nathalie Scheers, together with Professor Ingrid Undeland, also of Chalmers, will investigate parvalbumin from herring, and its transport in human tissues.\n\n\"It will be very interesting to study how parvalbumin distributes within human tissues in more depth. There could be some really exciting results.\"\n\nMore About: Fish and Better Neurological Health\n\nThe link between higher consumption of fish and better long-term health for the brain has been long established. There is correlation between certain diets and decreased rates of Parkinson's disease - as well as other neurodegenerative conditions.\n\n\"Among those who follow a Mediterranean diet, with more fish, one sees lower rates of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's,\" says Tony Werner, a PhD student in the Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, and lead researcher on the study. This has also been observed in Japan, where seafood forms a central part of the diet. The team is careful to note that no definite links can be established at this point, however.\n\nMore About: Amyloids and Aggregation\n\nProteins are long chains of amino acids that fold into specific structures to carry out their function. But sometimes, proteins can fold incorrectly, and get tangled up with other proteins, a process known as aggregation. As these misfolded proteins aggregate together, they create long fibrous structures known as amyloids. Amyloids are not necessarily a bad thing, but can be responsible for various diseases. Some of them can interfere with neurons in the brain, killing those cells, and causing a variety of neurodegenerative conditions.\n\nMore About: The Study\n\nNathalie Scheers had looked at parvalbumin before in another context.\n\n\"I was on a previous study where we looked at possible compliance markers for fish intake. Parvalbumin is a cause of fish allergies, so we knew that it passed over to the blood, and that this form of parvalbumin is specific for fish\"\n\nShe joined forces with Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede, and together they took the idea forward.\n\n\"Because Nathalie had previously shown that parvalbumin passes into the body of the person eating fish, it made sense to study its interaction with human proteins. We already knew that they can meet in the gut, the blood, or the brain,\" explains Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede.", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Affordability of fish varies widely around the world so we can understand not bringing up costs.\nThe intervention advocated is consuming a fish protein called parvalbumin, or PV for short.

Nonetheless, the issue of cost doesn\u2019t seem entirely applicable here.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "The genetic legacy each of us inherits is a powerful force -- and in a few extreme cases, it can be deadly. Still, thanks to science, genetics need not always be destiny, as Martha Teichner shows us in our Cover Story:\n\nAmy and Brad Price\u2019s home in Omaha, Nebraska, is crazy with all the kids around. There are seven of them, ages 2 to 11. But if you look closely, you\u2019ll see small memorials to one more: Liviana, who died in 2013 at the age of 5\u00bd of a rare, nightmare disease called late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy. MLD destroys brain cells and is caused by a single, faulty gene.\n\n\u201cShe was happy all the time,\u201d Brad said.\n\nShe was talkative, addicted to \u201cCaillou,\u201d the animated TV series, a lively little girl, \u2018til she was two. \u201cHer knees were going a little knock-kneed,\u201d Amy said. \u201cAnd she had been just randomly falling down.\u201d\n\nHer doctor said, \u201cNothing to worry about,\u201d but she quickly got worse.\n\n\u201cI was in the kitchen doing something and I heard her crying,\u201d Amy recalled. \u201cAnd I turned around and said, \u2018Liviana, what\u2019s wrong?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Mommy, my legs don\u2019t work.\u2019\u201d\n\nLiviana was diagnosed in the fall of 2010. Amy recalled: \u201cShe\u2019s sitting on the bed in her tutu and her colorful sweater, and they\u2019re telling me she\u2019s gonna die.\u201d\n\nMany children with the disorder are dead by the age of 6. And it runs in families. If it hadn\u2019t been for Liviana, Amy and Brad Price would never have known to have their other children tested. They learned that their infant son, Giovanni, had inherited the faulty gene, too.\n\n\u201cI get a call from the doctor\u2019s office,\u201d said Amy, \u201cI knew. And I was thinking, \u2018I\u2019ve just been told two of my kids now are gonna die.\u2019\u201d\n\nExcept that\u2019s not what happened.\n\nDoing research online, Amy Price discovered the existence of a medical trial in Milan, Italy, of an extraordinary gene therapy treatment for MLD that would save Giovanni\u2019s life -- and later, when his sister, Cecilia, was born with MLD, hers, too. The treatment works only on children who, like them, have not yet started showing symptoms.\n\nThe Price family scraped together the money to go to Milan.\n\n\u201cThe patients go to the surgery room for collection of the stem cells on Monday, and receive their cells back on Friday evening,\u201d said Dr. Alessandra Biffi, who oversaw the trial.\n\nA patient\u2019s stem cells contain the faulty gene, which the doctors have learned how to fix. Amazing, right? But then they need a vehicle to insert the good gene into the stem cells before those are put back into the patient\u2019s body.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s really amazing: That vehicle is the HIV virus, re-engineered so the children can\u2019t get AIDS.\n\nWhy the HIV virus? \u201cIs it particularly efficient at getting around the body?\u201d Teichner asked.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s very efficient in entering our cells, and that\u2019s why we use it,\u201d Dr. Biffi replied.\n\nHow well did the children do? It will take years to know for sure, but so far so good. \u201cAt least 70-80% of them have an outstanding benefit coming from the treatment,\u201d Dr. Biffi said. \u201cSome of the children were going to school and having a normal life.\u201d\n\nGiovanni Price is six now, in first grade. He and his sister Cecilia (Ceci for short) have to go back to Milan twice a year to be tested and monitored.\n\nBrad Price calls Dr. Biffi \u201cOur angel. She took us in like family.\u201d\n\nSo why Italy, and not the United States?\n\nGene therapy has a checkered history. In the 1990s, hyped as the Next Big Thing, research withered here after serious setbacks, including a death during clinical trials. But more than 15 years later, it\u2019s back. One sign: Dr. Biffi is now head of the gene therapy program at Dana-Farber/Boston Children\u2019s Cancer and Blood Disorders Center.\n\nTeichner asked, \u201cDo you believe that gene therapy is finally coming into its own?\u201d\n\nThe MLD trial, she thinks, demonstrates what\u2019s possible -- offering promise to the 30 million Americans who suffer from some 7,000 rare diseases.\n\nTrials for the experimental treatment Ceci and Giovanni Price received in Milan have not begun in the U.S. They are two of only 24 children in the world with MLD to receive it.\n\nCompare Giovanni to Calliope Joy Carr, also six, from Bala Cynwyd, Pa., outside Philadelphia. She can turn her head, a little. She can still smile and laugh. But that\u2019s about all. She was diagnosed at 2.\n\nFor her parents, college professors Patrick Carr and Maria Kefalis, coming to terms with the disease was wrenching. \u201cIt\u2019s decline in slow motion, and that\u2019s difficult,\u201d said Carr.\n\n\u201cI remember the social worker said, \u2018It\u2019s good to try to cry in the shower to save it from your family and your children,\u2019\u201d Kefalis said.\n\nAfter more than a year of rage and grief, Kefalis decided that she had to find some way of helping MLD children. It was too late for Cal, but she was desperate to give her daughter\u2019s life meaning.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not wealthy people,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know very influential people who could write a big check for a million dollars. And so we said, \u2018Well, we\u2019ll start selling cupcakes.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Calliope Joy Foundation was formed in 2013. It\u2019s been slow going, but the money added up. And when Kefalis learned about the Italian trial, and the fact that Amy Price had to keep going back to Milan with Giovanni and Ceci, it was clear she would use the money to help families get to Italy.\n\n\u201cShe sent me a picture of Giovanni playing in his front yard,\u201d Kefalis said. \u201cHe\u2019s three months younger than Cal, so he should\u2019ve been as sick as Cal. He should have been on a feeding tube. He should be paralyzed. And I thought, I gotta be a part of this. I need to help this happen again and again and again.\u201d\n\nMaria Kefalis has turned cupcakes into weapons of war -- her war against MLD. She\u2019s raised more than $250,000, and helped where she could, but she\u2019s hit a wall. So far, not a single gene replacement therapy has been approved by the FDA. The trial in Italy is closed to new patients. It could be years before any children with MLD will be allowed to receive the treatment in the United States.\n\n\u201cNow, it\u2019s just impatience,\u201d Kefalis said. \u201cNow it\u2019s, like, \u2018When do we get this here? What will it take. Tell me what you need me to do.\u2019\u201d\n\nUntil then, she continues to fight her battles one cupcake at a time -- the Price children, Giovanni and Cecilia, proof to her the war can be won.\n\nTeichner asked Brad and Amy Price, \u201cYou keep using the word \u2018miracle.\u2019 In what way is all of this a miracle?\u201d\n\n\u201cOur son\u2019s still with us, and Cecilia as well,\u201d they replied. \u201cThat\u2019s the miracle.\u201d\n\u2022 New hope for young patients with rare genetic disease (\u201cCBS Evening News,\u201d 10/16/15)\n\u2022 Follow the Calliope Joy Foundation on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Gene therapies are astronomically expensive; Glybera, the only approved gene therapy in the world, costs around $1 million and has only been used once.\nNowhere\u00a0is the potential cost of the treatment mentioned by the reporter, despite\u00a0interviewing a woman financially supporting families to get their children into the clinical trial.\nAlthough it is impossible to say how much the experimental treatment would cost if approved, the likelihood of an extremely high price tag\u00a0should have been mentioned.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "For years, research has shown that babies born by cesarean section are more likely to develop health problems.

It is one of the largest and longest studies to explore how planned C-sections differ from other deliveries.\n\nSurprisingly, the data showed more health problems among babies born by planned C-section than among those delivered by emergency C-section or vaginal birth, even though the planned surgery is done under more controlled conditions. The finding suggests that the arduous experience of labor \u2014 that exhausting, sweaty, utterly unpredictable yet often strangely exhilarating process \u2014 may give children a healthy start, even when it\u2019s interrupted by a surgical birth.\n\nThe new findings, published in JAMA this month, are important because the number of babies born by C-section has increased tremendously. In the United States, nearly one in three babies are born by C-section.

But babies delivered by a planned C-section, which is usually scheduled to take place well before the first pang of labor, may miss out entirely.\n\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t wait for labor to begin on its own, you cut short all kinds of physiological changes and preparations for birth that are taking place toward the end of pregnancy,\u201d said Carol Sakala, the director of the nonprofit Childbirth Connection programs at the National Partnership for Women & Families. \u201cWhat is the effect of cutting off those processes so casually on such a large scale?\u201d\n\nStudies have consistently found that children born by C-section are at higher risk for health problems like obesity and allergies. C-section birth has also been associated with a higher risk for Type 1 diabetes.\n\nThe Scottish study took advantage of the small country\u2019s rich trove of linked birth and medical databases to track the long-term health of 321,287 babies. Nearly 4 percent were born by planned C-section and 17 percent were delivered by emergency surgery. The remaining 252,917 were vaginal births.\n\nThe researchers compared a range of health outcomes among the babies, including asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, Type 1 diabetes, early death and cancer.\n\nOver all, the differences between a scheduled C-section and an emergency C-section were slight. However, the data do begin to shed light on why babies born through vaginal birth may have fewer health risks than babies born by C-section.\n\nThe biggest difference between babies born by scheduled and unscheduled C-section appeared in risk for Type 1 diabetes. The results showed that babies born by planned C-section had a 35 percent higher risk of Type 1 diabetes compared with babies born by emergency C-section, after adjusting for differences among the mothers.\n\nAll of the babies born by C-section were slightly more likely to use an asthma inhaler at age 5: 10.3 percent of planned C-section babies and 10.19 percent of unscheduled C-section babies wound up using an inhaler, compared with 9.6 percent of vaginally born babies. Asthma hospitalization rates were also higher for babies born by planned C-section with a statistically significant increase of 22 percent over vaginally born babies.\n\nAlthough all of the C-section babies were more likely to be obese at age 5, the differences were not statistically significant after adjusting for differences among the mothers. There were no significant differences in cancer and irritable bowel disease among any of the types of births.\n\nNo one knows exactly why labor may be protective, but the spontaneous onset of labor prompts fluid to clear from a baby\u2019s lungs, said Dr. Aaron Caughey, who helped draw up 2014 guidelines for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that urged providers to let women spend more time in labor and avoid an unnecessary C-section.\n\nThe step is just one of a cascade of physiological changes that take place in mother and baby during the labor process, including surges in stress hormones and reproductive hormones like oxytocin that may help the fetus adapt during labor, preserve blood flow to the organs, and keep the baby alert and prepared for breast-feeding.\n\nDuring labor, a newborn absorbs maternal microbes into its mouth and gastrointestinal tract, said Dr. Josef Neu, a neonatologist at the University of Florida who has written about C-section babies and the hygiene hypothesis.\n\nThe theory is that maternal microbes \u201ctrain\u201d the infant\u2019s immune system, so it doesn\u2019t overreact or become destructive and precipitate autoimmune disorders like Type 1 diabetes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an education process that says, \u2018Calm down, you\u2019re going to be seeing this antigen again, you don\u2019t have to be so aggressive,\u2019\u201d Dr. Neu said.\n\nDr. Neu said the broad-spectrum antibiotics prescribed to the mother before a surgical delivery were another concern; the antibiotics can be transmitted to the baby through breast milk if not before birth, decreasing the diversity of natural bacteria.\n\nThe findings are a reminder that although C-sections are appropriate in some circumstances, they are a poor substitute for labor.\n\nChildbirth and labor are \u201ca physiological process that we\u2019ve evolved to over millions of years,\u201d Dr. Caughey said. \u201cIt\u2019s been really well-designed by evolution.\u201d\n\u2022 Does Frequent Sex Prime the Immune System for Pregnancy?\n\n\n\n For more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The article does not include any discussion of costs.

That is a lot of excess deaths.\u201d\n\nCT scans give doctors a view inside the body, often eliminating the need for exploratory surgery. But CT scans involve much higher radiation dose than conventional X-rays. A chest CT scan exposes the patient to more than 100 times the radiation dose of a chest X-ray.\n\nAbout 70 million CT scans were done on Americans in 2007, up from 3 million in 1980. Amy Berrington de Gonzalez of the National Cancer Institute and colleagues developed a computer model to estimate the impact of so many scans.\n\nThey estimated the scans done in 2007 will cause 29,000 cancers. A third of the projected cancers will occur in people who were ages 35 to 54 when they got their CT, two-thirds will occur in women and 15 percent will arise from scans done in children or teens.\n\nThe researchers estimated there will be an extra 2,000 excess breast cancers just from CT scans done in 2007.\n\nRedberg, who wrote a commentary on the studies, said U.S. doctors\u2019 enthusiasm for the tests has led to an explosion in their use that is putting patients at risk.\n\n\u201cWhile certainly some of the scans are incredibly important and life saving, it is also certain that some of them were not necessary,\u201d Redberg said.\n\nIn a separate study, Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman of the University of California, San Francisco, and colleagues analyzed data from 1,119 patients undergoing the 11 most common types of diagnostic CT scans at four institutions in 2008.\n\nThey found radiation dosage varied widely between different types of CT studies, from a median or midpoint of 2 millisieverts for a routine head CT scan to 31 millisieverts for a scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which often involves taking multiple images of the same organ.\n\nBy comparison, the average American is exposed to about 3 millisieverts of radiation a year from ground radon or flying in an airplane \u2014 a level not considered a risk to health.\n\nThe researchers said efforts need to be taken to minimize CT radiation exposure, including reducing the number of unnecessary tests, cutting the dose per study, and standardizing the doses across facilities.\n\nImaging equipment makers such as GE Healthcare, Siemens, Philips and Toshiba Medical Systems are working to develop low-dose CT scanners.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not\u00a0describe the costs of CT scanning, which are substantial and increasing.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Walnuts have long been touted as a healthy, whole food, but new research just upped the homely nut's reputation another notch.\n\nIn a study by researchers from the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona and Loma Linda University, more than 700 older, healthy adults were asked to add either a handful of walnuts to their daily diets or to follow their normal diet without eating nuts.\n\nAfter one year, both groups experienced minimal body weight, triglyceride, and HDL cholesterol changes, but the walnut-eaters had significant reductions in LDL cholesterol (\"bad\" cholesterol) compared to the nut-free control group.\n\nThe research shows the well-known cholesterol-lowering effect of eating walnuts works equally well in the elderly, even in the long term, the authors reported at the Experimental Biology conference in San Diego.\n\n\"Given walnuts are a high-energy food, a prevailing concern has been that their long-term consumption might be associated with weight gain,\" said study author Dr. Emilio Ros, director of the Lipid Clinic, Endocrinology & Nutrition Service at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, in a press statement. \"\"It's encouraging to see that eating walnuts may benefit this particular population.\"\n\nOther walnut studies presented at the conference, funded in part by the California Walnut Commission, suggested the omega-3 fatty acid-rich nut may also benefit gut bacteria and help reduce inflammation.\n\nElisabetta Politi, nutrition director of the Duke Diet and Fitness Center at Duke University, said, \"We advocate that people eat nuts, including walnuts, because they are high in healthy fat, low in carbohydrates and a good source of protein.\"\n\nPoliti said a serving of walnuts is about 14 halves, which adds up to 180 calories.

The procedure, often done to relieve chest pain and to reduce the risk of having or dying from a heart attack, has become one of the most common medical procedures in the United States.\n\n\"The data are compelling,\" said William E. Boden of the University of Buffalo School of Medicine, whose findings were published yesterday by the New England Journal of Medicine to coincide with a presentation at a meeting of the American College of Cardiology in New Orleans. \"We do too many of these procedures.\"\n\nSeveral experts said they expect the findings will prompt a major shift in how doctors treat thousands of patients suffering from heart disease -- the nation's leading cause of death.\n\n\"These findings are pretty explosive,\" said Steven E. Nissen, president of the American College of Cardiology. \"I think this is going to shake things up pretty significantly.\"\n\nThe findings underscore the danger of rushing to adopt a procedure before careful studies have been conducted to fully determine its benefits, Boden and others said.\n\n\"There was just this intuitive belief that it would be beneficial,\" Boden said. \"But no one had ever done a proper randomized trial to see whether it actually improved outcomes. In the meantime, a whole industry has been created around this.\"\n\nThe researchers and others stressed that angioplasty clearly benefits patients who are in the throes of a heart attack or are at very high risk for one. But the findings indicate that for a patient whose condition is stable, medical therapy is just as effective at reducing the major risks. Such patients constitute at least one-third of those undergoing the 1.2 million angioplasties performed each year, and perhaps as much as 85 percent.\n\nSome cardiologists who specialize in the procedures, however, argued that the study did not focus on the sickest patients who are most likely to benefit, and that the main purpose of angioplasty in many is to alleviate chest pain, not to prevent heart attacks.\n\n\"I don't think this is going to cause any huge paradigm shift,\" said Gregory J. Dehmer, president of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions. \"This study was limited to a fairly select group of patients with very stable symptoms.\"\n\nBut Boden said that the study did include patients with moderate to severe heart disease and that many such patients undergo the procedure in the belief it will protect them against heart attacks.\n\nIn the procedure, doctors thread a tiny balloon into clogged arteries, inflate the balloon to clear the blockage, and insert a stent -- a tiny wire lattice strut that props the artery open. The procedure costs about $50,000 and is considered safe, though it does carry some risks.\n\nThe findings come on the heels of questions about the safety of new stents coated with drugs to keep arteries from reclosing. Those concerns had led doctors to curtail their use of the newer devices, and the new findings are expected to have a similar effect on angioplasty overall.\n\n\"There was an overexuberance,\" said William O'Neill, a prominent cardiologist at the University of Miami. \"I think we're getting a midcourse correction.\"\n\nThe findings could also help fuel a resurgence of bypass surgery, which has become far less common with the rise of angioplasty.\n\n\"There was this sense that angioplasty would produce the same result as bypass surgery,\" Nissen said. \"I think this will cause a tilt toward more patients with stable conditions choosing medical therapy and more people who have more severe disease getting bypass surgery, which both relieves symptoms and reduces the risk for heart attack and death.\"\n\nThe new study, which was funded mostly by the Department of Veterans Affairs, involved 2,287 patients at 50 centers in the United States and Canada who had chest pain or other symptoms because one or more major arteries supplying blood to the heart had clogged. Half the patients received standard medical treatment involving medication and lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, eating better and exercising. The other half received the same treatment plus angioplasty.\n\nAfter about five years, the number of patients who experienced a heart attack, were hospitalized or died because of their heart problems was virtually identical in the two groups, the researchers found.\n\n\"There was no significant difference,\" Boden said. \"The data are clear.\"\n\nAlthough about one-third of patients who initially got medical treatment later turned to angioplasty, the findings show how much medical treatment of heart disease has improved, Boden said.\n\n\"The paradigm for the last 20 years for patients like this been: 'Mr. Jones, you need a procedure.'

If it does, Orlistat (xenical) -- currently sold only by prescription -- could be available over-the-counter (OTC) later this year. But it's important to know that the weight loss that's typical for users of the drug -- 5 to 10 percent of total weight -- will be less than many dieters expect. And many consumers may be put off by the drug's significant gastrointestinal side effects, including flatulence, diarrhea and anal leakage.\n\nNor is Orlistat a quick fix for unwanted pounds. To achieve any weight loss, users must also eat fewer calories and exercise more.\n\n\"It's not a miracle drug,\" notes Lawrence Cheskin, director of the Weight Management Center at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in Baltimore, who conducted a study of Orlistat in adolescents. \"None of these [weight loss] medications are.\"\n\nOrlistat was approved as a weight loss and weight maintenance drug by the FDA in 1999 to treat obese and overweight people -- those with a body mass index of 30 or higher -- and overweight people (with BMI of 27 or higher) who already have weight-related health problems including diabetes, heart disease or high blood pressure.\n\nMore than 100 studies involving some 30,000 patients have been conducted with Orlistat, according to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Consumer Healthcare, the maker of Orlistat, which has petitioned the FDA to permit OTC sales of the drug. The company says that 22 million people in 145 countries have taken the drug. \"Orlistat is a very safe and effective drug with a long history of use around the world,\" says George Quesnelle, president of GSK Consumer Healthcare, North America.\n\nIn the longest study of Orlistat, participants who took the drug in addition to eating fewer calories and increasing exercise shed up to 12 percent of their body weight the first year. But by the fourth year of the study, they had regained some pounds. Overall, they lost about 7 percent of their body weight, compared to 4 percent for a control group that dieted and increased physical activity but didn't take the drug. The 7 percent figure works out to about 18 pounds for someone who weighs 250.\n\n\"That's little difference in weight, but significant in terms of medical benefits,\" notes Samuel Klein, director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine.

What is hard is to keep the weight off.\n\nNow scientists think they know why. When people lose substantial amounts of weight, their physiology changes so that, although they may look normal, they have all the hallmarks of starvation.\n\nTheir metabolism slows down, they expend fewer calories when they exercise because their muscles become much more efficient, and their thyroid hormone and adrenaline levels drop. They also have much lower levels of the fat hormone, leptin.\n\nThey also usually stop losing weight and often gain back what they have already lost.\n\nA group of researchers at Columbia University devised an experiment to see whether if they could prevent these changes that occur with weight loss. Leptin, they reasoned, tells the brain how much fat is on the body.\n\nIf people lose weight, they have less leptin. But what if the researchers put people - fat and thin - on weight-reducing diets and gave them enough leptin to make their bodies think that they were still fat. The leptin would then serve as a sort of virtual fat. Would the subjects still show the metabolic changes of starvation?\n\nThe answer, published in the current issue of The Journal of Clinical Investigation, was that the leptin trick worked.\n\nTen subjects - five men and five women; of them three had never been fat and seven were obese - lived in the hospital, where they were fed a liquid diet formula to elicit a 10 percent weight loss. Then, for five weeks, they were given twice-daily injections with enough leptin to restore the levels they had before losing the weight.\n\nThe investigators measured muscular efficiency by having the subjects pedal a stationary bicycle with a mouthpiece, measuring their oxygen consumption to determine how many calories they burned.\n\nAt low levels of exertion, comparable to normal daily activities, they burned 23 percent fewer calories. When they took leptin, their calorie burning increased to pre-diet levels.\n\nThey also measured thyroid hormone concentrations in the blood and found that leptin reversed the declines in those levels that occurred with weight loss. And the scientists measured the effects of weight loss on the sympathetic nervous system, documenting lower levels of adrenaline in urine. Leptin reversed that, too.\n\nDr. Michael Rosenbaum, the lead investigator, said the 10-week study was too short and too small to determine whether continuous leptin treatments could allow dieters to keep off their weight permanently and effortlessly.

And this strategy \u2026 could potentially be used,\u201d said Dr. Jean-Michel Molina, head of infectious diseases at Saint-Louis Hospital in Paris and the lead author of the study.\n\nMolina insisted he would never support long-term use of antibiotics to prevent STIs, but said that the approach might be an effective short-term strategy when paired with other control approaches, like more frequent STI testing among high-risk populations.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want this strategy to be used widely in any person, clearly,\u201d Molina said. \u201cBut if you can select a group with a high incidence rate of syphilis or chlamydia, and you want to try to reduce the rate of syphilis quite quickly in this group of people, you may think that this strategy could be used for a couple of months.\u201d\n\nRates of syphilis in particular have risen steadily in recent years; the rate in 2015-2016 \u2014 8.7 cases per 100,000 people \u2014 was the highest since 1993, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. The rate of infection increased in every age group over the age of 15, in both men and women, and in all ethnic groups.\n\nMolina\u2019s study was recently published by the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was one of its funders.\n\nThe researchers randomly assigned 232 men to one of two groups. One of the groups was given antibiotics \u2014 the drug doxycycline \u2014 to take if they had unprotected sex. They were told to take two pills per encounter, and no more than six in a week, ideally within 24 hours and no later than 72 hours after the intercourse. In reality, the median use among the men was about 6.8 pills per month.\n\nThe men were tested regularly for STIs, and in the nine or so months they were followed, the rates of some sexually transmitted infections fell dramatically in the treatment group. The overall reduction of all STIs was 47 percent, but that average was dragged down by the fact that doxycycline doesn\u2019t cure gonorrhea.\n\nThere was, however, a 70 percent reduction in chlamydia infections and cases of syphilis decreased by 73 percent. The authors noted, however, that the study length was short and they can\u2019t tell if the strategy would work as well over the long term.\n\nThe results can\u2019t be taken in isolation, others experts warned. Using doxycycline this way could drive the bacteria that cause the infections to develop resistance to the drug, warned Dr. Brad Spellberg, an infectious diseases specialist and chief medical officer at the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center in Los Angeles.\n\nSpellberg also said people who used the drug this way would be exposing the bacteria they have in their gastro-intestinal tracts \u2014 their own gut flora \u2014 to regular doses of doxycycline. And those bacteria too could develop resistance to the drug, leading to a host of other health problems.\n\nThe full picture of the knock-on effects of exposing your gut flora to antibiotics is still coming into focus, said Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics, and Policy and a leading voice on the dangers of mounting antibiotic resistance. He noted a recent report in the journal Science revealed that some cancer immunotherapy drugs worked less well in people who had recently taken antibiotics.\n\nMolina noted that antibiotic resistance to doxycycline has not been seen in chlamydia or syphilis, despite the fact that the drug has been used to treat these infections for decades. Still, he said the possibility it could arise cannot be discounted.\n\nA commentary published with the study argued that reducing infection rates in men who have sex with men and who are highly sexually active might lower STI infection rates more generally in a community.\n\nAuthors Christopher Fairley and Eric Chow, of Australia\u2019s Melbourne Sexual Health Center at Monash University, said pressure from patients to be given doxycycline on a preventative basis might be substantial, given that the drug is also prescribed in six-month courses to treat acne. Like Molina and his co-authors, they said STI preventive use at this point is premature.\n\nLaxminarayan did not dismiss the notion of this type of use out of hand, however. \u201cI certainly think that for a small subset of the population, if this helps prevent syphilis, then it certainly is worth exploring further,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he said additional studies should be conducted first to try to get a better picture of the potential consequences of using doxycycline this way, including the risk of resistance developing, the potential that it might further erode condom use, and any other unintended consequences.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not address the cost of preventative use of doxycycline.

Scientists believe this style of eating offers some protection against mental aging, and, above all else, it is heart healthy.\n\nA new study of over 15,000 people in 39 countries explored the benefits of this diet for one special group: those already diagnosed with heart disease. Surprisingly, the results suggest it might be possible they can have their cake and eat it, too.\n\nParticipants eating a Mediterranean diet showed a lower risk of heart attack and stroke, the researchers discovered; yet, eating healthy food appeared to be more important than avoiding unhealthy foods identified as typical of a so-called Western diet, such as French fries, fatty red meats, and, yes, even cake. (Though diet names refer to regions, they are not precise.)\n\nLed by Professor Ralph Stewart from the University of Auckland, New Zealand, a team of researchers asked 15,482 older adults with stable coronary artery disease to complete a lifestyle questionnaire. With an average age of 67, each was a participant in GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s STABILITY drug trial, created to learn whether the drug reduced the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and deaths. Participants lived in Western and Eastern Europe, North and South America, and the Asia Pacific region.\n\nThey answered questions about their diet and reported how many times a week they consumed servings from separate food groups. Looking at their answers, researchers gave them points in either the Mediterranean diet or Western diet category.\n\nOver nearly four years, 1,588 (about 10 percent) of the study participants suffered either a heart attack or stroke, or died. Those who ate more foods in the Mediterranean diet category were 3.5 times less likely to experience one of these three events than people whose diets more closely resembled the Western standard.\n\nIn fact, every one-point increase in a participant\u2019s Mediterranean diet score was linked with a 7 percent reduction in risk of heart attack, stroke, or death. Look at it this way: if 100 people ate the highest proportion of Mediterranean foods and 100 ate the least, there would be three fewer heart attacks, strokes, or deaths among those who ate more foods from the Mediterranean diet. These findings held for every geographical region.\n\nNow here\u2019s the interesting part: eating more foods thought to be less healthy \u2014 those typical of Western diets \u2014did not link to an increase in heart attacks, strokes, or deaths. Eating more healthy foods was the key, even if some unhealthy foods were also consumed along the way.\n\nAccording to Stewart, the meaning behind the numbers is clear. Instead of avoiding unhealthy foods, people with weak hearts might focus more on consuming healthy foods. That said, Stewart notes his study has limitations, including a lack of strict guidelines about portion size and no measure of total calories.\n\nLong-standing American Heart Association guidelines recommend a diet primarily consisting of fruits, vegetables, fish, and other whole foods, with limited amounts of sodium, sugar, saturated fats, and refined carbohydrates.

Currently, CT scans of the brain are the standard way of diagnosing TBI, but they can\u2019t pick up every case. And because the expose patients to radiation, doctors are often reluctant to use them on every patient, especially young children, who come to the emergency room with a head injury.\n\nBut in a study published in , scientists report on a promising blood test that could distinguish the more serious cases of TBI that require further evaluation. Led by Dr. Linda Papa, director of clinical research and an emergency physician at Orlando Regional Medical Center, the research team focused on two blood proteins that have already been linked to brain injury. Papa and her team expanded on that work by studying how levels of these two proteins, or biomarkers, change immediately after head trauma.\n\nThey collected blood from 584 people coming to the Orlando Regional Medical Center, which is a Level 1 Trauma Center, for trauma-related injuries. About half them had brain-related injuries, and half had other traumas, including broken bones and chest injuries. Papa wanted to test several things about the blood test, including whether they were specific to brain injuries or whether they changed during any trauma to any part of the body. All of the people had their blood drawn 19 times, starting at within four hours of their injury and up to 7 days later. By tracking changes in the levels of the two proteins over this time, Papa could see how they changed, and correlate that with the people\u2019s symptoms.\n\nMORE: Concussion Expert: Over 90% of NFL Players Have Brain Disease\n\nIn all people, regardless of the type of injury they had, the levels of the proteins, called GFAP and UCH-L1, rose within the first hour after the injuries. GFAP, which is specific to cells known as astrocytes that form a matrix for nerves in the central nervous system (which includes the brain and spinal cord), peak at 20 hours after the injury and then decline steadily but are still detectable seven days later. UCH-L1 is released by brain nerves when they\u2019re stressed, and its levels rise more rapidly immediately after injury and peak at eight hours.\n\nWhen Papa then looked just at people who showed signs of TBI on CT scans, she found that their levels of GFAP and UCH-L1 were significantly higher than those of people with other types of trauma, suggesting that the two markers can be relatively specific to TBI and not trauma in general.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to do any unnecessary procedures on people who don\u2019t need them,\u201d says Papa of using CT scans to distinguish people with more serious head injuries from those how just have hit their head but don\u2019t experience any symptoms. \u201cI don\u2019t think a blood will be the be-all and end-all but it would be a beautiful tool for us to have in the clinic to support a lot of our decision making.\u201d\n\nTesting for levels of UCH-L1, for example, might be helpful for emergency medical teams in an ambulance trying to assess whether a patient has any serious head injuries, since its levels peak in the hours immediately after a trauma. It might also help coaches or athletic trainers are sports events to determine which athletes who have had a concussion are able to return to the game and which, if they have higher levels of the blood marker, should not.\n\nMORE: A New Blood Test to Diagnose Concussions On The Field\n\nIn the emergency room, a blood test for UCH-L1 could also help doctors decide which patients should get a CT scan \u2014 the higher their levels of the protein are, the more likely they are to have TBI and would benefit from a scan, while those with lower levels probably don\u2019t need one.\n\nAnd because levels of GFAP tend to remain higher for many days, Papa says it might be useful in cases where patients don\u2019t come in immediately after a head injury, thinking they\u2019re okay, but see the doctor several days later because they\u2019re concerned. Even at that point, the study shows, GFAP levels might be higher than normal and therefore might indicate TBI and need for further tests.\n\n\u201cWe may not use these blood tests in a hundred percent of cases but probably in eighty percent of cases where there is a question mark, a blood test could definitely help,\u201d she says.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Costs are not addressed here.

At a week old, doctors amputated his dead forearm and hand. They were afraid his body would be become infected and he would die. Falardeau mourned her boy's missing arm for years but, in time, embraced her son as he was.\n\nWyatt also learned to adapt. They tried a couple of prosthetics when he was younger and each time the toddler abandoned the false limb within months.\n\n\"His main interest was to create a shocking response from onlookers by pulling it off in the grocery store,\" Falardeau wrote on CNN iReport . In truth, she had been more concerned about getting him therapy for his autism-related delays -- the limb difference was secondary.\n\nSo when a friend shared a story from the \"Today Show\" with Wyatt in mind, about a team of University of Central Florida (UCF) students and graduates that made an electronic arm for 6-year-old Pring using a three-dimensional printer on campus, Falardeau was defensive.\n\n\"He doesn't need this,\" she thought.\n\nHer fifth-grader had a different reaction: \"I want one of these robot arms!\" Falardeau remembers Wyatt telling her and her husband. \"I could ride a bike! I might even be able to paddle a kayak!\"\n\nThere were other things the 12-year-old boy said he would do if he had two hands. A proper somersault. Clap with two hands. Dance with a pretty girl with one hand on her back and the other leading. Stuff she hadn't really thought about but he clearly had.\n\nFalardeau got in touch with the Orlando students through E-Nable , an online volunteer organization started by Rochester Institute of Technology research scientist Jon Schull to match people who have 3-D printers with children in need of hands and arms. The organization creates and shares bionic arm designs for free download at EnablingTheFuture.org that can be assembled for as little as $20 to $50. Middle and high school student groups and Girl and Boy Scout troops are among those donating their time and materials to assemble limbs for kids and give them to recipients for free.\n\n\"It's really just a step-by-step process of solving problems. The first problem we solved was: how do we make the hand move electronically? And then: how do we attach this arm to a child?\" said sophomore Tyler Petresky. \"It's just one problem after another we keep solving. That's what engineering is all about.\"\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about 1,500 babies in the United States are born with upper limb deformities each year. Comprehensive statistics aren't available for the number of children with amputations, such as Wyatt.\n\nThe UCF project started when Albert Manero, an engineering doctoral student, heard a story on the radio about one of the inventors of the 3-D printed hand. He got involved with E-Nable and met Alex, a local boy teased because of his missing arm, and set about designing a robotic replacement. They gave it to Alex for free.\n\nEach electronic limb takes about 30 to 50 hours to make and assemble. The students use the printer in the school's manufacturing lab and cover the cost of materials -- about $350 -- through donations.\n\nPetresky got involved with the design of Pring's hand because Manero knew he was good with electronics.\n\n\"He bribed me with some pulled pork sandwiches. I went over to his house and helped him out with electronics,\" he said. \"I found out he was working on an arm, and I thought that was the coolest thing in the world.\"\n\nEventually Manero moved to Germany for a Fulbright scholarship and left Petresky in charge of running the operations in Orlando.\n\nPetresky says they ask every family about the child's favorite color, superhero and interests, so the new limb can \"not just be a piece of plastic ... but be a part of them.\"\n\nAs they've designed the bionics, they've learned that kids don't necessarily want to blend in. Children have requested colorful designs inspired by superheroes, Disney's \"Frozen,\" and in Wyatt's case, the blue-skinned men from \"Blue Man Group.\" For Christmas, the group upgraded Alex's plain vanilla white arm to a new one resembling Optimus Prime from \"Transformers.\"\n\n\"We quickly found out this is much less about fitting in and feeling normal, and much more about expressing yourself,\" Petresky said. \"There's a large aspect of being artistic and being creative.\"\n\nThe team has made electronic arms for five children and are working with three more kids including Wyatt. He traveled with his mom to UCF last week and practiced flexing his muscle to make the hand open and close.\n\nHe expects to get fitted with his new arm later this month.\n\nHis mom, Cynthia, was most excited about seeing Wyatt being celebrated for who he is.\n\n\"The adoration of college students was an affirmation that money can't buy. He was wrapped in the joy of leading and advising students on how to help children like himself,\" she wrote in her iReport. \"Wyatt felt like he was making a difference for himself and other children.\"\n\nAs they got ready to leave the campus, her son told her he can't wait to see what he will accomplish with his new arm.

Previous research has found that one out of every four women with fibroids has problems related to fertility. The standard treatment option for such women is myomectomy, or surgical removal of the fibroids.\n\nHowever, myomectomy is not always possible or effective and can result in major complications including hysterectomy, according to study co-author Jo\u00e3o Martins Pisco, M.D., Ph.D., from the Department of Interventional Radiology at Saint Louis Hospital in Lisbon, Portugal.\n\nUterine fibroid embolization (UFE) is a less invasive option that involves injection of an embolic agent, typically made up of very small beads, into the uterine arteries to block the blood supply to the uterus and fibroids. As the fibroids die and begin to shrink, the uterus fully recovers. UFE can be performed in patients with a prior myomectomy or in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\nDespite its less invasive nature, UFE has yet to be fully embraced in the medical community as a fertility-preserving treatment for women with symptomatic fibroids due to concerns that the procedure may cause inadequate blood flow to the endometrium, or lining of the uterus, and the ovaries.\n\nFor the new study, Dr. Pisco and colleagues assessed pregnancy rates in 359 women with uterine fibroids who were unable to conceive and who underwent either conventional or partial UFE. In conventional UFE, all uterine artery branches are embolized. However, the partial procedure requires treatment of only the small vessels to the fibroids, leaving the corresponding larger vessels unaffected. Partial UFE may help reduce the risks of infertility associated with conventional UFE.\n\nAfter an average follow-up of almost six years, 149 of the 359 women, or 41.5 percent, had become pregnant one or more times, and 131 gave birth to a total of 150 babies. It was the first pregnancy for more than 85 percent of the women who gave birth.\n\nThe procedures had a clinical success rate of approximately 79 percent for fibroid-related symptoms. Complication rates were 14.6 percent for partial UFE and 23.1 percent for conventional UFE. The procedure was repeated in 28 patients whose fibroids had not been fully treated, as shown by MRI, and 11 of those patients subsequently got pregnant.\n\n\"Our findings show that UFE is a fertility-restoring procedure in women with uterine fibroids who wish to conceive, and pregnancy following UFE appears to be safe with low morbidity,\" Dr. Pisco said. \"Women who had been unable to conceive had normal pregnancies after UFE and similar complication rates as the general population in spite of being in a high-risk group.\"\n\nDr. Pisco suggested that UFE may become the first-line treatment for women with fibroids who wish to conceive, particularly for those with numerous or very large fibroids. Such patients have a fibroid recurrence rate of more than 60 percent after myomectomy, making UFE an important option.\n\nThe researchers are continuing the treatments and compiling data. Since the time of writing, there were 12 additional pregnancies.\n\n\"In our study there are now almost 200 newborns following UFE,\" Dr. Pisco said. \"Our next step will be a randomized study comparing the results of partial and conventional UFE.\"\n\n\"Spontaneous Pregnancy with a Live Birth after Conventional and Partial Uterine Fibroid Embolization.\" Collaborating with Dr. Pisco were Marisa Duarte, M.D., Tiago Bilhim, M.D., Ph.D., Jorge Branco, M.D., Ph.D., Fernando Cirurgi\u00e3o, M.D., Marcela Forjaz, M.D., L\u00facia Fernandes, M.D., Jos\u00e9 Pereira, M.D., Nuno Costa, M.D., Joana B.

Patients who received treatment endoscopically had shorter hospital stays and lower costs than those who had laparoscopic surgery.\n\n\"Obesity continues to be a problem in America and it is an epidemic rapidly spreading around the world,\" said Reem Z. Sharaiha, MD, MSc, assistant professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and attending physician at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, the study's lead author. \"Our research -- the first to compare these treatments -- demonstrates that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is safe and effective in helping patients lead healthier lives. It should be considered as another tool available to clinicians and patients in the fight against obesity.\"\n\nDr. Sharaiha followed 278 patients who underwent ESG (91 patients), laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (120 patients) or laparoscopic banding (67). During the one-year follow-up period, patients went to an academic bariatric center of excellence as part of their treatment.\n\nAt one-year follow-up, patients who chose laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery achieved the greatest percent total body weight loss at 29.28 percent, compared to 17.57 percent for endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty patients and 14.46 percent for laparoscopic banding patients. Researchers found that patients who received endoscopic treatment had lower complications (1 percent) than those who received surgical treatment (10 percent for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and 11 percent for laparoscopic banding).\n\nDr. Sharaiha noted that these findings do not suggest that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty will replace the two surgical treatments as weight-loss interventions. Instead, these results show that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is another possibility that patients and health-care providers should consider when discussing options.\n\nWhile endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is performed with an endoscopic device through the mouth, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy involves a small surgical incision in the belly to place a tube in the abdomen, allowing doctors to reduce the stomach's volume. With laparoscopic banding, doctors insert a tube through an incision in the belly to place a band around the stomach, restricting food intake.\n\nThe team also reported that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty patients customarily left the hospital on the same day of treatment, while laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy patients stayed for about three days and laparoscopic banding patients for a day and a half.\n\nWhen examining cost, researchers reported endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty resulted in the lowest-cost, with an average institutional procedure cost of $12,000, compared to $22,000 for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and $15,000 for laparoscopic banding.\n\n\"For years, patients seeking weight-loss interventions had limited options because they could not tolerate or did not want surgery, or it was not even an option for them,\" added Dr. Sharaiha. \"Our research shows that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty can be the treatment they've been looking for. It's less invasive than surgery and helps them reach their health goals.\"\n\nObesity is associated with heart disease, stroke, diabetes and some cancers, and researchers estimate that it is the second-leading cause of preventable death, after tobacco use. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that more than one in three U.S. adults is obese, having a body mass index of 30 or more.

It diagnoses prostate cancer that's going to actually cause harm,\" said Dr. H. Ballentine Carter, urology chief at Johns Hopkins University, who led the research published Tuesday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nThe study is far from proof that making health decisions based on so-called PSA velocity can really save lives.\n\nBut Carter contends the findings suggest that men should consider getting a baseline PSA test around age 40, instead of the more usual 50, to use as a comparison for future changes.\n\nPSA tests are used to screen men for prostate cancer, but they're imprecise. Too much PSA, or prostate-specific antigen, in a man's blood can indicate that he has either a benign enlarged prostate or cancer. Only a biopsy can tell the difference.\n\nIt's not even clear when is the best time to do a biopsy. Some men have cancer despite a \"normal\" PSA count of 4 or below. Yet routinely biopsying men with low PSA would worsen another problem, overdiagnosis. Many specialists say too many men today are undergoing side effect-prone treatment for tumors too small and slow-growing to ever threaten their lives.\n\nTwo years ago, Boston researchers reported that men whose PSA levels jumped more than 2 points the year before diagnosis were more likely to relapse and die despite prostate surgery. But those were men whose PSA levels were already fairly high.\n\nHopkins' Carter wondered if doctors could catch such men far sooner, when the cancer might be more treatable.\n\nHe turned to a study of aging that has been collecting and freezing blood samples from participants since 1958. The Hopkins team tracked PSA changes in that blood from 980 men, 20 of whom eventually died of prostate cancer and 104 of whom survived it.\n\nHow fast a man's PSA was rising a decade before his cancer was diagnosed \u2014 even before it reached that biopsy-triggering level of 4 \u2014 predicted his survival 25 years later, regardless of his ultimate cancer treatment, Carter concluded.\n\nThose with a higher PSA velocity \u2014 the level rose more than a count of 0.35 a year \u2014 had a 54 percent survival rate, while those whose PSA rose more slowly had a 92 percent survival rate.\n\nWhat does that mean for men today? That it's a good idea to order a biopsy for a man with a low but fast-rising PSA, Carter said. And men diagnosed with prostate cancer whose PSA is rising slowly may be ideal candidates for monitoring instead of surgery or other treatment, he added.\n\nA study with just 20 deaths is far too small to prove the value of PSA velocity, cautioned Dr. Durado Brooks, a prostate specialist with the American Cancer Society.\n\nStill, growing numbers of doctors are using the method already to help decide when to order a biopsy, and \"I think the study does raise the question as to whether PSA velocity may at some point be a helpful factor in determining prognosis,\" he said.\n\nThe work is \"another step on the road to more sophisticated\" prostate cancer screening and treatment, Dr. Timothy Church of the University of Minnesota wrote in an editorial accompanying the work.\n\nSome 234,000 U.S. men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year, and just over 27,000 of them will die, the cancer society estimates.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not mention any costs of PSA testing (or the number of tests over what period of time are\u00a0needed to determine PSA velocity).\u00a0 ", "answer": 0}, {"article": "A Japanese drug company is offering up a big claim: Shionogi & Co. says it has an experimental pill that can kill the flu virus within a single day, according to news reports.\n\nIn a clinical trial, a single dose of the drug made by the pharmaceutical company eliminated the virus from people's bodies in a median time of 24 hours, The Wall Street Journal reported.

It's the same technology used since the 1980s to blast kidney stones, an application called lithotripsy, but for foot problems doctors use less intense shock waves.\n\nShock-wave therapy for plantar fasciitis is beginning to catch on around the U.S., partly since this stubborn type of foot pain is so common -- and so difficult to treat. Nearly 2 million Americans seek care for plantar fasciitis (pronounced PLAN-tar FASH-ee-EYE-tus) every year.\n\nTheodore tells Cassidy Driscoll that shock-wave therapy gives her a 60 to 80 percent chance of reducing her pain by half; about one-quarter of patients will become pain-free from the treatment.\n\nAfter the 20-minute treatment, Cassidy Driscoll says she felt no pain, only a sort of tapping. She gets off the table, walks out of Theodore's office and drives herself home. Two days later, she says her foot felt bruised, but she didn't have enough pain to require medication.\n\nCassidy Driscoll will pay $1,000 for the treatment. Elsewhere the charge can range from $500 to several thousand dollars. But most insurers won't pay for it, because they consider it experimental.\n\nStudies have given conflicting results, partly because there's no standardized way of doing shock-wave therapy. Different doctors use different sources of energy, different doses and a differing number of treatments.\n\n\"Is it rock-solid science that everyone agrees on? I would say no,\" says Dr. Naven Duggal, another Harvard orthopedic surgeon at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.\n\nDuggal is not impressed with reported success rates.\n\n\"Sixty to 80 percent [success] for something that somebody's not going to get guaranteed pain relief -- in my mind, it's not something I would go for,\" Duggal says.\n\nDuggal says foot specialists don't really know what causes the pain of plantar fasciitis.\n\nThe plantar fascia is a tough, rubber-band-like structure on the bottom of the foot.\n\nIt has to be strong, because every time the foot strikes the ground, the plantar fascia bears the body's full weight. In high-impact activities like running, the forces even exceed the actual weight because it's so concentrated in a narrow spot where the fascia attaches to the heel bone. That's presumably why sufferers of plantar fasciitis feel the pain in the heel.\n\nConcepts of what plantar fasciitis is have changed in recent years. Doctors used to think it occurred because the fascia became inflamed \u2013- in fact, the suffix \"-itis\" denotes inflammation. But while inflammation can be involved in plantar fasciitis, it doesn't seem to be the cause, Duggal says.\n\nMany think that plantar fasciitis is caused by heel spurs, bony hook-like growths that develop on many people's heels due to stress. But specialists don't think that anymore.\n\nAs ideas of what plantar fasciitis is change, so have treatments. Doctors don't do surgery for it anymore except in rare cases, largely because they've found surgery often makes people worse off.\n\n\"Patients have to be patient,\" Duggal says. \"They have to understand that this condition unfortunately is not fully understood.\"\n\nHe's interested in another experimental treatment that's just entering clinical trials. It's called platelet-rich plasma, and it involves isolating blood cells called platelets from patients' own blood and injecting them into the plantar fascia. Though platelets are best known for their role in initiating blood clots, they also contain growth factors. So the hope is that platelet injections will stimulate healing without the damaging effects of shock-wave therapy. But it will be some years before that approach is proven -- or not.\n\nMeanwhile, foot specialists and their patients are left with a smattering of low-tech treatments that they say all plantar fasciitis patients should try, whether or not they eventually go on to shock-wave therapy.\n\n-- Icing the bottom of the foot, sometimes using ice to massage the heel area\n\n-- Using cups made of gel in shoes to cushion the heel (and many orthopedic surgeons say expensive custom-made orthotics are not necessary)\n\n-- Wearing a night splint, a simple brace that holds the foot in a flexed position to keep the plantar fascia stretched during sleep\n\n-- Physical therapy, though some studies indicate that some PT practices such as ultrasound and whirlpool are not helpful\n\n-- Use of NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) drugs such as ibuprofen and naproxen\n\n-- Corticosteroid injections into the heel, though this is controversial and should not be used repeatedly\n\n-- Backing off activities like running until the pain goes away, and then reinitiating them gradually\n\nAbout 90 percent of sufferers will get better with time. Duggal says he advises patients to try a combination of these measures for at least a year.\n\nKaren Firestone, a 54-year-old Boston businesswoman and avid runner, says that techniques like stretching, icing and taping were effective for her. She started having plantar fascia pain last summer, and on Duggal's advice has been diligent about doing everything she can to heal the problem.\n\n\"The stretching, the icing, the taping -- I do all these little pieces of help for my body, and it responds,\" Firestone says. \"So I think people should take that message and go with it.\"\n\nAfter a few months, she's back to running -- but shorter distances.

The diet is aimed primarily at people with irritable bowel syndrome, a common condition in which abdominal pain and irregular bowel habits \u2014 with diarrhea, constipation or both \u2014 can wax and wane for years.\n\nFollowers are asked to eliminate, and then try to reintroduce, a long list of foods containing certain carbohydrates that might trigger gas, bloating, pain and diarrhea. FODMAP is an acronym for those carbohydrates: fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols.\n\nThe theory is that FODMAPs, found in many fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy foods and sweeteners, are poorly digested by susceptible people. The undigested carbohydrates can draw extra fluid into the digestive tract and end up in the colon, where they are \u201cfeasted upon\u201d and fermented by gut microbes, leading to all sorts of misery, says Lauren Van Dam, a registered dietitian at the University of Michigan.\n\nIf giving up some foods might lessen that misery, many people are game, she says. \u201cWe have some patients that are literally housebound because they are worried they are going to have an accident or because they have terrible pain,\u201d Van Dam says.\n\nBarbara DeLancey, a 63-year-old registered nurse from Ann Arbor, says she was crippled by 10-times-a-day diarrhea when she agreed to try the diet a year ago. \u201cI was resistant at first because it seemed so restrictive,\u201d she says. She got teary-eyed at the grocery store, seeing all the food she could not have.\n\nBut eventually she learned she could tolerate and add back some favorites, including garlic and apples. She credits the diet, along with medication, with a big reduction in her symptoms, but says \u201cit has not been a miracle cure.\u201d\n\nThe diet has generated enough interest to prompt some food companies to introduce low-FODMAP products \u2014 hoping for a market surpassing that for gluten-free foods, according to some industry reports.\n\nIn 2014, IBS treatment guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology said the diet showed promise, but that the quality of evidence was \u201cvery low.\"\n\nSince then, several studies have strengthened the case for the diet, says guideline co-author Brian Lacy, a professor of medicine and chief of gastroenterology at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, N.H. Still, one study from Sweden showed no advantage over a less-restrictive dietary approach that eliminates fewer foods and stresses changes such as smaller, more frequent meals.\n\n\"The data are not overwhelming,\u201d Lacy says. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s a reasonable thing to try.\u201d\n\nThe largest study so far, with 92 patients, was conducted at University of Michigan. It found that 52% of low-FODMAP patients and 41% of patients on a less-restrictive diet reported \u201cadequate relief.\u201d The difference was not statistically significant, says study co-author William Chey, a professor of gastroenterology. But low-FODMAP patients did get significantly better relief from pain and bloating and greater gains in mood, body image and overall quality of life, he says.\n\nMedications, probiotics, fiber supplements and other approaches still have roles in treating IBS, and no one approach works for all patients, Chey and Lacy say.\n\nIt\u2019s not known if the diet leads to any nutritional deficiencies or keeps working in the long run \u2014 especially for patients who get little support from doctors or dietitians.\n\n\u201cPhysicians are largely administering the diet by giving patients sheets of paper with foods to exclude,\u201d Chey says. Ideally, all would be referred to dietitians, Chey and Lacy agree. But few dietitians are trained in the diet, and insurers typically do not cover the visits, Lacy notes.\n\nWhen patients do make their way to Kate Scarlata, a Boston area registered dietitian who specializes in the diet, the first thing she tells them is that it \u201cis a dietary experiment. It\u2019s a short-term learning diet.\u201d\n\nVan Dam does the same \u2014 explaining that after a few weeks she will help clients reintroduce foods one carbohydrate category at a time.\n\n\u201cMost are able to identify some high-FODMAP foods they can tolerate very well and some they can tolerate a little, but not in high portions every day,\u201d she says. \u201cOur goal is for them to be on the most varied, nutritious diet possible.\u201d\n\nThe trickiest part is avoiding onions and garlic, the dietitians say. They teach clients strategies such as using (safe) garlic-infused oils, avoiding restaurant sauces and soups and topping salads with oil and vinegar.\n\nHigh- and low-FODMAP food lists are updated frequently at websites and apps run by the University of Michigan and Monash University in Australia.\n\nHere is a sampling from the Michigan site.

Such fasting already shows benefits after only six weeks. This is according to a study by Kyoung-Han Kim and Yun Hye Kim in the journal Cell Research which is published by Springer Nature. Intermittent fasting in mice helped to kick-start the animals' metabolism and to burn fat by generating body heat. The research team was led by Hoon-Ki Sung of The Hospital for Sick Children in Ontario, Canada.\n\nResearch has shown that our unhealthy eating habits and sedentary lifestyles are playing a major role in the development of lifestyle-related metabolic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and obesity. For this reason, dietary interventions like intermittent fasting are gaining popularity to treat conditions such as obesity.\n\nThe research team in this study wanted to better understand the reactions that interventions such as fasting trigger on a molecular level in the body. They exposed groups of mice to sixteen weeks of intermittent fasting. The recurring regimen saw the animals being fed for two days, followed by one day without anything to eat. Their calorie intake was not adjusted otherwise. Four months later the mice in the fasting group weighed less than those in the control group who continued to eat the same volume of food. The lower body weight of the mice in the fasting group was not the only effect. The fasting regime helped lower fat build-up in the white fat by increasing the brown-like fat (involved in burning energy and producing body heat) of mice on the high fat diet. Their glucose and insulin systems also remained more stable. In a further experiment, similar benefits were already seen after only six weeks of intermittent fasting.\n\nThrough an analysis into the underlying biology involved, the researchers found that such intermittent fasting tempers an immune reaction in fat cells. There are changes in certain gene pathways involved in the immune system and the body's reaction to inflammation. A type of white blood cell known to play a role in fighting inflammation is triggered. Known as anti-inflammatory macrophages, these cells stimulate the fat cells to burn stored fats or lipids by generating heat. This happens during periods of intermittent fasting because there is an increase in vascular growth factor (VEGF) that help form blood vessels and activate anti-inflammatory macrophage.\n\n\"Intermittent fasting without a reduction in calorie intake can be a preventative and therapeutic approach against obesity and metabolic disorders,\" says Kyoung-Han Kim.\n\n\"Strikingly, these fasting-stimulated changes in the growth of vascular cells and subsequent immune alterations occur even after a single cycle of 24-hour fasting, and are completely reversed when mice start eating again,\" adds Yun Hye Kim.\n\nReference: Kim, K-H. et al (2017).

This will help for that,\u201d Destounis said.\n\nIn the study, women were divided into two groups, one that received an invitation to have breast cancer screening and another that received usual care.\n\nThe screening phase of the trial lasted about seven years. Women between 40 and 49 were screened every two years, and women 50 to 74 were screened roughly every three years.\n\n\u201cOur results indicate that in 1,000 women screened for 10 years, three breast cancer deaths would be prevented,\u201d Duffy said, adding that most of the deaths prevented would have occurred more than a decade after the screening had started.\n\n\u201cThis indicates that the long-term benefits of screening in terms of deaths prevented are more than double those often quoted for short-term follow-up.\u201d\n\nThe new data adds to evidence on the long-term benefits of regular mammography screening.\n\nNew breast screening recommendations issued in 2009 by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an influential advisory group, recommended against routine mammograms for women in their 40s and said women in their 50s should get mammograms every other year instead of every year.\n\nThe guidelines contradicted years of messages about the need for routine breast cancer screening starting at age 40, eliciting protests from breast cancer experts and advocacy groups who argued the recommendation for fewer screenings would confuse women and result in more deaths from breast cancer.\n\nThe changes were meant to spare women some of the worry and expense of extra tests needed to distinguish between cancer and harmless lumps. But the latest results from the Swedish study show the rate of false positive results was low.\n\n\u201cWe saw the actual number of overdiagnosed cases was really very small \u2014 less than 5 percent of the total,\u201d Robert Smith, director of cancer screening at the American Cancer Society and one of the study\u2019s authors, said in a telephone interview.\n\nMany groups, including the American Cancer Society, have stuck by their long-standing recommendations of a yearly breast exam for women starting at age 40, stressing that the breast X-rays have been proven to save lives by spotting tumors early, when they are most easily treated.\n\n\u201cI think for anybody who was beginning to have their faith shaken in the value of mammography, these data show mammography is quite valuable as a public health approach to reducing deaths from breast cancer,\u201d Smith said.\n\nDuffy said he thinks screening women 40 to 54 every 18 months and screening women 55 and older every two years would be a reasonable schedule.\n\nHe said the new findings do not speak to the frequency of screening issue, but they do make clear that screening works.\n\n\u201cEveryone must make up their own mind, but certainly from combined results from all the screening trials, mammography in women aged 40-49 does reduce deaths from breast cancer,\u201d he said.\n\nBreast cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death among U.S. women, after lung cancer.

A new study identifies patterns of communication that can help couples affected by Alzheimer\u2019s maintain a sense of connection, which could improve quality of life for both partners.\n\nPrevious research on communication in couples affected by Alzheimer\u2019s has tended to focus on deficits, said study author Christine Williams, professor and director of the PhD in Nursing program at Florida Atlantic University\u2019s Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing. Identifying patterns that help couples maintain their bond could make it easier for caregiving spouses to find meaning and improve satisfaction with their marriage.\n\n\u201cNo one is looking at it from the perspective of what these couples are doing right, what is helping,\u201d said Williams, whose findings were published in the International Journal for Human Caring. \u201cSome past research has involved a caregiver giving directions and seeing if his or her spouse [with Alzheimer\u2019s] can follow. A relationship is obviously so much more than that.\u201d\n\nMembers of Williams\u2019s research team visited 15 couples in their home once a week for 10 weeks. The couples, who were recruited from a day program for people with memory disorders and their spouses, were receiving coaching in communication, with caregivers learning to listen, to avoid arguing, to not treat their spouse like a child. Twice during the 10 weeks, the couples were asked to discuss a topic of their choosing while the researcher left the room. A total of thirty 10-minute conversations were recorded.\n\nIn analyzing the recordings, Williams identified 10 communication patterns that caregiving spouses used to connect with their partners and show affection. These patterns showed the caregivers applying what they\u2019d learned through coaching in creative ways, she said. They included sharing news about friends or relatives or plans for the day as a way to involve their spouse in day-to-day events; waiting patiently and keeping eye contact while spouses searched for words; and finding alternate ways to communicate \u2014 for example, singing songs together when attempts to engage the spouse in certain topics failed.\n\nThe caregiving spouses seemed to value their partners\u2019 efforts to communicate as much as or more than the actual content of their conversations. They were willing to listen to stories they had heard before, and resisted correcting their partners\u2019 versions of past events. This showed that they \u201cvalue the relationship more than being right,\u201d Williams said.\n\nSome of the caregivers did voice frustration or tried to teach their partners information they had forgotten. Future research might focus on interventions that could help diffuse these frustrations, the paper noted. Yet Williams hopes that the more supportive and positive communication patterns that many of the caregivers showed will help nurses coach spouses and family members affected by Alzheimer\u2019s. Previous research has found that communication decline among people with dementia is a significant source of stress to caregivers, and most say they need education about communication.\n\n\u201cThe reality is, a person with dementia isn\u2019t going to have a dramatic breakthrough and remember things forgotten,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAt the same time, people with Alzheimer\u2019s do have moments of clarity or show affection when it\u2019s unexpected.

Neoptolemos, of the Cancer Research U.K. Liverpool Cancer Trials Unit at the University of Liverpool in England, and colleagues.\n\nThe study authors noted that, currently, the prognosis for pancreatic cancer is very poor, with a five-year survival rate of less than 5 percent. Surgery to remove cancerous tissue can boost the odds to as much as 10 percent, however, and there is active search underway to improve a patient's chances even more by adding in additional chemotherapy following surgery.\n\nThe pool of nearly 1,100 patients that the researchers focused on were part of the large European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer trial that took place across 159 pancreatic cancer centers located in Europe, Canada, Australasia and Japan.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2007, the participants were divided into one of two six-month chemotherapy groups: one receiving fluorouracil and folinic acid post-surgery and the other receiving gemcitabine.\n\nAfter nearly three years of treatment, the researchers found almost no difference between survival rates in the two groups.\n\nThose who received fluorouracil and folinic acid chemotherapy had lived an average of 23 months. At the one- and two-year markers, survival rates for that group was approximately 78.5 and 48 percent, respectively.\n\nAt the three-year mark, patients on the gemcitabine regimen achieved an average survival rate of 23.6 months. One- and two-year survival rates were 80 and 49 percent, respectively, the investigators found.\n\n\"In conclusion, gemcitabine did not result in improved overall survival compared with fluorouracil plus folinic acid in patients with [surgically removed] pancreatic cancer,\" the authors concluded in their report.\n\nHowever, the team did observe one appreciable difference: patients on gemcitabine were less likely to experience serious side effects as a result of their chemotherapy treatment than those on the fluorouracil/folinic acid treatment (7.5 percent versus 14 percent).\n\nDr. Michael Choti, a professor of surgery and oncology at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, described the study as \"important,\" but he does not believe it will alter the current approach to post-surgical chemotherapy.\n\n\"Really in the scope of things following major surgery, both are fairly tolerable regimens, and this study doesn't necessarily change the pattern of use in terms of choosing post-operative therapy,\" Choti said.\n\n\"But the point is that pancreatic cancer is a terrible disease, and really just a minority of patients are candidates for surgery. And even for those, unfortunately 75 to 80 percent of those will go on to recur even after the surgery appears to be successful. So, indeed, there has been a strong interest in giving the best additional therapy possible,\" Choti added.\n\n\"So this is not a revolutionary finding, but it's part of an effort to look at what we have and even to find newer regimens with more combinations of drugs,\" he noted. \"And that's exactly what's already underway, as we search for more aggressive and more successful treatments.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more information on pancreatic cancer.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Costs of these chemotherapy agents are not discussed.

When the tumors are then surgically removed, most people live five years or more, in striking contrast to patients whose cancers are found only after they experience symptoms.\n\nThe study of nearly 32,000 people in eight countries boosts hope that early detection by CAT scans may reduce the death toll of lung cancer, much as mammography has done for breast cancer. But while the research clearly shows that the interval between diagnosis and death was longer in screened patients, it does not definitively show they lived longer -- a subtle difference with significant public health consequences.\n\nLung cancer kills about 162,000 Americans a year and is the leading cause of cancer death in men and women. Only 15 percent of people with the disease survive five years from the time it is diagnosed.\n\nWhat it will take to prove that CAT scans are either useful or a waste of time and money is a matter of great controversy.\n\nSome people, including many treatment advocates, think there is enough evidence to urge all heavy smokers to have routine CAT scans. Others, including researchers and policymakers in the government, say it is a question that will not be settled for five or six years, when other studies are complete.\n\nThe new research, which appears in today's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, seems destined to heat up that argument.\n\n\"I think it provides valuable information on many things.

This was achieved by assessing the DNA of 80,000 prostate cancer patients and 61,000 men without the disease.\n\nThe resulting test hones in on these and the existing 100 known markers to pinpoint the 1 percent of men who are at six times greater risk of developing the condition, and the 10 percent of men who have a threefold greater risk of developing the disease, a study author told The Guardian.\n\nThe new method is being trialed on 300 men in doctors' offices across London, and is due to be expanded to 5,000 next year, according to BBC News.\n\nIf it is found to be effective, it could be an important tool for physicians. Although prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. after lung, few risk factors have been found, and it is difficult to accurately diagnose.\n\nMost men with prostate cancer do not experience symptoms. Doctors can use the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test to detect protein produced by prostate and cancerous cells, respectively. But as these antigens can be present in men without the cancer, it carries a risk of returning a false positive that can kick-start unnecessary, life-changing treatment. Rectal examinations and biopsies are also used to test for the disease.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, over 160,600 new cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed each year, and around 29,400 people die of the disease. The condition is rare in those below the age of 40; older men and African-Americans are most at risk. The majority of cases are caught at around 66.\n\nRosalind Eeles, an author of the study at the U.K.-based Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) who specializes in finding genetic variants that increase the risk of prostate cancer, told The Guardian the team is \u201cexcited by the test\u201d because it can be used by doctors to offer patients targeted screenings.\n\nCarl Alexander, a spokesman from the charity Cancer Research UK, said: \u201cThis study is an exciting example of how research can find clues in our genes to help us uncover those more likely to develop the disease.

A group of researchers led by Dr. Christine Beeton at Baylor College of Medicine has found that one of the hundreds of components in scorpion venom can reduce the severity of the disease in animal models, without inducing side effects associated with similar treatments. The study appears in the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.\n\n\"Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease - one in which the immune system attacks its own body. In this case, it affects the joints,\" said Beeton, associate professor of molecular physiology and biophysics and member Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center at Baylor College of Medicine. \"Cells called fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) play a major role in the disease. As they grow and move from joint to joint, they secrete products that damage the joints and attract immune cells that cause inflammation and pain. As damage progresses, the joints become enlarged and are unable to move.\"\n\nCurrent treatments target the immune cells involved in the disease and none are specific for FLS. Beeton and her colleagues studied FLS looking for an 'Achilles' heel' that would allow them to prevent or stop them from damaging the joints.\n\n\"In previous work, we identified a potassium channel on FLS of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and found that the channel was very important for the development of the disease,\" Beeton said. \"We wanted to find a way to block the channel to stop the cells damaging the joints.\"\n\nPotassium channels work by opening gates on the surface of cells that allow potassium ions - small charged atoms - to flow in and out of the cell. The flow of ions through the channels is necessary for the cells to carry out many of their essential functions. Animals such as scorpions have venoms that block potassium and other ion channels. They use the venoms to paralyze and kill prey. Decades ago, scientists discovered this and realized that, if handled correctly, venoms also might have medicinal applications.\n\nScorpion venom may lead to improved treatments for rheumatoid arthritis\n\n\"Scorpion venom has hundreds of different components. One of the components in the venom of the scorpion called Buthus tamulus specifically blocks the potassium channel of FLS and not the channels in other cells such as those of the nervous system,\" said first author Dr. Mark Tanner, a graduate student in the Beeton lab during the development of this project. \"Here, we investigated whether this venom component, called iberiotoxin, would be able to specifically block the FLS potassium channel and reduce the severity of the rheumatoid arthritis in rat models of the disease.\"\n\nWhen the researchers treated rat models of the disease with iberiotoxin, they stopped the progression of the disease. In some cases they reversed the signs of established disease, meaning that the animals had better joint mobility and less inflammation in their joints. In addition, treatment with iberiotoxin did not induce side effects, such as tremors and incontinence, observed when treating with another channel blocker called paxilline.\n\n\"It was very exciting to see that iberiotoxin is very specific for the potassium channel in FLS and that it did not seem to affect the channels in other types of cells, which might explain the lack of tremors and incontinence,\" Tanner said.\n\n\"Although these results are promising, much more research needs to be conducted before we can use scorpion venom components to treat rheumatoid arthritis,\" Beeton said. \"We think that this venom component, iberiotoxin, can become the basis for developing a new treatment for rheumatoid arthritis in the future.\"\n\nOther contributors of this work include Michael W.

(\"Primary insomnia\" means that medical problems, medicines, or other substances have been ruled out as a cause of sleep difficulties. The more common type of insomnia is \"secondary insomnia,\" in which medical issues or medications contribute.)\n\nOf the patients with insomnia, the average age was 45 and nine were women. Participants slept for two nights in a sleep lab with no cap; two nights with the cap set at a \"neutral\" temperature (about 86 degrees Fahrenheit); two nights at a moderately cool temperature (72 degrees Fahrenheit); and two nights with the coolest temperature (57 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nWhile the participants slept, researchers monitored their brain electrical activity, eye movements (to determine if someone was in REM, or rapid eye movement sleep) and jaw muscle tone (during REM, the muscles go slack due to 'sleep paralysis').\n\nIn this preliminary study, about three-quarters of those with insomnia said the cap helped them sleep better when the water temperature was about 57 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nAt higher temperatures -- 72 and 86 degrees -- patients reported no benefit, according to the study presented Monday at SLEEP 2011, the Associated Professional Sleep Societies meeting in Minneapolis.\n\nWhile wearing the cooling cap, it took insomnia patients an average of 13 minutes to fall asleep and they spent 89 percent of their time in bed actually sleeping, about the same as controls who didn't have insomnia (the latter group averaged 16 minutes to fall asleep and 89 percent of the time in bed sleeping) .\n\nThe cooling cap was, however, associated with an increased amount of slow-wave sleep -- or the deepest, restorative portion of sleep, the researchers reported.\n\n\"What we wanted to find out was: 'Would cooling the surface of the brain of insomnia patients result in lower metabolism and improved sleep? The basic answer in this preliminary study, is yes, it seems to work, and it works in two ways,\" said Buysse. \"It does reduce brain metabolism in the frontal lobes, and it improves sleep.\"\n\nDr. William Kohler, medical director of the Florida Sleep Institute, said the concept was exciting and worth further research in larger studies that include body temperature measurements and brain imaging tests.\n\n\"The theoretical concept is correct, in that we do know from many previous studies that as the body core temperature cools, our sleep improves, and with warming of the core temperature, we have more restless sleep,\" Kohler said.\n\nChronic insomnia -- which the American Academy of Sleep Medicine attributes to about one out of every 10 Americans -- can be difficult to treat. Medications can help, although many people complain of side effects, Kohler said. The most effective treatment is cognitive behavior therapy, which involves changes such as avoiding cigarettes, alcohol and caffeine before bed, and getting plenty of bright light in the morning but turning off the TV, computer and dimming the lights during a wind-down period, among other techniques for improving \"sleep hygiene.\"\n\n\"It's in the brain where the chemical changes are occurring that lead to sleep,\" he said.\n\nThe cap is not yet available to consumers, although the lead researcher, Dr. Eric Nofzinger, has plans to bring it to market, Buysse said.\n\nBecause this study was extremely small and presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal and confirmed in larger studies.\n\nBuysee said there shouldn't be any safety issues.

Older people tend to get less slow-wave sleep and are at greater risk for memory impairment.\n\nZee and her fellow researchers had 13 adults ages 60 and older spend two nights in a sleep lab. On both nights, the participants took a memory test at night, went to sleep wearing headphones and an electrode cap, and repeated the memory test in the morning.\n\nOn one of those nights, headphone-clad participants were played a series of short bursts of pink noise during deep sleep, spaced out enough to prevent the brain from getting used to and ignoring them. \u201cThe noise is fairly pleasant; it kind of resembles a rush of water,\u201d says Zee. \u201cIt\u2019s just noticeable enough that the brain realizes it\u2019s there, but not enough to disturb sleep.\u201d The sounds were timed to match their slow-wave oscillations. No noise was played during the other night.\n\nAfter analyzing everyone\u2019s sleep waves, the team found that people\u2019s slow-wave oscillations increased on the nights punctuated by pink noise.

The latest investigation from the US team pinpoints which cells are important and how they might work.\n\nIn the first of a series of experiments in mice, Cai showed that neural stem cells, which are found in a handful of brain regions at birth, disappear from the hypothalamus over time. The stem cells are known to form fresh brain cells in youth, but the process slows down dramatically in adults. Though small, the hypothalamus forms a crucial connection between the body\u2019s nervous and hormonal systems.\n\nTo test whether the decline in stem cells was causing ageing, and not itself a result of old age, the researchers injected mice with a toxin that wiped out 70% of their neural stem cells. The effect was striking. Over the next few months the mice aged more rapidly than usual, and performed much worse than control animals on a battery of tests of endurance, coordination, social behaviour and ability to recognise objects. \u201cBehaviourally mice aged faster when these cells were removed during early ageing,\u201d Cai told the Guardian. The animals died months earlier than healthy control animals.\n\nNext, the scientists looked at what happened when aged mice received injections of fresh neural stem cells. This time the mice lived longer than controls, typically several months more, an increase of about 15%. If a similar extension was achieved in humans, a person with a life expectancy of 80 years could live to 92.\n\nHaving proved that it was neural stem cells that were important for ageing, the scientists ran further tests to work out what the cells were doing. They found that molecules called microRNAs, or miRNAs, that are released from neural stem cells were responsible for most of the ageing effects. When the molecules are produced in the hypothalamus, they flow into the clear fluid in the brain and spinal cord and affect how genes operate.\n\n\u201cThe mechanism is partially due to these cells secreting certain miRNAs which help maintain youth, and the loss of these leads to ageing\u201d said Cai, whose study is published in Nature. The next step is to create human neural stem cells in the lab for testing.\n\n\u201cIt is a tour de force,\u201d said David Sinclair at Harvard Medical School. \u201cIt\u2019s a breakthrough. The brain controls how long we live. I can see a day when we are implanted with stem cells or treated with stem cell RNAs that improve our health and extend our lives.

But experts said they were optimistic the results will hold up in the larger, longer-term trials already underway.\n\nWhat's most exciting, they said, is that the triple-drug approach could open up new options to nearly all cystic fibrosis patients.\n\n\"This is not a cure for cystic fibrosis,\" stressed Dr. Steven Rowe, who led one of the trials. \"But it could be game-changing.\"\n\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that causes persistent lung infections. Over time, extensive lung damage leads to respiratory failure. At one time, children with CF usually died before they reached school age. But with improved treatments, the typical life expectancy is now about 40 years, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.\n\nCystic fibrosis is caused by various mutations in a gene called CFTR. In the past several years, drugs that target those underlying genetics have become available. Known as CFTR modulators, they were heralded as a major advance in treating the disorder.\n\nHowever, they work well only for a small number of people with certain CFTR mutations, explained Rowe, director of the Cystic Fibrosis Research Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n\nThe most common mutation that causes cystic fibrosis is called F508del -- and it has proven tougher to tackle, Rowe said.\n\nAbout half of people with CF carry two copies of the mutation (one inherited from each parent). For them, a combination of two existing CFTR modulators can ease breathing problems -- but the overall effects are only \"modest,\" Rowe said.\n\nThen there's the 30 percent of CF patients who carry only one copy of F508del, plus another defect known as a \"minimal-function\" mutation. For them, the existing CFTR modulators do not work at all.\n\nBoth new trials focused on those two groups of patients. The results are published in the Oct. 18 New England Journal of Medicine, to coincide with the researchers' presentation at a North American Cystic Fibrosis meeting, in Denver.\n\nRowe's team tested a combination of two available CFTR modulators -- tezacaftor and ivacaftor -- plus an experimental one, known as VX-659. The other trial used the same existing drugs, along with a similar new drug, dubbed VX-445.\n\nRowe's team randomly assigned 54 adults with cystic fibrosis to either take the triple-drug regimen or be in a comparison group. In the comparison group, patients with one F508del mutation took placebo pills, while patients with two copies of the mutation took tezacaftor and ivacaftor alone.\n\nAfter four weeks, the trial found, the triple-drug therapy had improved lung function in patients with both types of mutations. Their performance on a test called FEV1 rose by as much as 13 percentage points, on average -- what Rowe described as a \"pronounced improvement.\"\n\nThe other trial had nearly identical results.\n\nThis is the first time, Rowe said, that CFTR modulator therapy has \"pushed the needle\" for patients with one F508del mutation.\n\nAn editorial published with the studies said they \"represent a major breakthrough.\"\n\nNow the questions are whether the improved lung function can be sustained, and whether the drugs prevent symptom exacerbations and other complications, wrote Dr. Fernando Holguin, of the University of Colorado, Aurora.\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing both experimental drugs.\n\n\"The ability of these potential drugs to treat individuals with a single F508del mutation means that more people than ever before could benefit,\" said Dr. Michael Boyle, senior vice president for therapeutics at the foundation. \"This is very exciting news for our community.\"\n\nRowe agreed there are still important questions about the triple-drug regimens. One is, how well do they work for younger patients?\n\nPatients as young as 12 are included in the larger ongoing trials, Rowe said.\n\nSo far, the treatments appear safe. Most side effects in the four-week trials were \"mild to moderate,\" the researchers said, and included cough, headache and increased sputum.\n\nIf the experimental drugs are ultimately approved, there will be the real-world issue of price.\n\nVertex currently markets the combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor as Symdeko -- at a reported list price of $292,000 a year.\n\nIn the United States, more than 30,000 people have cystic fibrosis, according to the foundation.\n\nFor an overview of cystic fibrosis, visit the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story brought up the \u201creal-world issue of price\u201d if the drugs are approved.

A new study finds that kids in the U.S. preschool program tend to have a healthier weight by kindergarten than similarly aged kids not in the program.\n\nIn their first year in Head Start, obese and overweight kids lost weight faster than two comparison groups of children who weren't in the program, researchers found. Similarly, underweight kids bulked up faster.\n\n\"Participating in Head Start may be an effective and broad-reaching strategy for preventing and treating obesity in United States preschoolers,\" said lead researcher Dr. Julie Lumeng, an associate professor at the University of Michigan Center for Human Growth and Development.\n\nFederally funded Head Start, which is free for 3- to 5-year-olds living in poverty, helps children prepare for kindergarten. The program is designed to build stable family relationships, improve children's physical and emotional well-being and develop strong learning skills.\n\nHealth benefits, including weight loss, seem to be a byproduct of the program, said Dr. David Katz, director of the Yale University Prevention Research Center.\n\n\"This paper importantly suggests that some of the best strategies for controlling weight and promoting health may have little directly to do with either,\" said Katz, who wasn't involved in the study.\n\nHead Start might provide a structured, supervised routine that's lacking in the home, Katz suggested. \"Perhaps the program fosters better mental health in the children, which in turn leads to better eating,\" he said.\n\n\"Whatever the exact mechanisms, by fostering well-being in one way, we tend to foster it in others, even unintended,\" Katz said. \"The essence of this study is the holistic nature of social, psychological and physical health.\"\n\nAlmost one-quarter of preschool-aged children in the United States are overweight or obese, and obesity rates within Head Start populations are higher than national estimates, the study authors noted. Because obesity in childhood tends to continue into adulthood, experts worry that these children are at risk of future health problems.\n\nFor the study, Lumeng's team collected data on more than 43,700 Michigan preschool-age children between 2005 and 2013. More than 19,000 were in Head Start. Information on the others -- 5,400 of whom were on Medicaid, the publicly financed insurance program for the poor -- came from two primary health care groups.

The study is being published online in Menopause, the journal of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS).\n\nCompared with women who undergo natural menopause, women with breast cancer are at a greater risk of experiencing hot flashes, partially as a result of the premature menopause that results from chemotherapy and surgery, as well as estrogen deficiency caused by the use of breast cancer treatments such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors. It is estimated that by the year 2020 there will be nearly six million breast cancer survivors in the United States.\n\nResearchers analyzed data from a randomized, controlled trial involving 58 breast cancer survivors experiencing bothersome hot flashes. They compared the benefits of using electro-acupuncture (the application of a pulsating electric current) to prescribing gabapentin, an anti-seizure medication frequently prescribed to treat sleep disturbances related to hot flashes. The study showed electro-acupuncture to be comparable to, if not better than, gabapentin in helping to reduce hot flash severity and frequency and improving overall sleep quality (including falling asleep faster and fewer sleep disruptions). Although it is not exactly understood how acupuncture affects sleep, it has been shown to affect a number of neurotransmitters associated with sleep, such as serotonin and melatonin.\n\nPoor sleep is particularly bothersome for breast cancer survivors experiencing nighttime hot flashes because it has been shown to increase levels of pain, fatigue, depression and anxiety. Although electro-acupuncture produced significant sleep improvements, researchers noted that sleep quality for the participants was still not as good as it should be, implying that more research is necessary to explore possible combinations of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments.\n\n\"This study shows that, for women who need or choose to avoid medications, electro-acupuncture may be an option because it has minimal risks, but blinded controlled trials are needed,\" says Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, NAMS executive director.\n\nFunding for the study was provided in part by a grant from the National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute Cancer Center.\n\nFounded in 1989, The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) is North America's leading nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting the health and quality of life of all women during midlife and beyond through an understanding of menopause and healthy aging.

The sensitivity may also trigger or exacerbate headaches.\n\nWhile sunglasses can provide some relief from photophobia, wearing them all the time is not always a practical solution, nor is it pleasant for patients to live in a dark room for days at a time. A new study from the University of Cincinnati (UC), published online this week in the Journal of Athletic Training, assessed the use of colored lenses in post-concussion patients and found wearing certain color-tinted sunglasses may be a good alternative to dark sunglasses.\n\n\"While sunglasses can provide some relief, they are not very practical indoors or in low light environments,\" says Joe Clark, PhD, professor in the Department of Neurology and Rehabilitation Medicine at the UC College of Medicine and lead author of the study. \"What is needed is a light mitigation strategy that can be readily employed indoors, which can optimize relief in those who suffer from photophobia, or light sensitivity.\"\n\nClark and researchers at the College of Medicine assessed visual symptoms of 51 concussion patients and used frames with varying colored lenses to find out if certain hues provided relief from photophobia.\n\n\"We found that 85 percent of patients reporting photophobia had relief of the symptoms with one or more colors-- blue, green, red and purple--with no reported adverse events,\" Clark says.\n\n\"Sensitivity to light can be common and impact activities of daily life suggesting that light mitigation might improve quality of life in many of these patients. Photophobia is a common symptom for patients following traumatic brain injury. Our goal in this study was to provide medical staff like athletic trainers with a method and means to assess and subsequently provide relief to an athlete who may be experiencing symptoms of photophobia,\" Clark adds.\n\nThe goal is to help the concussion patient feel better as the brain heals. \"We compare the colored glasses to being like a brace or cast but for the brain,\" he says. \"It is temporary but prevents further injury or pain.\"\n\nAt least 3.8 million people in the United States sustain a concussion or traumatic brain injury every year, many not for the first time. As with many other health conditions, the presentation of concussion symptoms can vary greatly--while some individuals exhibit very little to no change in functionality and may report no symptoms at all, others may report confusion, headache, decreased balance and vision disturbances including blurry vision, trouble focusing and sensitivity to light.\n\nPhotophobia is so common that many neurosurgical intensive care units consider it standard operating procedure to keep lights dimmed in rooms containing TBI patients says Clark.\n\nIn addition to trying colored-lens sunglasses, the article suggests other ways to mitigate photophobia including wearing a wide-brimmed hat when outdoors, adjusting digital screen and device settings to an appropriate hue and brightness or purchasing filters for screens. However, the researchers noted, they do not recommend wearing colored glasses while driving. Certain colors make seeing stop lights or emergency vehicle lights difficult.\n\n\"We believe that an athletic trainer, in consultation with team physicians, may find it useful to apply this photophobia assessment and recommend colored glasses to his or her athlete,\" Clark says. \"The use of the colored glasses in the high school, college or other setting can allow a person to engage in some medically approved activities, while minimizing the risk of symptom exacerbation. We believe the use of the colored glasses that provide photophobia mitigation has added benefits superior to dark sunglasses, especially for indoor lighting.\"\n\nAdditional researchers on the study include Jon Divine, MD, a professor in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at the UC College of Medicine and head team physician for University of Cincinnati Athletics.\n\nThere was no funding used for this study.", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "There is no mention of costs in the release.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "It's pretty well known to doctors that the most successful treatment for obesity is surgery, especially the gastric bypass operation. But here's something the medical world is just realizing: that the gastric bypass operation has other even more dramatic effects. It can force type 2 diabetes into almost instant remission and it appears to reduce the risk of cancer.\n\nSurgeons have been performing bariatric, or weight loss operations since the 1950s, but they're much safer than they used to be. They're typically done laparoscopically now, where doctors use tiny surgical tools and video cameras instead of making big, deep incisions.\n\nDespite the increase in obesity, only a small number of people have had the gastric bypass operation.\n\nmet some people who were once morbidly obese.\n\nThere was Tony Sideman, who underwent surgery in April 2007 and has lost 140 pounds; there was Janet Rovak, who lost 90 pounds in the eight months since her surgery; and there was Travis Goodbou, who lost 260 pounds in the seven months since he underwent the operation.\n\nDr. Neil Hutcher from Richmond, Va. has performed more than 3,000 bypass surgeries. Asked how many people gain the weight back, Dr. Hutcher tells Stahl, \"You know I think when you're dealing with an incurable disease that kills many people, if you have an 85 to 90 percent success rate, that's pretty darn good.\"\n\n\"Is that what you have?\" Stahl asks.\n\nThere's no diet, no exercise regimen, and no pill with a success rate like that. These patients lose a ton of weight and keep it off.\n\nHere's how Hutcher does the surgery: first, he sections off a small pouch of the upper part of the stomach, which is then attached to a lower part of the small intestine, bypassing most of the stomach, so that there's not a lot of room for food.\n\nIt used to be that roughly one in 100 people died from this operation. Hutcher says it's now about one in 1,000, which makes it less deadly than most major surgeries.\n\n\"It's less than gall bladder surgery. It's about one-tenth of cardiac surgery,\" he explains.\n\nIt's safer because of new surgical techniques which have also made it more effective. For instance, they can make the stomach pouch smaller than they used to.\n\n\"Even if I wanted to eat a whole cheesecake, my stomach is very tiny. It holds four ounces max, stretched to the max. And that's not even one piece of cheesecake,\" a female patient explained.\n\nA big reason the operation works is because it seems to suppress appetite. \"If you listen to your patients, they come back and they say, 'Doctor, you put the fire out,'\" Hutcher says.\n\n\"When you see a sign for fast food or\u2026she's already shaking her head at me,\" Stahl asked a patient.\n\n\"Don't want it,\" the female patient replied. \"I used to crave sweets all the time. I couldn't go past the gift shop at work without getting a candy bar. Now I go past it and I never give it a thought.\"\n\nPaul Delios of Saugus, Mass. has lost 90 pounds. He owns a doughnut shop with his siblings, but he's able to resist the cravings. \"Before I'd have cravings for everything. Now I really don't,\" he told Stahl.\n\nFor most patients the cravings really do disappear. One theory is that's because the operation suppresses the levels of a stomach hormone called \"grelin\" that activates the sensation of hunger.\n\nYet most people who have this operation do not get skinny. Dr. David Cummings, an expert on appetite at the University of Washington, says as a rule these patients end up just one third lighter.\n\n\"Most people with severe obesity who undergo gastric bypass do not become fully normal, in terms of body weight. They go from severely obese to mildly obese, or from obese to overweight. But nevertheless it's an enormous change,\" Dr. Cummings explains.\n\nAnd not just in terms of weight loss. Dr. Hutcher says the operation itself can take type 2 diabetes - which has ballooned in this country - and throw it into complete remission.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The segment reports that the surgery costs about $25,000 and is not always covered by insurance.

He is a professor of fetal medicine at Kings College Hospital in London.\n\nBut he added, \"This condition is, to a great extent, preventable.\"\n\nThe new study looked at an aspirin dose of 150 milligrams (mg) per day because some past studies with smaller daily doses of aspirin have produced conflicting results, according to Nicolaides. A baby aspirin dose is 81 milligrams.\n\nIn those studies using smaller doses, the reduction in preeclampsia risk hovered around 10 percent, he said, but the higher dose in this latest study was linked to a 62 percent reduction in risk.\n\nPreeclampsia is a serious high blood pressure disorder. It can affect all of the organs in a woman's body, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). The exact cause of the disorder is unknown, but certain risk factors make it more likely to occur, including:\n\u2022 Being pregnant with more than one baby,\n\u2022 Having chronic conditions, such as type 1 or type 2 diabetes, autoimmune disease and kidney problems.\n\nDr. Mitchell Kramer, chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Huntington Hospital in New York, said he'd add women who are severely obese and women who've had babies who had restricted growth to the list of women at high risk of preeclampsia.\n\nACOG already recommends that women who are at high risk of preeclampsia take a low-dose baby aspirin beginning between 12 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAbout 1,600 women completed the double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Just under 800 were randomly put into the daily aspirin group, while just over 800 were placed in the placebo group. The women came from 13 different maternity hospitals across Europe and Israel.\n\nInstead of relying solely on standard risk factors, the researchers combined those risk factors with measurements of maternal blood flow, blood pressure and two hormones produced by the placenta. They used an algorithm they designed to combine all those factors to select women who they believed were at a high risk of preeclampsia.\n\nBetween 11 and 14 weeks, the women began taking a daily 150 mg aspirin or a placebo. They continued taking the pills until they were 36 weeks' pregnant, or sooner if they delivered the baby early.\n\nJust 13 women in the aspirin group developed preeclampsia, while 35 women in the placebo group developed the complication, the findings showed.\n\nThe reduction in risk was even greater for early deliveries. Women who delivered at less than 34 weeks were 82 percent less likely to have preeclampsia if they were taking 150 mg of aspirin, Nicolaides said.\n\nThere were no serious side effects for expectant mothers, or adverse events for the babies related to aspirin use during pregnancy, the researchers noted.\n\nHowever, as with all drugs, women should talk to their doctor about the use of aspirin in pregnancy before taking up this regimen, because aspirin does increase the risk for bleeding.\n\nNicolaides said the aspirin may help improve blood flow from the mother to the placenta.\n\nAccording to Kramer, \"This randomized study concludes that [aspirin's] use is not only effective for reducing the incidence of preeclampsia at term, but also preterm. This is important because it will reduce the need for preterm delivery, which is risky for the baby.\"\n\nLow-dose aspirin can also help reduce the chances of eclampsia, which is seizures due to preeclampsia for high-risk women, Kramer noted.\n\nThe study is scheduled for presentation Wednesday at the Fetal Medicine Foundation meeting in Slovenia. The findings were also published simultaneously in a special online issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nTo learn more about preeclampsia, visit the March of Dimes.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "We\u2019ll consider this N/A since generic aspirin is very affordable.

Now health officials are warning doctors that preventing the disease will take more than just writing a prescription.\n\nThe pill, called Truvada, is already on the market for treating HIV infections. But the landmark study, involving 2,500 men who have sex with men, showed that taking Truvada faithfully can reduce the risk of infection by as much as 92 percent.\n\nThat touched off a lot of celebrating. It's the first time anybody's shown that taking a pill can prevent HIV \u2013 and it was the first new weapon against HIV unveiled in many years.\n\nTo make sure it works, though, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says doctors need to do a number of things:\n\u2022 Prescribe Truvada only for men at high risk of getting infected \u2013 that is, only for men who have sex with men, those who have multiple sex partners, and those who live in areas where there's a lot of HIV circulating.\n\u2022 Test patients before prescribing it to make sure they're not already infected. That'll help avoid creating viruses resistant to the drug when patients miss doses. For the same reason, patients should get an HIV test periodically while on the drug.\n\u2022 Counsel patients on Truvada to use condoms faithfully, because the drug isn't a sure bet against the virus.\n\u2022 Above all, tell patients they must take the drug every day \u2013 not just when they've had risky sex.\n\nThe study makes that last point very clear. Overall, men who took Truvada had a 44 percent lower risk of HIV infection. But those who said they took the drug at least 9 out of every 10 day had a 73 percent lower risk.\n\nThat doesn't tell the whole story. When researchers tested the blood of patients for traces of Truvada, they found many who claimed to have taken the pill regularly weren't telling the truth. Among those whose tests showed they really did take it every day, the risk of HIV infection was 92 percent lower than those not on the drug.\n\nThere's one other thing, the CDC says.

The center will provide one of the newest and highly precise forms of radiation therapy available, pencil beam scanning (PBS), which targets tumors while significantly decreasing radiation doses to healthy tissue. This technique can precisely direct radiation to the most difficult-to-reach tumors.\n\nProton therapy is just one of several new methods for treating cancer.

Additionally, they demonstrated that the DNA for all three human genes and one viral gene could be successfully extracted from urine, and they could identify such lesions with 75 percent sensitivity.\n\nTwo commercial tests based on markers of DNA chemical changes called methylation, released in Europe last summer, require Pap smears or swabs of cervical tissue, and show 64 percent sensitivity in identifying similar lesions, according to senior investigator Rafael Guerrero-Preston, Dr.P.H., M.P.H., assistant professor of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and member of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center.\n\n\"If further studies confirm these findings, we see a significant use of urine screening as a way to quickly and inexpensively determine if a biopsy is warranted, or if physicians can use a 'watch and wait' approach before intervening,\" says Guerrero-Preston. Typically, he says, a woman who tests positive for HPV and has an abnormal Pap smear undergoes a biopsy to rule out cervical cancer using cells taken directly from cervical tissue. But previous studies suggest more than 50 percent of these biopsies are unnecessary and can result in pain, worry, infertility and higher health care costs.\n\n\"Our urine test would serve as a molecular triage,\" he says, \"at times supplementing Pap test information. In developing countries that don't have the money, medical infrastructure or cultural approval for Pap test, our test could be used instead.\"\n\nThe new study builds on the Johns Hopkins team's previously published work, in which investigators identified three genes associated with cervical cancer or abnormal-looking cells known to become cancerous: FKBP6, INTS1 and ZNF516. As abnormalities progress, these genes were more likely to have a chemical methyl group attached to their DNA in certain spots.\n\nThe researchers tested the value of these genes as markers using 214 cervical cell samples collected from women undergoing Pap smears at Hospital Dr. Hernan Henriquez Aravena in Chile. The women ranged in age from 18 to 86. Among the test samples, 34 showed no abnormalities in their cervix; 87 showed one of three types of precancerous, abnormal tissue; and 90 showed clear evidence of cervical cancer.\n\nNext, Guerrero-Preston's team isolated DNA from each cervical tissue sample and used advanced genetic sequencing methods to spell out the DNA makeup of cells in the cervical tissue samples. The researchers then compared the number of methyl groups attached to each gene in samples from the 34 healthy women to 53 samples with a specific subset of precancerous markers.\n\nUsing methylation as a value to diagnose malignancy, the three genes together showed a 90 percent sensitivity, meaning that their presence was able to predict a true positive cancer sample this percentage of the time. The test had an 88.9 percent specificity, meaning the percent of time the test correctly identified someone without the disease.\n\nTo further improve the accuracy of the test, the investigators added a new gene marker to the test. This time, rather than using a human gene, they used one from the virus, HPV16-L1, which also becomes methylated in human cells as cancer develops. They did the test again with the four-gene combination on a new population of women from the University of Puerto Rico. The 115 women ranged in age from 21 to 49; 41 participants had healthy cervical tissue, and 74 had one of three types of precancerous cells. Using all four genes, the test now had a sensitivity of 90.9 percent and a specificity of 60.9 percent.\n\n\"When developing a new cancer screening test, we want something in the range of 90 to 95 percent sensitivity, which is competitive with the effectiveness of tests developed and now marketed in Europe,\" says Guerrero-Preston.\n\nThe next step, the researchers report, was to verify that the four-gene test worked using freely circulating DNA from blood and urine, rather than DNA taken directly from cervical tissue.\n\nFor this experiment, they tested 40 samples of paired cervical tissue, blood and urine from a subset of the patients from Puerto Rico. Using the DNA from blood, they found the test had an 85.7 percent sensitivity and a 60.9 percent specificity. Using urine, they found a 75 percent sensitivity and an 83.3 percent specificity.\n\nDuring the course of the study, the time to process cervical samples, blood or urine and get a test result took four days. They plan to continue modifying the test to improve the urine sensitivity to that of the cervical tissue samples.\n\nAccording to World Cancer Research Fund International, 84 percent of cervical cancers occur in less developed countries, with the highest rates in Africa, Latin American and the Caribbean. In the United States, cervical cancer used to be the highest cause of cancer deaths among women, but that soon changed when the yearly Pap smear was introduced over 40 years ago. Countries without the infrastructure or cultural acceptance for regular Pap tests have not seen declining cancer rates.\n\nGuerrero-Preston and his colleagues have a research agreement with Cepheid to develop a way to reduce the waiting time for a test result from a maximum of four days in the lab to under three hours in a Cepheid instrument using sealed cartridges to minimize sample handling and contamination.\n\nAdditional authors on the study include Blanca Valle, Anne Jedlicka, Nitesh Turaga, Oluwasina Folawiyo, Francesca Pirini, Fahcina Lawson, Angelo Vergura, Maartje Noorhuis, Amanda Dziedzic, Gabriela Perez, Marisa Renehan, Carolina Guerrero-Diaz, Bruce Trock Liliana Florea and David Sidransky of The Johns Hopkins University; Edgar De Jesus Rodriguez, Jose Rodriguez Orengo, Keimari Mendez and Josefina Romaguera of the University of Puerto Rico; and Teresa Diaz-Montes of the Institute for Cancer Care at Mercy.\n\nThe research was funded by National Cancer Institute grants (U01 CA084986, K01 CA164092 and U01 CA084986).", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The release suggests\u00a0that a urine test would be less costly than a Pap test, but it makes no effort to indicate what the cost is of either the proposed test or a Pap test.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Sun Pharma announced successful Phase 3 confirmatory clinical trial results for Seciera\u2122 (cyclosporine A, 0.09% ophthalmic solution), for the treatment of dry eye disease.

Atherosclerotic disease, in which plaque buildup narrows the brain arteries, is one of the most common causes of strokes.\n\nNeurosurgeons performing EDAS reroute arteries from the scalp and the membranes that cover the brain and place these arteries under the skull near areas of the brain at risk of stroke. Over time, new blood vessels form, creating fresh pathways for blood and oxygen to reach the brain.\n\nThe trial, led by Nestor R. Gonzalez, MD, professor of Neurosurgery and director of the Neurovascular Laboratory at Cedars-Sinai, enrolled 52 patients with severe brain atherosclerosis, also known as intracranial atherosclerotic disease, or ICAD, who showed symptoms of either a recent stroke or a mini-stroke, called a transient ischemic attack. These patients received EDAS surgery, along with intensive medical management, which included diet and lifestyle changes, blood thinners and other medications to control blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels.\n\nAfter one year, 9.6 percent of the patients treated with the surgery experienced another ischemic stroke or died, compared with 21.2 percent of patients in a matched control group who received only intensive medical management. Two of the EDAS patients had small wound openings that required additional surgical interventions, but there were no intracranial hemorrhages or other serious adverse events, the researchers reported.\n\n\"Our findings in this intermediate-stage trial are promising for applying EDAS surgery to intracranial atherosclerotic disease,\" said Gonzalez said. Previously, EDAS has been used for moyamoya disease, a rare cerebrovascular disorder that affects younger patients.\n\nGonzalez said the new trial addressed a serious medical need. \"Even under the best current treatments, ICAD carries high rates of recurrent stroke and death, compared with other causes of stroke,\" he said. \"Developing new therapeutic strategies is crucial for ICAD patients.\"\n\nCurrent ICAD therapies--in addition to intensive medical management--include bypass surgery to connect a blood vessel from outside the brain to a vessel inside the brain, as well as angioplasty with stenting, which involves inflating a tiny balloon inside a cerebral artery to open it up and placing a stent device inside the artery. Despite advances in medical care, annual rates of recurrent stroke and death are remain high, at 15 percent or more for ICAD patients, according to published research.\n\nGonzalez said his team is working with the stroke prevention working group of the National Institutes of Health to develop a proposal for a Phase III randomized clinical trial across multiple institutions to further test the effectiveness of EDAS as compared with intensive medical management. While this Phase IIa trial selected patients from previous studies as the control group, the Phase III study would enroll new ICAD patients for both the control and experimental groups, he explained.\n\n\"This clinical trial moves us significantly closer to preventing strokes and death in high-risk populations,\" said Keith Black, MD, professor and chair of the Department of Neurosurgery. \"As a nationally renowned physician-investigator, Dr. Gonzalez personifies the dedication of Cedars-Sinai to translating the most advanced research into new cures.\"\n\nBesides Gonzalez, the trial involved other investigators from the stroke centers of Cedars-Sinai and UCLA.\n\nFunding: Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Strokes of the National Institutes of Health under award number K23NS079477-01A1.", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The release doesn\u2019t mention cost although the surgical procedure used in the research is both already established practice and a complicated and extensive operation.\u00a0 Given that the surgery is being compared to simple medical management, the cost of the new approach will be substantially higher, and therefore deserves mention in this release.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "\"They have a lot of promise and are potentially very important,\" said Katherine Hamilton, a headache specialist at Penn Medicine.

Ten years ago, scientists started looking at the hormones made in the pituitary gland to see how they act on certain targets. They found some of these hormones had an effect on bone mass.\n\nFrom this, they created an antibody to see if it could be used to prevent bone loss in mice\u2014and in 2010, they showed it could. As a result, they started considering it as a potential treatment for osteoporosis, particularly in post-menopausal women\u2014a period when women lose bone mass fairly quickly.\n\nBut scientists also realized it could have other uses.

So we thought maybe there was a connection\u2014that FSH could have direct effects on adipose tissue.\u201d\n\nIn the study, published in Nature, scientists injected the antibody into mice that had had their ovaries removed (mimicking menopause) and mice that had been fed on a high-fat diet. In both cases, the antibody caused significant weight loss and gains in bone mass.\n\nZaidi says they looked at the adipose tissue in different areas of the body, including under the skin and around the vital organs. \u201cIn all compartments it was [fat] reduced by around this level. It\u2019s a fairly dramatic effect.\u201d Mice also showed increased oxygen consumption, higher levels of physical activity and more heat production in beige fat (which dissipates energy around the body).\n\nBut how do mice models translate to human treatments? Mice a fairly close genetic match to Humans, and Zaidi is hopeful there will be similar effects in humans.\n\nTheir next step is to \u201chumanize\u201d the antibody, so it can be tested without triggering an immune response. \u201cWe would then hopefully go to the next phase of preclinical testing, which would be to look at side effects, toxicology etc. After that, we would go into primates and larger animals. That would then lead\u2014if all goes well\u2014to the first human trials in three to four years.\u201d\n\nAt present, the researchers are focusing on the adiposity, rather than bone loss, for drug development: \u201cI think obesity is a more prevalent disease\u2014but osteoporosis at the tail end can be tagged on. Also to do trials for osteoporosis takes a very long time,\u201d Zaidi says.\n\nEventually, he hopes to end up with an injected drug that gets rid of fat and increases bone mass. \u201cThat\u2019s the ideal situation,\u201d he says. \u201cIt could be a unique obesity drug. But it could also be a unique drug because it lowers body fat and makes bones stronger. And the population that could be most benefited by this could be post-menopausal women.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the research, Tim Speckor, Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at King\u2019s College London, U.K., says: \u201cIt\u2019s a nice mouse study that seems to work\u2014whether it works in humans is another matter.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Cost is not discussed.

Symptoms include weakness, muscle stiffness and difficulty thinking--a phenomenon often referred to as \"brain fog.\" MS affects an estimated 2.5 million people worldwide, according to the Multiple Sclerosis Foundation.\n\nDamage to the thalamus, a structure in the middle of the brain that acts as a kind of information hub, and its connections with other parts of the brain play an important role in the cognitive dysfunction many MS patients experience.\n\nResearchers led by Laura De Giglio, M.D., Ph.D., from the Department of Neurology and Psychiatry at Sapienza University in Rome, recently studied the effects of a video game-based cognitive rehabilitation program on the thalamus in patients with MS. They used a collection of video games from the Nintendo Corporation, called Dr. Kawashima's Brain Training, which train the brain using puzzles, word memory and other mental challenges. The games are based on the work of Japanese neuroscientist Ryuta Kawashima, M.D.\n\nTwenty-four MS patients with cognitive impairment were randomly assigned to either take part in an eight-week, home-based rehabilitation program--consisting of 30-minute gaming sessions, five days per week--or be put on a wait list, serving as the control group. Patients were evaluated by cognitive tests and by 3-Tesla resting state functional MRI (RS-fMRI) at baseline and after the eight-week period. Functional imaging when the brain is in its resting state, or not focused on a particular task, provides important information on neural connectivity.\n\n\"Functional MRI allows you to study which brain areas are simultaneously active and gives information on the participation of certain areas with specific brain circuits,\" Dr. De Giglio said. \"When we talk about increased connectivity, we mean that these circuits have been modified, increasing the extension of areas that work simultaneously.\"\n\nAt follow-up, the 12 patients in the video-game group had significant increases in thalamic functional connectivity in brain areas corresponding to the posterior component of the default mode network, which is one of the most important brain networks involved in cognition. The results provide an example of the brain's plasticity, or ability to form new connections throughout life.\n\n\"This increased connectivity reflects the fact that video gaming experience changed the mode of operation of certain brain structures,\" Dr. De Giglio said. \"This means that even a widespread and common use tool like video games can promote brain plasticity and can aid in cognitive rehabilitation for people with neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis.\"\n\nThe modifications in functional connectivity shown in the video game group after training corresponded to significant improvements in test scores assessing sustained attention and executive function, the higher-level cognitive skills that help organize our lives and regulate our behavior.\n\nThe results suggest that video-game-based brain training is an effective option to improve cognitive abilities of patients with MS.\n\nIn the future, the researchers hope to study whether the plasticity induced by video games in MS patients is also related to improvements in other aspects of their daily lives. They also plan to look at how the video game can be integrated into a rehabilitation program together with other rehabilitative techniques.\n\n\"Multiple Sclerosis: Changes in Thalamic Resting-State Functional Connectivity Induced by a Home-based Cognitive Rehabilitation Program.\" Collaborating with Dr. De Giglio were Francesca Tona, M.D., Francesca De Luca, Psy.D., Nikolaos Petsas, M.D., Ph.D., Luca Prosperini, M.D., Ph.D., Valentina Bianchi, Psy.D., Carlo Pozzilli, M.D., Ph.D., and Patrizia Pantano, M.D.\n\nRadiology is edited by Herbert Y.

The study discovered the specific triggers activating the development of fibrosis which accelerates heart failure. Blocking the triggers through the use of a specific kind of bile acid prevented cardiac fibrosis from occurring.\n\n\"This is something that nobody has ever seen before,\" says Marek Michalak, co-principal investigator and a distinguished professor in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Alberta's Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry. \"Cardiac fibrosis is considered a permanent remodeling of the heart. Inevitably it leads to heart failure and eventually death. The bottom line is that this shows for the first time that cardiac fibrosis is preventable.\"\n\n\"It offers hope to those who are living with heart failure,\" adds Luis Agellon, co-principal investigator and a professor at McGill University's School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition. \"Prevention of fibrosis will extend the ability of the heart to function, even if at a reduced capacity. Currently patients with heart failure have poor quality of life and a dismal prognosis. Improving their quality of life will do wonders for these individuals.\"\n\nFibrosis is an early step on the path to heart failure. According to the Heart and Stroke Foundation there are currently 1.3 million Canadians living with heart disease or heart failure--a condition that severely limits physical activity because the heart cannot pump enough oxygenated blood that the body needs. About 30 per cent of patients diagnosed with heart failure will die within the first year.\n\nCardiac fibrosis itself is caused by a variety of factors including high blood pressure, overwork of cardiac muscle and long-term consumption of a diet that is high in both saturated fat and sugar--all cause increased stress to heart cells. Individuals with diabetes, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and heart transplant recipients are also known to be at high risk.\n\n\"It's almost like building a scar,\" says Michalak. \"It's exactly the same type of biological activity but it's happening in the heart tissue. It destroys the ability of the heart to function normally.\"\n\nThe team is now pushing forward with additional studies to see if the same therapeutic effect can be achieved in humans. They also aim to gain a better understanding of exactly how bile acids can prevent cardiac fibrosis from occurring.\n\n\"We don't yet have a full understanding--nobody does--of how the bile acid actually does what it does in heart cells,\" explains Michalak. \"So, another phase of the work is to find out what actually happens within heart cells at the molecular level. How can this bile acid affect the heart in such a dramatic way?\"\n\nOnce that occurs, the team hopes to work with cardiologists to quickly move the research into clinical trials, involving chemotherapy and heart transplant patients.\n\n\"If cardiac fibrosis can be stopped, then that could substantially improve the outcome for people at risk,\" says Agellon. \"This would be a significant advance in the fight against heart disease.\"\n\nThis research was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.\n\n\"Inhibition of the Unfolded Protein Response Mechanism Prevents Cardiac Fibrosis,\" PLOS ONE, published online July 21, 2016.", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "At this stage of the research, cost is not of major concern.

So much metformin is taken in the United States \u2014 some 72 million prescriptions were written for it in 2013 \u2014 that a recent study found higher trace levels of it (presumably from the urine of people taking it) in Lake Michigan than of any other drug, including caffeine.\n\nBut Price, a science and medical reporter in Oakland, Calif., doesn\u2019t have Type 2 diabetes. She has Type 1, the far less common form of the disease, which requires lifelong treatment with insulin, to compensate for her body\u2019s failure to produce enough of the hormone. However, she had read studies indicating that metformin combined with insulin might help Type 1 diabetics, too. Moreover, the drug was being studied in clinical trials as a way to lower the risk of cancer, heart disease and dementia \u2014 not just for diabetics, but for everyone.\n\nFor Price, there was yet another possible benefit \u2014 as a treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome, an endocrine disorder that doctors thought might explain the difficulty she and her husband had had conceiving.\n\nSure enough, a month and a half after she had started taking metformin pills and even as she was enjoying the benefits of better blood-sugar control, Price became pregnant, eventually giving birth to a girl.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still taking metformin along with my insulin,\u201d said Price, 36, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes 14 years ago. \u201cI remember eating Mexican food one night, which can be a potential disaster for people with diabetes because of the carbs, but I noticed I needed only two-thirds to a half of the insulin I normally needed.\u201d\n\nSynthesized in the 1920s, metformin was first approved for treatment of Type 2 diabetes in the United Kingdom in 1958. It took until 1995 to get approval in the United States after a potentially fatal disorder linked to a similar drug was found to be rarely if ever associated with metformin.\n\nUnlike insulin shots, which help Type 1 diabetics break down sugar and starches in the blood, metformin lowers blood-sugar levels primarily by squelching the liver\u2019s tendency to release stored-up sugar into the bloodstream. Keeping that extra sugar (actually a form of sugar called glucose) out of the blood helps to maintain normal blood-sugar levels, thereby preventing such long-term complications as blindness, kidney failure and lower-limb amputation.\n\nAbout 29 million people in the United States have diabetes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 90 percent of them have Type 2, in which their bodies slowly fail to respond to normal levels of insulin, forcing their pancreas to produce so much that it\u2019s eventually exhausted. The estimated 2.5 million with Type 1, in contrast, lose their ability to produce insulin, usually within a matter of months, due to an autoimmune attack by the body on itself.\n\nToday, the range of ailments being targeted by metformin, a prescription drug sold under such names as Glucophage, Glumetza, Fortamet and Riomet, all share one characteristic: They are diseases related to aging.\n\n\u201cMetformin actually lowers the rate of cell turnover,\u201d said Michael Pollak, who has been studying metformin\u2019s effects on pancreatic cancer as chairman of oncology at McGill University in Montreal. \u201cIt makes cells divide less quickly. The rate-of-living theory defines aging as the number of cell divisions you undergo since you were a fertilized egg. If the theory is true, then people who age more gracefully have a slower rate of cell division. The question is whether the rate-of-living theory is operational in mammals.\u201d\n\nPollak says that none of the most exciting possible benefits for the drug have yet been proved in randomized clinical trials of non-diabetics. For now, the evidence suggesting benefits is limited to large studies of diabetics that have found, on average that those who take metformin tend to have lower rates of cancer, heart disease and dementia, and to live longer overall than those who take other drugs for diabetes. Those effects have also been seen in animal studies. But such evidence often does not pan out in human studies.\n\nAt a medical meeting in May, Pollak reported disappointing results from his first randomized, placebo-controlled trial of metformin for people with pancreatic cancer. \u201cIt yielded no benefit,\u201d he said. \u201cPlain old metformin given in the same dose as we do for Type 2 diabetes doesn\u2019t seem to be a breakthrough for cancer, at least for pancreatic cancer.\u201d\n\nMany other metformin clinical trials are underway for breast, colorectal, endometrial and other cancers.\n\nFor heart disease, the benefit of metformin over most other drugs for Type 2 diabetics has been seen repeatedly in clinical trials. For people without diabetes, only one study has been published, finding no apparent effect after 18 months. As with cancer, however, other studies are underway.\n\nFor dementia, which people with Type 2 diabetes have double the risk of developing compared with non-diabetics, metformin has been found in a number of studies to cut that risk substantially.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of excitement about metformin and dementia,\u201d said Rachel Whitmer, an epidemiologist at Kaiser Permanente in California.\n\nIn 2013, Whitmer presented the results of a study of about 15,000 people newly prescribed a medication for Type 2 diabetes: By the end of the five-year study, those who received metformin had a 40 percent lower risk of having developed dementia than those prescribed sulfonylureas, another common type of diabetes drug.\n\nBut, Whitmer notes, \u201cI don\u2019t think the story is complete. There needs to be more work in this area with all drugs for diabetes.\u201d\n\nFor Type 1 diabetes, researchers at the University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine published a study in May in which they added either a low dose of metformin or placebo pills to the insulin regimen of 74 adolescents. Those who received metformin lost weight \u2014 generally a benefit for those with diabetes \u2014 and needed less insulin after six months. Those who received the placebo needed more insulin than at the beginning of the study and saw their blood pressure rise. The one goal the study did not achieve was better blood-sugar control.\n\n\u201cThere is some benefit, but it wasn\u2019t the full benefit we hoped for,\u201d said Helen Nickerson, senior scientific program manager at JDRF, formerly known as the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, which partly funded the study. Even so, she said, she is hearing from doctors that growing numbers of them are prescribing metformin along with insulin to patients with Type 1 diabetes.\n\nNo one would suggest that a person with Type 1 diabetes stop taking their insulin. Doing so would be life-threatening. For those with Type 1, metformin is being tested only as an add-on to insulin.\n\nJDRF, meanwhile, is funding a clinical trial to see if metformin will reduce the risk of heart disease in people with Type 1, and it is funding a trial in Britain to see if the drug will prevent children from developing Type 1 in the first place.\n\nTerry Wilkin, a professor of endocrinology and metabolism at the University of Exeter, is leading the prevention trial. He theorizes that the risk of developing Type 1 rises when excess demand for insulin is placed on the pancreas in children who are even slightly overweight. His study will give low daily doses of metformin to children who are at high risk of developing Type 1.\n\n\u201cIf we can even slightly lower their average blood sugar with metformin,\u201d Wilkin said, \u201cI believe we can have a big benefit on their risk of developing Type 1.\u201d\n\nDespite all these potential benefits of metformin \u2014 and despite a recommendation from the American Diabetes Association that it be tried before any other drug for newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetics \u2014 a recent study found that only about half of all such people get metformin as their first prescribed medication. The study does not explain why that might be. Among the possibilities, experts say, are that newer drugs are being pushed heavily in direct-to-patient advertising and that some patients are turned off by the common though mild side effect of metformin \u2014 stomach upset and diarrhea \u2014 which can usually be avoided by starting on a low dose.\n\nThe author of the study, Niteesh Choudhry, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, also found that newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetics who start on metformin are the least likely to need an additional diabetes drug later.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that physicians and patients are not always choosing to start on metformin,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are legitimate reasons to put patients on one drug rather than another. But the guidelines do recommend metformin first.\u201d\n\nFor patients with Type 2 whose doctor started them on a drug other than metformin, he said, \u201cI certainly would encourage people to talk with their doctor. That\u2019s always a good thing.\u201d\n\nHurley is a New Jersey-based science journalist who writes frequently on diabetes and health.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Part of why this topic is exciting is that metformin is relatively cheap, but the story doesn\u2019t put a price tag on the drug.

The treatment does not cure hay fever but is generally effective at reducing symptoms. However, inconvenience and discomfort limits patients\u2019 willingness to try allergy shots.\n\nSublingual immunotherapy is an alternative and has become commonly used in Europe, where two tablet-based products against grass-pollen allergies are available: Grazax and Oralair. There are also a number of drop-based products. No sublingual immunotherapy products have yet been approved in the United States, however.\n\nFor the new study, reported in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Italian researchers combined the results of 19 clinical trials conducted since 1995 on the effectiveness of immunotherapy tablets and drops against hay fever caused by grass pollen.\n\nThe trials lasted anywhere from three months to three years.\n\nAcross the studies, which included a total of 2,971 adults and children with grass-pollen allergies, immunotherapy reduced symptoms by about 20 percent to 30 percent, on average. It also allowed patients to reduce their use of antihistamines and other medications.\n\nThe researchers, led by Dr. Gabriele Di Lorenzo of the University of Palermo, describe the benefits as \u201cmodest.\u201d\n\nIn an email, Di Lorenzo told Reuters Health that the findings suggest that sublingual immunotherapy is \u201chighly effective in many, but not in all patients.\u201d He said that more work is needed to identify which patients might be most likely to benefit.\n\nDr. Harold Nelson, an allergist at National Jewish Health in Denver, said that the body of evidence indicates that sublingual immunotherapy beats antihistamines and other medications used to control hay fever symptoms.\n\nIn an interview, he noted that antihistamines reduce symptoms by about 12 percent to 15 percent, on average. Nasal steroids, another hay fever option, appear to cut symptoms by about 17 percent.\n\nOn the other hand, Nelson said, allergy shots appear to outperform the oral versions, with a symptom reduction about twice that of sublingual immunotherapy.\n\nIn addition, the long-term effectiveness of the grass-pollen tablets is not yet fully clear.\n\nLike allergy shots, the oral immunotherapy takes time. Grazax, for instance, is taken daily, starting several months before the start of the next grass-pollen allergy season and continuing for three years thereafter.\n\nResearch so far suggests that the symptom relief persists in the year after patients stop taking Grazax. A study published earlier this year \u2014 and not included in the current analysis \u2014 found that during that post-treatment year, Grazax patients had one-quarter fewer hay fever symptoms than those who had been given a placebo for comparison.\n\nBut longer term data are not yet available. The benefits of allergy shots, by contrast, have been shown to persist for 10 years or beyond, Nelson noted.\n\nThe ultimate cost-effectiveness of sublingual immunotherapy has also yet to be determined; in the UK, for example, Grazax treatment costs about 2.25 pounds ($3.50) per day. In theory, that could pay off if long-term use of allergy medications was cut, but that has yet to be shown.\n\nStill, Nelson said that if sublingual products do win approval in the U.S., they will likely boost the number of hay fever sufferers who want to use under-the-tongue immunotherapy. Even though the effectiveness is less than that of allergy shots, the convenience of an at-home version of immunotherapy is a plus, and the sublingual therapy tends to have fewer side effects than shots, according to Nelson.\n\nThe most common side effects include itchiness and irritation in the mouth, ears and eyes, swelling of the mouth or tongue, headache and gastrointestinal problems like stomach pain and heartburn.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "1clip_filelist.xml\" rel=\"File-List\"/>1clip_themedata.thmx\" rel=\"themeData\"/>1clip_colorschememapping.xml\" rel=\"colorSchemeMapping\"/>\n\n\n\n \nThe story concedes that the \u201cultimate cost-effectiveness of sublingual immunotherapy has\u2026yet to be determined.\u201d Based on cost in the U.K., the story reports that treatment may be $3.50 per day, adding that it should be \u201ctaken daily, starting several months before the start of the next grass-pollen allergy season and continuing for three years thereafter.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n", "answer": 1}, {"article": "THURSDAY, June 8, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Scary pit vipers may need an image upgrade: Their venom might end up helping human heart patients, research suggests.\n\nTaiwanese scientists say a blood thinner drug based on venom from the Wagler's pit viper was effective in mice, and might prove safer than current anti-clotting meds for humans one day.\n\nThe serpent-medicine connection isn't new, one cardiologist noted, since venom typically kills by disrupting the blood's clotting mechanisms.\n\n\"Blood thinner medications have a long and storied history with snake venom,\" said Dr Satjit Bhysri, a heart specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. In fact, \"many current blood thinners are based on initial experiments from proteins found in snake venom,\" he added.\n\nIn the new study, a team led by Tur-Fu Huang, a pharmacology researcher at National Taiwan University, focused on the venom of the Tropidolaemuswaglerix snake -- a Southeast Asian species known as Wagler's pit viper or the Temple viper.\n\nThe snake's venom contains a protein called trowaglerix, the researchers explained. Designing a molecule based on trowaglerix, Huang's group was able to block GPVI -- a protein that sits on the surface of blood platelet cells and is crucial to allowing these cells to clump together and form clots.\n\nWhen mixed with blood, the new compound prevented blood cells called platelets from clotting. Also, mice that received the drug had slower blood clot formation than untreated mice, but the treated mice did not bleed longer than untreated mice. Still, experiments in animals often don't translate to success in humans, so further research is needed.\n\nDr. Kevin Marzo is head of cardiology at NYU Winthrop Hospital in Mineola, N.Y.

It is expected to be available as an inexpensive, over-the-counter product.\n\nOutdoor air pollution is a global health crisis that kills over 3 million people a year and it has long been linked to lung and heart disease and strokes. But research is also uncovering new impacts on health, including degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s, mental illness and, this week, diabetes.\n\nThe impact of air pollution costs $5tn a year, according to a World Bank report published last week. In the UK, at least 40,000 people a year die prematurely from air pollution, with a cross-party committee of MPs calling it a \u201cpublic health emergency\u201d.\n\nBut the government\u2019s plans to tackle the issue were heavily criticised this week, just as alerts were issued for extreme air pollution across much of northern England. A day later, it was announced that more ambitious plans for London from Mayor Sadiq Khan were overwhelmingly backed by the public.\n\nVehicles are a key contributor to air pollution but, a year after the VW emissions scandal broke, most new diesel cars still emit far more toxic nitrogen oxides on the road than the official lab-based limit.\n\nAction to clean up air is urgently needed across the world, but cutting emissions for vehicles and other sources will take years, meaning ways to reduce the harm in the meantime could be vital. The new inhaler has been developed by German medical devices company Bitop and is based on a molecule called ectoine, discovered in the 1980s in a desert bacterium which uses the compound to conserve water in 60C heat.\n\n\u201cIt is quite an inert molecule that does one main thing, which is bind water, which stabilises cell membrane tissues against physical or chemical damage,\u201d said Dr Andreas Bilstein, at Bitop. \u201cIt supports the natural barrier.\u201d\n\nWhen inhaled, this helps prevent the damage caused by air pollution particles that can lead to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer, Bilstein said: \u201cDamage cannot occur as strongly and there is less inflammatory response, and so disease progression is reduced. The perfect situation is that the patient inhales in the morning and evening at home.\u201d\n\nThe inhaler has been tested in three small groups of patients particularly at risk from air pollution, due to asthma, COPD and bronchitis, with the positive results due to be published soon, Bilstein said.\n\nEctoine does not interact with cell receptors, so it is classed as a medical device rather than a drug. This means large clinical trials are not required for official approval and the inhaler could be on sale soon, at an estimated cost of \u00a317 a month, after Bitop selects a marketing partner. A version of the product for use in nebulisers will be available this year in Germany and Poland, while an ectoine-based nasal spray for allergy relief is already available.\n\nBilstein said the inhaler could be useful around the world, as particulate air pollution is not just a European problem: \u201cEspecially in Asia \u2013 China in particular \u2013 the demand for such a product is even higher. I was in New York last week, and the air was also not very clean.\u201d\n\nThe protective effect of ectoine was discovered by Prof Jean Krutmann and colleagues at the Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine, while investigating whether the molecule could protect skin against sun damage. Bitop funded a series of studies, now published in prominent scientific journals.\n\n\u201cThe point that it can prevent the lung inflammation induced by ultrafine particles is established \u2013 there is no more doubt,\u201d Krutmann said. Antioxidants can also provide some protection but there has been controversy over the effectiveness of such food supplements, he said: \u201cPersonally, I think it is much better to eat lots of vegetables and fruit rather than taking any supplements.\u201d\n\nDr Richard Russell, a consultant respiratory physician in the NHS and medical advisor to the British Lung Foundation, who was not involved in the research, said the inhaler was both credible and promising: \u201cEctoine is a beautifully elegant molecule and it clearly works by helping water to stabilise, giving you a film of water in times of stress.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe work that has been published thus far, in credible, internationally recognised journals, show that this stuff has positive properties, protecting against triggered inflammation,\u201d he told the Guardian. Russell, who also lectures at Imperial College and Oxford University, said it might also be useful for the treatment of asthma, COPD and other lung diseases, not only prevention. \u201cIt could potentially do so much more. It is actually quite exciting and there is clearly a lot more to come from this story.\u201d\n\nKrutmann said slashing air pollution remained paramount. \u201cIt is very nice to be able to protect people against the detrimental effects, but this should not be used as an argument that we can now stop working on reducing particulate [air pollution]. The best thing is that we have clean air because then we don\u2019t need any prophylactic treatment. But on the other hand we have to be realistic and in many countries you cannot just switch traffic overnight to electric cars and do other drastic things.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will take many more years, especially in countries like China, and I think there is an ethical need to provide something to the general population to protect them,\u201d he said.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The expected cost to UK\u00a0consumers is noted ($17 pounds/month).", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Two new just-released studies offer fresh insights into the best way to lose weight and keep it off.

Half of all patients are children. Epilepsy can result from brain injury, but in most cases the cause is unknown and may be genetic. Refractory epilepsy, its intractable form, and the medications with which doctors attempt to treat it can cause lifelong problems with learning, memory and behavior.\n\nAn epileptic seizure occurs when large groups of neurons in the brain begin firing uncontrollably, disrupting the balance of electrical activity and causing changes in mental function, motor function and behavior. It\u2019s not known what sets off a seizure, but lately scientists like Dr. Devinsky have been gathering evidence that inflammation, the immune system\u2019s response to injuries or foreign organisms, plays a pivotal role.\n\nScientists have known since the 1950s that inflammation is involved in a particularly vicious brain disorder called Rasmussen\u2019s encephalitis, which starts seizures and usually affects children. Inflammation inflicts such severe damage to the brain that the standard treatment for the condition is hemispherectomy \u2014 the surgical removal of one of the brain\u2019s hemispheres. Some researchers also suspect an inflammatory link to another form of epilepsy, infantile spasms, because children with the disease respond to ACTH, a hormone produced in the pituitary gland with strong anti-inflammatory effects.\n\nEleonora Aronica, a neuropathologist at the University of Amsterdam, has found signs of inflammation in autopsy specimens and surgical resections from patients with a wide range of epilepsies. Annamaria Vezzani, a neuroscientist at the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan, has induced epilepsy in mice and rats by injecting kainic acid into their brains, and has observed the activation of a cellular pathway linked to inflammation before and during seizures.\n\nThe amount of inflammation in the brain correlates with the frequency of seizures, she also has found. \u201cThis is a novel finding,\u201d Dr. Vezzani said in an interview. \u201cIt was not known that inflammation was a common feature of different types of epilepsy.\u201d\n\nNormal brain function is regulated by the glial cells, which protect neurons and induce an inflammatory response if the brain is injured. But this response also can contribute to seizures, some experts believe, either because components of the immune system stimulate neurons or because the glial cells\u2019 capacity to regulate the brain is diminished when they become \u201cdistracted\u201d by an injury. As Dr. Devinsky noted, seizures in turn may produce further inflammation, perpetuating the cycle.\n\nNow Dr. Vezzani and colleagues are testing a molecule called VX-765 that disrupts the inflammatory process she discovered. In one study, high doses of the drug reduced the number of seizures by about two-thirds in mice with treatment-resistant epilepsy.\n\nSixty patients enrolled in a subsequent trial did not experience a statistically significant improvement after taking VX-765 for six weeks, but they did begin to experience fewer seizures at the end of the trial.\n\nThe drug is now the subject of a Phase 2 trial involving 400 patients. \u201cAnti-inflammatory therapies could at least supplement, and perhaps replace, anticonvulsants,\u201d said Dr. Jacqueline French, a neurologist at the N.Y.U. Comprehensive Epilepsy Center who is leading the new trial.\n\nReplacing anticonvulsants is not merely an end in itself. Although they give many epileptics a better quality of life, they do not affect the course of the disease, only its symptoms. Researchers hope that anti-inflammatories may help ameliorate epilepsy\u2019s underlying causes. \u201cGiving a medication that could treat the epilepsy, as opposed to treating the seizure, would be absolutely novel,\u201d Dr. French said.\n\nBut there are dangers to this approach. Steroids \u2014 potent anti-inflammatories that some doctors are using for experimental treatments \u2014 can have harmful long-term side effects. And it remains unclear whether inflammation might be implicated in all forms of epilepsy or which patients might benefit from anti-inflammatory treatment.\n\n\u201cLike any new field, there\u2019s a lot of enthusiasm and almost a bit of religion involved,\u201d said Dr. Tallie Z. Baram, an epilepsy expert at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cThe challenge for the next few years is to find out the limitations, the boundaries, the real mechanisms.\u201d\n\nStill, whatever the role of inflammation in epilepsy, Elisa Moller says that anti-inflammatories were a miracle intervention for her son. At William\u2019s worst point, a night in July 2010, he had a seizure every time he fell asleep, suffering 23 grand mals between midnight and 6 a.m.\n\nDr. Devinsky had prescribed weekly doses of prednisone, a steroid, and in desperation Ms. Moller decided to administer a mega dose.\n\n\u201cI was taking his life into my hands, I know,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the way I looked at it, he was going to die anyway.\u201d\n\nSince that night William has not had another seizure.

It's a fantastic alternative to treat patients with these diseases, and this study will help doctors when they discuss [treatment options] with patients.\"\n\nBakkum-Gomez has also used the method in her practice and is conducting a study of the IUD, which was originally designed as a contraceptive device, for this purpose.\n\nAbout 3 percent to 5 percent of women who get endometrial cancer, which affects the womb lining, are under the age of 40 and will lose their fertility if they undergo a hysterectomy. The majority of these women have not yet had children, according to background information in the article.\n\nAlthough the IUD is not yet approved to treat endometrial cancer, it is approved and widely used to treat endometriosis and abnormal uterine bleeding.\n\nWhile hysterectomy or removal of the uterus is the accepted treatment for this kind of cancer, doctors have been using the hormone in oral form for the past 20 years, but only for \"well-selected groups of women,\" said Dr. Elizabeth Poynor, a gynecologic oncologist and pelvic surgeon with Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"Well selected,\" in this case, means those with early-stage disease who want to maintain their fertility, much like the group in this trial.\n\nOral hormone treatment to slow down the cancer's growth is a systemic therapy, however, and can have adverse side effects such as skin rashes, nausea and vomiting, headaches and abnormal uterine bleeding, according to background material accompanying the study.\n\nThe theoretical -- but still unproven -- advantage to this new IUD method, Poynor said, is that \"there is a lower risk of systemic side effects . . . and that you may be giving higher doses of the drug directly into the uterus.\"\n\nThe authors followed 20 Italian patients from January 1996 to June 2009 with atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH), which often precedes the cancer, and 14 women with early-stage endometrial cancer confined to the inner layer of the womb.\n\nParticipants -- all of whom were between ages 20 and 40 -- had an IUD known as Mirena, which released levonorgestrel, inserted for a year.

It is produced when enzymes act to convert a precursor molecule, angiotensinogen. Lisinopril is a member of a drug family called ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors. Other examples of ACE inhibitors are benazepril (Lotensin), enalapril (Vasotec) and ramipril (Altace).\n\nReducing angiotensin production by giving ACE inhibitors can lower blood pressure. The same effect can be achieved with drugs that block the cell receptors through which angiotensin acts. Called angiotensin receptor blockers, these drugs have a greater protective effect against dementia than ACE inhibitors, the study found. Such drugs include candesartan (Atacand), irbesartan (Avapro), losartan (Cozaar) and valsartan (Diovan).\n\nIn the study, men taking an angiotensin receptor blocker had a 24 percent lower incidence of dementia than those taking other cardiovascular drugs. The risk was 19 percent lower for men taking ACE inhibitors. The risk was nearly halved for those taking both angiotensin-targeting drugs.\n\nIn men with Alzheimer's disease, use of an angiotensin receptor blocker reduced admission to nursing homes by half. Combined angiotensin medication therapy reduced nursing home admissions by two-thirds.\n\nWolozin said that it's not clear why the drugs would have a beneficial effect on the brain, but improved blood flow probably plays a role.\n\n\"If you get no blood to the brain, you're not going to think well,\" he said. \"Also, in brain cells there is more than one kind of angiotensin receptor. By blocking bad receptors, you are left with the good ones so that helps neurons become more resilient.\"\n\nBut the evidence is not sufficient to support routine use of angiotensin receptor blockers to prevent Alzheimer's disease, Wolozin said. The new report describes an observational study, one that lacks the strict controls that are needed for convincing proof.\n\n\"Any study like this is hypothesis-generating,\" he said. \"You only know for sure when you have done clinical prospective trials.\"\n\nHis advice for anyone considering angiotensin receptors blockers to reduce dementia risk: \"They should consult with their physicians.\" There are potential hazards, such as too-low blood pressure that can lead to damaging falls, Wolozin said.\n\nCaution was urged by Dr. Richard B. Lipton, vice chairman of neurology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, who has done work on the genetics of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThe angiotensin hypothesis makes sense, Lipton said, because improved blood flow to the brain helps nerve cells and reduces formation of Alzheimer's-related amyloid protein.\n\nBut there have been a number of observational studies implicating various molecules, including estrogens, in dementia, he said. \"The sequence is that when you do the randomized trial, you don't get the same effect,\" Lipton said.\n\nOn the other hand, such randomized trials usually include people who are close to having Alzheimer's disease, and \"it could be different if you gave the drugs earlier,\" Lipton said.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has more on blood pressure medications.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The cost of the drugs was not mentioned.\u00a0 And the possible cost-effectiveness ramifications of the research were not mentioned.\u00a0 As is often the case with 70% of the stories we review, cost just doesn\u2019t seem to matter.\u00a0 But we all know it does.

This morning, she'll be getting two of them drilled the old-fashioned way. But the third is a decay that is not so advanced, and Dr. Jin-Ho Phark, her dentist, is going to use a treatment he's testing that involves no drilling -- \"which is nice because many patients don't like the sound of the drill, and the feeling or the pain that might be associated with it,\" Phark says.\n\nThat cringe-worthy sound may be on the way out. A new procedure used by Phark and other doctors claims to stop the progress of cavities without drills or Novocain.\n\nThe treatment, called Icon, is one of several new cavity treatments that avoid drilling. Icon was developed in Germany and has been available in the U.S. for just over a year. It's intended for patients whose decay has not gone beyond the tooth enamel.\n\nTo Drill Or Not To Drill\n\nPhark says that when decay is caught very early or very late, dentists have a clear course of action: Early problems can often be reversed with better brushing, fluoride or calcium-containing toothpastes -- and late-stage cavities need to be filled. But at the intermediate stages, dentists don't have many options.\n\n\"In many of those cases we decide, 'OK, this lesion is too small to be treated with a filling.' So, we are actually waiting until the lesion grows bigger and bigger and becomes deep enough and worthy to be drilled out and be filled,\" Phark says.\n\nGerman researcher Sebastian Paris is a dentist and one of the drill-less cavity treatment's developers.\n\n\"We aim to treat these intermediate lesions -- not the very early ones, but the intermediate ones -- where usually, as a dentist, you are not sure whether you should make a filling or not,\" Paris says.\n\nWhen tooth decay begins, minerals, like calcium, are leached out of the tooth enamel, leaving behind sponge-like pores in the enamel. If the decay process is allowed to continue, the pores grow and form a hole, known as a cavity.\n\nThe new treatment uses a coating of mild acid that is applied to the decay to open up a route to the pores and clear out decayed enamel. Then the open pores are filled with a clear resin.\n\nParis says the key to getting the treatment to work was finding a filling material that wasn't thick and goopy so the porous enamel would immediately suck it up like a sponge.\n\n\"When you take a sugar cube and you put it into your coffee, you will see that it is soaked up with the coffee,\" Paris says. \"But if you put your sugar cube into honey, you can imagine that it will take ages to soak into the sugar cube.\"\n\nAvoiding the drill has the advantage of preserving and extending the life of the natural tooth. However, some dentists argue that any time before a cavity actually forms, tooth decay can be stopped -- and even reversed -- by the patients themselves, using, for example, fluoride toothpaste.\n\n\"An alternative could simply be brushing better in a certain location and not drinking Coca-Cola all day long,\" says Mark Wolff, a professor of dentistry at New York University who specializes in cariology, or the study of tooth decay.\n\nWolff says that while the no-drill approach to treating this type of tooth decay has promise, fluoride treatments and other patient-applied methods are still more inexpensive, less invasive and have a much longer track record of success.\n\n\"Might this be a good application to help that person recover or prevent this decay from advancing? Absolutely. I think the jury is still out on the product a little bit. Hopefully it works. It's just still in its earliest stages,\" Wolff says.\n\nBecause it's so new, it's still unclear how the Icon resin filling holds up over time. And clinical studies have shown that the treatment fails to stop decay from advancing up to 15 percent of the time.\n\nBut Wolff says that for patients who aren't able or willing to change their dental hygiene habits, or who are predisposed to tooth decay, this may be a good solution for keeping the dentist's drill at bay.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "\n\n\nOddly, while the story says this product is cheaper than drilling and filling a cavity\u2026 and it includes a comment from an expert saying this product is more expensive than other approaches to preventing cavities, it does not say how much this product costs.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "April 21, 2010 -- An experimental oral drug is showing early promise for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, a study shows.\n\nIn preliminary research published this week in Nature, researchers from Bristol-Myers Squibb -- the maker of the drug -- report that patients who took the drug showed dramatic reductions in viral load while exhibiting few side effects.\n\nThe research is so early that the drug hasn't been named.

Another trial in 2013, however, suggested that removing clots was not beneficial, he added.\n\nIn this latest trial, researchers found that routinely removing clots was not beneficial, Jolly said.\n\nJolly isn't sure why removing clots causes additional problems. It is possible that parts of the clot break off and travel elsewhere in the heart or brain, he said.\n\n\"This is an unexpected finding, and we want to confirm this in other studies,\" Jolly said.\n\nJolly said there are mechanical methods of removing clots, which were not tested in this study. Whether these methods would have produced better results isn't clear. \"The jury is out on that. It needs to be tested in large trials,\" he said.\n\nHowever, preliminary results from small trials of mechanical clot removal have not been promising, Jolly noted.\n\nJolly said the lesson from his team's trial is that clot removal should be used only as a rescue treatment when an angioplasty fails to clear an artery.\n\n\"As a routine therapy, clot removal is not beneficial and could have some significant downsides,\" he said.\n\nThe results of the study were published online March 16 in the New England Journal of Medicine to coincide with a planned presentation of the findings at the American College of Cardiology's annual meeting in San Diego.\n\nFor the study, Jolly and colleagues randomly assigned 10,732 patients undergoing an angioplasty after a heart attack to have clots manually removed or to not have them removed.\n\nAmong all the patients, 6.9 percent who had clots removed, and 7 percent of those who didn't, died, had another heart attack or developed heart failure in the 180 days after the procedure.\n\nIn the 30 days after the procedure, 0.7 percent of the patients who had clots removed suffered a stroke, as did 0.3 percent of those who only had angioplasty, Jolly's team found.\n\nDr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said, \"This is a very important and eagerly awaited clinical trial.\"\n\nA number of studies have suggested a benefit from manually removing clots during an angioplasty, but this trial found no clinical benefits for doing so, he said.\n\n\"These findings will likely have important implications for clinical practice,\" Fonarow said.\n\nVisit the U.S. National Library of Medicine for more on angioplasty.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not discuss the cost of angioplasty, or whether that cost would be affected if routine practice regarding clot removal is changed.

In humans and many animals the lateral sleeping position is the most common one. The buildup of brain waste chemicals may contribute to the development of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other neurological conditions. Their finding is published in the Journal of Neuroscience.\n\nDr. Benveniste, Principal Investigator and a Professor in the Departments of Anesthesiology and Radiology at Stony Brook University School of Medicine, has used dynamic contrast MRI for several years to examine the glymphatic pathway in rodent models. The method enables researchers to identify and define the glymphatic pathway, where cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) filters through the brain and exchanges with interstitial fluid (ISF) to clear waste, similar to the way the body\u2019s lymphatic system clears waste from organs. It is during sleep that the glymphatic pathway is most efficient. Brain waste includes amyloid \u03b2 (amyloid) and tau proteins, chemicals that negatively affect brain processes if they build up.\n\nIn the paper, \u201cThe Effect of Body Posture on Brain Glymphatic Transport,\u201d Dr. Benveniste and colleagues used a dynamic contrast MRI method along with kinetic modeling to quantify the CSF-ISF exchange rates in anesthetized rodents\u2019 brains in three positions \u2013 lateral (side), prone (down), and supine (up).\n\n\u201cThe analysis showed us consistently that glymphatic transport was most efficient in the lateral position when compared to the supine or prone positions,\u201d said Dr. Benveniste. \u201cBecause of this finding, we propose that the body posture and sleep quality should be considered when standardizing future diagnostic imaging procedures to assess CSF-ISF transport in humans and therefore the assessment of the clearance of damaging brain proteins that may contribute to or cause brain diseases.\u201d\n\nDr. Benveniste and first-author Dr. Hedok Lee, Assistant Professor in the Departments of Anesthesiology and Radiology at Stony Brook developed the safe posture positions for the experiments. Their colleagues at the University of Rochester, including Lulu Xie, Rashid Deane and Maiken Nedergaard, PhD, used fluorescence microscopy and radioactive tracers to validate the MRI data and to assess the influence of body posture on the clearance of amyloid from the brains.\n\n\u201cIt is interesting that the lateral sleep position is already the most popular in human and most animals \u2013 even in the wild \u2013 and it appears that we have adapted the lateral sleep position to most efficiently clear our brain of the metabolic waste products that built up while we are awake,\u201d says Dr. Nedergaard. \u201cThe study therefore adds further support to the concept that sleep subserves a distinct biological function of sleep and that is to \u2018clean up\u2019 the mess that accumulates while we are awake. Many types of dementia are linked to sleep disturbances, including difficulties in falling asleep. It is increasing acknowledged that these sleep disturbances may accelerate memory loss in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Our findng brings new insight into this topic by showing it is also important what position you sleep in,\u201d she explained.\n\nDr. Benveniste cautioned that while the research team speculates that the human glymphatic pathway will clear brain waste most efficiency when sleeping in the lateral position as compared to other positions, testing with MRI or other imaging methods in humans are a necessary first step.\n\nOther co-authors on the paper include: Lulu Xie, Hongyi Kang, and Rashid Deane of the Center for Translational Neuromedicine, University of Rochester; Jean Logan of the Department of Radiology, New York University Langone Medical Center; and Tian Feng of the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Stony Brook University.", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Cost is not an applicable criteria since there\u2019s no cost associated with sleeping (unless one goes to a sleep clinic).", "answer": 2}, {"article": "The website for LipoFuze says that the supplement \"increases the metabolic mechanism in your body.\" The site also says the green tea and caffeine will \"rev up your metabolism\" and \"increase energy, focus and physical performance.\" The site features testimonials it says are from users who claim they have lost huge amounts of weight with the help of LipoFuze.

The researchers say this may lead to new national guidelines for treating this cancer subtype, known as uterine serous carcinoma.\n\nUterine serous carcinoma makes up less than 10 percent of all cancers of the endometrium, or lining of the womb, diagnosed in the United States each year, but it accounts for more than a third of the 10,000 endometrial cancer deaths annually. The aggressive carcinomas often don't cause symptoms until they've begun to spread throughout the body. As a result, the average time that standard chemotherapy and surgical treatments can keep the tumor from growing or spreading--known as progression-free survival--is only about eight months.\n\n\"The fact that these tumors grow rapidly, but also have a propensity to spread to lymph nodes and other organs very early, is a double whammy for women,\" says Amanda Fader, M.D., associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and first author of the new study.\n\nFader and her colleagues knew that about 30 percent of all uterine serous carcinomas test positive for HER2/neu, a receptor protein that is also overexpressed in about 10 percent of all breast cancers. Trastuzumab binds to and blocks HER2/neu, keeping it from driving tumor growth, and has been shown to be effective in so-called HER2 positive breast cancers.\n\nFrom August 2011 through March 2017, Fader, Alessandro Santin, M.D., professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Yale University, and collaborators at 11 other cancer treatment centers in the U.S. randomly assigned 61 women with uterine serous carcinoma, being seen at the participating institutions, to receive either the standard chemotherapeutic regimen--a combination of the drugs carboplatin and paclitaxel--or those drugs plus trastuzumab. Some 41 of the patients had stage 3 or 4 uterine serous carcinoma--known as advanced disease--and 17 had recurrent uterine serous carcinoma. All tested positive for the HER2/neu receptor.\n\nAmong all patients, the 28 controls receiving only the standard carboplatin and paclitaxel combination had an average progression-free survival time of eight months, and the 30 who received trastuzumab in addition had an average progression-free survival time of 12.6 months. However, the difference was even more profound in the 41 patients with advanced disease, whose progression-free survival time went from an average of 9.3 months to 17.9 months with the addition of trastuzumab.\n\n\"Even an improvement of a few months may be quite meaningful for women with these cancers,\" says Fader, who is also affiliated with the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins.\n\nAmong patients with recurrent disease, progression-free survival time increased from an average of six months to 9.2 months. The difference, Fader says, may be that these patients have been heavily treated in the past, are more likely to have overall poorer health and are more likely to have mutated or heterogeneous tumors, or tumors with different levels of HER2 expression.\n\nFollow-up studies of the women who remain alive--who now number 35--continue, the researchers say, to track the impact of trastuzumab on overall survival time even after tumor progression. But the results of the trial, they add, were strong enough to warrant submission to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, which guides the design of standard treatment plans around the country.\n\nFader cautions that a larger study of the drug combination, or other combinations, is needed to confirm the findings and potentially extend survival even more. She notes that using trastuzumab to selectively treat uterine serous carcinoma that express HER2/neu is part of a broader trend at Johns Hopkins and other cancer centers to use the tools of tailored therapy, or precision medicine, based on the molecular and genetic makeup of tumors and patients.\n\nOther authors of the paper are Dana M.

The Weight Watchers group also had a bigger improvement in a measure of long-term control of their blood sugar, which can reduce the risk for serious problems related to Type 2 diabetes.

The paper, The Sternum-Nipple Distance is Double the Nipple-Inframammary Fold Distance in Macromastia, is published Ahead-of-Print online in the Annals of Plastic Surgery.\n\n\"Breast reduction is one of the most commonly performed plastic surgery procedures. The long-term appearance after reduction is not optimized 50% of the time using standard reduction techniques,\" notes lead author Dr. Frank Lau. \"At LSU Health New Orleans, we offer an improved technique that preserves more of the critical breast anatomy. This study provides an anatomical foundation for why our technique may yield better, longer-lasting results.\"\n\nAbout 50% of patients who undergo the most commonly used breast reduction technique experience pseudoptosis or \"bottoming out\" as a long-term complication. This occurs when breast tissue drops to the lower portion of the breast independent of nipple position.\n\n\"We want our patients to have a long-lasting, aesthetically pleasing breast shape,\" says Lau.\n\nBelieving that disruption of the lower suspensory ligaments may be a critical factor because they are stronger than the upper sensory ligaments, the researchers conducted a retrospective review of 208 patients who underwent breast reduction surgery from 2008-2015, studying the results in 400 individual breasts. In all patients, only one reduction technique was performed per patient. Ninety-two percent of the 174 reductions performed with the inferior pedicle technique used a Wise pattern incision, which disrupts the lower suspensory ligaments, and 7.5% used a Boston modification of Robertson technique, which preserves the lower suspensory ligaments. Of the 33 superomedial pedicle reductions, 25 (75.8%) used a Wise pattern incision and 8 (24.2%) used a vertical pattern incision.\n\nBy measuring the sternal notch-nipple distance and the nipple-inframammary fold distance ( proxies for upper and lower sensory ligament strength, respectively), the study found a differential rate of stretch - for every 1 cm in upper sensory ligament stretch, the lower sensory ligament length increases by 0.45 cm. This relationship strengthens the researchers' hypothesis that the lower pole ligaments stretch at a significantly slower rate than the upper pole ligaments. An anatomic basis for this differential may exist. A horizontal membrane of dense connective tissue originating at the level of the fifth rib that divides the breast into segments at the level of the nipple has been described. This division may signify a transition point in sensory ligament strength. On that basis, the authors recommend that techniques such as the Boston modification of Robertson technique should be preferred by surgeons seeking to avoid pseudoptosis. Other advantages of the Boston modification of Robertson technique include decreased operative time and elimination of the \"triple point,\" the most common site of postoperative incision rupture.\n\n\"This study is one of the largest breast anthropometry (measurement) studies ever performed,\" says Lau. \"These results help us provide the best breast reduction outcomes to our patients.\"\n\nCo-authors include Thomas Steele, a 4th-year medical student at LSU Health New Orleans School of Medicine, and Julian Pribaz, MD, of Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School.\n\nLSU Health Sciences Center New Orleans educates Louisiana's health care professionals.

The group numbers about 7,500 patients a year in the United States.\n\nThe one-time infusion, known as CAR T-cell therapy, is made by Kite Pharma, which is based in Santa Monica, Calif., and recently was bought by Gilead Sciences for $11.9 billion. Kite announced Wednesday that the treatment's brand name will be Yescarta and its price will be $373,000.\n\nIn late August, the FDA cleared the first CAR T-cell therapy, which is designed for children and young adults whose leukemia doesn't respond to standard treatments. About 600 patients in the United States fall into that category every year. Kymriah, which costs $475,000, is manufactured by Novartis.\n\nBiotech analysts had expected the Kite price to be lower than Kymriah's, in part because the number of eligible patients is larger and the response rates are lower. Even so, Yescarta's cost is likely to stoke the ongoing debate about high drug prices.\n\nThe FDA approval is the latest step forward for the fast-moving field of immunotherapy, which aims to bolster the immune system to attack malignancies. CAR T-cell therapies are among several approaches, along with treatments called checkpoint inhibitors and cancer vaccines, but they have recently grabbed much of the attention. Dozens of other companies also are working on them.\n\n\u201cToday, marks another milestone in the development of a whole new scientific paradigm for the treatment of serious diseases,\u201d FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement, adding that the approval demonstrates \u201cthe continued momentum of this promising new area of medicine.\u201d\n\nA CAR T-cell therapy involves a complicated and customized procedure in which T cells \u2014 sometimes called the foot soldiers of the immune system \u2014 are removed from the patient. They are sent to a special lab and genetically modified to target a protein on the surface of the patient's cancer cells. Once the modified cells are returned to the patient, their numbers expand exponentially as they become an army of cancer fighters.\n\nIn 2015, Marie Miceli was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma at Siteman Cancer Center in St. Louis, which is jointly owned by Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine.

Then they offered her a slot in Kite's clinical trial, a last-resort effort. \u201cI could feel it when they put those T cells back in,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the craziest feeling in the world.\u201d When she was checked a month later, she said, her cancer was gone. It hasn't returned.\n\nKite's \u201cvein-to-vein\u201d turnaround period \u2014 from cell extraction to reinfusion \u2014 is about 17 days, according to Frederick Locke, an oncologist at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa and co-leader of the Kite trial.\n\nThe FDA said the safety and efficacy of Yescarta were established in a multi-center trial of more than 100 adults with large B-cell lymphoma. An independent review committee found that 72 percent of patients treated with a single infusion responded to therapy, including 51 percent who then showed no evidence of remaining cancer. Kite has said that at six months, 44 percent of patients were still responding, with 39 percent having no sign of cancer.\n\n\u201cThis is not just an incremental benefit,\u201d said David Chang, Kite's chief medical officer. \u201cIt raises the potential that a cure can be possible.\u201d Some of the first patients who underwent treatment now have been in remission for three to five years, he said, although he cautioned that it's still too early to know whether those patients are cured.\n\nLocke said about 13 percent of patients in the trial had a severe side effect known as cytokine release syndrome, which produces high fevers, low blood pressure and other flulike symptoms. Twenty-eight percent had neurological \u201cevents,\u201d such as severe confusion; three patients died of complications caused by the treatment.\n\n\u201cThese are patients who knew they were out of options,\u201d he said, noting that lymphoma patients who relapse or don't respond to treatment have just a 50 percent chance of surviving for six months.\n\nBecause of the side effects, the treatment will carry a boxed warning, the FDA's most serious. In addition, the agency is requiring hospitals and clinics that dispense Yescarta to be certified after undergoing special training.\n\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults. This type of cancer begins in the immune system and can be fast- or slow-growing, the FDA noted.\n\nKite's CAR T-cell product was developed years ago at the National Cancer Institute by pioneering scientist Steven Rosenberg and licensed to the company for commercialization.\n\nArmin Ghobadi, an oncologist at Siteman who was an investigator in the Kite trial, said the new treatment is \u201cjust the first step\u201d and that researchers are working to make it safer and more effective.

That, in turn, may rev up inflammation in their tissues.\n\nIn the study, funded by the Israeli Ministry of Health, 101 patients were randomly assigned to either a concoction without pomegranate juice, or the real thing.\n\nAfter downing about half a cup three times a week over a year, those who drank the real thing had a reduction of inflammatory molecules in their blood.\n\nThey also made fewer trips to the hospital.\n\n\u201cWe found significant reductions in hospitalization due to infections, with more than 40 percent reduction in the first hospitalization and 80 percent in the second,\u201d said Kristal.\n\nHowever, the researchers were only able to rule out chance as the cause of the reduction in the second visit to the hospital.\n\nAccording to the findings, among 50 patients drinking pomegranate juice for a year, about two would have to go to the hospital at least twice. By comparison, that number would be nearly 11 in patients not drinking the juice.\n\nThe researchers say they don\u2019t know if their results extend to other brands as well, and suggest squeezing your own juice.

A closer look at the recent study suggests that raloxifene's advantages may not be as great as the government announcement implied. Some cancer experts were less than enthusiastic, and patient advocates were downright skeptical.\n\n\"The outcome of the study is not as clear cut as we might have hoped for,\" said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. \"It will take some time for experts to review the data to determine which of the two treatments is preferable.\"\n\nFran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, said the new study had been hyped adding, \"We have many concerns about it on many levels.\"\n\nAnother group, Breast Cancer Action, said, \"We are very concerned that treating risk as a medical condition will result in substituting one disease for another.\"\n\nThe study included nearly 20,000 women 35 and older who were past menopause and had an increased risk of developing breast cancer. To qualify, their risk had to be at least that of an average 60- to 64-year-old woman \u2014 a 1.66 percent chance of getting the disease within 5 years. On average, the participants actually had more than twice that risk, around 4 percent, meaning that 40 of 1,000 would be affected. (Women can quickly figure out their own risk at the Web site cancer.gov/bcrisktool).\n\nHalf the participants took one drug, and half the other for about five years. Their rates of invasive breast cancer were the same, 163 cases for tamoxifen and 167 for raloxifene \u2014 about half as many as would have been expected without treatment.\n\nSo raloxifene looked just as good as tamoxifen. Even better news, the cancer institute said, was that those taking raloxifene \"had 36 percent fewer uterine cancers and 29 percent fewer blood clots.\" Based on those findings, it is easy to see why raloxifene was declared the winner.\n\nBut numbers can be tricky. Expressed as percentages, the differences between the drugs for uterine cancer and blood clots sound large.\n\n\"But the actual numbers are small,\" Dr. Lichtenfeld said.\n\nAmong women taking tamoxifen in the study, 36 of 4,732 got uterine cancer, while for raloxifene the number was 23 of 4,712. (Women who had had hysterectomies were not counted.) As for blood clots, there were 141 in the 9,726 women on tamoxifen and 100 in the 9,745 on raloxifene\n\n\"Women who took raloxifene did get uterine cancer, and they did have blood clots,\" Dr. Lichtenfeld said. \"Any suggestion that tamoxifen is the only drug saddled with getting these diseases is not accurate.\"\n\nMore important, the difference between the numbers of side effects was not statistically significant, meaning that it could have occurred by chance and that the drugs could be similar or even the same. That fact was not stated in the news release, and the researchers mentioned it only briefly during the news conference, calling the results \"borderline\" significant.\n\nMany researchers say that results don't count unless they pass the statistical tests. But Dr. Leslie Ford, an associate director for clinical research at the cancer institute, said that the differences could not be ignored because they came so near to being significant. Had the study gone on a little longer, they might have crossed the line, she said.\n\nAnother issue is that the message from the cancer institute seemed to play down a shortcoming of raloxifene that cancer doctors consider important. The institute emphasized that raloxifene lowered the risk of \"invasive\" breast cancer, tumors that have penetrated surrounding tissue and that have the potential to spread and turn deadly.\n\nBut raloxifene did not prevent two other serious breast conditions, whereas tamoxifen did reduce their risk by 50 percent. Those conditions, sometimes called noninvasive breast cancers, are L.C.I.S. and D.C.I.S., for lobular and ductal carcinomas in situ. Lobular growths increase the likelihood of invasive cancer, and ductal ones can become invasive. D.C.I.S. is often treated like breast cancer, with surgery and radiation.\n\n\"D.C.I.S. is not inconsequential,\" said Dr. Lichtenfeld, adding that it leads some women to have both breasts removed. Since tamoxifen lowers the risks of both invasive and noninvasive tumors, he said, it \"has a broader spectrum of activity against breast cancer.\"\n\nDr. Larry Norton, a breast cancer expert at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said he also found it worrisome that raloxifene did not share tamoxifen's ability to prevent the noninvasive growths.\n\nWhen it came to L.C.I.S. and D.C.I.S., the difference between the two drugs was statistically significant, meaning it was likely to be real and not due to chance. Yet that distinction was not pointed out in the news release, and, Dr. Lichtenfeld noted, it was \"de-emphasized\" during the news conference.\n\nBut Dr. Ford of the cancer institute said raloxifene's ability to prevent invasive cancers was more important.\n\n\"Invasive cancer is what kills you,\" she said, adding that only about 10 percent of D.C.I.S. turn invasive, and that those that do can be treated. She called it \"twisted logic\" to dwell on tamoxifen's superior ability to prevent the noninvasive cancers because, she said, \"We're not preventing noninvasive cancers because nobody's taking tamoxifen anyway.\"\n\nGiven that there are shades of gray and room for debate about these findings, some critics questioned the way they were made public.\n\nThe results were announced by the cancer institute in a news release and a telephone conference for news reporters. Contrary to usual practice, the complete data had not yet been revealed to scientists or published in a medical journal, though the institute said it intended to do so. Officials said they announced the findings before publishing them because they had implications for public health.\n\nMs. Visco said, \"How is it ethical to do that, to make this much hype around something that is not a health emergency, and you can't check their data?\"\n\nShe said she also worried that the announcement might have left the impression that the drugs could prevent breast cancer entirely.\n\n\"It's not prevention,\" Ms. Visco said. \"It's risk reduction, short term, for a subset of women we cannot identify.\"\n\nThe concern is that many women would have to take tamoxifen or raloxifene for a few to benefit. In 1,000 high-risk women like those in the study, for instance, without treatment 40 would be expected to develop invasive breast cancer over the next five years. If all 1,000 were treated, only 20 cases would occur.\n\nBut since there is no way to predict who will actually get cancer, everyone has to be treated, meaning that 980 will be exposed to the drug's risks but will get no cancer benefit.\n\n\"The hope is that at some point we'll be able to pinpoint who really is at high risk of breast cancer and then we'll know what to do,\" Ms. Visco said. \"But we're not anywhere near there.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Dr. Ford said, at least tamoxifen and raloxifene give women at risk the chance to do something. She compared the drugs to statins and blood pressure drugs, which people take even though they feel well, to lower their risks of heart attacks and strokes. But others argue that heart attacks are far more common than breast cancer, and the drugs to prevent them much safer.\n\nTo Dr. Norton, the most important conclusion to be drawn from the study is that more research on breast cancer prevention is needed. He said the next step should be to test another class of drugs called aromatase inhibitors, already in use to treat breast cancer, to see if they can do better at risk reduction than tamoxifen or raloxifene.\n\n\"Until we have zero cancer,\" he said, \"I'm not going to make any claims about a great advance.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "No costs were mentioned.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "An experimental treatment for prostate cancer tumors using high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) shows promise as an effective treatment with fewer side effects than existing therapies.\n\nThe idea behind the new procedure is similar to lumpectomy in breast cancer patients, in which doctors remove only the tumors instead of the entire breast. Using HIFU, doctors can focus on treating only the cancer cells on the prostate while causing minimal damage to the surrounding tissue. Unlike more common and invasive treatments such as radiotherapy and surgical removal of the prostate gland, HIFU may be able to avoid side effects like urine leakage and impotence.\n\nThe new study, designed as a proof-of-concept study, involved just 41 men. Doctors used MRI and mapping biopsies to locate the cancerous tissues. They then focused high-energy sound waves on the affected area, causing the cancer cells to heat up to around 80\u00b0C, which kills the cells. None of the patients reported urinary incontinence a year after treatment, and only 1 in 10 suffered from poor erections. Overall, about 95% of the men were cancer-free after a full year following the trial.\n\n\u201cThe signal from this study is quite strong,\u201d study author Hashim Ahmed, a urologist at the University College London, told Bloomberg. \u201cWhen you look at the current standard of care, there\u2019s a 1-in-3, or 1-in-2 chance of having the perfect outcome.

The procedure was carried out under general anesthesia and most of the patients had hospital stays of less than 24 hours after the treatment.\n\n\u201cFocal therapy of individual prostate-cancer lesions, regardless of whether they are multifocal or unifocal, leads to a low rate of genitourinary side-effects and an encouraging rate of early freedom from clinically significant prostate cancer,\u201d the authors concluded in the study.\n\nProstate cancer is the most common cancer among men.

The study, led by Tonya Orchard, an assistant professor of human nutrition at The Ohio State University, appears in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research.\n\nWomen with the least-inflammatory diets (based on a scoring system called the Dietary Inflammatory Index) lost less bone density during the six-year follow-up period than their peers with the most-inflammatory diets. This was despite the fact that they started off with lower bone density overall.\n\nFurthermore, diets with low inflammatory potential appeared to correspond to lower risk of hip fracture among one subgroup of the study -- post-menopausal white women younger than 63.\n\nThe findings suggest that women's bone health could benefit when they choose a diet higher in beneficial fats, plants and whole grains, said Orchard, who is part of Ohio State's Food Innovation Center.\n\n\"This suggests that as women age, healthy diets are impacting their bones,\" Orchard said. \"I think this gives us yet another reason to support the recommendations for a healthy diet in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.\"\n\nBecause the study was observational, it's not possible to definitively link dietary patterns and bone health and fracture outcomes.\n\nRebecca Jackson, the study's senior author and director of Ohio State's Center for Clinical and Translational Science, said the new findings support a growing body of evidence that factors that increase inflammation can increase osteoporosis risk.\n\n\"By looking at the full diet rather than individual nutrients, these data provide a foundation for studying how components of the diet might interact to provide benefit and better inform women's health and lifestyle choices,\" said Jackson, who is national chair of the Women's Health Initiative steering committee.\n\nPrevious studies have connected high levels of inflammatory markers in the blood to bone loss and to fractures in older women and men, which prompted Orchard and her colleagues to wonder what they'd find if they took one more step back - to the dietary choices that contribute to inflammation in the body.\n\nThe Dietary Inflammatory Index - developed to assess the quality of diet from maximally to minimally inflammatory based on nutrients consumed - helped them accomplish that. Dietary information as well as data on bone density and fracture were collected from a large group of the participants in the Women's Health Initiative, the largest study of postmenopausal women's health undertaken in U.S. history.\n\nParticipants in the WHI were 50 to 79 when they enrolled in the study of prevention and control of common diseases impacting older women. Enrollment ran from 1993 to 1998.\n\nFor the new analysis - the first of its kind - the research team looked at dietary data from 160,191 women and assigned inflammation scores based on 32 food components that the women reported consuming in the three months prior to their enrollment.\n\nThe researchers used bone-mineral-density data from a subset of 10,290 women. Fracture data was collected for the entire study group.\n\nOrchard and her colleagues found a correlation only between high-inflammatory diets and fracture in younger white women in the study. Higher scores were associated with an almost 50 percent larger risk of hip fracture in Caucasian women younger than 63, compared with the risk for women in the group with the lowest inflammatory scores.\n\n\"This suggests that a high-quality, less-inflammatory diet may be especially important in reducing hip fracture risk in younger women,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nBut in the study group overall, more-inflammatory diets were not linked to fracture and - in fact - the researchers found a modestly lower risk of lower-arm and total fracture in women with the highest dietary inflammation scores. One possible explanation included in the study: The women with lower inflammation scores were more physically active as a group and therefore were at a slightly greater risk of falls.\n\nWomen with the least-inflammatory diets had lower bone mineral density overall at the start of the study, but lost less bone than their high-inflammation peers, the researchers found. The lower bone density to start could be because women with healthier diets are more likely to be of a smaller build, Orchard said. Larger people have higher bone density to support their larger frames.\n\n\"These women with healthier diets didn't lose bone as quickly as those with high-inflammation diets, and this is important because after menopause women see a drastic loss in bone density that contributes to fractures,\" Orchard said.\n\nVedat Yildiz of Ohio State's Center for Biostatistics also worked on the study, which was supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The release does not discuss costs.

Risk reduction [was] probably in the range of 80 to 95 percent,\" said researcher Timothy Rebbeck, an epidemiologist at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nAnd women who had ovaries removed reduced their risk of ovarian cancer by as much as 80 percent.\n\nThe study findings are extremely reassuring to Rebbeck -- no breast cancer diagnoses among women who had double mastectomies after three years of follow-up. Among the women who did not have the surgery, 7 percent were later diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nRebbeck says these decreases are big but are cautions that cancer risk will never be brought down to zero. That's because all the tissue is never completely taken out.\n\n\"Breast tissue is found throughout the torso and can't be completely removed through surgical means. And, with ovarian cancer, the ovary leaves behind cells that could go on to become cancerous. So, it's just not possible to remove all the tissue that might be at risk,\" he says.\n\nOne of the women who decided to take that chance is 61-year-old Toby of New Jersey.

I thought I was getting very, very good surveillance, and I thought that would probably be enough and they would be able to diagnose something very, very early and be able to cure me if I were to get breast cancer,\" she says.\n\nBut her doctors thought otherwise. Breast cancer caused by BRCA mutations is particularly aggressive. And they told Toby her lifetime risk of that type of cancer was as high as 90 percent.\n\nToby was one of the women researchers from around the country tracked in the study to see how they fared after having this surgery.\n\nWomen like Toby who chose both ovary and breast removal had dramatically lower risks of getting both cancers after the surgery. Only 3 percent of those who had surgery died, compared with 10 percent of those who did not, during the follow-up period.\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the study, Virginia Kaklamani, an oncologist at Northwestern University, says lives can be saved if women have genetic testing.\n\n\"A lot of times I see these women having had a very preventable type of breast cancer. Preventable because I can identify the fact that they had a higher risk of getting breast cancer,\" she says.\n\n\"Had they been genetically tested a few years prior to my seeing them, they would have had the option of having bilateral mastectomy.

It\u2019s an emotional decision that women often make quickly, considering that surgeries often take place within days of their cancer diagnosis.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about the women who are on the fence and make a very quick decision before really considering the other options or the fact that it is an irreversible procedure,\u201d said Dr. Todd Tuttle, the U\u2019s chief of surgical oncology and lead author of the study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\nWhen diagnosed with cancer in her right breast last year, Debra Elmore-Nesheim talked with her new husband and other relatives about the appropriate treatment.

That makes removing both breasts a better option for younger women with longer life spans. Many oncologists also recommend it for women with genetic predispositions for breast cancer.\n\nFor other women, a double mastectomy might eliminate another breast cancer, but it won\u2019t stop cancer from resurfacing in vital organs, Tuttle said.

Research has found this procedure is equally effective, particularly with smaller tumors and often when used in combination with radiation.\n\nOf the women in Tuttle\u2019s study who received mastectomies in 2003, 11 percent chose to have both breasts removed. That is an increase from 4.2 percent in 1998.\n\nThe rising use of magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, is likely contributing to the increase in double mastectomies, said Dr. Joseph Leach, a medical oncologist with Park Nicollet Health Services. Such scans are becoming standard for women who appear to have cancer in one breast, and half the time they raise suspicions about the other breast.\n\nWhile these suspicions rarely end up as cancer, they do often result in follow-up tests such as biopsies and ultrasounds that can frighten patients, Leach said.\n\n\u201cOur own impression is that women in some ways are getting sort of scared into having prophylactic mastectomies because of having these uncertain tests,\u201d Leach said.\n\nBoth Leach and Tuttle are pursuing research studies to address the why question.\n\nWomen choosing to have both breasts removed face higher surgery costs and slightly higher risks of post-surgery complications and infections.\n\nMost women are satisfied after double mastectomies, but a Mayo Clinic survey showed that as many as 10 percent are unsatisfied because of their appearance or medical complications. The survey results came a decade ago, however, when the safety of breast implants was a major issue, said Mayo\u2019s Dr. Lynn Hartmann.\n\nThe safety concerns have been reduced and cosmetic procedures have improved, but some women still probably regret the decision, she said.\n\nHartmann said doctors could take pressure off women by performing lumpectomies first to eliminate their cancer tumors. Then the women can have genetic tests and assess their risks for follow-up cancers before deciding whether to have one or both breasts removed.\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019ve just put some time on the table for them rather than trying to have them make this major decision \u2026 in a brief period of time,\u201d she said.\n\nElmore-Nesheim, the nurse with breast cancer, said cosmetic concerns played a role.

The findings indicate that if uninfected populations are vaccinated with Gardasil 9, approximately 90 per cent of all cervical cancers worldwide could be prevented.\n\nPublished in the New England Journal of Medicine, the study found that, among uninfected women, Gardasil 9 was 97 per cent effective at preventing high-grade cervical, vulvar and vaginal disease caused by HPV 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58, and was equally effective as the current Gardasil vaccine in preventing diseases caused by HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18.\n\nProfessor Jack Cuzick of Queen Mary University of London, who co-authored the report and participated in the design and analysis of the study, and served on the Trial Advisory Board, comments: \"This is a significant achievement.

Eventually this will mean less screening is needed, as women will have greater protection from the outset.\n\n\"Gardasil 9 offers the potential to increase overall cervical cancer prevention from 70 to 90 per cent, nearly eliminating this cancer among vaccinated women. However, it's crucial to remember that vaccination must be done before exposure to the virus. Our focus for prevention must be on girls aged 12-13, as the current UK vaccine programme is doing, but the vaccine may also be appropriate for women 25-45 as part of a screening appointment.\"\n\nUntil late last year, there were two available vaccines to protect against HPV related disease (Cervarix and Gardasil). The UK currently uses Gardasil which protects against four HPV types and offers about 70 per cent protection against cervical cancer, and also significantly reduces the risk of other types of cancer and genital warts.\n\nHowever, researchers have been trying to find methods to completely eliminate cervical cancer and other HPV related disease and by adding five more cancer related HPV types. The development of the new Gardasil 9 vaccine makes an important step in that direction.\n\nHPV is the most common sexually transmitted virus. Many people infected with HPV clear it from their systems with no lasting health concerns and some types of the virus are low risk, causing warts or verrucas. However, other types are high risk, causing cervical cancer (and less commonly vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal, and throat cancers). Almost all cases of cervical cancer occur as a result of infection with high risk types of HPV.\n\nCervical cancer is still the fourth most common cancer in women, with over 500,000 cases and 250,000 deaths per year worldwide.

While this emerging research is promising, and contributes to the overall understanding of the health benefits of red raspberries, conclusions cannot be drawn at this time.\n\nIn this human trial, investigators from the Center for Nutrition Research at the Illinois Institute of Technology looked at two study groups: obese individuals with impaired fasting glucose and hyperinsulinemia (PreDM) and healthy weight individuals with normo-glycemia and insulinemia. Participants experienced a significant reduction in postprandial glucose when 2 cups (250g) of red raspberries were consumed with meals compared to no raspberries. The glucose lowering was accompanied with less insulin suggesting improved insulin sensitivity in individuals with pre-diabetes and insulin resistance.\n\n* Xiao, D. Huang, Y. Park, E.

Prebiotics reduce body fat in children who are overweight or obese by altering their gut microbiota, according to new research published in Gastroenterology, the official journal of the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA). Prebiotics are non-digestible food ingredients (such as fiber) that act as fertilizers to help stimulate the growth of good bacteria already in the gut, different from probiotics, which introduce new bacteria into the system.\n\n\"This is a well-designed trial that demonstrates how a prebiotic could potentially help combat one of the most prevalent and costly conditions afflicting children in the developed world -- overnutrition -- by targeting the gut microbiome,\" said Geoffrey A. Preidis, MD, PhD, a member of the AGA Center for Gut Microbiome Research and Education scientific advisory board. \"It is promising to see this evidence that alteration of the gut microbiota can be used to restore health. As a clinician, I hope that continued research into prebiotics will lead to a new strategy for the treatment of obesity.\"\n\nFor this study, researchers from the University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 42 participants. Participants included children, 7 to 12 years old, who were classified as overweight or obese (>85th percentile of body mass index) but otherwise healthy. Participants were randomly assigned to groups given either the prebiotic fiber -- oligofructose-enriched inulin -- or a placebo, once daily for 16 weeks. The prebiotic was provided as a white powder, mixed in water.\n\n\"Powdered fiber, mixed in a water bottle, taken once a day is all we asked the children to change, and we got, what we consider, some pretty exciting results -- it has been fantastic,\" added Raylene A. Reimer, PhD, RD, professor and researcher in the Faculty of Kinesiology at University of Calgary, who led the study.\n\nBased on four-month intervention data, the annual projected body weight increase in the prebiotic group would be 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds), within the expected healthy range, whereas the projected increase in the placebo group was 8 kilograms (17.6 pounds), almost triple the expected yearly weight increase. Thus, supplementation with the prebiotic improved outcomes in children who were overweight or obese. Importantly, the researchers show that the prebiotic induced specific gut bacterial shifts compared to placebo.\n\nThis is the first randomized controlled study to assess comprehensive changes in gut microbial composition with prebiotic intervention in children who are overweight and obese. Excess weight in childhood tends to persist into adulthood and is an early risk factor for obesity-associated morbidity and mortality, highlighting the importance of early intervention.\n\nThe metabolic and microbial findings from this study provide a foundation for a larger clinical trial in the pediatric population.

Yet only 50 percent of those people have been diagnosed with a mental illness.\n\nThe intervention studied by Stanley and her group starts in the ER or a clinic, before the suicidal patient is released. First, a health care professional talks with the patient and tries to understand that person's warning signs for a suicide attempt.\n\n\"If they've grappled with being suicidal, they know what their warning signs are,\" says Stanley. For example, she says, someone might say, \" 'I find that I'm staying in my room, not answering the phone, not answering texts, not answering emails.' That could be a warning sign.\" Others might have repeated thoughts that they're not worthy.\n\nThe next step is for the patient \u2014 with help from the clinician \u2014 to come up with a set of coping strategies to help get through moments of intense suicidal ideation.\n\nFor most people, this intense state only lasts from a few minutes to a couple of hours, she says.\n\nThe coping strategy could be something as simple as playing video games, watching TV or talking to a loved one.\n\nIf people contemplating suicide can distract themselves with something they enjoy doing, they can bypass that narrow window during which suicidal thoughts can overpower them, notes Stanley. \"For suicidal people, the passage of time is their friend,\" she says.\n\nThe provider also tries to persuade patients to remove or distance themselves from their means of suicide. For example, if they own a gun, they should lock it away or give it to someone who can keep it away from them. \"If you make it really hard to use whatever means you were going to use, time passes and you give a chance for suicidal thoughts to subside,\" she says.\n\nSafety planning includes follow-up phone calls with the patient \u2014 the first call is made within 72 hours of being discharged from the ER. The provider asks the patient how the safety plan is being used and helps revise it if needed. The provider also makes sure the patient sees a mental health care provider for long-term care. A provider keeps calling until the patient has had a second appointment with a therapist or counselor.\n\nThat follow-up is key, says Julie Goldstein Grumet, a psychologist at the Zero Suicide Institute at the Education Development Center, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit.\n\n\"People often fall off and they don't follow up on their referrals,\" she says. \"And the times during these transitions from acute care settings is one of the highest risk times of suicides.\"\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, Stanley's team looked at five VA emergency departments across the country that used it and compared the outcomes with four VA emergency rooms that simply discharge patients after stabilizing them.\n\nAmong the nearly 1,200 people who received the intervention, half as many people had made suicide attempts (or had come very close) as those in the control group. In other words, the intervention had nearly halved the risk of suicide in the six months after discharge. Two-thirds of the people in the treatment group had used their safety plans, and they were also twice as likely to get follow-up mental health treatment when compared with the control group.\n\n\"The study is incredibly important ... because it shows brief interventions work,\" says Goldstein Grumet.\n\nRick, a father in Missouri, says a safety plan may have saved his 12-year-old daughter's life. (NPR is leaving off his last name to protect his daughter's privacy.)\n\nIn September 2017, she came very close to taking her own life. When he found out about this from her school principal the next day, Rick rushed her to the ER at Mercy Hospital Jefferson. \"The whole process was overwhelming, because you have your 12-year-old who's wanting to end her life,\" Rick says. \"And she'd not shared any of that with us.\"\n\nThe hospital wasn't part of the new study but was also using a safety planning intervention as part of its efforts to prevent suicides.\n\n\"The crisis counselor did such an amazing job of setting up a safety plan that my daughter felt comfortable with,\" he says.\n\nHe says his daughter didn't want to talk to him or her mother about her struggles, but she agreed to communicate with them in other ways. During times when she felt her urge to take her own life coming back, she agreed to watch TV with her mother or call or text her father.\n\nRick says she usually sends a specific emoji when she is having a bad day. And he responds by distracting her with something completely different.\n\nHe says she also agreed to use a crisis help line if things escalated.\n\n\"It was something that she could follow through with,\" he says. \"It gave her some confidence and it gave me some confidence.\"\n\nHe says the plan has helped his daughter get through her suicidal phase and even slowly open up to her parents.\n\n\"That's what is so powerful about a safety plan,\" says Ahmedani. \"The patient is the author of their safety plan, but it's guided by a provider.\"\n\nAs part of the 2012 National Strategy For Suicide Prevention, many health care providers have adopted the approaches to prevention outlined in the Zero Suicide Initiative, which includes safety planning based on previous evidence showing it works.\n\nWhile safety planning has begun to be used across the country, it ought to be adopted universally, says Goldstein Grumet.\n\n\"It is a brief intervention that hospital workers, primary care staff, outpatient behavioral health, can all be trained in to utilize,\" she says.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "We\u2019re told the intervention takes a few minutes up to two hours for nurses or social workers to administer when a patient comes to the emergency room after a suicide attempt.

And they detected Alzheimer\u2019s proteins in 36 percent of people with normal brain function.\n\nThe study is the latest to show that measuring disease-related proteins in spinal fluid is useful in diagnosing Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nCurrently, only an autopsy can confirm that a person has Alzheimer\u2019s, a fatal and incurable deterioration of the brain that affects more than 26 million people globally.\n\nDoctors diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s by excluding other causes of memory loss, such as stroke, tumors and heavy drinking.

The test is administered like a tuberculin skin test (TST), and results are interpreted by measuring the size of the skin induration two or three days later.\n\nThe TST is the most commonly used test to detect TB infection, with about 50 million tests worldwide each year, according to the World Health Organization. The test is easy to administer but produces too many false positives to achieve the WHO's goal of reducing TB deaths by 95 percent and new cases by 90 percent by 2035, Dr. Ruhwald said.\n\nIntroduced a decade ago, IGRAs have high specificity, producing few false positives, but require blood samples and complicated lab work, which has limited their widespread use. There is also a dramatic price difference between the two diagnostic tests. According to Dr. Ruhwald, a TST costs about $2; an IGRA is 20 to 40 times more expensive depending on setting.\n\nIn the first clinical trial, Dr. Ruhwald and colleagues conducted a double-blinded study of C-Tb in 979 participants enrolled at 13 clinical trial sites in Spain. Participants, all adults, ranged in TB status from presumed uninfected through intermediate and high risk of latent TB to active disease.\n\u2022 Both C-Tb and the IGRA had a specificity of 97 percent.\n\u2022 C-Tb was highly concordant to IGRA in 95 percent of study participants.\n\u2022 The specificity of C-Tb, unlike the TST, was not impacted by the BCG vaccine, the partially effective vaccine that many residents in the developing world receive. TST specificity in this group was only 62 percent.\n\u2022 The sensitivity of C-Tb was comparable to the IGRA in confirmed TB cases (77 percent vs. 81 percent), indicating similar abilities to detect infection.\n\nIn the second double-blinded trial, researchers were primarily concerned with testing how accurate C-Tb was in HIV-positive patients and in young children--populations in which the accuracy of the TST and the IGRA is known to be compromised. The study, conducted in South Africa, enrolled 1,090 participants, including 299 patients with HIV and 402 children as young as 28 days.\n\u2022 Among participants with HIV, the ability of all three tests to detect TB infection was diminished, though the C-Tb appeared more robust in HIV-infected participants with low CD4 T cell counts.\n\u2022 Among children under 5, C-Tb was comparable with the other two tests in identifying those infected.\n\nDr. Ruhwald said another advantage of C-Tb is that the measurement of infection, a 5mm or larger induration, is universal across patients with different risk factors, including HIV infection. With TST, the size of the induration is often adjusted to increase its accuracy in measuring infection in different patient populations.\n\nRegulatory approval for C-Tb is currently being sought and Statens Serum Institute is actively seeking a commercial partner for marketing of C-Tb. The cost of a C-Tb test is to be determined; however, it is expected to be significantly less than an IGRA.\n\nDiagnostic Accuracy of the Novel C-Tb Skin Test for Latent M.tuberculosis Infection; Results from Two Phase III Clinical Trials \n\nM.

C-Tb combines the field friendliness of the PPD-based Tuberculin Skin Test (TST), with the high specificity of the interferon gamma release assays (IGRA).\n\nThis presentation outlines the results from two recently completed phase III trials (TESEC-05 and -06). The results have not previously been published or presented.\n\nThe TESEC-06 trial included 979 participants from 13 clinical trial sites in Catalonia, Galicia and Basque Country (Spain) with various risk profiles of M.tuberculosis infection. The TESEC-05 trial included 1090 participants with symptoms of TB and 100 endemic controls from Cape Town (South Africa).\n\nIn both trials C-Tb and TST were administered in a double-blinded fashion to one or the other forearm. Skin indurations were read 2 to 3 days later. A reading ?5mm was considered positive for the TST and C-Tb (cut off preset in phase II). Blood for IGRA testing (Quantiferon, QFT-GIT) was drawn prior to skin testing.\n\nThe safety profile of C-Tb was acceptable and not different from TST. Test specificity was assessed in 212 presumed unexposed Spanish controls. Here, C-Tb had comparable specificity to QFT-GIT (both 97%, p=1.0, and there was no impact of BCG vaccination). By contrast, previous BCG vaccination subverted TST specificity [62% (67/108) in BCG vaccinated compared to 95% (99/104) in BCG unvaccinated persons; (p<0.001)]. Sensitivity of C-Tb and QFT-GIT was comparable in patients with confirmed TB [77% (235/307) vs 81% (250/307); p=0.08]. In contacts, mirroring the findings with QFT-GIT, there was a strong trend in increasing C-Tb test positivity with M. tuberculosis exposure (figure 1). The impact of age and HIV infection on C-Tb, TST and QFT reactivity was assessed in 1090 individuals with symptoms suspect of TB disease, analysis is ongoing and will be included in the presentation.\n\nThese phase III trial results demonstrate that C-Tb is safe, has comparable diagnostic performance to QFT-GIT and addresses the problem of false positive TST results in BCG vaccinated persons.\n\nThe field-friendliness and high specificity offered by the C-Tb test could allow for improved targeted treatment of M. tuberculosis-infected persons in also in resource-constrained settings, where IGRAs are too complicated to implement.", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "This release provides a very good discussion of costs, stating, \u201cThere is also a dramatic price difference between the two diagnostic tests.

He hopes the new treatment will eventually replace bone-marrow transplantation, an even more arduous, risky and expensive procedure that is now the last hope when other treatments fail in leukemia and related diseases.\n\nThree adults with chronic leukemia treated at the University of Pennsylvania have also had complete remissions, with no signs of disease; two of them have been well for more than two years, said Dr. David Porter. Four adults improved but did not have full remissions, and one was treated too recently to evaluate. A child improved and then relapsed. In two adults, the treatment did not work at all. The researchers were presenting their results on Sunday and Monday in at a meeting of the American Society of Hematology.\n\nDespite the mixed results, cancer experts not involved with the research say it has tremendous promise, because even in this early phase of testing it has worked in seemingly hopeless cases. \u201cI think this is a major breakthrough,\u201d said Dr. Ivan Borrello, a cancer expert and associate professor of medicine at the School of Medicine.\n\nDr. John Wagner, the director of pediatric blood and marrow transplantation at the , called the Pennsylvania results \u201cphenomenal\u201d and said they were \u201cwhat we\u2019ve all been working and hoping for but not seeing to this extent.\u201d\n\nA major drug company, , is betting on the Pennsylvania team and has committed $20 million to building a research center on the university\u2019s campus to bring the treatment to market.\n\nHerv\u00e9 Hoppenot, the president of Novartis Oncology, called the research \u201cfantastic\u201d and said it had the potential \u2014 if the early results held up \u2014 to revolutionize the treatment of leukemia and related blood cancers. Researchers say the same approach, reprogramming the patient\u2019s immune system, may also eventually be used against like breast and .\n\nTo perform the treatment, doctors remove millions of the patient\u2019s T-cells \u2014 a type of white blood cell \u2014 and insert new genes that enable the T-cells to kill cancer cells. The technique employs a disabled form of H.I.V. because it is very good at carrying genetic material into T-cells. The new genes program the T-cells to attack B-cells, a normal part of the immune system that turn malignant in leukemia.\n\nThe altered T-cells \u2014 called chimeric antigen receptor cells \u2014 are then dripped back into the patient\u2019s veins, and if all goes well they multiply and start destroying the cancer.\n\nThe T-cells home in on a protein called CD-19 that is found on the surface of most B-cells, whether they are healthy or malignant.\n\nA sign that the treatment is working is that the patient becomes terribly ill, with raging fevers and chills \u2014 a reaction that oncologists call \u201cshake and bake,\u201d Dr. June said. Its medical name is cytokine-release syndrome, or cytokine storm, referring to the natural chemicals that pour out of cells in the immune system as they are being activated, causing fevers and other symptoms. The storm can also flood the lungs and cause perilous drops in \u2014 effects that nearly killed Emma.\n\nSteroids sometimes ease the reaction, but they did not help Emma. Her temperature hit 105. She wound up on a ventilator, unconscious and swollen almost beyond recognition, surrounded by friends and family who had come to say goodbye.\n\nBut at the 11th hour, a battery of blood tests gave the researchers a clue as to what might help save Emma: her level of one of the cytokines, interleukin-6 or IL-6, had shot up a thousandfold. Doctors had never seen such a spike before and thought it might be what was making her so sick.\n\nDr. June knew that a drug could lower IL-6 \u2014 his daughter takes it for . It had never been used for a crisis like Emma\u2019s, but there was little to lose. Her oncologist, Dr. Stephan A. Grupp, ordered the drug. The response, he said, was \u201camazing.\u201d\n\nWithin hours, Emma began to stabilize. She woke up a week later, on May 2, the day she turned 7; the intensive-care staff sang\n\nSince then, the research team has used the same drug, tocilizumab, in several other patients.\n\nIn patients with lasting remissions after the treatment, the altered T-cells persist in the bloodstream, though in smaller numbers than when they were fighting the disease. Some patients have had the cells for years.\n\nDr. Michel Sadelain, who conducts similar studies at the Sloan-Kettering Institute, said: \u201cThese T-cells are living drugs. With a pill, you take it, it\u2019s eliminated from your body and you have to take it again.\u201d But T-cells, he said, \u201ccould potentially be given only once, maybe only once or twice or three times.\u201d\n\nThe Pennsylvania researchers said they were surprised to find any big drug company interested in their work, because a new batch of T-cells must be created for each patient \u2014 a far cry from the familiar commercial strategy of developing products like or medicines, in which millions of people take the same drug.\n\nBut Mr. Hoppenot said Novartis was taking a different path with cancer drugs, looking for treatments that would have a big, unmistakable impact on a small number of patients. Such home-run drugs can be approved more quickly and efficiently, he said, with smaller studies than are needed for drugs with less obvious benefits.\n\nBut such drugs tend to be extremely expensive. A prime example is the Novartis drug Gleevec, which won rapid approval in 2001 for use against certain types of leukemia and gastrointestinal tumors. It can cost more than $5,000 a month, depending on the dosage.\n\nDr. June said that producing engineered T-cells costs about $20,000 per patient \u2014 far less than the cost of a bone-marrow transplant. Scaling up the procedure should make it even less expensive, he said, but he added, \u201cOur costs do not include any profit margin, facility depreciation costs or other clinical care costs, and other research costs.\u201d\n\nThe research is still in its early stages, and many questions remain. The researchers are not entirely sure why the treatment works, or why it sometimes fails. One patient had a remission after being treated only twice, and even then the reaction was so delayed that it took the researchers by surprise. For the patients who had no response whatsoever, the team suspects a flawed batch of T-cells. The child who had a temporary remission apparently relapsed because not all of her leukemic cells had the marker that was targeted by the altered T-cells.\n\nIt is not clear whether a patient\u2019s body needs the altered T-cells forever. The cells do have a drawback: they destroy healthy B-cells as well as cancerous ones, leaving patients vulnerable to certain types of infections, so Emma and the other patients need regular treatments with immune globulins to prevent illness.\n\nSo far, her parents say, Emma seems to have taken it all in stride. She went back to school this year with her second-grade classmates, and though her grades are high and she reads about 50 books a month, she insists impishly that her favorite subjects are lunch and recess.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for her to be a kid again and get her childhood back,\u201d Mr. Whitehead said.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The study addresses costs nicely,\u00a0noting that any commercial treatment resulting from this research will probably be very expensive.

Smoking cigarettes causes 480,000 premature deaths each year due mainly to a two-fold risk of cardiovascular disease and a 20-fold risk of lung cancer. In a commentary published in the current issue of the American Journal of Medicine, researchers from the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine at Florida Atlantic University reassure clinicians and their patients that varenicline, whose brand name is Chantix, is a safe and effective way to achieve smoking cessation and that failure to use this drug has caused preventable heart attacks and deaths from cardiovascular disease.\n\nIn 2006, varenicline was approved as a safe and effective means to quit smoking and achieved permanent quit rates of approximately 25 percent. In 2009, however, varenicline received a black box warning by the FDA based on their adverse event reports of neuropsychiatric symptoms like depression and thoughts of suicide.\n\nThere were plausible alternative explanations including that nearly half of the subjects had psychiatric histories, 42 percent were taking psychotropic drugs and about 42 percent were suffering from depression. Nonetheless, since then, there has been a 76 percent decline in the number of prescriptions dispensed from a peak of about 2 million in the last quarter of 2007 to about 531,000 in the first quarter of 2014.\n\nIn their commentary, the FAU researchers emphasize that, until recently, the totality of randomized evidence on varenicline had been restricted to eight small trials, which did not demonstrate a hazard. The researchers caution that the reliable detection of small to moderate risks and benefits of drug therapies requires cogent data from large-scale randomized trials designed a priori to test the hypothesis.\n\nSuch a large randomized trial was recently completed that included both apparently healthy individuals as well as those with severe mental illness. The trial was conducted for 12 weeks on about 8,000 long-term smokers and included equal subgroups of those without as well as with psychiatric disorders. In subjects without psychiatric disorders, those treated with varenicline had less neuropsychiatric symptoms and in subjects without psychiatric disorders there were no increases in these symptoms. Both groups of participants assigned at random to varenicline achieved significantly higher abstinence rates at 12 weeks than those assigned to placebo, nicotine patch or bupropion. Just a few months ago, the FDA removed the black box warning from varenicline.\n\nThe commentary was coauthored by Dianna Gaballa, a fourth-year medical student; Joanna Drowos, D.O., M.P.H., an associate professor of integrated medical science and associate chair of the Department of Integrated Medical Science; and Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., Dr.P.H., the first Sir Richard Doll Professor and senior academic advisor to the dean, all in FAU's Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine.\n\n\"The existing totality of evidence suggests an urgent need to increase the use of varenicline in the general population as well as in those with serious mental illness who on average die about 20 years earlier than the general population, in part, because their smoking rates may be as high as 75 percent,\" said Hennekens.\n\nQuitting smoking significantly reduces risks of cardiovascular disease beginning within a matter of months and reaching the non-smoker status within a few years, even among older adults. For lung and other cancers, however, reductions do not even begin to emerge for years after quitting and, even after 10 years, quitters achieve death rates only about midway between the continuing smoker and non-smoker.\n\n\"For reducing risks of cardiovascular disease it's never too late to quit, but to reduce risks of cancer, it's never too early,\" said Hennekens.\n\nThe authors speculate that if use of varenicline had not plummeted by 76 percent following the black box warning in 2009, perhaps 17,000 premature deaths from cardiovascular disease may have been avoided each year during the last few years. Public health efforts and effective cessation treatments including behavioral counseling and medication have resulted in a 14 percent decrease in smoking in the U.S. while the rates are markedly increasing in developing countries.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heart disease is the leading killer among men and women causing approximately 600,000 deaths each year.\n\nAmong the numerous honors and recognitions Hennekens has received include the Ochsner Award for reducing premature deaths from cigarettes in 2014. From 1995 to 2005, Science Watch ranked him as the third most widely cited medical researcher in the world and five of the top 20 were his former trainees and/or fellows. In 2012, Science Heroes ranked Hennekens No. 81 in the history of the world for having saved more than 1.1 million lives.

Measuring non-HDL and apoB provides a more accurate assessment for cardiovascular risk, as they account for the total 'bad cholesterol' found in the blood.\n\n\"The findings are most important for populations at high risk for cardiovascular disease, such as Type 2 diabetics, who have normal levels of LDL cholesterol, but elevated levels of non-HDL or apo B,\" said Dr. Vladimir Vuksan, research scientist and associate director of the Risk Factor Modification Centre of St. Michael's. \"Barley has a lowering effect on the total bad cholesterol in these high-risk individuals, but can also benefit people without high cholesterol.\"\n\nHigh cholesterol and diabetes are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease and stroke, historically treated with medications. However, Dr. Vuksan's research and work focuses on how dietary and lifestyle changes can reduce these risk factors.\n\n\"Barley's positive effect on lowering cholesterol is well-documented and has been included in the Canadian strategy for reducing cardiovascular risk,\" said Dr. Vuksan. \"Health Canada, the FDA and several health authorities worldwide have already approved health claims that barley lowers LDL cholesterol, but this is the first review showing the effects on other harmful lipids.\"\n\nDespite its benefits Dr. Vuksan said barley is not as well-established as some other health-recommended foods -- such as oats. Barley consumption by humans has fallen by 35 per cent in the last 10 years. Canada is one of the top five world producers of barley -- almost 10 megatonnes per year -- but human consumption accounts for only two per cent of the crop yield, with livestock making up the other 98 per cent. \"After looking at the evidence, we can also say that barley is comparably effective as oats in reducing overall risk of cardiovascular disease\" said Dr. Vuksan.\n\nBarley is higher in fibre, has twice the protein and almost half the calories of oats, which are important considerations for those with weight or dietary concerns.\n\nDr. Vuksan said barley can be enjoyed in a variety of ways. He recommends trying to incorporate barley into existing recipes, using it as a substitute for rice or even on its own -- just like oatmeal.\n\nSt. Michael's Hospital provides compassionate care to all who enter its doors.

Beginning Saturday, Medicare will cover the treatments when other therapies have failed.\n\nNASHVILLE -- Sick with depression, Harriet Bruce spent her days lying in bed for months at a time.\n\nThen she agreed to a transcranial magnetic stimulation. The new treatment pushes powerful magnetic currents into the front of the brain, the part that controls emotions.\n\nThese days, Bruce awakens before her alarm goes off and dives into projects, including monster tasks she once dreaded.\n\n\"I have a room in my house in which I had stacked boxes from when we moved 10 years ago that I wanted to get to, but I couldn't do it,\" the Centerville woman said. \"But I've been working on that.\"\n\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation, once considered an experimental treatment for depression, is gaining acceptance since it came on the market four years ago. Beginning Saturday, Medicare will cover the treatments when other therapies have failed. This week, specialty insurance administrator Magellan Behavioral Health Inc. issued medical necessity guidelines for TMS treatment and will provide coverage effective Jan. 1.\n\nDoctors who use the NeuroStar TMS Therapy system say treatments are more effective than medications with far fewer side effects. It's an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy \u2014 shock treatments \u2014 for patients who have not responded to drugs or psychotherapy. But TMS is expensive. It can cost as much as $400 for a 37-minute session and require multiple treatments. The total bill can range between $8,000 and $12,000.\n\nThe cost, however, is less than an extended hospital stay.\n\n\"We had several patients who were headed toward the hospital, who had this treatment and were able to avoid that,\" said Dr. Scott West, a psychiatrist who pioneered the treatment in Nashville 2 and one-half years ago.\n\nThe NeuroStar system resembles a dentist's chair. A patient sits in the chair while a magnetic pulse emitter transmits energy from a levered arm \u2014 a process similar to undergoing dental X-rays. The device makes a clicking noise while delivering the magnetic pulses.\n\n\"When this large magnet pulses repetitively, it causes an electromagnetic field which then passes through the skull and stimulates the brain tissue itself,\" said West, explaining a cascading effect that results in the interior nerve fibers connecting better.\n\nDr. Michelle Cochran, purchased her TMS system about 18 months ago. The devices cost around $100,000, Cochran said, who has treated 45 patients with the therapy.\n\n\"Most people are not scared of it,\" she said. \"It sounds sort of creepy and weird when you think about it, but for the most part, it is safer in general than taking a medicine. You've got less seizure risk than taking a medicine. You've got less side effects than taking a medicine.\"\n\nBoth Cochran and West cite high patient response rates. A clinical trial funded by the National Institutes of Health revealed a \"significant effect of treatment\" when patients received TMS treatment. It compared outcomes of patients who actually received the magnetic pulses against patients in a \"sham\" group, who sat down in the treatment chair for fake sessions.\n\nDepressed patients who received the real TMS treatment had remission rates four times higher than those in the sham group.\n\nHowever, insurers, including UnitedHealthcare and BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, remain reluctant to embrace the treatment. UnitedHealthcare's medical policy for TMS says it is unproven for treating depression.\n\n\"Generally speaking, just because a device, procedure or medication has been approved or is deemed to be safe by some entities does not mean that it is automatically covered,\" BlueCross BlueShield spokeswoman Kelly Allen said. \"Quality and safety are our first priority in setting our medical policy, but those have to be balanced with affordability.\"\n\nCochran does not accept Medicare and has chosen to be an out-of-network provider.

Maybe we were brainwashed by the industry paying people to tell us that in medical school.\"\n\nNow, other drugs have come into use for hot flashes, but not much is known about their effectiveness or long-term safety. Until recently, there was little interest in studying them rigorously, because hormones worked so well for most women.\n\n\"There's a lot of hype around trying things that we haven't proven effective and, sadly, we haven't proven they're safe,\" said Dr. Heidi D. Nelson, the first author of the journal article and an internist and professor at the Oregon Health and Science University.\n\nThe report is based on a review of 43 studies of various nonhormonal drugs being used for hot flashes. Most were originally approved for other purposes. The drugs include the antidepressants Paxil (paroxetine), Effexor (venlafaxine), Prozac (fluoxetine) and Celexa (citalopram), the blood pressure drug Catapres (clonidine), and the seizure drug Neurontin (gabapentin). Some came into use for menopause because women taking them for other reasons told doctors the drugs seemed to diminish their hot flashes.\n\nThe researchers also examined studies of nonprescription extracts from soy and red clover, which contain plant estrogens called isoflavones and are marketed as a \"natural\" treatment for hot flashes.\n\nNone of the drugs or extracts are approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat hot flashes \u2014 only hormones are approved for that purpose \u2014 but doctors are free to prescribe medicines for any use they see fit, and many recommend the drugs or plant products for hot flashes, based on study findings and their patients' experiences.\n\nThe researchers found that on average, antidepressants and Catapres each appeared to reduce hot flashes by about one per day, and Neurontin by about two per day. For women with a lot of hot flashes, that is not a very impressive performance, Dr. Nelson said, but she added that the drugs may also lessen their severity.\n\nEstrogen, by comparison, gets rid of two to three flashes a day, and also makes them milder, Dr. Nelson said. Though hormones cause small increases in the risks for breast cancer and heart disease, a short course may still be the best choice for women with very severe symptoms, she said, though she added that women who have had breast cancer should definitely not take hormones.\n\nAll the nonhormonal drugs have side effects. The antidepressants can cause headache, nausea, dry mouth, dizziness and insomnia or sleepiness. Catapres can cause some of the same symptoms and also constipation. Neurontin causes sleepiness, and soy extracts can produce gastrointestinal troubles.\n\nAmong the antidepressants, Paxil seemed to have the strongest evidence of benefit. There were only two studies for Effexor, just one of which suggested it might help.\n\nFor the other antidepressants, Prozac and Celexa, and for the plant extracts, there was no statistically significant evidence that they worked for hot flashes.\n\n\"But I wouldn't want any drug company to get an edge,\" Dr. Nelson said. \"It's just where we are today. It's not the end of the story.\"\n\nShe took a cautious view because she and her colleagues found that there was relatively little reliable data on using the drugs for hot flashes. Of 10 studies on antidepressants, for instance, the researchers judged only two of the studies to be good, and the rest fair or poor. The poor rating often meant a study, even though well conducted, was too small or too short to be conclusive.\n\n\"If there were only 20 women in the study, how do we say it's appropriate for all the women in the country?\" Dr. Nelson said.\n\n\"Now we know what we need,\" she said. \"More bigger studies on more things.\"\n\nIn the meantime, both Dr. Tice and Dr. Nelson said that for women who find their symptoms intolerable and want treatment, they would favor antidepressants over hormones. But Dr. Tice warned that the drugs should not be used long term.\n\n\"I wouldn't encourage the mindset of putting women on these drugs thinking they're going to be on them for life,\" he said, adding that patients should try the drugs for a few months and then try to stop.\n\n\"We hate to medicalize a natural process,\" Dr. Nelson said, but she added that severe symptoms should not be dismissed. \"We want to take it seriously, but not everybody needs to be on prescription drugs for it.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "No mention of the cost of hormonal or non-hormonal treatments, which would be important to note if they are taken daily (or several times a day for some medications) for several months or years.

The anticipated cost of the vaccine, administered in three shots over six months, is $300 to $500, a possible impediment to widespread vaccination campaigns.\n\nGardisil is likely to be approved in early June, After that, the vaccine will move into the hands of the Centers for Disease Control, which will have to decide if it should be a mandatory vaccine or just a recommended vaccine, CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Kaledin reports.\n\nThe drug protects against the two types of human papillomavirus (HPV) believed responsible for about 70 percent of cervical cancer cases. The vaccine also protects against two other virus types that cause 90 percent of genital wart cases. All four virus types are sexually transmitted.\n\nHowever, this vaccine should not be considered a replacement for the standard screening test: the pap smear, adds Kaledin.\n\nThe FDA is not required to follow the recommendations of its outside panels of experts, but usually does. An agency decision is expected by June 8.\n\nHPV is the most common sexually transmitted disease. It affects more than 50 percent of sexually active adults. The cervical cancer it can cause kills each year about 290,000 women worldwide, including 3,500 women in the United States, where regular pap smears often detect precancerous lesions and early cancer.\n\n\"This is certainly a wonderful, good step in addition to our screening processes\" in helping eradicate cervical cancer, said Dr. Monica Farley, who heads the advisory panel. She is a bacterial infectious disease expert at the Emory University School of Medicine.\n\nAdvocates are recommending the vaccine be given to 11- and 12-year-old girls before they become sexually active, but argue that it is not a license to behave promiscuously, Kaledin reports.\n\nMaking their case for approval, Merck officials suggested that development could make Gardasil the biggest advance in preventing cervical cancer since the pap test.\n\n\"Gardasil has the potential to meet an unmet medical need as the first vaccine to prevent cervical cancer,\" Merck's Dr. Patrick Brill-Edwards told the Vaccine and Related Biological Products advisory committee.\n\nSeveral speakers said the vaccine should not replace screening.

But that largely faded away because of vaccine's potential for reducing cancer.\n\nFDA reviewers said Gardasil appears safe and effective, according to agency documents. One agency reviewer, Dr. Nancy Miller, told the advisory committee that Merck submitted data to support the use of the vaccine in females 9 to 26.\n\nMiller said Gardasil does not necessarily protect against one or more of the four viruses in people already infected before they get the vaccine, and can increase their risk for precursors to cervical cancer.\n\nAlso, the drug does not protect against infection from the many other virus strains not included in the vaccine. In addition, the FDA staff highlighted five cases where children with birth defects were born to women who received the vaccine around the time of conception.\n\nMerck, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., developed the vaccine and tested it in more than 27,000 females and males.\n\nThursday's discussion focused on its use in preventing HPV-related disease in girls and women, including those as young as 9.

They range from patient demands to malpractice fears to financial incentives and doctors\u2019 own lack of understanding of the risks and benefits of screening.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of pressures,\u201c said Dr. Gerald L. Andriole, a urologic surgeon at Washington University. \u201cIt is not all pure data that is promoting aggressive screening.\u201d Dr. Andriole is directing a National Cancer Institute study of 76,000 men that failed to find a screening benefit after 10 years. The men were aged 55 to 74 when the study began. P.S.A. screening is controversial at any age. Screening proponents say the cancer institute study was flawed and point to a European study of 162,000 men aged 55 to 69 that showed a 20 percent drop in the prostate cancer death rate with screening.\n\nScreening critics say the European study was flawed and add that there is a logical reason it has been hard to show a screening benefit.\n\nThey note that prostate cancer is a common cancer, found in most men\u2019s prostates on autopsy, although often the men had no idea they had it. The cancer can be lethal, but it usually grows so slowly that men die with it, not because of it.\n\nFor most men, screening only has harms because it leads to biopsies and treatments with unpleasant side effects. And, they say, it might not help cure many deadly prostate cancers because those cancers may have already spread outside the prostate, microscopically seeding other organs, long before a P.S.A. test indicates a possible problem.\n\nA positive P.S.A. test usually leads to a biopsy and then, if cancer is found, to a decision about whether to treat it. Nearly all men opt for treatment, which includes surgery to remove the prostate or radiation to destroy the cancer. Side effects can include impotence and incontinence.\n\nEven younger men should weigh the harms of screening, says Dr. Lisa Schwartz of Dartmouth Medical School. \u201cYou also have the potential to wreck their lives,\u201d she said.\n\nOne reason treatment is the most common choice is that it is hard to know if a cancer is lethal. Pathologists can distinguish between cancers that look particularly aggressive and those that do not, but there is a real possibility that even if tissue obtained at a biopsy has only less aggressive tumor cells, more aggressive cells might still be lurking in the prostate.\n\nBut even with this uncertainty, prostate cancer specialists say, most men who are treated would not have died of prostate cancer, and that is especially true for elderly men, in particular those who are frail and have a limited life expectancy. Yet changing medical practice can be difficult.\n\n\u201cAnytime a practice becomes ingrained, it is difficult to eradicate,\u201d says Dr. Brooks. \u201cIt is harder to get rid of an aberrant behavior than to adopt a new one.\u201d\n\nDr. Andriole said the very concept of not screening is difficult.\n\n\u201cIt is the hardest thing in the world not to look for a cancer and not to treat it,\u201d he says. And doctors, he added, have many inducements to screen. They often are afraid they could be sued if they do not screen and a man is found to have a lethal cancer. And there are financial incentives.\n\n\u201cUrologists make money by finding ways to biopsy men and administer treatments,\u201d Dr. Andriole said. Screening, he added, \u201cis promoted by hospitals and industry.\u201d And, he added, \u201cmany patients demand it.\u201d\n\nDr. Brooks of the cancer society says he travels the country and talks to primary care doctors about screening, and has learned that many have misconceptions about the test\u2019s benefits.\n\n\u201cThey often don\u2019t appreciate the downside of screening,\u201d Dr. Brooks said, \u201cand they don\u2019t appreciate the delay in benefit.\u201d In addition, Dr. Brooks said, primary care doctors often \u201coverestimate the likelihood that early detection of prostate cancer will lead to survival benefits.\u201d\n\nAdded to that, Dr. Brooks said, is the length of time it takes to discuss the pros and cons of screening with patients. Often it is easier to just order the test.\n\nDr. Bruce Roth, a professor of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis, said that ideally, a doctor should take a man\u2019s overall health into account and not just go by age in ordering P.S.A. tests. But if a man has been screened year after year, it can be hard to suggest he stop because he may not live much longer.\n\nSome men say the cautions just do not apply to them.\n\nJ. Allen Wheeler, who is 82 and lives in Portland, Ore., said he had his most recent P.S.A. test in January. His doctor orders it routinely, he says, adding, \u201cIn all honestly, it\u2019s part of my physical.\u201d His doctor \u201cjust does it \u2014 that\u2019s the understanding between us.\u201d\n\nMr. Wheeler, who says his health is \u201cfairly good,\u201d said he could not foresee a time when he would stop having the test. He would like to know if he has cancer, he says, although he may decide not to be treated.\n\nA 75-year-old Connecticut man said he had the test because he was healthy and wanted to stay that way.\n\n\u201cI think I am going to live to be 100,\u201d he said, asking that his name be withheld to protect his privacy. A recent P.S.A. test found a small cancer, and he does not want to take a chance that it will grow slowly and not cause him problems.\n\n\u201cI am thinking seriously of having the whole thing taken out,\u201d he says. \u201cHasta la vista.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "There was no discussion of costs, either in terms of the actual dollar value involved in routine PSA testing or for follow-up biopsy and treatment.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "The Site is down for maintenance.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Not applicable.\u00a0 Too early to discuss costs.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "Evidence suggests it may not only be good for mind and body, but also for a long life\n\nThe consensus--one of the first of its kind--comes on the eve of the Ryder Cup, the biennial golf tournament between Europe and the US.\n\nAmid a growing body of evidence on the health impacts of the sport, the consensus aims to help current and would-be players maximise the health pros and minimise the health cons of golf, and to guide policy-makers and industry leaders on how best to make golf more inclusive and accessible and so encourage more people from all walks of life to take up the sport.\n\nThe statement draws on a systematic review of the available published evidence (342 eligible studies) and discussions among an international working group of 25 experts in public health and health policy, and industry leaders.\n\nAgreement was reached on 79 statements in three areas.

It can provide moderate intensity aerobic physical activity, and its health benefits are greatest for players (and spectators) who walk round the course rather than opt for a golf cart.\n\nWhile around 60 million people play golf at least twice every year, the participant profile is quite narrow: players tend to be middle aged to older, male, of white European heritage, relatively well off, and living in North America, Europe, and Australasia.\n\nAnd the sport is often perceived as expensive, male dominated, difficult to learn, and not a game for the young or those on the lower rungs of the social ladder.\n\nThis can put people off, says the statement.

Coronary arterial calcification, or CAC, is considered a very early sign of cardiovascular disease. Importantly, the presence of breast arterial calcification also appears to be an equivalent or stronger risk factor for CAC than other well-established cardiovascular risk factors such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes. Earlier research had shown a link between breast arterial calcification and atherosclerotic disease--even heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular disease events, but researchers said these data provide a more direct relationship between the extent of calcified plaque in the mammary and coronary arteries, as well as a comparison to standard risk evaluation.\n\n\"Many women, especially young women, don't know the health of their coronary arteries. Based on our data, if a mammogram shows breast arterial calcifications it can be a red flag--an 'aha' moment--that there is a strong possibility she also has plaque in her coronary arteries,\" said Harvey Hecht, M.D., professor at the Icahn School of Medicine and director of cardiovascular imaging at Mount Sinai St. Luke's hospital, and lead author of the study.\n\nAll told, 70 percent of the women who had evidence of breast arterial calcification on their mammogram were also found to have CAC as shown on a noncontrast CT scan of the chest. For women under 60 years of age with CAC, half also had breast arterial calcification--an important finding as very few would be thinking about or considered for early signs of heart disease. There were even fewer false positives among younger patients; researchers said that if a younger woman had breast arterial calcification, there was an 83 percent chance she also had CAC.\n\nNotably, breast arterial calcification also appeared to be as strong a predictor for cardiovascular risk as standard risk scores such as the Framingham Risk Score, which underestimates women's risk, and the 2013 Cholesterol Guidelines Pooled Cohort Equations, which tends to overestimate risk, Hecht said. When researchers added 33 asymptomatic women with established CAD, breast arterial calcification was more powerful than both risk assessment formulas, which suggests the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis may be a more important indicator of heart disease than other risk factors.\n\n\"This information is available on every mammogram, with no additional cost or radiation exposure, and our research suggests breast arterial calcification is as good as the standard risk factor-based estimate for predicting risk,\" Hecht said. \"Using this information would allow at-risk women to be referred for standard CAC scoring and to be able to start focusing on prevention--perhaps even taking a statin when it can make the most difference.\"\n\nMultivariate analysis showed that early signs of a buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries were most strongly related to breast arterial calcification. While CAC was about two times as likely with advancing age or high blood pressure, it was three times more likely with breast arterial calcification.\n\n\"The message is if a woman is getting a mammogram, look for breast arterial calcification. It's a freebie and provides critical information that could be lifesaving for some women,\" Hecht said, adding he hopes these findings will prompt clinicians, who rarely report breast arterial calcification, to routinely report not just the presence or absence of breast arterial calcifications but also to estimate and note the amount.\n\n\"The more breast arterial calcification a women has, the more likely she is to have calcium in her heart's arteries as well. If all it requires is to take a closer look at the images, how can we ignore it?,\" he said.\n\nA total of 292 women who had digital mammography and noncontrast CT scans within one year were included in the study. Of these, 124, or 42.5 percent, were found to have evidence of breast arterial calcification. Mammograms were reviewed by a second radiologist who was blinded to the CAC results. Women with breast arterial calcification were more likely to be older, have high blood pressure and chronic kidney disease, and less likely smokers. Women with established cardiovascular diseases were excluded. Breast arterial calcification was evaluated on a scale from zero to 12 by increasing severity, and CAC was measured on the CT using a validated 0-12 severity score. The overall accuracy of breast arterial calcification for the presence of CAC was 70 percent, and 63 percent of those with CAC also had breast arterial calcification.\n\nTo date, there is no consensus on using CAC as a screening test, though a very large outcome study of 39,000 subjects is underway in the Netherlands. Mammography, however, is widely used and accepted and, as Hecht said, may provide an opportunity to risk stratify asymptomatic women by breast arterial calcification who might have calcium in the coronary arteries and ordinarily would not have been readily considered for cardiovascular screening.\n\nHeart disease is the leading cause of death among women, yet breast cancer is often the most feared.\n\nRoughly 37 million mammograms are performed annually in the U.S. Mammography is recommended annually for women over 40 years of age by the American Cancer Society and every other year for women 50-75 years old and women at high risk for breast cancer by the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force. Digital mammography is more sensitive to the presence of calcifications and is now available in 96 percent of mammography units in the U.S.\n\nAnother intriguing point that deserves additional study, according to the researchers, is that the nature of the atherosclerosis is different in breast arterial calcification and CAC, making it unclear why one should be related to the other.\n\nHecht stresses that these findings warrant further evaluation and validation in larger studies. Future prospective trials are needed to see what the prognostic significance of breast arterial calcification might be. Because the study involved women who received both mammography and CT scan for clinical indications, these women may have been more likely than the average woman to have coexisting conditions, although Hecht said these were unrelated to heart disease.\n\nThis study is being published simultaneously online in JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging.\n\nIn an accompanying editorial in JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging, Khurram Nasir, M.D., M.P.H., and John McEvoy, from the Center for Healthcare Advancement and Outcomes at Baptist Health South Florida, said that the report provides impetus to document breast arterial calcification in mammography reports, to improve education of primary care and radiology providers on the link with heart disease, and other actions to establish best practices for incorporating this research into care.\n\n\"Even by the conservative estimate of 10 percent, approximately 4 million women nationwide undergoing screening mammography will exhibit breast arterial calcification; with 2 to 3 million of them likely to have signs of premature coronary atherosclerotic disease,\" the authors said. \"Whether the best use of breast arterial calcification is to trigger additional testing or to directly inform preventive treatment decisions, either by flagging high-risk women to their providers or by reclassifying traditional (heart disease) risk estimates, is worth further discussion.\"\n\nThe study was funded, in part, by the Flight Attendants Medical Research Institute.\n\nThe study, \"Digital Mammography: Screening for Coronary Artery Disease?,\" will be presented on April 3, 2016, at 9:45 a.m. CT/10:45 a.m. ET/3:45 p.m. UTC at the American College of Cardiology's 65th Annual Scientific Session in Chicago.

McEvoy, MD, MCR, and her co-authors report that at three months of age, the infants whose mothers took 500 mg of vitamin C in addition to their prenatal vitamin had significantly better forced expiratory flows (FEFs). FEFs measure how fast air can be exhaled from the lung and are an important measure of lung function because they can detect airway obstruction.\n\nThe researchers also discovered an association between the infant FEFs and a genetic variant some of the mothers possessed that appeared to amplify the negative impact of nicotine on the babies before they were born. Other studies have linked this genetic factor, specifically for the \u03b15 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, to increased risk of lung cancer and obstructive lung disease.\n\n\u201cSmoking during pregnancy reflects the highly addictive nature of nicotine that disproportionately affects the most vulnerable populations,\u201d said Dr. McEvoy, lead study author and professor of pediatrics at Oregon Health & Science University. \u201cFinding a way to help infants exposed to smoking and nicotine in utero recognizes the unique dangers posed by a highly advertised, addictive product and the lifetime effects on offspring who did not choose to be exposed.\u201d\n\nIn a previous study, the authors had shown that 72 hours after birth, babies of mothers who smoked had better lung function if their mothers were randomized to vitamin C (500 mg/day) during their pregnancies compared to those born to mothers who smoked and were randomized to placebo. That study used passive methods to measure lung function, and the authors note that FEFs provide a more direct assessment of airway function and are similar to methods used to diagnose lung disease in adults and older children.\n\nIn the current study, 251 pregnant women who smoked were randomly assigned at 13 to 23 weeks of gestation to either receive vitamin C (125 women) or a placebo (126 women). Smoking was defined as having had one or more cigarettes in the last week. All participants received smoking cessation counseling throughout the study, and about 10 percent of the women quit smoking during the study.\n\nThe researchers wrote that study results support the hypothesis that oxidative stress caused by cigarette smoking reduces the amount of ascorbic acid, a component of vitamin C, available to the body. At the time they enrolled in the study, the women had lower levels of ascorbic acid than have been reported among women who do not smoke. Those levels rose in study participants who received vitamin C to become comparable to women who do not smoke.\n\nInfants in this study will continue to be followed to track their lung function and respiratory outcomes. The authors believe that future trials of vitamin C supplementation in pregnant smokers should determine whether the benefits are greater if the supplementation starts earlier and continues postnatally in the babies themselves.\n\nSumming up the findings of the current study, Dr. McEvoy said that a relatively low dosage of vitamin C may present \u201ca safe and inexpensive intervention that has the potential to help lung health of millions of infants worldwide.\u201d\n\nHowever, she added, helping mothers quit smoking should remain the primary goal for health professionals and public health officials. \u201cAlthough vitamin C supplementation may protect to some extent the lungs of babies born to mothers who smoke during pregnancy, those children will still be at greater risk for obesity, behavioral disorders and other serious health issues,\u201d she said.\n\nThis study was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the Office of Dietary Supplements.\n\n\u201cFor mothers who smoke during pregnancy, vitamin C may reduce harm #smoking causes to their babies\u2019 #lungs, finds new study of #vitaminC supplementation. #Nosmokingduringpregnancy.\u201d\n\nAbout the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine\n\nThe AJRCCM is a peer-reviewed journal published by the American Thoracic Society.

They assigned another 25 men and 35 women to standard care -- exercise, and back and neck education.\n\n\"The experimental therapy, focusing on functionality, not using pain as a reliable symptom, and not as a guideline to adapt movements or activities, leads to better treatment outcomes,\" Malfliet said.\n\nThe program led to a significant and clinically important reduction of pain, she said.\n\nPatients in the program reported 50 percent less pain after the treatment. They also reported paying less attention to pain.\n\nIn general, they also had less disability, a reduced fear of moving, and improvement in mental and physical outlook, according to the study authors.\n\n\"These positive effects were found until the last follow-up measurement at one year after treatment,\" Malfliet said.\n\nThe program involves \"pain neuroscience education with cognition-targeted motor control training,\" she said.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nPain neuroscience education aims to change patients' beliefs about pain, to increase their knowledge of pain and to decrease its threat, Malfliet said.\n\nBesides focusing on the makeup of the spine, the program stressed lifting techniques and stretching.

They wanted to see what effect different types of exercise, and different intensity activity, had on sperm quality and count. One group exercised at moderate levels continuously by walking or jogging on a treadmill, while another followed the same protocol but at a higher intensity. Another group did high intensity exercise on the treadmill but in short interval bouts.\n\nCompared to the control group that didn\u2019t exercise, all of the men who followed a physical activity program showed improvements in a variety of measures of their sperm. After six months, they showed less DNA damage, healthier sperm shape and lower levels of metabolic stress factors. They also showed higher numbers of sperm precursors.\n\n\u201cThis fits reasonably well with what we thought about the effects of exercise,\u201d says Dr. Peter Schlegel, vice president of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine and chairman of urology at New York Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. \u201cBut this is a much better done study than almost anything that\u2019s been done before on the subject.\u201d He notes that most previous studies did not randomly assign people to exercise groups and compare the outcome on sperm quality, but rather recorded sperm measures among men who reported their exercise habits after the fact.\n\nIn the current study, the men in the moderate intensity, continuous activity program showed the most improvements compared to men in the other two more intense groups. While it\u2019s not entirely clear why, part of the reason may have to do with the fact that extreme exercise generates body heat, which can be detrimental to sperm health; for marathoners and people training at intense levels, finding ways to dissipate body heat is a major concern. Schlegel also says that regular exercise can improve circulation and make the blood vessels healthier, which may benefit the testes, an organ that\u2019s sensitive to and requires good blood flow.\n\nExercise may also be working in other ways to enhance reproductive health, since all of the men who exercised lost weight, reduced their amount of body fat and improved their fitness levels. Fat tissue has been linked to higher levels of damaging metabolic stress compounds, so losing weight and becoming more fit may create more hospitable conditions for sperm and improve its quality and volume.\n\nThere are already plenty of reasons to exercise, and now better quality sperm is one more worth noting.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "There was no mention of the cost of the methodology used in this study.

If we can control the autoimmunity, we may reverse the diabetes. We showed that the islets [cells] can start to work again,\" said Dr. Yong Zhao, an assistant professor in the section of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism at the University of Illinois at Chicago.\n\nThis treatment could potentially be useful in other autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\"It's quite remarkable that this approach, based on the re-education of immune cells, might work so well. The concept is very intriguing, and the treatment seems to be so simple and so safe,\" said Dr. Luca Inverardi, deputy director of translational research at the Diabetes Research Institute, University of Miami School of Medicine.\n\nBut he's also \"reasonably cautious,\" he said. \"The follow-up is long, up to 40 weeks, but it's not long enough to declare victory against diabetes yet,\" said Inverardi.\n\nAlso, he noted that the study involved only 15 Chinese people, and that type 1 diabetes is a bit different in that population. He said he'd like to see larger studies with a more diverse population, followed for a longer time.\n\nResults of the study were published online Jan. 9 in the journal BMC Medicine.\n\nType 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease, occurs when the body's immune system cells mistakenly attack the insulin-producing (beta) cells in the pancreas. Because their beta cells don't produce enough or any insulin, people with type 1 diabetes have to replace the lost insulin through injections to survive.\n\nStopping that autoimmune attack appears to be crucial to any treatment that hopes to cure or reverse type 1 diabetes.\n\nZhao's team developed a completely new approach. They take blood from a patient and separate out the immune system cells (lymphocytes). They briefly expose those cells to stem cells from umbilical cord blood from an unrelated infant and return the lymphocytes alone to the patient's body. The researchers have dubbed this \"Stem Cell Educator Therapy,\" because while exposed to the stem cells, the lymphocytes seem to relearn how they should behave.\n\nThe study participants, who were 15 to 41 years old, had had type 1 diabetes for an average of nine years. Six had some residual beta cell function and six did not. Both groups were given stem cell educator therapy. The other three people served as the control group.\n\nThe researchers measured C-peptide, a protein fragment that's a byproduct of insulin production, and found that the educator therapy group had improved levels of C-peptide at 12 weeks. These levels continued to improve until 24 weeks, and remained stable through the follow-up at 40 weeks. There were no changes in C-peptide in the control group.\n\nThe average daily dose of insulin dropped almost 39 percent after 12 weeks for the group with some beta cell function and 25 percent in those with no beta cell function, suggesting that the group with no beta cell function now produced insulin.\n\n\"That means if you stop the autoimmune reaction, you may see beta cell regeneration, or there might be other precursor cells in the pancreas. If these data are confirmed, this is a very provocative and remarkable finding,\" Inverardi said.\n\nThe average hemoglobin A1C level dropped 1.06 percent for those with residual beta cell function and 1.68 percent for those without beta cell function. A1C levels measure average blood sugar levels over two to three months, and people with type 1 diabetes are advised to maintain A1C levels below 7 percent. A drop of 1 percent in A1C levels can reduce the risk of complications.\n\nThis was an initial clinical trial designed to test for safety. Zhao said that in future trials he hopes that with additional treatments people might get off insulin altogether.\n\nBut, even if that's not possible, the recovery of some beta cell function would be welcome news. \"In the absence of complete remission, there are very sizable advantages to having some beta cell function,\" Inverardi noted.\n\nBoth experts said the treatment appears safe, with no risk of rejection. No significant side effects were reported during the trial, other than some arm soreness where blood was taken and returned.\n\nLearn more about type 1 diabetes from the Nemours Foundation's KidsHealth Web site.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "We\u2019ll rule this Not Applicable.

A stool sample containing high levels of these markers will be strong enough to change the test's liquid display from pink to yellow, indicating high levels of Bifidobacterium. The liquid will remain pink if a sample has low levels of acetate and lactate, indicating that Bifidobacterium is missing and that key nutrients from breast milk, human milk oligosaccharides (HMO), are being wasted. Evivo has commenced rigorous clinical trials with the prototype to demonstrate the results from infant stool samples.\n\nPoint-of-Care Diagnostic Expert Turns Focus to the Infant Gut\n\nThe development of the prototype is led by Dr. Bethany Henrick, Ph.D., Director of Immunology and Diagnostics for Evivo. With more than a decade of experience designing and creating rapid, point-of-care diagnostics, Henrick was formerly an integral part of the team that developed and optimized the world's fastest point-of-care HIV test in 2005.\n\n\"This is the first and only point-of-care screening test designed to identify infants that do not have enough Bifidobacterium levels to create a stable infant gut microbiome,\" said Dr. Henrick. \"With recent research indicating most babies born after 1980 do not acquire Bifidobacterium at birth, our ability to detect significant levels of Bifidobacterium gives pediatricians and parents an immediate indication of whether or not their baby has this beneficial gut bacteria that set them up for lifelong health.\"\n\nIdentifying a Disappearing, Yet Critical Piece of Gut Health\n\nDr. Henrick's previously published findings, which are the basis for the Evivo test, show an inverse correlation between rising infant fecal pH, reduced acetate and lactate, and lower levels of beneficial Bifidobacterium, proving that the infant gut microbiome has been rapidly changing over the last three generations. In the past, babies acquired Bifidobacterium from their mother during childbirth, but due to the increased use of modern medical practices such as antibiotics, C-sections and formula feeding, nine out of 10 babies born in the U.S. today no longer acquire it. The generational loss of this good bacteria in the infant gut allows for potentially harmful bacteria such as E. Coli and Clostridia to thrive, which are linked to higher risk of short- and long-term health issues such as colic, eczema, allergies, diabetes, and obesity.\n\n\"Currently there is no way to easily determine whether a baby is colonized with healthy bacteria,\" said Mark Underwood, M.D., Chief of Neonatology at UC Davis Medical Center. \"The ability to quickly measure levels of Bifidobacterium in a stool sample would enable pediatricians to identify babies with low levels of these beneficial bacteria and take appropriate action.\"\n\nEvolve BioSystems' Evivo is the only baby probiotic clinically proven to restore Bifidobacterium to a baby's gut and reduce potentially harmful bacteria by 80 percent. In a landmark clinical trial, Evivo produced rapid, substantial and persistent stabilization of the infant gut microbiome, to help set a foundation for life-long health.\n\nAbout Evolve BioSystems\n\nEvolve BioSystems, Inc. is a privately-held microbiome company dedicated to developing the next generation of products to establish, restore, and maintain a healthy gut microbiome.

The results are presented in the journal The Lancet Oncology.\n\nRectal cancer affects some 2,000 men and women in Sweden every year. Preoperative radiotherapy was gradually introduced in the early 1990s, with a consequent improvement in prognosis for people with rectal cancer and reduction in the risk of local recurrence.\n\n\"Back then we showed that preoperative radiotherapy reduces the risk of local recurrence by over 50 per cent for patients with rectal cancer,\" says principal investigator Anna Martling, senior consultant surgeon and professor at Karolinska Institutet's Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery. \"Thanks to our results, radiotherapy is recommended to many rectal cancer patients.\"\n\nHowever, radiotherapy can cause adverse reactions and the optimal radiotherapeutic method and the interval between it and the ensuing surgery have been mooted. The study now presented in The Lancet Oncology is based on the claim that the adverse effects of rectal cancer treatment can be reduced by administering more but lower doses of radiation for a longer time, or by increasing the interval between radiotherapy and surgery. These hypotheses have now been tested in a study in which rectal cancer patients were randomly assigned to three different treatment arms:\n\u2022 Delayed surgery with short-course (5x5 Gy) radiotherapy followed by surgery after 4-8 weeks.\n\u2022 Delayed surgery with long-course (25x2 Gy) radiotherapy followed by surgery after 4-8 weeks.\n\nThe results of the study show that patients with delayed surgery develop fewer complications with equally good oncological outcomes. It also showed that there is no difference between long-course and short-course radiotherapy other than that the former considerably lengthens the time for treatment.\n\n\"The results of the study will give rise to improved therapeutic strategies, fewer complications with a sustained low incidence of local recurrence, and better survival rates for rectal cancer patients,\" says Professor Martling. \"The results can now be immediately put to clinical use to the considerable benefit of the patients.\"\n\nEighteen Swedish hospitals took part in the study, which was financed by the Swedish Research Council and the Cancer Society in Stockholm, and through the regional ALF agreement between Stockholm County Council and Karolinska Institutet.

But now the Food and Drug Administration has evaluated the safety of the second generation of silicone implants and the results are mixed.\n\nAn FDA report, released in late June, says silicone implants are generally safe. But complications from implants are frequent \u2014 things like hardening of the skin around the implant; ruptured, wrinkled, or lopsided implants; scarring, pain and infection.\n\nAs many as half of patients will need to have additional surgeries or have the implants removed in the first decade.\n\nIt also turns out that the longer a woman has the implants, the more likely she is to experience these complications.\n\nTake Kate Marion. She had silicone implants for breast augmentation in her late 20s. Just shy of two decades later she noticed something unusual.\n\n\"When I was crossing my left arm across my body \u2014 for instance, to put lotion on my right arm \u2014 I would make a little noise from my armpit, the way little boys do when they stick their hand in their armpit and pump their arm up and down,\" Marion says. \"A little tooty noise.\"\n\nAn MRI showed both her implants had burst. Her doctor immediately recommended removing them, which she did. Marion hasn't suffered any apparent harm from her ruptured implants, and she even confesses to having an occasional twinge of regret that she didn't have them replaced when she had the old ones removed. But ultimately she decided she didn't want to go through more surgery.\n\n\"Well, how long would these next ones last? I would be in my 60s when I had to do this again, and who wants to have surgery unnecessarily when you are 60 something?\" says Marion.\n\nAlthough the long-term effects of silicone in the body are still uncertain, many plastic surgeons don't see the leaking of modern implants as a health concern.\n\n\"The actual silicone that's within the implants is inert. So if the silicone gel leaks, it doesn't travel through the body, it doesn't cause systemic problems. So the MRI is really detecting a cosmetic concern,\" says New York City plastic surgeon Matthew Schulman.\n\nBut there have been more serious outcomes. Annette Knecht got silicone implants in 1991 following a double mastectomy. For years afterward she felt ill, suffered multiple bouts of pneumonia, had trouble breathing and pain in her chest. Doctors reassured her it wasn't her implants.\n\n\"We had a CT scan done, and it showed OK \u2014 everything looked fine, so we didn't worry about it,\" says Knecht.\n\nBut no one ever told her to get an MRI \u2014 something the FDA now recommends that women with silicone implants get every few years. As it turned out, Knecht's implants had leaked; a biopsy found silicone in her lymph nodes and in her lungs. She is currently disabled and awaiting a lung transplant \u2014 all, she says, for vanity.\n\n\"We're about four generations removed from those implants,\" says Schulman, the plastic surgeon. He explains that implants have undergone big changes since the early 1990s, when Knecht received hers. Back then they contained a runny liquid silicone.\n\n\"The silicone implants of today are what we call a cohesive gel \u2014 it's essentially like a jelly. So the jelly may ooze a little bit, but it will not run out like an oil,\" says Schulman.\n\nSid Wolf of the nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen is among critics who point out that the data in the FDA report sample just a fraction of the nearly 400,000 women who receive breast implants each year. Moreover, that data are limited to just the last two or three years \u2014 not enough, Wolf says, to make any real claims about the long-term safety of the implants.\n\n\"There is a huge deficiency of long-term data at a time when we know that the longer these devices are in, the more problems ... occur,\" says Wolf.\n\nStill, there are plenty of satisfied customers among the nearly 400,000 women who receive breast implants each year. Not only have the number of women choosing breast implants for augmentation risen by nearly 40 percent in the last decade, Schulman says that in his practice, 80 percent of them are choosing silicone over saline. What's more, he says few of them follow the recommendations to get routine MRIs to screen for leaks.\n\nSchulman says that the rates of complications for silicone implants are roughly the same as for saline \u2014 though he feels these complications can be minimized by choosing an experienced surgeon. Still, he warns his patients that no procedure is without risks \u2014 and additional surgeries are a very real possibility.\n\n\"Your young breast implants don't last forever,\" says Schulman. \"They may leak, they may rupture, you may decide you want a different size. So you have to at least expect that sometime in your life, you are going to need a reoperation. And if you are 100 percent against having another surgery related to these implants, then it's something you should reconsider.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The article sidesteps any issues related to costs of breast implants or the remedies for failures, a glaring omission in light of frequent complications and adverse outcomes.\n", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Botox is now being used by men, some of whom did not even run for President.

Procedural sedation is commonly used for painful or uncomfortable procedures like setting fractures, repairing lacerations and draining abscesses in emergency departments worldwide.\n\n\"Although sedation-related serious adverse events occur infrequently, recognition and early intervention is necessary to ensure patient safety,\" said Dr. Maala Bhatt, lead author, director of pediatric emergency research at CHEO, and assistant professor at the University of Ottawa. \"We've been able to identify sedation medications and practices associated with the best clinical outcomes, which is practice-changing.\"\n\nAccording to the authors, this study represents the largest and most robust prospective emergency department procedural sedation cohort to date. It includes children from six emergency departments across Canada, sedated with six different medication combinations.\n\nThe results of the study show that choice of sedation medication had the biggest impact on the incidence of adverse events and need for significant interventions in response to those events. The incidence of serious adverse events was lowest among patients sedated with ketamine-alone and highest among patients sedated with combination drugs ketamine plus propofol or fentanyl.\n\nThe overall incidence of adverse events in the study population was 11.7%. The most common events were a decrease in oxygen saturation (5.6%) and vomiting (5.2%). Significant interventions in response to an adverse event were rare, occurring in only 1.4% of children. Two other practices - receiving an opioid prior to sedation and having a laceration repair - were associated with the occurrence of vomiting, oxygen desaturation and need for significant interventions.\n\n\"The low rate of serious adverse events and significant interventions supports the safety of procedural sedation in the hands of emergency department physicians,\" said Dr. Bhatt. \"While all sedation medications and combination of medications are effective and safe in the hands of experienced providers, ketamine-alone is associated with the fewest serious adverse events and significant interventions, making it a logical choice for providing procedural sedation for children in emergency departments.\"\n\nCo-authors include: Drs.

It includes a decade\u2019s worth of data from more than 100,000 men and women in the U.S., most over 60 and all of them non-smokers.\n\nPeople who said they took daily aspirin - whether \u2018baby\u2019 or adult strength - had a 16-percent lower risk of dying from cancer than non-users overall, Thun and his colleagues found.\n\nFor men, the difference came out to 103 fewer cancer deaths a year per 100,000 people; for women, the number was 42.\n\nThe effect was strongest for gastrointestinal cancers, such as colon cancer and stomach cancer. But it didn\u2019t seem to matter whether people had been on aspirin for more or less than five years.\n\nBecause the study wasn\u2019t a clinical trial, it\u2019s hard to know if the findings can be chalked up to aspirin or if something else is at play.\n\nStill, Thun said the results would favor broadening the aspirin guidelines to include cancer prevention based on an individual risk-benefit assessment. But he added that it will take scientists a few years to mull over all of the existing evidence.\n\nOther researchers are more skeptical. Dr. Kausik Ray of St. George\u2019s University of London, who has studied aspirin, said the new study did not look at overall death rates or side effects such as serious stomach bleeds.\n\n\u201cThis is not a drug without side effects, so what you have to look at is net benefit,\u201d he told Reuters Health.\n\nEarlier this year, Ray\u2019s team published an analysis of previous aspirin trials showing the medication did not prevent deaths from heart disease or cancer, and was likely to cause more harm than good.\n\nOne of the problems with the new study as well as with previous aspirin trials, he said, is something called detection bias. People who develop stomach bleeding from aspirin are likely to get their bowels checked out by a doctor. As a result, doctors may find and remove tumors or precancerous polyps, which could prolong the patient\u2019s life - the idea behind colon cancer screening.\n\nSo far, most aspirin trials have been designed to test the drug\u2019s effect on heart disease. Ray called for trials that specifically check people for new cancers at given intervals to weed out the selection bias marring the previous research.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have enough hard evidence suggesting everybody should be taking\u201d aspirin, Ray said.\n\nWhen it comes to cancer, the government-backed U.S. Preventive Services Task Force agrees.

Rick Perry signed legislation that will require Texas insurance companies to cover the test for men 45 to 75 years old, and for women between 55 and 75, at intermediate or greater risk of heart attack. The law, the first in any state, takes effect Jan. 1.\n\nThe legislation was introduced in 2007 and passed quietly this year. It eventually attracted attention in cardiology circles, where the scans' costs and benefits are the subject of much debate. The scans are sometimes criticized as an example of expensive new technologies being adopted before proof is established that they're better than cheaper existing methods \u2014 an issue at the heart of the health care reform debate.\n\nThe test, a CAT scan of the heart that measures plaque buildup in the arteries, is popular because heart disease, the nation's No. 1 killer, strikes many people without the sort of very high cholesterol that usually predicts it. Doctors say they get many patients who want to know more about their risk because their father suffered a heart attack and died young.\n\nCritics note that no study has linked the use of CT scans with better patient outcomes. They say the test's value is limited because it doesn't identify which plaque are stable and which could rupture and cause a heart attack.\n\nCT scanning, which costs from $100 to $500, has grown exponentially in recent years. One Houston doctor said that there was just one scanner in Houston in the mid-'90s, and now the $1 million machines are all over the city. The Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography estimates more than 200,000 Americans had the test in 2008 at a cost of about $50 million.\n\nThe American Heart Association did not endorse the legislation, which Khera estimates could result in millions of Texans being screened.\n\nThe Texas legislation was pushed by Screening for Heart Attack Prevention and Eradication, a private organization that has called for CT scans on all asymptomatic men 45 to 75 and all asymptomatic women 55 to 75 \u2014 or some 50 million Americans.\n\nTexas Rep. Rene Oliveira, D-Brownsville, the bill's sponsor, stressed the state law won't result in such widespread testing.\n\n\u201cThe bill was written to target those people most likely to benefit from it, not everyone,\u201d said Oliveira, who credits the test for saving his life when it revealed blockages that led to double-bypass surgery two years ago.\n\nBut Khera, an advocate of the test in select cases, said the Texas law puts the cart before the horse. He questioned unsupported cutoffs of those covered under the law and said it would have been better to wait until more data is available on who really benefits from it.\n\nDr. William Zoghbi, director of Methodist Hospital's Cardiovascular Imaging Institute, said the cancer risk numbers reported in the study are actually fairly low compared to other tests that take X-rays of the chest area, such as a regular CAT scan or coronary angiography.\n\nThe Texas law will require insurance companies pay $200 of the bill for patients to get the test every five years.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "\n\n\n \nThe story not only mentions the cost of a scan to individuals ($100 to $500), it also notes that about $50 million dollars was spent on this type of scanning nationwide in 2008.

(Table sugar, or sucrose, extracted from sugar cane or sugar beets, is a compound of glucose and fructose.) Researchers also took blood samples to measure levels of glucose, fructose and insulin, and of leptin and ghrelin, enzymes involved in controlling hunger and feelings of fullness.\n\nBefore having their drinks, the participants rated their desire to eat on a one-to-10 scale from \u201cnot at all\u201d to \u201cvery much.\u201d Then they drank the liquids and had functional magnetic resonance imaging brain scans while looking at images of food and of neutral objects like buildings or baskets.

The volunteers were then presented with images of high-calorie foods and asked whether they would like to have the food now, or a monetary award a month later instead.\n\nThe study, published in the journal PNAS, found that compared with glucose, consuming fructose produced greater responses to food cues in the orbital frontal cortex of the brain, a region that plays an important role in reward processing. The fructose drink also produced greater activity in the visual cortex when volunteers looked at images of food, a finding that suggests increased craving compared with glucose.\n\nWhen choosing between tasty high-calorie food or a delayed monetary reward, fructose drinkers were more likely than glucose drinkers to choose the food.\n\nThere was no difference in leptin or ghrelin levels between fructose and glucose drinkers.

It does this by enhancing the protective neurohormonal systems (Natriuretic Peptide system) while simultaneously inhibiting the harmful effects of the overactive renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).11 Other heart failure medicines only block the harmful effects of the overactive RAAS.12 Entresto contains the neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril, and the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) valsartan.11\n\nEntresto is indicated in the US to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with chronic heart failure (NYHA Class II-IV) and reduced ejection fraction.11 Entresto is usually administered in conjunction with other heart failure therapies, in place of an Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).11 Entresto film-coated tablets are available in three dosage strengths: 24/26 mg, 49/51 mg, and 97/103 mg (sacubitril/valsartan).11 These doses are referred to as 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg in the clinical trial literature including the New England Journal of Medicine publication of the results of PARADIGM-HF. The target treatment dose of Entresto is 97/103 mg twice daily.11\n\nNovartis is committed to providing patients with affordable access and resources through Entresto Central.

Nor does it quantify what it means when it says the drug is \u201ccost-effective.\u201d The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, ICER, warned in a draft report that the drug\u2019s current price was too high and that widespread use could overwhelm the health system. The drug cost was estimated at about $4,600 per year for a typical patient. According to the report:\n\u201cAt the list price of $4,560 per year, Entresto does not save money over the long term but its added costs are well-aligned with the degree of benefit it brings to patients, meaning that Entresto can be judged \u201ccost-effective\u201d in the long-term according to commonly accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds.\u201d\n\u201cHowever, ICER\u2019s analysis predicts that nearly 2 million patients could be prescribed Entresto over the first five years, creating a total budget impact so high that excessive cost burdens would be placed on the overall health care system.

They were far less likely to die young.\n\nIt\u2019s a reassuring finding for parents who may worry that tiny and premature babies are safer in an incubator than in their arms, the team wrote in their report, published in the journal Pediatrics.\n\nKangaroo mother care was first described in Colombia, and the team of experts there who first showed it was safe did a 20-year follow-up to see how the babies fared as they grew up.

They exhibited less antisocial behavior, which might be associated with separation from the mother at birth,\u201d they added.\n\n\u201cKangaroo mother care may change the behavior of less well-educated mothers by increasing their sensitivity to the needs of their children, thus making them equivalent to mothers in more favorable environments.\u201d\n\nTwenty million babies are born at a low birth weight every year around the globe, the World Health Organization reports.

It is a powerful, easy-to-use method to promote the health and well-being of infants born preterm as well as full-term.

The boy is currently on chemotherapy, the study authors noted.\n\n\"This is a very good first step, but it's a little scary and we need to move to safer vectors,\" said Dr. Mary Ellen Conley, director of the Program in Genetic Immunodeficiencies at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn.\n\n\"The study shows proof-of-principle that gene therapy with stem cells in a genetic disorder like this has strong potential,\" added Paul Sanberg, a stem cell specialist who is director of the University of South Florida Center of Excellence for Aging and Brain Repair in Tampa.\n\nNeither Conley nor Sanberg were involved in the study, which is scheduled to be presented Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology in Orlando, Fla.\n\nAccording to Conley, children (mostly boys) with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) are born with an inherited genetic defect on the X chromosome that affects the number and size of platelets and makes the children remarkably susceptible to easy bleeding and infections, including different types of cancer.\n\nBone marrow transplants are the main treatment for the disorder which, if they succeed, basically cure the patient.\n\n\"They grow up, go to college and they cause problems,\" said Conley. \"But they're not an easy group of patients to transplant.\"\n\nEven if a good match is found, transplant recipients can go on to have more problems with infections, such as graft-versus-host disease, in which the body basically rejects the foreign elements.\n\n\"One of the long-lasting complications is the kids couldn't do this, they couldn't do that, they see themselves as different,\" Conley said. \"Transplants are getting better but we need better therapy, there's no question.\"\n\nIn this study, the researchers inserted a healthy gene capable of producing WAS protein into hematopoietic stem cells (the \"granddaddy\" cells that give rise to different blood cells), then transferred these stem cells back into the patient using a viral vector. A viral vector is a virus that has been modified to deliver foreign genetic material into a cell.\n\nIn fact, the experiment was largely successful, with cells now able to produce WAS protein, resulting in increased platelet counts and improvement of some immune-system cells.\n\n\"This is a first step that says you can correct the disease but I think most people would look at it and say the risk of leukemia is something, and that, let's see if we can avoid that,\" said Conley, whose team at St. Jude is working on a therapy involving a different type of vector. \"It's a good start, but I think we have better things coming down the road.\"\n\nIn other news from the conference, another group of German researchers have determined that people who donate peripheral blood stem cells or bone marrow to help save a life don't face any heightened risk of cancer.\n\nPreviously there had been some concern that drugs needed to get the stem cells out of the bone marrow and into the bloodstream where they could be accessed might pose a risk of leukemia.\n\nThe study was based on questionnaires returned from more than 12,500 donors, which also showed the donors tended to be in good health and were willing to donate again.\n\nAnother study found that the drug rituximab (Rituxan), used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and forms of leukemia and lymphoma, could greatly reduce graft-versus-host disease in stem cell transplant recipients.\n\nThe National Marrow Donor Program has more on Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "We think it\u2019s too early to guess at what any therapy based on this technique would cost, so we won\u2019t flag the story for not mentioning costs.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "Doctors in Seattle cured a late-stage cancer patient after tinkering with his body's defenses against infection, leading to cautious optimism about treating late-stage melanoma, a deadly skin cancer.\n\nThe surprising result, published in this week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, is the latest hopeful finding from the 30-year-old field of \"adoptive immunotherapy,\" which theorizes that the body can be taught to fight off its own cancers.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "\nThe story says the cost is roughly $30,000 to $50,000.\n", "answer": 1}, {"article": "There is only \u201cmoderate\u2019\u2019 evidence that the newly approved prostate cancer drug Provenge helps patients, according to an analysis done for Medicare that was made public on Wednesday.\n\nThe analysis is part of a controversial review by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to determine whether to pay for Provenge, which costs $93,000 per patient and extended lives by about four months in clinical trials. Medicare advisers will meet next Wednesday to discuss the drug, which was developed by Dendreon, a Seattle-based biotechnology company.\n\nProvenge is the first so-called therapeutic cancer vaccine \u2013 meaning it works by training the patient\u2019s immune system to attack the tumor \u2013 to win F.D.A. approval.

Benson III, president of the Association of Community Cancer Centers, said in a comment submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nBut others say the health care system cannot afford to continue paying high prices for all therapies, particularly cancer drugs that extend lives by only a few months.\n\nWith expensive medicines there is already a sort of dual approval system, especially with private insurance companies. First a drug must get F.D.A. approval and then a manufacturer often must go through a lengthy process of persuading insurers to pay for the drug.\n\nMedicare is not supposed to consider price when determining whether to cover a drug, however.\n\nSome analysts have assumed that Medicare will pay for Provenge when used for the patients specified in the drug\u2019s label \u2013 those with advanced prostate cancer that is resistant to hormone-deprivation therapy but who are experiencing no or minimal symptoms.\n\nThe Medicare review might be more designed to limit off-label use of the expensive drug, such as for patients who already have symptoms. The review for Medicare said there was insufficient evidence to judge whether Provenge would work if used off-label.\n\nThe F.D.A. declined to approve Provenge in 2007, setting off protests by patients and Dendreon investors. After Dendreon completed another trial, which reaffirmed a survival advantage for the drug, Provenge was approved this April.\n\nBut the analysis for Medicare said that there were issues in how the trials were designed that made it difficult to assess how effective Provenge really was. One big issue was that the placebo used in the control arm was not really inert.\n\nRobyn Karnauskas, a biotechnology analyst at Deutsche Bank, said in a note to clients Wednesday that the assessment of moderate evidence in support of Provenge boded well for reimbursement. \u201cHistorically, moderate means that CMS will reimburse the product for its on-label indication,\u2019\u2019 she wrote.\n\nDendreon\u2019s shares rose more than 5 percent in trading after the close of the market.\n\nThe assessment was done by a technology evaluation group at the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association under contract to the government\u2019s Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story appropriately reports that Provenge treatment costs $93,000 per patient and is satisfactory based on the criterion.

Of those, between one third and one half have a type of lazy eye known as anisometropia, which is caused by a difference in the degree of nearsightedness or farsightedness between the two eyes.\n\nStandard treatment for children involves eyeglasses or contact lens designed to correct focus issues. However, while this approach is often successful in younger children (between the ages of 3 and 7), it is successful among only about a third of older children (between the ages of 7 and 12).\n\nFor the latter group, doctors will often place a patch over the \"good\" eye temporarily in addition to eyeglasses, and treatment success is typically achieved in two-thirds of cases.\n\nChildren, however, often have trouble adhering to patch therapy, the treatment can bring emotional issues for some and a reverse form of lazy eye can also take root, the researchers said.\n\nStudy author Dr. Dennis S.C. Lam, from the department of ophthalmology and visual sciences and Institute of Chinese Medicine at the Joint Shantou International Eye Center of Shantou University and Chinese University of Hong Kong, and his colleagues report their observations in the December issue of the Archives of Ophthalmology.\n\nIn the search for a better option than patch therapy, Lam and his associates set out to explore the potential benefits of acupuncture, noting that it has been used to treat dry eye and myopia.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2009, Lam and his colleagues recruited 88 children between the ages of 7 and 12 who had been diagnosed with anisometropia.\n\nAbout half the children were treated five times a week with acupuncture, targeting five specific acupuncture needle insertion points (located at the top of the head and the eyebrow region, as well as the legs and hands). The other half were given two hours a day of patch therapy, combined with a minimum of one hour per day of near-vision exercises such as reading.\n\nAfter about four months of treatment, the research team found that overall visual acuity improved markedly more among the acupuncture group relative to the patch group. In fact, they noted that while lazy eye was successfully treated in nearly 42 percent of the acupuncture patients, that figure dropped to less than 17 percent among the patch patients.\n\nNeither treatment prompted significant side effects, the authors said.\n\nThe team nonetheless pointed out that their study's tracking period was relatively short, and that acupuncture is a complicated system that may lend itself to different success rates, depending on the skills of the particular acupuncturist.\n\nAnd while theorizing that the apparent success of this alternative approach may have something to do with stimulating blood flow, retinal nerve growth and visual cortex activity, the authors acknowledged that the exact mechanism by which it works remains poorly understood.\n\nDr. Richard Bensinger, a Seattle-based ophthalmologist and spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, said that the finding is \"certainly suggestive and worth following up.\"\n\n\"This is kind of cool,\" he said. \"But I will say that I don't know of any study looking at acupuncture and vision. There are studies based on symptomatic things such as pain, and I think there's pretty good evidence that it does have benefit in that respect. But for vision therapy this is the first I've heard of it, and I don't know that anyone has ever tried this before. So this is like a teaser.\"\n\n\"Of course people in those parts of the country, like where I live, where there's fairly wide acceptance of alternative medicine might receive this type of treatment better than others,\" Bensinger cautioned. \"And no question patients will gravitate towards treatments that are covered by their insurance even if it's not the best treatment. And as an alternative approach, this may not be covered.\"\n\n\"But if it works,\" he added, \"people will certainly be excited -- although it certainly needs further testing and further studies to decide if it's really beneficial or not.\"\n\nFor his part, Dr. Stanley Chang, chairman of the ophthalmology department at Columbia University in New York City, did not seem to hold out much promise for acupuncture's potential as an alternative lazy eye therapy.\n\n\"Acupuncture I think definitely works for pain amelioration, but I'm not sure it works for some of these other things,\" he cautioned. \"They've tried it for the treatment of myopia and glaucoma, without much success. And so although there haven't been any really good trials comparing acupuncture with conventional therapies, my guess is that it's probably not going to do much for the treatment of lazy eye.\"\n\n\"However, I think it's worth considering or trying,\" Chang added, \"because nothing else seems to work very well for patients of that age, including patch therapy. But what will need is a very carefully controlled study that accounts for all the variables that might have an impact on the outcome of this approach.\"\n\nFor more on amblyopia, visit the National Eye Institute.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story mentions that acupuncture\u00a0may not be\u00a0be covered by many insurers, but it never provides even a ballpark\u00a0estimate of what a typical office visit for acupuncture would cost.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today permitted marketing of the first blood test to evaluate mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), commonly referred to as concussion, in adults. The FDA reviewed and authorized for marketing the Banyan Brain Trauma Indicator in fewer than 6 months as part of its Breakthrough Devices Program.\n\nMost patients with a suspected head injury are examined using a neurological scale, called the 15-point Glasgow Coma Scale, followed by a computed tomography or CT scan of the head to detect brain tissue damage, or intracranial lesions, that may require treatment; however, a majority of patients evaluated for mTBI/concussion do not have detectable intracranial lesions after having a CT scan. Availability of a blood test for concussion will help health care professionals determine the need for a CT scan in patients suspected of having mTBI and help prevent unnecessary neuroimaging and associated radiation exposure to patients.\n\n\u201cHelping to deliver innovative testing technologies that minimize health impacts to patients while still providing accurate and reliable results to inform appropriate evaluation and treatment is an FDA priority.

In addition, availability of a blood test for mTBI/concussion will likely reduce the CT scans performed on patients with concussion each year, potentially saving our health care system the cost of often unnecessary neuroimaging tests.\u201d\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2013 there were approximately 2.8 million TBI-related emergency department visits, hospitalizations and deaths in the U.S. Of these cases, TBI contributed to the deaths of nearly 50,000 people. TBI is caused by a bump, blow or jolt to the head or a penetrating head injury that disrupts the brain\u2019s normal functioning. Its severity may range from mild to severe, with 75 percent of TBIs that occur each year being assessed as mTBIs or concussions. A majority of patients with concussion symptoms have a negative CT scan. Potential effects of TBI can include impaired thinking or memory, movement, sensation or emotional functioning.\n\n\u201cA blood test to aid in concussion evaluation is an important tool for the American public and for our Service Members abroad who need access to quick and accurate tests,\u201d said Jeffrey Shuren, M.D., director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. \u201cThe FDA\u2019s review team worked closely with the test developer and the U.S. Department of Defense to expedite a blood test for the evaluation of mTBI that can be used both in the continental U.S. as well as foreign U.S. laboratories that service the American military.\u201d\n\nThe Brain Trauma Indicator works by measuring levels of proteins, known as UCH-L1 and GFAP, that are released from the brain into blood and measured within 12 hours of head injury. Levels of these blood proteins after mTBI/concussion can help predict which patients may have intracranial lesions visible by CT scan and which won\u2019t. Being able to predict if patients have a low probability of intracranial lesions can help health care professionals in their management of patients and the decision to perform a CT scan. Test results can be available within 3 to 4 hours.\n\nThe FDA evaluated data from a multi-center, prospective clinical study of 1,947 individual blood samples from adults with suspected mTBI/concussion and reviewed the product\u2019s performance by comparing mTBI/concussion blood tests results with CT scan results. The Brain Trauma Indicator was able to predict the presence of intracranial lesions on a CT scan 97.5 percent of the time and those who did not have intracranial lesions on a CT scan 99.6 percent of the time. These findings indicate that the test can reliably predict the absence of intracranial lesions and that health care professionals can incorporate this tool into the standard of care for patients to rule out the need for a CT scan in at least one-third of patients who are suspected of having mTBI.\n\nThe Brain Trauma Indicator was reviewed under the FDA\u2019s De Novo premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for some low- to moderate-risk devices that are novel and for which there is no prior legally marketed device.\n\nThe FDA is permitting marketing of the Brain Trauma Indicator to Banyan Biomarkers, Inc.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

If the approach pans out, it could provide options for patients with fading cognition and retrieve vanished memories.\n\nRight now, deep brain stimulation is used primarily to treat Parkinson's disease and tremor, for which it's approved by the Food and Drug Administration. DBS involves delivering electrical impulses to specific areas of the brain through implanted electrodes. The technique is also approved for obsessive-compulsive disorder and is being looked at for a number of other brain disorders, including depression, chronic pain and, as in Lozano's work, dementia.\n\nIn 2008, Lozano's group published a study in which an obese patient was treated with deep brain stimulation of the hypothalamus. Though no bigger than a pea, the hypothalamus is a crucial bit of brain involved in appetite regulation and other bodily essentials such as temperature control, sleep and circadian rhythms. It seemed like a reasonable target in trying to suppress excessive hunger. To the researcher's surprise, following stimulation the patient reported a sensation of deja vu. He also perceived feeling 20 years younger and recalled a memory of being in a park with friends, including an old girlfriend. With increasing voltages, his memories became more vivid, including remembering their clothes.\n\nUsing a 3-dimensional brain mapping technique called standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography, or sLORETA, Lozano's group uncovered an explanation for the unexpected findings. They found that stimulating the hypothalamus was in turn driving increased brain activity in the hippocampus, a key cog in the brain's memory circuitry. As Alzheimer's progresses, not only does the hypothalamus atrophy, but electrical communication between neurons in the region also gradually becomes impaired.\n\nThat our memories \u2014 so entwined with our personalities and senses of self \u2014 might be so vulnerable to a brown out is, existentially speaking, rather alarming. There's something palpably dehumanizing about reducing our past selves to the exchange of electricity between neurons, and also about retrieving memories by hot-wiring the brain.\n\nYet the prospect of the latter is undeniably intriguing. Given that Alzheimer's affects 1 in 9 people over the age of 65 and that current therapies are in many patients dismally ineffective, Lozano felt all but obligated to dig further. His group launched a test in six patients and published the results in the Annals of Neurology in 2010.\n\nThe study included patients with mild and severe disease who received stimulation in the fornix continuously for 1 year. \"The fornix is like the highway leading into the hippocampus,\" explains Lozano. \"It's easier to stimulate than the hippocampus itself and crucial to memory function.\" As expected those with more severe disease continued to mentally deteriorate, however it appeared that in those with mild disease, cognitive decline slowed with stimulation.\n\nNext, Lozano launched a randomized trial involving 42 patients from the US and Canada, all of whom had electrodes implanted in the fornix on both sides of the brain. In half the patients the stimulation was turned on right away. In the other half the stimulation wasn't turned on for a year, though they didn't know it.\n\nPreliminary results, published in December 2015 in the Journal of Neurosurgery, were mixed but encouraging.\n\nGiven that so few people have had electrical stimulation applied to memory circuits, perhaps the most significant finding was that both the surgery itself and DBS of the fornix appear safe. No serious long-term neurological side effects were seen in either patient group, supporting future research in the field.\n\nIn terms of efficacy, however, after one year there were no significant differences in cognition between the groups, as measured by two scales commonly used to measure Alzheimer's disease symptoms, the ADAS-Cog and CDR-SB. Alzheimer's tends to progress slowly and reversing or slowing the neurodegeneration associated with condition may take time to become noticeable. Lozano's final results won't be reported until four years out.\n\nMore intriguing for now were comparisons of glucose utilization. Glucose is our brains' primary fuel. The degree to which glucose is burned is a commonly used measure of brain activity. Patients with Alzheimer's typically have reduced glucose activity in their brains, as well as, again, shrinking memory circuits. The older patients in Lozano's study who had stimulation turned on exhibited markedly increased glucose use in the brain's memory regions. Not only that, the hippocampus of some study patients who received DBS actually increased in size.\n\nReversing withering hippocampi by encouraging the growth of new neurons is seen as a holy grail in Alzheimer's research, and Lozano's finding is supported by a recent animal study demonstrating that DBS in rats causes the release of growth factors that induce neuronal growth in the hippocampus.\n\nLozano acknowledges that retrieving childhood memories, which he says has occurred in about one-third of his patents \u2014 requires lofty voltages that he would be uncomfortable sending patients home on. Yet he's encouraged by the early findings that suggest the procedure is safe. \"We also know that in patients who receive stimulation there is an increase in glucose utilization in memory areas of the brain,\" he says, a finding that could mean there's a way to overcome some of the damage from Alzheimer's.\n\nEvidence supporting DBS in dementia is emerging from other research groups as well. A 2012 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that in seven patients receiving DBS to a brain region called the entorhinal cortex, spatial memory improved \u2013 meaning they could more easily remember the locations of newly learned landmarks. The entorhinal cortex works in concert with the hippocampus to solidify memories.\n\nA group at the University of Cologne in Germany is instead focusing on delivering DBS to a part of the brain called the nucleus basalis of Meynert, another region in which impaired neuron function is thought to contribute to Alzheimer's. Last year they published a study in Molecular Psychiatry in which four of six patients either remained cognitively stable or improved in response to DBS, as measured by the ADAS-cog. Like in Lozano's study no serious side effects were seen.\n\nDespite the mounting evidence for DBS, not everyone is convinced.\n\nReferring to Lozano's second clinical study, Dr. Nader Pouratian, a neurosurgeon and DBS researcher at UCLA, comments, \"The recent deep brain stimulation trial for Alzheimer's disease clearly demonstrates the safety of this approach for trying to treat the progression of disease. Unfortunately, [the findings] suggest that the therapy may not be as robust as initially proposed.\"\n\nHowever he acknowledges Lozano's results suggest that DBS to the fornix might be promising for a subgroup of patients, those being older people with less severe disease.\n\n\"The most promising areas are likely the fornix or the entorhinal area,\" he says. \"But I believe further studies are necessary to better elucidate the efficacy of this treatment before proceeding to a larger scale randomized trial.\"\n\nIn a 2008 episode of the medical television drama House, the show's main character Dr. Gregory House survives a bus crash that leaves his memory murky. In an attempt to remember the medical history of a fellow collision victim \u2013 and inspired by Lozano's initial paper \u2014 House voluntarily undergoes deep brain stimulation. Following the procedure the grouchy TV doctor's memory returns. As is customary on the show, he cracks the case.\n\nDBS for treatment of Alzheimer's and other dementias is a field in its infancy. Unlike on TV, in all likelihood it won't be widely used anytime soon to retrieve specific memories. \"Even though House did this, we're not doing it yet,\" cautions Lozano.\n\nYet the fact that the therapy can in some people rescue recollections \u2013 albeit random ones \u2013 and possibly induce new neuron growth in memory regions of the brain seems reason enough to pursue it further.\n\n\"We're hoping to use electricity to drive activity in areas of the brain involved in memory and cognition,\" says Lozano. \"We want to turn these brain networks back on.\"\n\nBret Stetka is a writer based in New York and an editorial director at Medscape.

These so-called \"hot spots\" are central to motor function, attention, facial recognition and social behavior -- types of behaviors that are abnormal in people with autism.\n\n\"We know the two hemispheres must work together for many brain functions,\" study author Dr. Jeffrey S. Anderson, an assistant professor of radiology at the University of Utah, said in a news release. \"We used MRI to look at the strength of these connections from one side to the other in autism patients.\"\n\nUsing MRI imaging, the team searched for differences in brain activity patterns in the microstructure of white matter tissue in 80 autism patients between the ages of 10 and 35. This tissue, the authors noted, is known to play a role in communication between various brain regions.\n\nCommunication deficits between the two hemispheres of the brain were, in fact, uncovered by MRI scans -- differences that the team said were not found in the brains of people without autism.\n\nThe authors also noted that apart from an increased brain size among children diagnosed with autism, there are no apparent structural differences between the brains of autistic patients and patients who are not autistic.\n\nAnderson and his colleagues, who reported no conflicts of interest, published their findings in the Oct. 15 online issue of Cerebral Cortex.\n\nInformation from this investigation will be pooled with those of another ongoing long-term study, which is tracking brain activity among an additional 100 autism patients.\n\n\"We still don't know precisely what's going on in the brain in autism,\" co-author Dr. Janet Lainhart, an associate professor of psychiatry and pediatrics, acknowledged in the news release from Cerebral Cortex.\n\n\"[But] this work adds an important piece of information to the autism puzzle,\" she said. \"It adds evidence of functional impairment in brain connectivity in autism and brings us a step closer to a better understanding of this disorder.

In the U.S., there are around 50 million men and 30 million women affected by hair loss, which U.K.-based researchers said could be a source of \u201cpsychological distress.\u201d\n\nIn a study conducted on human hair follicles, researchers investigated a drug called Cyclosporine A (CsA), which has been prescribed to treat immune disorders and transplant rejection since the 1980s.

The condition tends to develop with age and can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue and heart failure.\n\nPatients in the study had minimally-invasive surgery that fixes the problem by inserting a replacement valve to send blood around the damaged valve while leaving it in place. This procedure, known as a transcatheter aortic valve replacement, is done by threading a catheter to the heart through a small incision in the chest or from the large artery in the groin - it doesn\u2019t require cutting open the chest.\n\nAfterward, patients could walk significantly further in six-minute walking tests used to assess their functional capacity. On average, they added almost 42 meters (138 feet) to their performance before surgery.\n\nIn addition, patients reported clinically meaningful improvements in their quality of life and their ability to complete daily tasks after surgery.\n\nThe results offer fresh evidence that transcatheter aortic valve replacement can help ease symptoms like shortness of breath and fatigue that limit the ability to handle physical exertion, said Dr. David Cohen, director of cardiovascular research at Saint Luke\u2019s Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\n\u201cThese symptoms lead to reduced functional capacity (inability to perform physical exertion) and also impact a patient\u2019s overall sense of wellbeing and quality of life,\u201d Cohen, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email.\n\n\u201cBy replacing the diseased aortic valve, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (and surgical valve replacement) reverses these effects and generally allows the patient to return to his or her \u2018normal\u2019 quality of life - limited only by the impact of other conditions that the patient may have,\u201d Cohen said by email.\n\nOverall, the current analysis included 2,775 patients from a total of 20 previously published studies on outcomes for this type of surgery.\n\nParticipants were 82 years old, on average, and they were typically considered high-risk surgical patients due to either advanced age or other medical issues.\n\nThe smaller studies in the analysis ranged in size from 36 to 484 patients, and most of them followed patients for as long as six to 12 months after surgery.\n\nOne limitation of the current analysis is that many of these smaller studies were not controlled experiments designed to prove whether or how transcatheter aortic valve replacement might improve quality of life, lead study author Nicola Straiton of the University of Sydney and colleagues note in Age and Ageing.

The task force's guidelines are important because insurers and government programs often follow the panel's recommendations in deciding whether to cover certain preventive services.\n\nThe task force's final recommendation is likely to be controversial because some other groups say the screening should start earlier. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, for example, recommends that regular screenings begin at age 40, while the American Cancer Society calls for women to start yearly screening at age 45 and then move to screening every two years starting at age 55.\n\nCongress has sided with proponents of earlier screening. Last month, in anticipation of Monday's release of the task force\u2019s final recommendation, lawmakers took preemptive action: It directed insurers to ignore the task force's latest guidelines and, instead, to rely on its 2002 recommendation. That called for annual mammograms to begin at 40. As a result of the congressional action, women in their 40s will continue to be able to get annual mammograms at no cost.\n\nThe differences over when to start regular screening reflect the growing concern that the benefits of mammograms may have been oversold, and that they don't outweigh the anxiety and potential harm caused by over-diagnosis and false positives from the tests.\n\n[In major shift, these guidelines scaled back breast cancer screening for women in their 40s]\n\nThe debate over when to start regular screening involves only women of \"average risk\" who don't have specific risk factors for breast cancer such as the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic mutations or a family history of the disease. They're also not aimed at diagnostic mammography, which takes place once a woman has a symptom such as a lump. The screening recommendations are not binding on doctors, hospitals or insurers.\n\nIn releasing its final recommendations, the task force confirmed an earlier guidance it issued that said screening mammography had the greatest benefit for women ages 50 to 74. For women in their 40s, the likelihood of benefit is less and the potential harms are proportionally greater, it said. The most serious potential harm is unneeded treatment for a type of cancer that would not have become a threat to a woman's health during her lifetime.\n\nThe congressional action, which was included in the recently enacted spending law, has drawn criticism from some experts.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Congress thinks it's perfectly acceptable, even preferred, for a scientific document from 14 years ago to guide coverage policy on screening for breast cancer in women,\u201d says Kenneth Lin, a Georgetown University family medicine doctor who teaches preventive and evidence-based medicine.\n\nPart of the problem is the common perception that women deserve free mammogram coverage and that the scientific community is basing its decision on cost or rationing, said Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University law professor and expert on public health.\n\nFran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, said the task force's guidelines for women in their 40s \u2014 that they should discuss whether to get mammograms with their doctors and make individual decisions \u2014 come closest to following the evidence accumulated over the past three decades. Women should trust that process, she said.\n\nDespite the decades of marketing of mammography to women, \"women are capable of understanding the complexities of the issue, evaluating the evidence and making their own health decisions,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\"At some point we will have to decide that we are not going to pay for interventions that lack a high level of medical evidence,\" she said. \"At this time, what does concern us very much are attempts by Congress to interfere with the makeup and process of the US Preventive Services Task Force.\"\n\nThe task force first suggested in 2009 that breast cancer screening begin at 50 instead of 40, touching off enormous criticism. In 2010, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, which required that certain preventive services be provided for free \u2014 if those services got a strong recommendation from the task force. But it included an amendment that effectively directed insurers to use the 2002 recommendations for mammograms. That meant that women who were 40 and older could get mammograms at no cost.\n\nIn April 2015, the task force came out with its latest draft guidance, basically reaffirming its 2009 recommendations that the greatest benefit of mammography screening is for women between 50 and 74.\n\nWorried that millions of women under 50 could lose their free annual mammogram coverage if the guidelines became final, several health-care groups, including ACOG, the American College of Radiology and the Susan G. Komen Foundation, lobbied Congress to block that from happening.\n\nLanguage was included in the spending bill that says any recommendations of the task force related to breast cancer screening, mammography and prevention refers to those \u201cissued before 2009.\u201d\n\nSen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) was among the lawmakers who pushed for the language to be included. In a statement, she said her number one priority was to ensure that women can get mammograms if they and their doctors decide it's the right thing to do. \"This means making sure that cost is not a deterrent to care,\" she said.\n\nSeveral groups that lobbied for congressional action said in a statement last month that the task force recommendations conflict with those of other organizations. This results in confusion and puts more than 22 million women at risk of losing of losing insurance coverage for mammograms.\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nThe simple way doctors can make patients feel understood\n\nHow cancer will affect Americans in 2016: in seven charts\n\nOmega 3 is still good for the brain.

However, the story does not tell readers the bottom line: how much would a mammogram cost if it were not covered by insurance? While we found varying estimates, a 2011 paper stated that the overall cost of a mammogram was $266 \u2014 a considerable sum, and likely out of reach for many women.

These limited screening criteria also missed more racial and ethnic minorities, most notably Asians.\n\nFailing to screen high-risk adults could lead to delayed treatments to prevent type 2 diabetes or manage the condition for those who already have it, possibly contributing to a worsening of the diabetes epidemic. Prediabetes and diabetes affect half of U.S. adults with an estimated cost of $327 billion per year.\n\nThe United States Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) currently recommends that physicians screen patients for dysglycemia (prediabetes or type 2 diabetes) when they are 40 to 70 years old and are overweight or obese. By following this recommendation, 53 percent of patients who had prediabetes or type 2 diabetes would not be screened. The study showed that screening patients using an expanded set of risk factors, which the USPSTF suggests but does not formally recommend, would identify most cases of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.\n\nOnly 23 percent of patients with prediabetes or diabetes would be missed if expanded screening criteria were used to make screening decisions, the study found. The expanded criteria include a family history of diabetes, history of gestational diabetes or polycystic ovarian syndrome or non-white race or ethnicity.\n\n\"This seems like a no-brainer to screen patients who have any of these additional risk factors,\" said lead author Dr. Matthew O'Brien, assistant professor of medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. \"By demonstrating how well these expanded criteria work in identifying patients with prediabetes and diabetes, we're proposing a better path for the USPSTF to strengthen its screening guidelines.\"\n\nThe study was published today, Friday, April 13, in the Journal of General Internal Medicine. O'Brien will be presenting his findings today at the Society for General Internal Medicine conference in Denver, Colorado. This is the first study to report how these expanded screening criteria would perform in practice among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults.\n\nThe USPSTF has come under scrutiny for other screening recommendations, most notably for breast cancer. But there has been little attention focused on this group's most recent diabetes screening guideline.\n\nIntensive lifestyle programs and some medications have been proven to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes among adults with prediabetes. A large volume of research over the last three decades has demonstrated that treating type 2 diabetes prevents life-threatening complications such as heart attacks, strokes and kidney failure.\n\n\"The earlier patients are diagnosed with these conditions, the sooner they can begin to combat them,\" O'Brien said.\n\nAfrican-Americans and Latinos develop type 2 diabetes at younger ages, so waiting until they are 40 years old to screen them is problematic, O'Brien said. In the study, 50 percent of whites with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes were identified using the limited criteria compared to only 48 percent of African-Americans and only 44 percent of Latinos.\n\nAsians are at high risk of developing diabetes even at a healthy weight. By following the limited guidelines and only screening patients who are overweight or obese, approximately 30 percent of Asians with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes would be identified. That would leave 70 percent of Asians with prediabetes or diabetes undiagnosed until their next screening test, which could occur years later.\n\nThe study also touches on the financial implications of these guidelines. Under a provision in the Affordable Care Act, all services recommended by the USPSTF must be fully covered by insurers. But O'Brien said it is unclear whether insurers will be required to pay for diabetes screening if patients only meet the expanded criteria.\n\n\"This could be a particular problem for people of low socioeconomic status who are at high risk of developing diabetes and may be unable to pay for a screening test,\" O'Brien said.\n\nThe study was conducted collaboratively with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), using data collected every year from a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. It builds on findings from a previous study O'Brien conducted that incorporated electronic health record data from 50,515 adult primary care patients at community health centers in the Midwest and Southwest between 2008 and 2013.\n\nOther Northwestern authors are senior author Dr. Ronald Ackermann and co-authors Mercedes Carnethon and Dr. Namratha Kandula.

When all expenses are considered, including hospital and surgical expenses, it says it will cost just over $315,000, about the same as a transplant.\n\nThe device was developed over 15 years by a team that included Alain F. Carpentier, the French surgeon-scientist who, along with Albert Starr, received the 2007 Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research. The Lasker Foundation, which is based in New York, praised their work in the development of artificial heart valves, saying they had \u201cprolonged and enhanced the lives of millions of people with heart disease.\u201d\n\nIn the November 2009 bulletin of the Acad\u00e9mie Nationale de M\u00e9decine, Dr. Carpentier wrote that, instead of picking up from older models of artificial hearts built on animal research, the developers of the new device had sought to use the tools of the digital revolution, namely computer-assisted design, hemodynamic modeling, regulation algorithms and simulations.\n\nThe French company is not the first to make total artificial hearts, which are meant to completely replace damaged and diseased organs.\n\nSynCardia, based in Tucson, currently makes the only approved temporary artificial heart, having continued development of the groundbreaking Jarvik-7, which Dr. William C. DeVries implanted in a retired dentist named Barney B. Clark in 1982. Its device, powered by a small air compressor that can be carried in a backpack, has been implanted in more than 800 patients as a bridge before transplant.\n\nAbiomed, a company based in Danvers, Mass., makes a self-contained total artificial heart, the electrical-powered AbioCor.

Results of the study were published today (Dec. 17, 2018) in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nMeasuring less than 1 centimeter across, or about a third of the area of a U.S. penny, the tiny devices -- which are safe for use in the body and implantable via a minimally invasive procedure -- generate gentle electric pulses from the stomach's natural churning motions and deliver them to the vagus nerve, which links the brain and the stomach.\n\nThat gentle stimulation dupes the brain into thinking that the stomach is full after only a few nibbles of food.\n\n\"The pulses correlate with the stomach's motions, enhancing a natural response to help control food intake,\" says Xudong Wang, a UW-Madison professor of materials science and engineering.\n\nUnlike gastric bypass, which permanently alters the capacity of the stomach, the effects of the new devices also are reversible. When Wang and his collaborators removed the devices after 12 weeks, the study's rats resumed their normal eating patterns and weight bounced right back on.\n\nWang's device has several advantages over an existing unit that stimulates the vagus nerve for weight loss. That existing unit, \"Maestro,\" approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2015, administers high-frequency zaps to the vagus nerve to shut down all communication between the brain and stomach. It requires a complicated control unit and bulky batteries which frequently must be recharged.\n\nThat ongoing maintenance can be a big barrier to use, says Luke Funk, a surgery professor in UW-Madison's Division of Minimally Invasive, Foregut and Bariatric Surgery. \"One potential advantage of the new device over existing vagus nerve stimulators is that it does not require external battery charging, which is a significant advantage when you consider the inconvenience that patients experience when having to charge a battery multiple times a week for an hour or so.\"\n\nIn fact, Wang's device contains no batteries, no electronics, and no complicated wiring. It relies instead on the undulations of the stomach walls to power its internal generators.\n\nThat means the device only stimulates the vagus nerve when the stomach moves.\n\n\"It's automatically responsive to our body function, producing stimulation when needed,\" says Wang. \"Our body knows best.\"\n\nWang is a world expert in wearable and implantable capacitive electricity-generating devices, having previously created implantable nanogenerators that harvest energy from people's beating hearts and breathing, a motion-powered bandage for wound healing, and other such devices.\n\nHe and his collaborators patented the weight-loss device through the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and are moving forward with testing in larger animal models. If successful, they hope to move toward human trials.\n\n\"Our expectation is that the device will be more effective and convenient to use than other technologies,\" says Wang.\n\nUW-Madison radiology professor Weibo Cai is also a senior author on the study.\n\nThis research was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (R01EB021336 and P30CA014520).", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Although this device is still in early testing, the news release notes that it is intended to improve upon a similar device that is already available.
