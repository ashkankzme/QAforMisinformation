[{"article": "The drug, finasteride, is available as a generic for about $2.00 a day, and millions of men safely take it now to shrink their prostates, its approved use.\n\nWith finasteride, as many as 100,000 cases of prostate cancer a year could be prevented, said Dr. Eric Klein, director of the Center for Urologic Oncology at the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nDr. Howard Parnes, chief of the prostate cancer group at the National Cancer Institute\u2019s division of cancer prevention, also is convinced. \u201cThere is a tremendous public health benefit for the use of this agent,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile it might seem convoluted to offer a drug to prevent the consequences of overtreatment, that is the situation in the country today, others say. Preventing the cancer can prevent treatments that can be debilitating, even if the cancers were never lethal to start with.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the bind we\u2019re in right now,\u201d said Dr. Christopher Logothetis, professor and chairman of genitourinary medical oncology at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. \u201cMost of the time, treatment wouldn\u2019t help and may not be necessary. But the reality is that people are being operated on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are trying to avoid a diagnosis to avoid a prevention whose value is disputed,\u201d he said. With finasteride, Dr. Logothetis added, \u201cwe\u2019re trying to overcome our other sins.\u201d\n\nOther experts say, Not so fast. Finasteride might not make much of a difference in the death rate because so few men die from prostate cancer. What the drug\u2019s proponents are advocating is taking a drug to somehow compensate for what many believe is the nation\u2019s overzealous diagnosis and treatment of the disease.\n\nDr. Peter Albertsen, a prostate cancer specialist at the University of Connecticut, explains: While 10 percent of men 55 and older find out they have prostate cancer, the cancer is lethal in no more than 25 percent of them. So if finasteride reduced the prostate cancer\u2019s incidence by 30 percent, about 7 percent of men would get a cancer diagnosis and approximately 1.8 percent instead of 2.5 percent would have a lethal cancer.\n\n\u201cFinasteride might make a difference but only in a very small subset of men,\u201d Dr. Albertsen said.\n\nAnd, he adds, the study did not look for a decline in death rates, and it is unlikely that any study ever will \u2014 it would take too long and be too expensive. Yet the ultimate goal of prevention is to save lives. It remains an assumption that finasteride would have much impact on the minority of prostate cancers that, despite early detection and treatment, still kill.\n\nFinasteride blocks the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, a hormone active mostly in the prostate and the scalp, and that all prostate cancers need to grow.\n\nThe drug is available from Merck & Company, as Proscar, and from six companies as a generic to shrink the prostate in older men whose prostates can enlarge, making urination difficult.\n\nResearchers say it turns out that shrinking the prostate also may be good for cancer detection by making it easier to find all tumors, including the most aggressive.\n\n\u201cThe data are compelling,\u201d said Dr. Peter Scardino, chairman of the department of surgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, a convert who originally thought the drug was dangerous. \u201cFinasteride has to be recognized as the first clearly demonstrated way to prevent prostate cancer with any medication or any oral agent at all.\u201d\n\nFinasteride has had its ups and downs. Its chronicle began in 1993, with the start of a study sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and involving 19,000 men. Half took finasteride pills; the rest a placebo. In March 2003, 15 months before the study\u2019s scheduled end, its directors halted it abruptly. The reason was that the results were overwhelmingly compelling \u2014 men taking the drug were not getting prostate cancer.\n\nYet despite that note of triumph, a troubling finding emerged. The study was designed to look for a reduction in the overall prostate cancer rate. And that is what it found. But, as Dr. Scardino pointed out in an editorial five years ago in The New England Journal of Medicine that accompanied the study, it appeared that 6.4 percent of the men who took the drug got fast growing, ominous-looking tumors. In contrast, such tumors were found in 5.1 percent, of men who took the placebo.\n\nThe concern was that the drug might be preventing cancers that never spread. At the same time, finasteride might actually be causing aggressive cancers that can kill.\n\nIt would, of course, be the worse possible outcome. Dr. Scardino\u2019s editorial warned healthy men not to take finasteride.\n\nThat seemed to leave the drug dead. The study researchers, though, wondered if that conclusion was correct. Maybe, they thought, by shrinking the prostate, the drug was just making it easier to find aggressive tumors.\n\nWhen doctors do a biopsy for prostate cancer, they probe the gland with a needle, hoping to find cancer cells. But prostate cancer grows as little nests and an aggressive cancer will appear as dangerous-looking cells in some clusters and less dangerous in others. A smaller prostate means a doctor is more likely to hit upon cancer nests and more likely to find aggressive-looking cells.\n\nThe researchers had a way to learn if they were correct. Most of the men in the study who had cancer \u2014 aggressive or not \u2014 chose to be treated and many had their prostates removed. A pathologist could carefully examine every one of those 500 prostates and compare the kinds of cancers found at surgery to those initially diagnosed at biopsy.\n\nIt took years, but the analysis showed the hypothesis was right. Now, two groups of independent researchers conclude, in papers in the current issue of Cancer Prevention Research, that finasteride decreases the risk of having any tumor at all \u2014 large or small, fast growing or slow growing, by the same amount \u2014 nearly 30 percent.\n\nWith this new analysis, many prostate cancer specialists, including Dr. Scardino, say their view of the drug has completely changed. The study actually found that finasteride protects against both lethal and less dangerous tumors and could cut prostate cancer risk by nearly a third.\n\nEven the effect on smaller tumors has important implications, said Dr. Ian M. Thompson, Jr., the study\u2019s principal researcher and a urologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio.\n\n\u201cThe cancers that were prevented were the ones men are having surgery and radiation for today,\u201d Dr. Thompson said.\n\nNow, though, prostate cancer specialists have a new problem: How can they change the drug\u2019s image?\n\nDrug companies are unlikely to be instrumental, Dr. Thompson and others say, because finasteride\u2019s patent has expired, giving companies little incentive to apply to the Food and Drug Administration to market it as a cancer preventative. Without F.D.A. approval, finasteride cannot be advertised as preventing cancer and insurers may not pay for it.\n\nBut doctors can prescribe drugs for other purposes at their discretion and Dr. Parnes said that men and their doctors may be persuaded to try it.\n\nIn the meantime, GlaxoSmithKline, which has a patented drug, Avodart, to reduce the size of men\u2019s prostates, has a study asking whether its drug can prevent prostate cancer. If it can, and the drug agency approves Avodart for cancer prevention, doctors and patients may have to decide between a generic drug used off-label or a more expensive brand-name drug that does much the same thing.\n\nSome leading prostate specialists, like Dr. Scardino, say they are recommending that men who worry about prostate cancer take finasteride.\n\nHe also ponders taking it himself. \u201cI regularly think, Why don\u2019t I take it? Why wouldn\u2019t every man take it?\u201d Dr. Scardino said. He hasn\u2019t done so yet, partly because those years of concern about the drug took a toll.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the difficulty of adjusting to something that originally had a bad reputation,\u201d Dr. Scardino explained.\n\nDr. Thompson has no such fears.\n\nHe is at no particular risk for prostate cancer, but, he reasons, taking finasteride is not that different than taking a statin for a slightly elevated cholesterol level.\n\n\u201cImagine the marathoner with no family history of heart disease, who\u2019s skinny, doesn\u2019t smoke and has normal blood pressure,\u201d Dr. Thompson says. \u201cShould he take a statin? The amount of benefit he\u2019ll get is not much, but his risk reduction still is 25 or 30 percent.\u201d\n\nDr. Thompson knows what he will do about finasteride.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 54,\u201d he said. \u201cThe men in the study were 55 and older. So I\u2019ll start taking it next year.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story included an estimated price for the generic version of this medication.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Cancer cells remain elusive and tough to locate, but a new crop of nuclear-imaging tests promises to lead to more accurate prognosis and treatment.\n\nThe tests use imaging agents that combine radioactive isotopes with targeted molecules that can spot cancer at the cellular level.

They noted that dupilumab has also shown the ability to tame atopic dermatitis, or severe eczema, an allergic condition that is not well controlled by current treatments.\n\nResults of the 12-week asthma study are being presented on Tuesday at the annual scientific meeting of the American Thoracic Society in Philadelphia.\n\nThe medicine, if approved, could hold promise for patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma that is not well controlled by standard drugs.\n\n\u201cWe have been treating asthma with sort of Band-Aid therapies that didn\u2019t get at the underlying causes,\u201d Wenzel said in an interview, adding that dupilumab could be an important step in going to the root of the problem.\n\nThe drug works by simultaneously blocking proteins that have been linked to inflammation, interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13).\n\nWenzel, director of the Asthma Institute at the University of Pittsburgh, said other drugmakers have tested medicines that block one or both of the proteins, but without success.\n\nThe trial recruited patients with high levels of eosinophils, a biomarker that shows immune system cells called type 2 helper T cells (Th2 cells) associated with allergy and asthma have been activated.\n\nSuch patients were deemed likely to benefit from treatment.\n\nAll patients initially stayed on their standard asthma treatments, meaning medium-to-high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids, as well as long-acting beta agonists. But patients gradually tapered off on those drugs and were no longer taking either of them after 9 weeks.\n\nThroughout the Phase IIa trial, half the patients also received weekly injections of dupilumab, while half received placebo injections.\n\nAfter the ninth week, 25 percent of those on placebos had experienced exacerbations, a catch-all term that included the need to take a beta agonist, a decrease in lung function, the need for an oral or inhaled corticosteroid, or if the patient went to the hospital or emergency room for worsening asthma.\n\n\u201cBy end of the trial, after 12 weeks, 44 percent of those in the placebo group had exacerbations, compared with 5 percent of those on dupilumab,\u201d Wenzel said. That represented an 87 percent reduction in exacerbations, which was highly statistically significant.\n\nWenzel said dupilumab was well tolerated, with side effects similar to placebo. But she cautioned that longer trials are needed to fully assess the drug.\n\nRegeneron and Sanofi said standard drugs are unable to control asthma in 10 to 20 percent of patients. They estimate that inflammation caused by Th2 cells - the type of inflammation among patients they tested - affects up to 2.5 million people in the United States and up to 30 million worldwide.\n\nDupilumab has also shown strong hints of safety and effectiveness in two early-stage trials that involved 67 patients with atopic dermatitis.

An expert panel in the United States recommends this test for children between the ages of 9 and 11, but many aren\u2019t tested now unless they are obese or have other heart risk factors such as diabetes or high blood pressure.\n\nFor every 1,000 people screened in the study, four children and four parents were identified as being at risk for early heart disease. That\u2019s nearly twice as many as most studies in the past have suggested.\n\n\u201cWe really need to pay attention to this,\u201d said Dr. Elaine Urbina, director of preventive cardiology at Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center and a member of the US. expert panel. \u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to screen for something that\u2019s common, dangerous and has a treatment that\u2019s effective and safe.\u201d\n\nDr. William Cooper, a pediatrics and preventive medicine professor at Vanderbilt University, called it \u201can innovative approach\u201d that finds not just kids at risk but also parents while they\u2019re still young enough to benefit from preventive treatment, such as cholesterol-lowering statin drugs.\n\nStatins aren\u2019t recommended until around age 10, but certain dietary supplements such as plant sterols and stanols could help younger kids, Urbina said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about putting all these kids on statins,\u201d she said.\n\nThe study was led by Dr. David Wald at Queen Mary University of London. He and another author founded a company that makes a combination pill to prevent heart disease. The work was funded by the Medical Research Council, the British government\u2019s health research agency. Results were published Wednesday by the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nResearchers were testing for familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic disorder that, untreated, raises the risk of a heart attack by age 40 tenfold.\n\nThey did a heel-stick blood test on 10,059 children ages 1 to 2 during routine immunization visits to check for high cholesterol and 48 gene mutations that can cause the disorder. If a child was found with the disorder, parents were tested.\n\nOne in 270 children had the gene mutations; others were identified through cholesterol levels alone.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty common genetic defect,\u201d said Dr. Stephen Daniels, chairman of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and a member of the US expert panel.\n\nBut many parents balk at the idea of testing children for a disorder associated with middle age, experts say.\n\nKaren Teber, a media relations specialist in Madison, Wis., was surprised when a doctor wanted to test her 12-year-old stepson. \u201cMy reluctance was really born out of lack of information,\u201d she said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard of it before.\u201d\n\nThe study did not address whether screening is cost-effective. In the US, cholesterol tests cost around $80 and usually are covered by health insurance though much lower prices often are negotiated. The study authors in England estimated that if cholesterol testing costs $7 and gene testing costs $300, it would cost $2,900 for every person identified as having the disorder.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "This was a strong point for the story, which did provide some information on cost. \u201cThe study did not address whether screening is cost-effective.

The data were presented today at the Society for Research on Nicotine & Tobacco's 22nd Annual Meeting.\n\nChrono's wearable transdermal drug delivery device times nicotine delivery to when smokers have their strongest cravings. For example, 75% of all smokers reach for their first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up. The Chrono Solution is designed to deliver the first dose of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) shortly before a smoker wakes up and then creates a pattern of \"peaks and troughs\" of nicotine delivery throughout the rest of the day to assure the smoker has more nicotine support when cravings are predicted to be strongest.\n\n\"In the United States, 70 percent of smokers want to quit, but quitting is extremely difficult. In fact, most people try 8 to 10 times and this includes quit attempts with standard cessation medications like nicotine patch and gum and prescription drugs like varenicline,\" said Alan Levy, Ph.D., chairman and CEO of Chrono Therapeutics. \"Gums and patches are designed to help manage cravings, but they are only 5 to 9 percent effective. Our goal is to solve this crisis of public health with an innovative, integrated smoking cessation solution, and the data we presented demonstrates that we are on the right path.\"\n\nThe clinical trial was a randomized, double blinded study of 24 adult males who smoked 11 or more cigarettes per day, indicating a high level of nicotine dependence. The subjects were divided into two groups. Test group subjects had nicotine administered over a 30-hour time period via Chrono's prototype device that delivered nicotine according to Chrono's \"peaks and troughs\" profile. Control subjects had a placebo solution, with no nicotine, administered at the same intervals via the same prototype device. Across both groups, subjects showed no serious adverse events or study withdrawals due to an adverse event. Skin irritation assessment showed no signs of irritation or erythema.\n\nCravings were assessed via three different methods: the Questionnaire for Smoking Urges (QSU), the Mood and Physical Symptoms Scale (MPSS) and a single craving question, each of which is a validated tool to assess cravings. When compared to subjects treated with placebo, test subjects had a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in cravings for all assessment methods (p=0.035; p=0.034 and p=0.016, respectively).\n\n\"Achieving statistical significance in a 24-subject trial is very striking and happens infrequently in biopharma; so these results are very encouraging,\" noted Wende Hutton, general partner at Canaan Partners and a member of Chrono's board of directors. \"Quitting smoking is one of the simplest ways to improve global public health, but as the dismal efficacy of current therapies demonstrates, it is also one of the hardest.

Chrono's team is developing the first wearable transdermal drug delivery device that optimizes drug dosing, is embedded with sensor technology to track usage and is connected via Bluetooth to an evidence-based smartphone application that delivers real-time personalized behavioral support to keep users on track to achieve their goals.

Most Americans don't get the 25 to 38 grams a day that's recommended, depending on age and gender.\n\nBut if you're skimping on fiber, the health stakes are high, especially if you're a teenage girl.\n\nA study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics concludes that eating lots of fiber-rich foods during high school years may significantly reduce a woman's risk of developing breast cancer.\n\nThe findings are based on a long-term study of 44,000 women who were surveyed about their eating habits in high school. The women also completed detailed questionnaires about their dietary habits every four years.\n\nThe researchers found that women who consumed high levels of fiber (28 grams per day, on average) had a 24 percent lower risk of developing breast cancer before menopause, compared with women who ate low levels of fiber (14 grams per day, on average). For the women on the high-fiber diet, the lifetime risk of developing breast cancer was also cut by 16 percent.\n\nOf course, the idea that high-fiber diets can help keep us healthy is not new. It's well-known that fiber can prevent constipation and keep the bowel moving by making stools bulkier and absorbing water. Prior studies have shown dietary fiber can protect against colorectal cancer and may lower the risks of diabetes and heart disease. There's also a growing body of evidence linking fiber to weight management.\n\nThis new study provides some evidence of yet another potential benefit.\n\n\"This is a really important study ... [suggesting] that the more fiber you eat during your high school years, the lower your risk is in developing breast cancer,\" says Kimberly Blackwell, a breast cancer specialist at the Duke Cancer Center.\n\nIn a commentary accompanying the study in Pediatrics, Blackwell writes, \"There is longstanding evidence that dietary fibers may reduce circulating estrogen levels.\" And this may help explain the reduced risk of breast cancer.\n\nThe authors point to other possible explanations, too. For instance, high-fiber diets may reduce the risk of breast cancer by improving insulin sensitivity, since fiber can slow down the absorption of sugars and help keep blood sugar levels more stable.\n\nMaryam Farvid, a fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health who is lead author of the study, says the influence of fiber on cancer risk may be time-sensitive. Adolescence is \"a period when breast cancer risk factors appear to be particularly important,\" she says.\n\nOne limitation of this new study is that it relies on data from women who had to recall what they ate during high school. They were in their 30s and 40 when asked, so there could be \"recall bias\" \u2014 the women's memories may be foggy.\n\n\"The recollection of dietary habits more than a decade earlier must be questioned,\" writes Blackwell. On the other hand, she says, \"people's dietary habits don't really change a lot. ... In general, what you eat as a teenager is really formative as to what you eat later in life.\"\n\nSo, how might the message of this new study linking high-fiber diets to a lower risk of breast cancer be communicated to teenagers?\n\nThis is a question Kristi King, a dietitian at Texas Children's Hospital, has thought about a lot.\n\nShe says it can be hard to get the attention of teenagers about healthy eating. \"Unfortunately for teenagers, they're [into] instant gratification,\" and they're not necessarily focused on how their actions today will influence their future health, she says.\n\nBut, she says, explaining that dietary choices may influence their risk of breast cancer may grab their attention. \"Most teenage girls do know someone that has been affected by breast cancer,\" says King. \"So I feel like that touches a nerve with them.\"\n\nGiven the known benefits of high-fiber diets and the growing evidence that fiber may play a role in preventing disease, the government's Dietary Guidelines for Americans also say most people need to consume more.\n\nWomen are advised to consume 25 grams a day. Men are advised to consume 38 grams a day.\n\nSo, how best to reach these targets? \"Add fiber at each meal,\" says King, in the form of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts or seeds.

Now, he's working on Project Evo. It's a total switch in mission, from dreaming up best-sellers for the commercial market to designing games to treat mental health conditions.\n\n\"The qualities of a good video game, things that hook you, what makes the brain \u2014 snap \u2014 engage and go, could be a perfect vessel for actually delivering medicine,\" he says.\n\nIn fact, the creators believe their game will be so effective it might one day reduce or replace the drugs kids take for ADHD. But this kind of goal requires a totally different business model; before they can deliver their game to players, they first have to go through the Food and Drug Administration \u2014 the FDA.\n\n\"The first time those three letters were uttered in a group setting, everyone's like, 'Oooo, that's scary, do we want to do that?' \" Omernick recalls.\n\nSilicon Valley companies routinely avoid government regulation if at all possible; the process for FDA approval can be slow and expensive.\n\n\"If it says 'FDA approval needed' in the business plan, I myself scream in fear and run away,\" says Tim Chang, managing director at Mayfield Fund, a venture capital firm. He has never backed a company that wanted to go through the FDA.\n\nMost startups can bring a new video game to market in six months. Going through the FDA approval process for medical devices could take three or four years \u2014 and cost millions of dollars.\n\n\"That's what's been scary about going the regulatory path,\" Chang says. \"You're waiting and waiting and waiting for FDA approval, going through all these different clinical tests, and you could run out of money easily before you get through that.\"\n\nThe worst fear is that the technology will become outdated by the time the FDA process is complete. Tech companies are constantly redesigning their software to keep up with competition and consumer habits.

If the FDA gives its stamp of approval, doctors could prescribe the game. And that opens the door for insurance companies to pay for it.\n\n\"Then you're going into the land of the big, big budgets,\" Chang says.\n\nWithin in the health care field, some executives believe the commercial successes of online games like Angry Birds and Candy Crush could translate into the medical world.

The Affordable Care Act has made it a lot easier for people to switch health plans. Cigna has to find ways to stand out.\n\n\"People want to do things that are fun,\" says Gee. \"So, we have to be there with them.\"\n\nIt might seem like a strange vision for an industry known best for issuing denial letters. But Gee believes reimbursing patients to play games could cut other health costs \u2014 by promoting exercise and preventing disease, for example, or even reducing the amount of expensive drugs people take.\n\n\"As an industry, we're going to have to reorient ourselves around what it is we're really trying to do,\" he says. \"And if, at the end of the day, the goal is about improving health, then we may need to revisit the way we are quantifying outcomes.\"\n\nDrug companies are keeping an eye on these games, too. Pfizer partnered with the Project Evo team to see if the game could help improve the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The drug manufacturer believes it could alleviate some of the problems with drug trials \u2014 helping to make them faster, cheaper and more efficient.\n\nRight now, screening for Alzheimer's is subjective. Patients and families fill out forms on mood and attention. The results are often inaccurate. Some of the people recruited for drug trials end up not having Alzheimer's at all.

It\u2019s designed to stimulate nerves under the skin in the arm and block pain signals from reaching the brain.\n\n\u201cAll stimulation treatments given so far have been in the head,\u201d said lead study author Dr. David Yarnitsky, an advisory board member for Theranica, the company developing the device.\n\n\u201cWe worked on stimulation at a far away location, which makes the treatment more convenient and more discrete so people can use it even during working hours without anyone noticing,\u201d Yarnitsky added by email.\n\nThe study involved 71 people with episodic migraines who had two to eight attacks a month and had not taken drugs to prevent the episodes for at least two months.\n\nParticipants were typically in their mid-to-late 40s and had been experiencing about five migraines a month. Most of them were female, and more than half of them reported experiencing what\u2019s known as aura\n\nOverall, participants had a total of 299 migraines during the study period.\n\nResearchers asked participants to put the device on their upper arm as soon as possible after the start of a migraine and use it for 20 minutes. They were also asked not to take any medicines for migraines for two hours after the start of the episode.\n\nFor the experiment, researchers randomly programed the devices to give either placebo stimulation at a very low frequency or deliver one of four levels of active electrical stimulation treatment.\n\nThe four active treatment programs were set at a pulse rate of 80 to 120 Hertz (Hz) with pulse widths of 200, 150, 100 and 50. People feel less stimulation at lower pulse widths. At higher pulse widths than this device used, people might feel their muscles contract.\n\nWhen researchers excluded the lowest pulse width, they found 64 percent of people in the other active treatment groups had at least a 50 percent pain reduction two hours after treatment, compared with 26 percent of people in the placebo group.\n\nAt the highest level of stimulation, 58 percent of the people who started out with moderate to severe pain reported little or no pain after treatment. So did 24 percent of people in the placebo group.\n\nThe timing of treatment also mattered.\n\nPeople who started using the device within 20 minutes of the start of a migraine reported average pain reductions of 47 percent, compared to a 25 percent reduction in pain for people starting the device later.\n\nEven though the study\u2019s participants were not told whether they were assigned active or placebo treatment, one limitation of the experiment is that participants often stopped placebo treatments before the recommended 20-minute course of stimulation was done, the authors note in Neurology.\n\nThe technology known as transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) that was tested in the current study has been examined in other devices for migraine pain for decades, said Dr. Jean Schoenen, a neurology researcher at the University of Liege in Belgium who wasn\u2019t involved in the current experiment.\n\nOne shortcoming of the current study is that researchers didn\u2019t examine how long the pain relief lasts beyond two hours, Schoenen said by email.\n\n\u201cRapid and sustained relief is what patients want,\u201d Schoenen added.\n\nIf the device works in larger trials and becomes widely available for migraine patients, it might offer an alternative for people who can\u2019t tolerate migraine drugs or an option patients could try in addition to medication when they don\u2019t get enough pain relief from drugs alone, Schoenen said.\n\n\u201cThe percentage of attacks for which TENS is sufficient as sole treatment and allows sustained pain relief remains to be determined,\u201d Schoenen cautioned.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "This was one downside to the story: There\u2019s no information about the cost, either for the Nerivio Migra or\u00a0similar treatments.

The differences in diagnosis can mean having mere hours to act or being able to take days or weeks to devise a treatment plan. Now, researchers at Jefferson (Philadelphia University + Thomas Jefferson University) have developed a test that could rapidly parse out infections of the brain from other diseases. The diagnostic could prove particularly useful in infants and young children.\n\n\u201cWe have many tests for making diagnoses, but the ones that conclusively indicate infection can often take more time than we\u2019d like, especially in cases of childhood meningitis or encephalitis,\u201d said Mark Curtis, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Pathology, Anatomy and Cell Biology, who also works as a hospital pathologist. \u201cOnce confirmed with additional research, our test could provide a first, rapid and less invasive way to look at what\u2019s happening in the brain and guide treatment or further testing.\u201d\n\nThe results were published in the journal PLOS ONE on October 31st.\n\nRather than testing for the presence of bacteria or virus, the researchers looked at the first tell-tale signs of infection: the cytokines produced by the patient\u2019s immune system in response to pathogens and other injury processes. \u201cCytokines are an alarm system in the body,\u201d said Dr. Curtis. \u201cInfectious agents activate a multi-pronged inflammatory response, a key component of which is the release of different combinations of cytokines tailored to combat pathogens. Changes in cytokine levels of cerebrospinal fluid offer a very early measurable sign of infection.\u201d\n\nDr. Curtis and colleagues decided to see if they could detect patterns within the cytokines that might differentiate infections from other brain diseases or disorders. In the retrospective analysis, the investigators looked at samples collected from 43 patients who had received spinal taps during their hospital stays. The researchers then tested the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) for the presence of 41 different cytokines and noticed that patients with confirmed infection of the central nervous system had a different cytokine fingerprint from those confirmed as having tumors or autoimmune disease. This suggested the test could be used to tell the conditions apart.\n\nAdditionally, within the patients identified with central nervous system infections, the CSF cytokine fingerprint was different in cases of viral infection compared to those with non-viral pathogens, such as bacteria or fungi.\n\n\u201cWith only a small amount of spinal fluid needed, CSF cytokine analysis could be used as one of the first diagnostic tests to rapidly triage serious central nervous system disorders and guide immediate intervention,\u201d said first author, Danielle Fortuna, MD, an Assistant Professor, in the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nWorldwide, meningitis and encephalitis affect more than four million adults and children each year. \u201cInfants and young children have an especially high risk of meningitis and encephalitis and the related, often serious sequelae,\u201d said Dr. Curtis. \u201cBeing able to rapidly identify a central nervous system disorder as infectious can be crucial in rapid response.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition, the test could distinguish viral from non-viral infections, a distinction that could spare a child with a viral infection from an unnecessary course of antibiotics, and tailor the care toward antiviral and supportive measures as needed,\u201d said Dr. Curtis. \u201cMoving forward, our goal is to formally validate our findings with a larger sample size that includes both adults and children for future use in the clinical arena.\u201d\n\nArticle reference: Danielle Fortuna, D Craig Hooper, Amity L Roberts, Larry A Harshyne, Michelle Nagurney, Mark T Curtis, \u201cPotential role of CSF cytokine profiles in discriminating infectious from non-infectious CNS disorders,\u201d PLOS ONE, DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0205501, 2018.", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "No costs for the test are mentioned, but a lumbar puncture can cost anywhere from about $600 to more than $2,000, with a \u201cfair price\u201d being about $1,000, according to Healthcare Bluebook.

For one thing, it can be the factor that sends someone to get a genetic test in the first place. For another, people in many parts of the world don\u2019t have access to genetic tests at all.\n\nThat\u2019s inspired years of effort to train a computer to do the same thing. Software that analyzes a patient\u2019s face for signs of disease could help clinicians better diagnose and treat people with genetic syndromes.\n\nSome older attempts at facial analysis relied on large, clunky scanners \u2014 a tool better suited to a lab, not the field. Now, in the era of smartphones, such efforts have a whole new promise. Face2Gene, a program developed by Boston-based startup FDNA, has a mobile app that clinicians can use to snap photos of their patients and get a list of syndromes they might have.\n\nMeanwhile, Muenke and his colleagues at the NIH last month published an important advance: the ability to diagnose disease in a non-Caucasian face.\n\nIt\u2019s a promising preliminary sign. But if facial recognition software is to be widely useful for diagnoses, software developers and geneticists will need to work together to overcome genetics\u2019 systemic blind spots.\n\nThe algorithms in general work on the same principles: measuring the size of facial features and their placement to detect patterns. They\u2019re both trained on databases of photographs doctors take of their patients. The NIH works with partners around the world to collect their photos; FDNA accepts photos uploaded to Face2Gene.\n\nBut they differ in a key way: Whereas the algorithm the NIH uses can predict if someone has a given genetic disorder, the Face2Gene algorithm spits out not diagnoses, but probabilities. The app describes photos as being a certain percent similar to photos of people with one of the 2,000 disorders for which Face2Gene has image data, based on the overall \u201clook\u201d of the face as well as the presence of certain features. However, the app won\u2019t give clinicians a yes or no answer to the question of, \u201cDoes my patient have a genetic disorder?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s intentional. Face2Gene is meant to be more like a search engine for diseases \u2014 a means to an end.\n\n\u201cWe are not a diagnostic tool, and we will never be a diagnostic tool,\u201d said FDNA CEO Dekel Gelbman.\n\nDrawing that bright line between Face2Gene and \u201ca diagnostic tool\u201d allows FDNA to stay compliant with FDA regulations governing mobile medical apps while avoiding some of the regulatory burden associated with smartphone-based diagnostic tools.\n\nThe algorithm the NIH uses \u2014 developed by scientists at Children\u2019s National Health System in Washington, D.C., \u2014 seems to work pretty well so far: In 129 cases of Down syndrome, it accurately detected the disorder 94 percent of the time. For DiGeorge syndrome, the numbers were even higher: It had a 95 percent accuracy rate across all 156 cases.\n\nFace2Gene declined to provide similar numbers for their technology. \u201cSince Face2Gene is a search and reference informational tool, the terms sensitivity and specificity are difficult to apply to our output,\u201d Gelbman cautioned.\n\nBut there\u2019s one big stumbling block for both of them, a problem that has dogged medical genetics for decades: Data for non-white populations is sorely lacking.\n\n\u201cIn every single textbook, the ones we had [when I trained] in Germany and the major textbooks here in the US, there are photos of individuals of northern European descent,\u201d Muenke said. \u201cWhen I told this to my boss, he said there have to be atlases for children from diverse backgrounds. And there aren\u2019t. There just aren\u2019t.\u201d (Today there is that resource, based on Muenke and the NIH\u2019s work.)\n\nSo diagnosing diseases from a face alone presents an additional challenge in countries where the majority of the population isn\u2019t of northern European descent, because some facial areas that vary with ethnic background can often overlap with areas that signify a genetic disorder. Eventually, the software will also have to be able to tackle people with mixed ethnic backgrounds, too. \u201cWe have thought about it but haven\u2019t gone there yet,\u201d Muenke said.\n\nFor example, children with Down syndrome often have flat nasal bridges \u2014 as do typically developing African or African-American children. Across different races and ethnicities of children there were only two reliable identifiers that could be used to diagnose Down syndrome \u2014 the angles between landmark points on the child\u2019s nose and eye, according to a paper Muenke and Marius Linguraru at Children\u2019s National published with their colleagues earlier this year. All of the other \u201ctypical\u201d features weren\u2019t significantly more likely to show up when children were compared to ethnically matched controls.\n\nIn fact, using a Caucasian face as a reference can sometimes be the least representative choice. \u201cOne of the findings that I\u2019m very interested in [in] our recent study was that the population that we found to be most different from the others, in terms of facial patterns characteristic of DiGeorge syndrome, was the Caucasian population,\u201d Linguraru said.\n\nTo continue to fix this problem, both the NIH and Face2Gene need help from more researchers who can upload more patients\u2019 faces \u2014 but that\u2019s easier said than done. Confirming a suspected disorder with genetic tests is standard practice today, and there are no genetic labs based in Africa registered in the NIH\u2019s Genetic Testing Registry. Asia and South America are also relatively underserved.\n\nThose numbers also reflect the general patterns of distribution for medical geneticists. \u201cMost practitioners are located in North America and Europe,\u201d Gelbman said. Nigeria, for example, doesn\u2019t have a single medical geneticist in the entire country.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that might change, with time and effort. In addition to his work as a researcher, Muenke directs a program that brings health care professionals from developing countries to the US for a month-long crash course in medical genetics. (The program is funded by the NIH\u2019s Fogarty International Center; President Trump eliminated funding for the center in his 2018 \u201cskinny\u201d budget proposal announced in March.)\n\nFor now, both algorithms have shown that they can handle a diverse patient set. FDNA scientists published a paper in January showing that their algorithm could better identify Down syndrome after being trained with a more diverse set of faces, and Muenke and Linguraru have also published papers this year demonstrating their algorithm\u2019s ability to identify genetic disorders correctly in children across a variety of ethnic backgrounds.\n\nAs both groups work on recruiting more researchers, they are also working to push their tech forward. FDNA is working on establishing partnerships with pharmaceutical companies to start their commercial outreach. In theory, these partnerships could contribute to precision medicine efforts or help companies develop new therapies for rare diseases.\n\nMeanwhile, Linguraru has his eyes on eventual FDA approval for the algorithm the NIH has used. The ultimate goal would be a simple tool that any doctor could use anywhere to get fast results and better diagnose their patients.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "There are no prices in this story.

University of Pennsylvania researchers Rebecca Ashare and Heath Schmidt saw potential for a permanent cessation solution in a class of FDA-approved medications used to improve cognitive impairments from Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn a study consisting of a rat trial and a human trial, Ashare and Schmidt studied the effects of two acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, or AChEIs, called galantamine and donepezil on overall nicotine intake. The rat component showed that pretreating the rodents with an AChEI decreased their nicotine consumption. Consistent with these effects, clinical trial participants taking the AChEI, not the placebo, smoked 2.3 fewer cigarettes daily, a 12 percent decrease, and noted feeling less satisfied with the cigarettes they did smoke.\n\n\"We're very interested in screening potential efficacy of anti-addiction medications in our models,\" said Schmidt, a professor in Penn's School of Nursing and Perelman School of Medicine. \"For this study, we looked at potential smoking-cessation medications.\"\n\nThe research itself took a translational approach, what Ashare, a professor in Penn Medicine's psychiatry department, calls bi-directional. In other words, the preclinical data informed the clinical study and vice versa.\n\nAt Penn's Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Nicotine Addiction, work on smoking cessation has been ongoing since 2001. Specifically, research from Caryn Lerman, CIRNA's director and the Mary W. Calkins Professor in Psychiatry, concluded that people who quit smoking often report a decrease in what's commonly called their executive functions.\n\n\"They feel fuzzy. They're forgetful,\" Ashare said. \"Those deficits are related to their ability to quit smoking. It was this clinical aspect of smoking cessation we thought would be useful to take further.\"\n\nThat's when they turned to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.\n\nIn the brain, the neurotransmitter called acetylcholine is important to cognitive functions like learning and short-term memory. When nicotine enters the body, it binds to the same receptors in the brain that acetylcholine binds to, resulting in smoking's rewarding and reinforcement effects. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors increase acetylcholine levels in the brain and, in effect, substitute nicotine's effects.\n\nSchmidt had successfully employed such a model with other addictive substances like cocaine. He divided a group of rats into galantamine and donepezil cohorts. To mirror voluntary drug taking in humans, the rats self-administered nicotine using a lever pushed at will. Once nicotine-taking stabilized, the rats were pretreated with one of the two AChEIs.\n\nFor both drugs, \"we were able to show a reduction in total nicotine self-administered,\" Schmidt said; however, there was a caveat.\n\n\"We know from the literature that upward of 30 percent of patients will report nausea and vomiting [when taking these drugs], and this will limit their compliance,\" he said. \"We had seen that these drugs reduced nicotine self-administration, but we wanted to make sure it wasn't because the rats were sick.\"\n\nUnlike humans who can verbally report when they don't feel well and whose bodies react to nausea, rats lack the reflex to vomit. In previous research, Matthew Hayes, who has appointments in Penn Medicine and Penn Nursing, had shown that in rats kaolin clay consumption coats the stomach like an antacid and quells any ill effects. Collaborating with Hayes, Schmidt offered the animals kaolin clay, then compared how much they ate normally and with the addition of the AChEIs.\n\n\"At the doses shown to reduce nicotine self-administration, the AChEIs did not make our animals sick,\" Schmidt said. The findings sparked the CIRNA clinical trial, which has to date studied 33 smokers ages 18 to 60.\n\nPeople who were interested in quitting smoking signed on for 23 days. For the first two weeks, they continued to smoke but also took either galantamine or a placebo. Before the trial began, researchers assessed the smokers' cognitive function to get a baseline. Participants followed the regimen for two weeks and then were asked to not smoke for one full day. Two more assessments took place: after the two weeks on the cigarette-drug combination and again after that initial smoke-free day. Finally, the researchers asked the study subjects to do their best to not smoke for seven straight days, a time during which the participants still took either galantamine or a placebo.\n\n\"That week-long period is a proxy for longer-term cessation. The ability to quit smoking the first week after you make a quit attempt is highly predictive of long-term success,\" Ashare said.\n\nShe's still actively recruiting for the trial, with an aim of 80 people total. Once the trial reaches that number, she'll dig into overall quit data. What she's learned so far -- that smokers who used the FDA-approved galantamine smoked fewer cigarettes per day and enjoyed them less -- is promising, particularly given that those who don't smoke during that first crucial week are 32 times more likely to quit smoking permanently.\n\n\"Our goal in investigating these different repurposed medications is not to replace the medications that are already available,\" she said. \"We know that they're effective.

In addition, the mammoth, U.S.-government funded Women's Health Initiative (WHI) earlier found no negative link between calcium and heart health.\n\nBut, as the current authors point out, more than half of the women in that study were already taking their own calcium supplements on top of what they had been prescribed for the trial, which may have clouded the results.\n\nFor this analysis, the authors looked only at the 16,718 women in the WHI who had not been taking personal calcium supplements before entering the trial.\n\nIn this case, women who were randomized to take calcium and vitamin D as part of the study protocol had a modest 13 to 22 percent increased risk of cardiovascular problems, particularly heart attacks. Women in the control arm had no change in risk.\n\nThe case against calcium became stronger when researchers added in data from 13 other, unpublished trials involving almost 30,000 women. Now the increased risk for heart attack was 25 to 30 percent and, for a stroke, 15 to 20 percent.\n\nWhile the authors speculate that an increased risk could be biologically plausible given that calcium is connected with hardening of the arteries, another expert thinks not.\n\nWhile calcium does tend to be a marker of inflammation, explained Dr. Philip Houck, assistant professor of internal medicine at Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine, \"lesions with calcium are actually more stable so there's less of a chance of having a heart attack than in vessels that are less calcified.\"\n\nMoreover, the results may have been statistically significant but that doesn't mean they're clinically significant, he added. \"If women have good reason to take calcium because their bones are thin, then they should not be afraid of taking the calcium,\" said Houck, who is also a cardiologist with Scott & White in Temple, Texas.\n\nDr. Susan V. Bukata, associate professor of orthopaedic surgery at the University of Rochester Medical Center, said that the study really doesn't provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion.\n\nNevertheless, accumulating evidence has her urging patients to get their calcium from their diet, rather than reflexively telling them to take 1,200 milligrams of calcium a day. \"With diet plus a supplement combined, women should be getting 1,000- to 1,500-milligrams a day,\" she said.\n\nAnd in an accompanying journal editorial, medical professors Dr. Bo Abrahamsen and Dr. Opinder Sahota wrote that due to study limitations, \"it is not possible to provide reassurance that calcium supplements given with vitamin D do not cause adverse cardiovascular events or to link them with certainty to increased cardiovascular risk.

The study was supported by the National Institute on Aging and the Judith Zwartz Foundation.\n\nThe age-related memory loss and thinking problems of participants in the study who reported eating seafood less than once a week declined more rapidly compared to those who ate at least one seafood meal per week.\n\n\"This study helps show that while cognitive abilities naturally decline as part of the normal aging process, there is something that we can do to mitigate this process,\" says Martha Clare Morris, ScD, a Rush nutritional epidemiologist and senior author of the paper.\n\nFour types of seafood, five types of brain function\n\nThe researchers followed 915 people with a mean age of 81.4 years for an average of five years. At study enrollment, none had signs of dementia. The participants were recruited from people already taking part in the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a study of residents of more than 40 retirement communities and senior public housing units across northern Illinois, plus older adults identified through church groups and social service agencies.\n\nDuring the course of the study, each person received annual, standardized testing for cognitive ability in five areas -- episodic memory, working memory, semantic memory, visuospatial ability and perceptual speed. The study group also completed annual food frequency questionnaires, allowing the researchers to compare participants' reported seafood intake with changes in their cognitive abilities as measured by the tests.\n\nThe questionnaires included four types of seafood: tuna sandwiches; fish sticks, fish cakes and fish sandwiches; fresh fish as a main dish; and shrimp, lobster and crab. The participants were divided into two groups: those who ate at least one of those seafood meals per week and those who ate less than one of those seafood meals per week.\n\nParticipants in the higher seafood consumption group ate an average of two seafood meals per week. Those in the lower group ate an average of 0.5 meals per week.\n\nSeafood is the direct nutrient source of a type of omega-3 fatty acid (docosahexaenoic acid) that is the main structural component of the brain. While epidemiologic studies have shown the importance of seafood and omega-3 fatty acids in preventing dementia, few prior studies have examined their associations with specific types of cognitive ability.\n\nIn the new Neurology article, the researchers report associations between seafood consumption and two of the areas of cognitive ability that they tested. People who ate more seafood had reduced rates of decline in the semantic memory, which is memory of verbal information. They also had slower rates of decline in a test of perceptual speed, or the ability to quickly compare letters, objects and patterns.\n\nThe study did not find a significant difference in the rate of decline in episodic memory (recollection of personal experiences), working memory (short-term memory used in mental function in the immediate present) and visuospatial ability (comprehension of relationships between objects).\n\nThe results were the same after researchers adjusted for other factors that could affect memory and thinking skills, such as education, physical activity, smoking and participating in mentally stimulating activities.\n\nFurther, the protective association of seafood was even stronger among individuals with a common genotype (APOE-\u03b54) that increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The APOE is a gene involved in cholesterol transport to neurons. About 20 percent of the population carries the APOE-\u03b54 gene, although not everyone who has the gene will develop Alzheimer's disease.", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Cost isn\u2019t discussed.

What\u2019s more, since the story discusses seafood primarily as a vehicle for omega-3 fatty acids, cost becomes even more of an issue.

Other laboratory rats from the same age group were assigned to receive placebo treatment, saline injections instead of stem cells. Both groups of aged rats were compared to a group of young rats with an average age of 4 months.\n\nBaseline heart function was measured in all rats, using echocardiograms, treadmill stress tests and blood analysis. The group of older rats underwent an additional round of testing one month after receiving cardiosphere-derived cells that came from young rats.\n\n\"The way the cells work to reverse aging is fascinating,\" Marb\u00e1n said. \"They secrete tiny vesicles that are chock-full of signaling molecules such as RNA and proteins.

The team is studying the use of stem cells to treat patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy as well as patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, a condition that affects more than 50 percent of all heart failure patients.\n\nGeneral support for Marb\u00e1n's laboratory is provided by the National Institutes of Health. The CDCs, manufactured by Capricor Inc. (NASDAQ: CAPR) as their product CAP-1002, have been used in other human clinical trials.\n\nThe process to grow cardiac-derived stem cells was developed by Marb\u00e1n when he was on the faculty of Johns Hopkins University and further developed at Cedars-Sinai. Capricor has licensed the process from Johns Hopkins and from Cedars-Sinai for clinical and commercial development. Capricor has licensed additional intellectual property from Cedars-Sinai and the University of Rome.

Even a baby aspirin might be enough.\n\nDon't start popping aspirin every morning to fight tumors without talking to your doctor, though.\n\nYes, scientists have already published strong evidence suggesting aspirin can cut bowel cancer and deaths. The painkiller's anti-inflammatory properties and effects in damping down precancerous polyps may be involved.\n\nAnd the latest study, published in The Lancet, suggests aspirin could provide protection against a wide variety of tumors. They range from pancreatic cancer to the type of lung cancer that strikes nonsmokers.\n\nFor some of these cancers, the reduction in death was remarkable. Twenty years after people had started taking aspirin regularly (and kept it up for at least five years), their deaths from esophageal cancer were reduced by 60 percent compared to study subjects who got a placebo.\n\nDeaths from adenomatous lung cancer were cut 30 percent, those from colorectal cancer 40 percent, and those from prostate cancer 10 percent.\n\nStill, none of the big guns in cancer and prevention -- the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, or the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force -- are ready to advise healthy people to start taking aspirin to prevent cancer.\n\nBut the latest batch of evidence deserves a closer look. It encompasses eight earlier studies that compared cancer deaths among more than 25,000 people randomly assigned to get aspirin (of different doses) or placebo. And the researchers were able to gather more information about cancer deaths for up to 20 years after those studies ended about nearly 13,000 people.\n\nFor cancer prevention experts, the British study is provocative and significant. \"This is definitely the first time that research has shown that long-term aspirin use can reduce the risk of deaths due to cancer,\" Dr. Asad Umar of the National Cancer Institute's division of cancer prevention tells Shots.\n\nIn fact, Umar says, no drug has been shown before now to prevent cancer deaths. \"This is definitely hypothesis-generating for future studies,\" Umar says.\n\nMassachusetts General Hospital's Dr. Andrew Chan, who studies the effect of aspirin on gastrointestinal cancers, says the new study will feed a growing sense among experts \"that there is likely some potential anticancer effect of aspirin.\"\n\nDr. Peter Rothwell, an Oxford University neurologist who led the study, tells Shots that aspirin's effect on cancer is \"quite a lot bigger\" than its benefit in preventing heart attacks and strokes -- the reason millions of Americans already swallow a baby aspirin every day.\n\n\"So I think in the fullness of time, preventing cancer will be seen to be the main reason for taking aspirin in healthy individuals,\" Rothwell says.\n\nHe started taking a daily dose of aspirin a couple of years ago as the results of his study emerged. \"It was looking as though there was something going on, and I thought it was a sufficiently large benefit to be worth doing something about,\" says the 46-year-old researcher.\n\nRothwell says the \"sensible time\" to start taking aspirin \"would be before the risk of cancer starts to rise, at about 45.\" He says prophylactic aspirin is \"worth thinking about\" for people with a family history of early cancers.\n\nBut aspirin carries risks. The biggest is stomach bleeding, although it also raises the risk of brain hemorrhage. Daily aspirin doubles a person's gastrointestinal bleeding risk to about 2 in every 1,000 people a year. But Rothwell says this bleeding hazard is \"drowned out\" by the cancer benefit.\n\nProf. Peter Elwood of the University of Cardiff, who wasn't involved in the new study, agrees. \"There's a small risk of any of us having a gastric bleed,\" Ellwood said at a Lancet press conference Monday. \"But when you inspect the data\u2026you find that the mortality from the bleed is not increased. In other words, aspirin seems to be increasing the less-serious bleeds,\" he said.\n\nTo be sure, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force's currently recommends against taking aspirin to prevent colorectal cancer, the type of cancer for which there is the largest body of scientific work. The benefits of daily low-dose aspirin can exceed the risks for many middle-aged and older people when it comes to preventing heart attacks and strokes, the task force says.\n\nSo for those already taking prophylactic aspirin for this reason, the possible anticancer effects are just icing on the cake. Other healthy people interested in taking aspirin to prevent cancer should consult their doctors, experts say, and possibly await further evidence.\n\nA final word about dose: The new study didn't find any additional anticancer benefit for aspirin doses above 75 milligrams a day -- the British dose for a \"baby\" aspirin. In the United States, a baby aspirin weighs in at 81 milligrams. However, experts say more information is needed on the optimum dose for cancer prevention.\n\n\"There's a little controversy about whether a baby aspirin dose is enough,\" says Harvard's Chan. \"We think that probably a standard adult aspirin dose of 325 milligrams is more likely to be effective.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "This story does not discuss the cost of daily aspirin intake. Because the cost to individuals is low and well-known, we won\u2019t insist on this point. Nevertheless, were a recommendation made for everyone to begin taking aspirin daily starting at age 45 the national price tag would be substantial. Readers would also benefit from an acknowledgement that such a recommendation would lead to higher spending on treatment of bleeding ulcers and other adverse events that would offset some of the potential cancer-related savings.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "A new paper in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute finds that testing for cervical cancer using HPV testing in addition to the Pap smear is unlikely to detect cancer cases that wouldn't be found using HPV testing alone.\n\nThe main goal of cervical screening programs is to detect and treat precancer before cancer develops. Cytology-based screening, known as the Pap test or Pap smear, is used to detect abnormal cells. The Pap test can also find noncancerous conditions, such as infections and inflammation.\n\nCervical cancer screening guidelines have changed dramatically over the last 15 years, following introduction of testing for the dozen high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types that cause virtually all cervical cancer and its precursors. Despite more research into HPV, and the introduction of preventive HPV vaccines, screening will remain important and comprise many millions of tests annually for decades to come. But improved screening methods have also introduced some confusion, even controversy.\n\nHPV testing is more sensitive than the Pap test for detecting precancer. The HPV test captures the known cancer causing viruses, but there are gynecologists who believe that there may be unknown cancer causing viruses and so continue to do the Pap smear (plus HPV testing).\n\nHowever, reports of rare HPV-negative, Pap-test-positive cancers are motivating continued use of both tests (cotesting) despite increased testing costs. An HPV test, in which doctors test a cervicovaginal specimen for the presence of the nucleic acids of carcinogenic types of HPV, is more sensitive than the Pap test (a microscopic examination of exfoliated cells) for detection of precancers. Thus, if a single screening method were chosen to complement HPV vaccination, primary HPV testing likely would gradually supplant the Pap test.\n\nIn the US, an interim guidance issued by a committee of experts from several clinical societies recommended primary HPV testing every three years, the same as the Pap test. Alternatively, current guidelines recommend cotesting but, in recognition of the additional reassurance provided by this approach compared with the Pap test alone, the screening interval is extended to every five years. Draft guidelines from the US Preventive Services Task Force recently recommended either primary HPV testing every five years or the Pap test every three years for women 30 to 64, and did not recommend cotesting.\n\nThe accumulated evidence supports inclusion of HPV testing in screening; thus, the main choice moving forward is between cotesting and primary HPV testing alone.\n\nResearchers were searching for realistic performance data to quantify the additional benefit of the Pap test component of cotesting, as the costs of intensive screening of all women using two screening tests are substantial.\n\nIn January 2003, just prior to US FDA approval of HPV and Pap test cotesting in mid-2003 and interim guidelines in 2004, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large integrated health care organization, introduced three-year cotesting in women aged 30 years and older. Kaiser Permanente has now screened over a million women by cotesting. This remains the most extensive experience of HPV testing incorporated into routine screening in the world.\n\nResearchers here quantified the detection of cervical precancer and cancer by cotesting compared with HPV testing alone at Kaiser Permanente, where 1,208,710 women have undergone triennial cervical cotesting since 2003. Screening histories preceding cervical cancers (n=623) and precancers (n=5,369) were examined to assess the relative contribution of the Pap test and HPV test components in identifying cases.\n\nThe analysis found that HPV testing identified more women subsequently diagnosed with cancer and precancer than the Pap test. HPV testing was statistically significantly more likely to be positive for cancer at any time point, except within 12 months. HPV-negative/ Pap test-positive results preceded only small fractions of cases of precancer (3.5%) and cancer (5.9%); these cancers were more likely to be regional or distant stage than other cases.\n\nGiven the rarity of cancers among screened women, the contribution of the Pap test to screening translated to earlier detection of at most five cases per million women per year. Two-thirds (67.9%) of women found to have cancer up to 10 years of follow-up at Kaiser Permanente were detected by the first cotest performed.\n\nThe researchers conclude that the added sensitivity of cotesting versus HPV alone for detection of treatable cancer affected extremely few women.?\n\nThe paper \"Relative Performance of HPV and Cytology Components of Cotesting in Cervical Screening\" is available at: https:/\n\nTo request a copy of the study, please contact: Daniel Luzer\n\n daniel.luzer@oup.com", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The release includes the idea of costs, but without using any numbers.

HER2 has been established as a therapeutic target in breast cancer, and breast cancers in which the HER2 gene is not amplified do not, in general, respond to HER2-directed therapeutic approaches.\n\nA few years ago, when the research teams of Dr. Matthew Ellis and others carried out a molecular characterization of breast cancer tumors, they found a new mutation in HER2 that was different from gene amplification but also resulted in tyrosine kinase being constantly activated.\n\n\"In this particular activation mechanism, the cells develop a subtle mutation within the functional part of the HER2 gene that activates the enzyme,\" said Ellis, professor and director of the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center, part of the National Cancer Institute-designated Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center at Baylor College of Medicine. \"The mutation locks the enzyme into an 'on' position.\"\n\nEllis and his colleagues developed a preclinical model to study this new HER2 mutation and discovered that the enhanced enzymatic activity could trigger tumor formation. Furthermore, these tumor cells were sensitive to an experimental drug, neratinib. With this information in hand, the researchers took the next step.\n\n\"We launched a phase II clinical trial of neratinib in patients with metastatic breast cancer carrying a HER2 mutation,\" Ellis said. \"Finding patients that are positive for a HER2 mutation required a national collaboration because we had to screen hundreds of patients to identify the 2 to 3 percent that have a tumor driven by a HER2 mutation. The results of the clinical trial were encouraging in that about 30 percent of the 16 patients treated with neratinib had a meaningful clinical response showing significant disease stabilization or regression. Neratinib was well tolerated by most patients.\"\n\n\"This is the first time we had a reasonable number of patients treated for HER2 mutations in whom we could estimate the response rate.\"\n\nThe number of patients who could potentially benefit from this new treatment approach is estimated to be in the thousands. The researchers estimate that as many as 200,000 patients are likely to be living with metastatic breast cancer today in the United States. Based on the estimate that the new mutation is present in 2 to 3 percent of cases, the researchers calculated that approximately 4,000 to 6,000 patients with metastatic breast cancer carry a HER2 mutation and are therefore potential candidates for neratinib treatment.\n\nTo identify the patients in this study who carried the new HER2 mutation, the researchers required tissue from the tumor, a biopsy, from which they could extract and sequence the genetic material to determine the presence of the HER2 mutation. This task turned out to be a major challenge because for 20 to 30 percent of the patients the researchers did not have sufficient material to make the diagnosis.\n\n\"To assist in our ability to identify patients with HER2 mutation-positive tumors, we conducted circulating tumor DNA analysis,\" Ellis said. \"The tumor's DNA is released into the human bloodstream, and we were able to determine the presence of the mutation in blood samples from the patients. Importantly the circulating tumor DNA results were highly concordant with the tumor sequencing results, and they were much easier to determine. Notably, the blood test was sensitive enough that we could use it as a tool to determine eligibility for the clinical trial.\"\n\nIn addition to bringing to the table a novel treatment for metastatic breast cancer carrying a HER2 mutation, the researchers have tested the value of the circulating tumor DNA as a disease-monitoring marker.\n\n\"A circulating tumor DNA-based blood test also could therefore be potentially used to monitor tumor progression and to determine whether patients are responding or not to treatment after just one month of therapy,\" Ellis said.\n\nEllis also is a McNair Scholar at Baylor.\n\nRead all the details of this study, the full list of contributors and their financial support in Clinical Cancer Research.", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "There was no mention of cost in this release.

They found that the two groups had widespread differences in terms of brain connectivity.\n\nEEG revealed that the children with autism had a reduced short range connectivity, indicating poor function of local brain networks. This was especially true in the left hemisphere regions of the brain responsible for language.\n\nThe children with autism also had increased connectivity between brain regions that were farther apart, which might be a mechanism developed to compensate for reduced short range connectivity, the researchers said.\n\nThe research was conducted at Boston Children's Hospital and was published online June 25 in the journal BMC Medicine.\n\nThe use of EEG-based testing may help diagnose autism in children and may improve early detection in infants, leading to more effective treatments and coping strategies, the researchers said.\n\n\"What was unique about this study is the very large number of children studied,\" Dawson noted. \"Consistent with many previous studies using EEG and functional MRI with both children and adults with autism, these investigators found that, overall, children with autism show reduced coordination (coherence) across brain regions.\"\n\nShe said the findings are important because, \"they help us understand why individuals with autism have difficulty with complex behaviors, such as social interaction and language. As children's brains develop, the different brain regions become increasingly connected, allowing for the acquisition of complex behaviors that require coordination across different brain regions.\"\n\nLanguage, for example, requires coordination across the auditory, visual, and motor brain regions, as well as the participation of the prefrontal cortex, she said.\n\n\"This reduced functional connectivity in the brain helps us understand impairments associated with autism,\" she added. \"The hope is that early behavioral intervention can help mitigate these functional impairments, helping to form the connections that natural develop in typical children.\"\n\n\"Although autism is still principally a clinical diagnosis, this study ... may allow for a new approach to classifying children with autism and may even assist in the early identification of affected children at a younger age,\" said Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven & Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York in New Hyde Park, NY.\n\nThe number of children diagnosed with autism in the United States has recently increased to one in 88.\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more about autism.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "There is no discussion of costs in the study, even though EEGs have been in use for more than 60 years.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Dec. 13, 2010 -- Acupuncture treatments to treat one type of lazy eye proved as good as the traditional patching of the eye used to help the eyes work together, according to a new study. ''Acupuncture could potentially become an alternative treatment to occlusion [patching] therapy for ambylopia [lazy eye], the researchers write. The study, conducted in China, is published in the Archives of Ophthalmology. U.S. experts familiar with the study call it interesting but say the treatment needs more study and wonder if it would catch on in the U.S.\n\nWhile some previous research has found acupuncture for lazy eye effective, the researchers couldn't find a study that directly compared acupuncture with conventional treatments such as patching. So Dennis Lam, MD, a researcher at the Joint Shantou International Eye Center of Shantou University and Chinese University of Hong Kong, and his colleagues evaluated 88 children, ages 7 to 12, with the condition known as anisometropic amblyopia, in which there is a difference in the degree of nearsightedness or farsightedness between the two eyes. They assigned 43 children to the acupuncture group, and they received five treatments a week. Acupuncturists used five different points in the head, face, hand, and leg. The children were instructed to do an hour per day of near-vision activities such as homework or computer work. Another 45 children wore a patch over their normal eye for two hours daily, a typical regimen, and were also asked to do an hour of near-vision activity a day.\n\nAt 15 weeks, visual acuity with eyeglasses improved by about 1.8 lines on the vision chart in the patched eyes and 2.3 lines in those who had acupuncture. An improvement of two lines or more occurred in nearly 67% of those in the patching group but nearly 76% of those in the acupuncture group.

A larger part is at this point, we just don't fully understand what the genetic mechanism that leads to autism is.\"\n\nStandard practice is to offer children with autism two tests as a first-line genetic work-up: karyotype and fragile X testing, the researchers said.\n\nIn karyotyping, forms of which have been around since the 1960s, geneticists use a microscope to look for chromosomal abnormalities that are associated with autism, explained Dr. David Miller, a clinical geneticist and assistant director of the Genetics Diagnostic Laboratory at Children's Hospital Boston, which conducted the new research along with Boston's Autism Consortium.\n\nLike karyotyping, CMA also looks for chromosomal abnormalities, but does so at 100 times the resolution of the earlier test, Miller said. CMA, a genome-wide test, can identify sub-microscopic deletions of duplications of DNA sequences, called copy-number variants, known to be associated with autism, he said.\n\n\"Think of chromosomes as a library full of books and each book as a gene,\" Miller said. \"What we look for are shelves of books that have gone missing, which represent a missing fragment of a chromosome, or extra fragments of chromosome, that could contain genes related to autism.\"\n\nWhile both Children's Hospital Boston and Montefiore have offered CMA testing for several years, not all hospitals do, nor does all insurance pay for it, the researchers noted.\n\nThe main purpose of genetic testing of children with autism is to help parents determine if they're at a higher risk of having another child with autism, Marion said.\n\nIf tests pinpoint an autism-related chromosomal abnormality in the child, the parents are then offered testing. If a parent is also found to have the abnormality, geneticists conclude that the couple is at higher risk of having a child with autism. (The precise risk depends on what the variant is.)\n\nBut if the parents don't have the abnormality, geneticists conclude that the deletion or duplication happened by chance, and the parents are probably not at any greater risk of having another child with autism than the general population, Marion said.\n\nStill, there is much geneticists can't tell parents. Between 10 percent and 15 percent of autism cases can be traced to a known genetic cause, the researchers noted. Of that, CMA alone can detect 7 percent of those.\n\nThere are a few other genetic tests that can explain another few percentage points of autism cases.\n\nBut that leaves 85 percent or more families with little explanation for the disorder, Marion said.\n\n\"CMA is better, but it's not great,\" Marion said. \"The vast majority of children who have autism have no identifiable genetic markers that will help in genetic counseling for future pregnancies. That is very frustrating.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more on autism.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story did not mention specific costs of the CMA test; however, it did indicate that not all insurance will cover this test.

Consuming even trace amounts of a food allergen can cause a reaction. About 15 million Americans have food allergies, including 1 in 13 children, according to the Food Allergy Research and Education (FARE) group. Eight foods account for 90 percent of all reactions: milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, wheat, fish and shellfish.\n\nUnlabeled allergens are a leading cause of food recalls in the U.S. and the number of food allergy-related visits to hospitals are on the rise, according to the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe FDA recently warned people with peanut allergies to avoid foods containing ground cumin, after traces of peanut powder were found in the ground spice.\n\nIn the skin patch trial, the international team of researchers randomly assigned 221 volunteers, ages 6 to 55, to wear a placebo patch or a patch containing peanut protein at one of three doses: 50 micrograms, 100 micrograms or 250 micrograms.\n\nAt the end of a year, 50 percent of those wearing the high-dose 250 microgram patch were able to tolerate consuming at least one gram of peanut protein. The same dose worked for nearly 54 percent of kids, 6 to 11.\n\nThe skin patch \u2014 intended to desensitize patients to peanuts by exposing them to tiny amounts of the allergen \u2014 may be particularly appealing to children who are too frightened to try oral or under-the-tongue therapy.\n\n\u201cMany have been told all their lives that if they ingest peanuts they will have a severe reaction and die,\" he said. \"So it\u2019s tough to get them to take it.

Just two dropped out because of flare-ups of eczema.\n\n\u201cThe goal for most practicing allergists and for most parents is to get a child to the point where if there is an accidental ingestion of peanut it would not be as risky or life-threatening,\u201d said Dr. Amy Stallings, an assistant professor of pediatrics in the division of allergy and immunology at the Duke University Medical Center who is not affiliated with the new study. \u201cAnd the patch may be a way of doing this that is safer.\u201d\n\nThe patch study's results are promising, although researchers need to continue following the participants for another year, Sampson said. It could be several more years before the patch will be available for consumers.\n\nResearchers are trying to discover why food allergies have increased among children \u2014 the number of kids living with peanut or tree nut allergies tripled between 1997 and 2008, studies show \u2014 but there\u2019s no clear answer.

Surgery, radiation, or some combination of both may lead to miserable side effects such incontinence, impotence and rectal damage. Doctors usually can\u2019t predict whether a man will suffer all or none of those side effects. While some risk factors are well-known -- including age, diabetes and poor cardiovascular health -- whether a man suffers harsh side-effects is often chalked up to random luck.\n\nSo what if it were possible to know before treatment which men might be more likely to suffer complications?\n\nNew research, published Thursday in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology, discovered a set of genetic markers that appear to indicate a significantly greater risk of collateral damage from radiation treatment for prostate cancer. Knowing a man\u2019s susceptibility to fallout from radiation may steer a doctor toward surgery instead of other potentially damaging therapy.\n\n\u201cMore often than not, it\u2019s not clear-cut which way to go,\u201d explained Barry Rosenstein, professor of radiation oncology at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. \u201cIf you see a surgeon, he\u2019s likely to say surgery is best. If you see a radiation oncologist he\u2019ll say oncology.\u201d\n\nDetermining what type of treatment a man should receive is only part of the dilemma of prostate cancer. The debate whether to even test for it is ongoing. This early-stage study represents a big step toward doctors and their patients making that decision.\n\nThe researchers started with a pool of 841 men treated with radiation for prostate cancer. Patients were assessed every three to six months for signs of sexual dysfunction for up to five years. The number of men studied was eventually winnowed down to 260 patients with erectile dysfunction and 205 controls.\n\nThe scientists then performed DNA analyses on the men, looking for genetic variations called single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs (pronounced snips), slight differences in the \u201cspelling\u201d of our DNA. After sifting through hundreds of thousands of SNPs, they settled on 12 suspect genetic variations.\n\nIt turned out that when the SNPs were combined to create a score that could be used to measure individual risk of treatment complications, having just one of the 12 SNPs more than doubled the risk. The more of the 12 a man had, the greater his chances of radiation therapy complications.\n\n\u201cIt is cumulative,\u201d Rosenstein explained. \u201cIf a man has five or six, it increases his chances quite a bit.\u201d\n\nThe research is still in the early stages, so doctors aren\u2019t likely to be using the genetic markers to determine treatment any time soon. \u201cThis is still not nearly good enough, yet\u201d he said.\n\nBut he\u2019s part of an international consortium that is trying to make that very scenario a practical reality. The next step, he said, is for group members to validate the predictive power of the markers his team found.\n\nIf they can, then doctors really will be \u201cable to assign patients to treatments and see if we maintain the same level of control of cancer and lower the incidence of complications,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if we can do that, then there\u2019ll be enough confidence to put it into use in the clinic.\u201d\n\nEven better, he suggested, it may one day be possible to use drugs to target the SNiPs, or the biological processes they influence, as a way to prevent damage from therapy.\n\nThat hope is evident to other researchers, such as Dr. Ithaar Derweesh, a urologic oncologist and associate professor of surgery at the University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center.\n\n\"This is a study that in certain ways is groundbreaking and also elegantly performed,\" Derweesh said.\n\nWhile Derweesh agreed with Rosenstein that such a technique will take time to validate, and be used to steer patients toward a particular therapy -- something he called the \"holy grail\" -- he suggested that in the nearer term, such markers might be used as a trigger to pre-emptively begin erectile rehabilitation or to take measures that might lessen the potential damage.\n\nThis kind of work is important not just for prostate cancer, but all cancers. While there has been greater success in treating cancer, survivors may live many years with side effects after treatment. If Rosenstein\u2019s hopes are fulfilled, it may one day be possible to prevent some of the damage before it\u2019s done, and still effectively treat the cancer.\n\nBrian Alexander (www.BrianRAlexander.com) is co-author, with Larry Young Ph.D., of \"The Chemistry Between Us: Love, Sex and the Science of Attraction,\" (www.TheChemistryBetweenUs.com), now on sale.\n\u2022 Pregnant women with cancer on the rise.

Lomaira should be used together with regular exercise and a reduced-calorie diet.\n\nLomaira is the only strength of phentermine hydrochloride that can be taken up to three times a day before meals. The limited usefulness of agents of this drug class (anorectics), including Lomaira, should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use.\n\n\"At KVK Tech, we are committed to developing high-quality, FDA-approved medicines that address unmet medical needs, while ensuring affordable options for all appropriate patients. With Lomaira, we're giving physicians and patients access to a low-cost, low-dose version of a weight-reduction medicine, phentermine, that has been prescribed by physicians for over 50 years. Appropriate patients can take Lomaira up to three times a day, before meals \u2013 not just in the morning as with the higher dose formulations of phentermine,\" said Anthony Tabasso, President and Chief Executive Officer of KVK Tech. \"We developed Lomaira with this dosing flexibility and affordability in mind.\"\n\nPhentermine hydrochloride, an appetite suppressant, is the most commonly prescribed drug for weight loss. Over 7 million prescriptions are written for phentermine yearly by a wide range of healthcare professionals (HCPs), including obesity medicine specialists, family practitioners, endocrinologists, internists and cardiologists. 1\n\nPhentermine hydrochloride is typically prescribed in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg and taken before or within a few hours of breakfast. The usual adult dose of Lomaira is one tablet three times a day 1/2 hour before meals. The butterfly-shaped tablet is scored to facilitate administering one half of the usual dosage for patients not requiring the full dose, enabling doctors and patients to work together to customize a weight-loss treatment plan to best meet each patient's needs. Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. Phentermine is not recommended for use in pediatric patients 16 years of age or younger. Late evening medication should be avoided because of the possibility of resulting insomnia.\n\nLomaira is reasonably priced to ensure that cost does not create a hurdle, despite the fact that two-thirds of Americans pay out-of-pocket for their weight-loss prescription medications. Through KVK Tech's , eligible patients will pay no more than 50\u00a2 per tablet for the duration of treatment.\n\n\"Obesity is a chronic metabolic disease that must be managed appropriately to reduce the risk of serious health conditions. Many physicians have used phentermine to help patients as part of a comprehensive weight-management plan. Now, the flexibility in dosing with Lomaira allows doctors to personalize dosing. They can prescribe a lower dose, a good option for some patients. They can also prescribe up to three times a day, which is particularly helpful when patients struggle to control their appetite in the afternoon,\" said Donna Ryan, MD. \"Regrettably, many patients are still not covered by insurance for weight-loss medications and the low cost for Lomaira makes it an affordable treatment option.\"\n\nIn relatively short-term clinical trials, adults with obesity who were instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs (appetite suppressants) lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 2\n\n\"Even modest weight loss can dramatically improve risk and health,\" continued Dr. Ryan. \"It is not necessary to lose a lot of weight to get a lot of benefit.\" Losing five to 10 percent of total body weight is likely to produce health benefits, such as improvements in blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood sugars.3\n\nSome side effects of phentermine that have been reported include pulmonary hypertension, valvular heart disease, palpitations, increased heart rate or blood pressure, insomnia, restlessness, dry mouth, diarrhea, constipation and changes in sexual drive. These are not all of the potential side effects of phentermine. See Full Prescribing Information.\n\nLomaira is anticipated to be available by the end of September 2016.

Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH), a rare fatal lung disease, has been reported in patients who had taken a combination of phentermine and fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible association between phentermine use alone and PPH cannot be ruled out. Patients should report immediately if they experience any decrease in the amount of exercise that they can normally tolerate, shortness of breath, chest or heart pain, fainting or swelling in the lower legs.\n\nSerious heart valve problems or disease have been reported in patients taking a combination of phentermine and fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine has not been established, therefore the possibility of an association between heart valve disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out.\n\nIf your body becomes adjusted to the maximum dose of phentermine so that its effects are experienced less strongly, the maximum dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect.\n\nCaution is advised while engaging in potentially hazardous activity such as driving or operating machinery while taking phentermine. Phentermine has the potential to be abused. Keep Lomaira in a safe place to prevent theft, accidental overdose, misuse or abuse. Using alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction.\n\nPhentermine can cause an increase in blood pressure. Tell your doctor if you have high blood pressure, even if it's mild. If you are taking medicines for type 2 diabetes, your doctor may have to adjust these medicines while taking phentermine.\n\nSome side effects of phentermine that have been reported include pulmonary hypertension, valvular heart disease, palpitations, increased heart rate or blood pressure, insomnia, restlessness, dry mouth, diarrhea, constipation and changes in sexual drive.

Older adults with mild cognitive impairment have less severe memory loss than those with Alzheimer's but often go on to develop the disease.\n\nTo assess the impact of fish on cognitive health, the authors focused on 260 mentally healthy elderly individuals drawn from the Cardiovascular Health Study, sponsored by the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.\n\nAll the participants underwent 3-D MRIs, so the researchers could map out the size of each individual's gray matter and track it over 10 years. They also completed the U.S. National Cancer Institute Food Frequency Questionnaire.\n\nThe team then stacked up gray matter changes against dietary consumption as reported in the questionnaire.\n\nThe questionnaires revealed that 163 of the study participants ate fish at least once a week, with most consuming fish between one and four times a week.\n\nWith that information, the authors found that regardless of age, gender, physical activity routines, and/or educational achievement, race or weight, those who ate baked or broiled fish had larger mass in the hippocampus, precuneus, posterior cingulate and orbital frontal cortex regions of their brains.\n\nThe team further observed that people who ate baked or broiled fish weekly displayed better so-called \"working memory,\" enabling them to more effectively execute routine tasks.\n\nBut fish and chips lovers, take note: No cranial benefit was evident with respect to consumption of fried fish.\n\nThe team cautioned that while eating baked and broiled fish appears to exert some cognitive benefit, other lifestyle and socioeconomic factors may play a role.

So in theory, treating them early on might help stave off some the more than 1.2 million heart attacks \u2014 a third of them fatal \u2014 that occur every year in the U.S.\n\nYet there\u2019s no evidence that treating people based on heart scan results does any good, said Dr. John McEvoy, of Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease in Baltimore, who led the new study.\n\nBy contrast, it\u2019s well known that the scans expose patients to a high dose of X-rays, which can increase their likelihood of developing cancer. And the dyes used to enhance the images cause kidney damage in a significant portion of people.\n\n\u201cTesting might lead to more harm than good,\u201d McEvoy told Reuters Health, adding that heart scans may cost $600 or more.\n\nHis team looked at 1,000 Korean patients who chose to get a heart scan as part of a health screening program at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital.\n\nThe researchers compared those patients to closely matched individuals who opted to forgo the scans \u2014 not currently recommended by guidelines \u2014 and just get the standard health checkup.\n\nMore than a fifth of the patients who got scanned had cholesterol buildups in their arteries, also called atherosclerosis.\n\nThree months later, these individuals were using cholesterol-lowering statins 34 percent of the time and blood-thinning aspirin 40 percent of the time. In those who tested negative for atherosclerosis or didn\u2019t get scanned, less than 10 percent used the medications.\n\nPeople who got scans also had more additional tests and major heart procedures.\n\nThe researchers expected that if the extra drugs and procedures were actually helpful, the treated people would have a lower rate of serious heart problems in the future.\n\nBut after another 18 months, there was no such difference.

Both drugs have side effects, notably joint problems and bleeding ulcers.\n\nAlthough the study can\u2019t prove that getting a scan caused the extra medication use, the gap could not be explained by differences in risk factors for heart disease, such as cholesterol levels or smoking.\n\nIn an editorial, Dr. Michael S. Lauer of National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said the new study serves as a reminder of the downsides of screening.\n\n\u201cPhysicians cannot easily ignore diagnoses made with screening tests because it is impossible for them to determine whether their patients have real disease or pseudodisease,\u201d Lauer notes. \u201cTherefore, physicians prescribe tests, medications, procedures, or even surgical procedures, all of which carry inherent risks.\u201d\n\nMcEvoy agrees. \u201cWith these new imaging techniques, we are left with the dilemma of what to do with the results,\u201d he said.\n\nEven when screening helps predict health problems down the road, Lauer adds, that doesn\u2019t mean treatments are necessarily beneficial.\n\n\u201cOverdiagnosis is threatening to become an increasingly important public health problem because of the enthusiasm for and proliferation of unproven screening tests,\u201d Lauer writes.\n\nMcEvoy said there have been several reports of doctors doing CCTA heart scans in healthy patients, although the practice is currently discouraged by the American Heart Association.\n\nAccording to McEvoy, doctors should focus on patients\u2019 lifestyle and traditional risk factors such as smoking and obesity.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/lEEptL and bit.ly/kBzX6J Archives of Internal Medicine, online May 23, 2011.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Costs were reported.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The spread of some sexually transmitted infections could potentially be dramatically reduced by instructing people who have had unprotected sex to take antibiotics within 24 hours after the intercourse, a new study suggests.\n\nBut such a strategy, which was tested in a population of men who had frequent unprotected sex with a number of male sex partners, could spark a controversy over the use of antibiotics and the general threat of growing antibiotic resistance.\n\n\u201cMy message with that study would be that we need to do more research to prevent STIs \u2014 because that\u2019s a concern. And this strategy \u2026 could potentially be used,\u201d said Dr. Jean-Michel Molina, head of infectious diseases at Saint-Louis Hospital in Paris and the lead author of the study.\n\nMolina insisted he would never support long-term use of antibiotics to prevent STIs, but said that the approach might be an effective short-term strategy when paired with other control approaches, like more frequent STI testing among high-risk populations.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want this strategy to be used widely in any person, clearly,\u201d Molina said. \u201cBut if you can select a group with a high incidence rate of syphilis or chlamydia, and you want to try to reduce the rate of syphilis quite quickly in this group of people, you may think that this strategy could be used for a couple of months.\u201d\n\nRates of syphilis in particular have risen steadily in recent years; the rate in 2015-2016 \u2014 8.7 cases per 100,000 people \u2014 was the highest since 1993, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. The rate of infection increased in every age group over the age of 15, in both men and women, and in all ethnic groups.\n\nMolina\u2019s study was recently published by the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was one of its funders.\n\nThe researchers randomly assigned 232 men to one of two groups. One of the groups was given antibiotics \u2014 the drug doxycycline \u2014 to take if they had unprotected sex. They were told to take two pills per encounter, and no more than six in a week, ideally within 24 hours and no later than 72 hours after the intercourse. In reality, the median use among the men was about 6.8 pills per month.\n\nThe men were tested regularly for STIs, and in the nine or so months they were followed, the rates of some sexually transmitted infections fell dramatically in the treatment group. The overall reduction of all STIs was 47 percent, but that average was dragged down by the fact that doxycycline doesn\u2019t cure gonorrhea.\n\nThere was, however, a 70 percent reduction in chlamydia infections and cases of syphilis decreased by 73 percent. The authors noted, however, that the study length was short and they can\u2019t tell if the strategy would work as well over the long term.\n\nThe results can\u2019t be taken in isolation, others experts warned. Using doxycycline this way could drive the bacteria that cause the infections to develop resistance to the drug, warned Dr. Brad Spellberg, an infectious diseases specialist and chief medical officer at the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center in Los Angeles.\n\nSpellberg also said people who used the drug this way would be exposing the bacteria they have in their gastro-intestinal tracts \u2014 their own gut flora \u2014 to regular doses of doxycycline. And those bacteria too could develop resistance to the drug, leading to a host of other health problems.\n\nThe full picture of the knock-on effects of exposing your gut flora to antibiotics is still coming into focus, said Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics, and Policy and a leading voice on the dangers of mounting antibiotic resistance. He noted a recent report in the journal Science revealed that some cancer immunotherapy drugs worked less well in people who had recently taken antibiotics.\n\nMolina noted that antibiotic resistance to doxycycline has not been seen in chlamydia or syphilis, despite the fact that the drug has been used to treat these infections for decades. Still, he said the possibility it could arise cannot be discounted.\n\nA commentary published with the study argued that reducing infection rates in men who have sex with men and who are highly sexually active might lower STI infection rates more generally in a community.\n\nAuthors Christopher Fairley and Eric Chow, of Australia\u2019s Melbourne Sexual Health Center at Monash University, said pressure from patients to be given doxycycline on a preventative basis might be substantial, given that the drug is also prescribed in six-month courses to treat acne. Like Molina and his co-authors, they said STI preventive use at this point is premature.\n\nLaxminarayan did not dismiss the notion of this type of use out of hand, however. \u201cI certainly think that for a small subset of the population, if this helps prevent syphilis, then it certainly is worth exploring further,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he said additional studies should be conducted first to try to get a better picture of the potential consequences of using doxycycline this way, including the risk of resistance developing, the potential that it might further erode condom use, and any other unintended consequences.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not address the cost of preventative use of doxycycline.

Parvalbumin, a protein found in great quantities in several different fish species, has been shown to help prevent the formation of certain protein structures closely associated with Parkinson's disease.\n\nFish has long been considered a healthy food, linked to improved long-term cognitive health, but the reasons for this have been unclear. Omega-3 and -6, fatty acids commonly found in fish, are often assumed to be responsible, and are commonly marketed in this fashion. However, the scientific research regarding this topic has drawn mixed conclusions. Now, new research from Chalmers has shown that the protein parvalbumin, which is very common in many fish species, may be contributing to this effect.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Parkinson's disease is amyloid formation of a particular human protein, called alpha-synuclein. Alpha-synuclein is even sometimes referred to as the 'Parkinson's protein'.\n\nWhat the Chalmers researchers have now discovered, is that parvalbumin can form amyloid structures that bind together with the alpha-synuclein protein. Parvalbumin effectively 'scavenges' the alpha-synuclein proteins, using them for its own purposes, thus preventing them from forming their own potentially harmful amyloids later on.\n\n\"Parvalbumin collects up the 'Parkinson's protein' and actually prevents it from aggregating, simply by aggregating itself first,\" explains Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede, Professor and Head of the Chemical Biology division at Chalmers, and lead author on the study.\n\nWith the parvalbumin protein so highly abundant in certain fish species, increasing the amount of fish in our diet might be a simple way to fight off Parkinson's disease. Herring, cod, carp, and redfish, including sockeye salmon and red snapper, have particularly high levels of parvalbumin, but it is common in many other fish species too. The levels of parvalbumin can also vary greatly throughout the year.\n\n\"Fish is normally a lot more nutritious at the end of the summer, because of increased metabolic activity. Levels of parvalbumin are much higher in fish after they have had a lot of sun, so it could be worthwhile increasing consumption during autumn,\" says Nathalie Scheers, Assistant Professor in the Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, and researcher on the study. It was Nathalie who first had the inspiration to investigate parvalbumin more closely, after a previous study she did looking at biomarkers for fish consumption.\n\nOther neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, ALS and Huntington's disease, are also caused by certain amyloid structures interfering in the brain. The team is therefore keen to research this topic further, to see if the discovery relating to Parkinson's disease could have implications for other neurodegenerative disorders as well. Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede stresses the importance of finding ways to combat these neurological conditions in the future:\n\n\"These diseases come with age, and people are living longer and longer. There's going to be an explosion of these diseases in the future - and the scary part is that we currently have no cures. So we need to follow up on anything that looks promising.\"\n\nA follow up study, looking at parvalbumin from another angle, is indeed planned for this autumn. Nathalie Scheers, together with Professor Ingrid Undeland, also of Chalmers, will investigate parvalbumin from herring, and its transport in human tissues.\n\n\"It will be very interesting to study how parvalbumin distributes within human tissues in more depth. There could be some really exciting results.\"\n\nMore About: Fish and Better Neurological Health\n\nThe link between higher consumption of fish and better long-term health for the brain has been long established. There is correlation between certain diets and decreased rates of Parkinson's disease - as well as other neurodegenerative conditions.\n\n\"Among those who follow a Mediterranean diet, with more fish, one sees lower rates of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's,\" says Tony Werner, a PhD student in the Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, and lead researcher on the study. This has also been observed in Japan, where seafood forms a central part of the diet. The team is careful to note that no definite links can be established at this point, however.\n\nMore About: Amyloids and Aggregation\n\nProteins are long chains of amino acids that fold into specific structures to carry out their function. But sometimes, proteins can fold incorrectly, and get tangled up with other proteins, a process known as aggregation. As these misfolded proteins aggregate together, they create long fibrous structures known as amyloids. Amyloids are not necessarily a bad thing, but can be responsible for various diseases. Some of them can interfere with neurons in the brain, killing those cells, and causing a variety of neurodegenerative conditions.\n\nMore About: The Study\n\nNathalie Scheers had looked at parvalbumin before in another context.\n\n\"I was on a previous study where we looked at possible compliance markers for fish intake. Parvalbumin is a cause of fish allergies, so we knew that it passed over to the blood, and that this form of parvalbumin is specific for fish\"\n\nShe joined forces with Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede, and together they took the idea forward.\n\n\"Because Nathalie had previously shown that parvalbumin passes into the body of the person eating fish, it made sense to study its interaction with human proteins. We already knew that they can meet in the gut, the blood, or the brain,\" explains Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede.", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Affordability of fish varies widely around the world so we can understand not bringing up costs.\nThe intervention advocated is consuming a fish protein called parvalbumin, or PV for short.

But the authors of a new study believe giving it early may slow and even reverse some disease-related disability.\n\n\"The expectation in MS has always been to try to slow down the progression of the disease. Now we can tell our patients that a significant number can actually improve by reversing their disability,\" said lead researcher Dr. Gavin Giovannoni. He is a neurology professor at Queen Mary University of London in England.\n\nThe treatment is not without its downsides, however. Because of the potential for side effects, people who received this treatment have to undergo monthly blood and urine tests for four years after the last dose, Giovannoni said.\n\nGiovannoni described Lemtrada as an immune system \"rebooter.\" First, it depletes the immune system, then it allows it to recover, he explained.\n\nDuring the time when the immune system is depleted, there is a risk of infection over eight to 12 weeks, including herpes infections, he said.\n\nAlso, when the immune system rebuilds itself, \"a significant number of people, about 40 percent, will develop another autoimmune disease,\" Giovannoni said. These include Graves' disease (a thyroid disorder) and a bleeding/bruising disorder called idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), which occurs in about 2 percent of patients, he noted.\n\n\"But these diseases can be treated, so it's not like MS. It's kind of trading in your MS for another autoimmune disease,\" Giovannoni said.\n\nStill, one MS specialist who reviewed the new study said patients need to be cautious about taking the drug.\n\nLemtrada is not for every patient with MS and the decision to use it should be carefully considered, said Dr. Dhanashri Miskin, an attending neurologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\n\"Although the safety profile is generally manageable for the right patient, risks probably outweigh benefits in patients with mild or early stage disease,\" Miskin said.\n\nThe decision to start Lemtrada should be made in the context of the risks, including infusion-associated reactions, infections, and autoimmune adverse events, she said. \"Although alemtuzumab [Lemtrada] treatment is associated with safety risks, those risks are manageable in most patients,\" Miskin said.\n\nThe new trial of more than 600 patients with relapsing-remitting MS was funded by Sanofi Genzyme and Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, the drug's makers.\n\nMS occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the protective sheath around nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. People can suffer muscle weakness, numbness, vision problems and difficulty with balance and coordination. Relapsing-remitting MS is the most common type, with symptoms suddenly worsening and then going into remission.\n\nFor this study, Giovannoni and colleagues treated 628 patients with relapsing-remitting MS who had not responded to at least one other MS drug. Lemtrada was given to 426 patients, while 202 received another drug, interferon beta-1a.\n\nThe researchers assessed disability levels at the start of the study and every three months for two years. By the study's end, nearly 28 percent of those given Lemtrada had improved by at least one point on a 10-point disability test, versus about 15 percent of those receiving interferon, the researchers found.\n\nMoreover, patients receiving Lemtrada were 2.5 times more likely to have their thinking skills improve compared to those given interferon. And they were more than twice as likely to see improvement in their ability to move without tremor or clumsiness, the findings showed.\n\nThe findings held after researchers adjusted the results to make sure the gains weren't led by those recovering from relapses.\n\nGiovannoni believes the drug could offer real relief from MS symptoms. Not only does alemtuzumab improve disability, but most patients go into long-term remission of at least five to eight years, he said.\n\n\"Some patients have been going 12 years without any evidence of disease activity,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Bruce Bebo, executive vice president for research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, \"Restoring lost function is a significant unmet need for people living with MS.\"\n\nThis study examines previous findings related to the reversal of some disability in those receiving alemtuzumab, he said. \"I am encouraged by these results and urge others to pursue potentially restorative approaches to treatment,\" Bebo said.\n\nGiovannoni pointed out that most of the drug's benefits are obtained early in the disease. \"If you really want this drug to have a big impact, you should use it as early as possible.

Research has supported its use to treat stomach problems such as nausea and vomiting; the U.S. National Library of Medicine says it's \"likely safe,\" although some people may develop mild side effects.\n\nPrevious research in animals has suggested that ginger can reduce inflammation but isn't potentially toxic to the stomach like aspirin, Zick noted.

GFAP, which is specific to cells known as astrocytes that form a matrix for nerves in the central nervous system (which includes the brain and spinal cord), peak at 20 hours after the injury and then decline steadily but are still detectable seven days later. UCH-L1 is released by brain nerves when they\u2019re stressed, and its levels rise more rapidly immediately after injury and peak at eight hours.\n\nWhen Papa then looked just at people who showed signs of TBI on CT scans, she found that their levels of GFAP and UCH-L1 were significantly higher than those of people with other types of trauma, suggesting that the two markers can be relatively specific to TBI and not trauma in general.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to do any unnecessary procedures on people who don\u2019t need them,\u201d says Papa of using CT scans to distinguish people with more serious head injuries from those how just have hit their head but don\u2019t experience any symptoms. \u201cI don\u2019t think a blood will be the be-all and end-all but it would be a beautiful tool for us to have in the clinic to support a lot of our decision making.\u201d\n\nTesting for levels of UCH-L1, for example, might be helpful for emergency medical teams in an ambulance trying to assess whether a patient has any serious head injuries, since its levels peak in the hours immediately after a trauma. It might also help coaches or athletic trainers are sports events to determine which athletes who have had a concussion are able to return to the game and which, if they have higher levels of the blood marker, should not.\n\nMORE: A New Blood Test to Diagnose Concussions On The Field\n\nIn the emergency room, a blood test for UCH-L1 could also help doctors decide which patients should get a CT scan \u2014 the higher their levels of the protein are, the more likely they are to have TBI and would benefit from a scan, while those with lower levels probably don\u2019t need one.\n\nAnd because levels of GFAP tend to remain higher for many days, Papa says it might be useful in cases where patients don\u2019t come in immediately after a head injury, thinking they\u2019re okay, but see the doctor several days later because they\u2019re concerned. Even at that point, the study shows, GFAP levels might be higher than normal and therefore might indicate TBI and need for further tests.\n\n\u201cWe may not use these blood tests in a hundred percent of cases but probably in eighty percent of cases where there is a question mark, a blood test could definitely help,\u201d she says.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Costs are not addressed here.

The procedure, often done to relieve chest pain and to reduce the risk of having or dying from a heart attack, has become one of the most common medical procedures in the United States.\n\n\"The data are compelling,\" said William E. Boden of the University of Buffalo School of Medicine, whose findings were published yesterday by the New England Journal of Medicine to coincide with a presentation at a meeting of the American College of Cardiology in New Orleans. \"We do too many of these procedures.\"\n\nSeveral experts said they expect the findings will prompt a major shift in how doctors treat thousands of patients suffering from heart disease -- the nation's leading cause of death.\n\n\"These findings are pretty explosive,\" said Steven E. Nissen, president of the American College of Cardiology. \"I think this is going to shake things up pretty significantly.\"\n\nThe findings underscore the danger of rushing to adopt a procedure before careful studies have been conducted to fully determine its benefits, Boden and others said.\n\n\"There was just this intuitive belief that it would be beneficial,\" Boden said. \"But no one had ever done a proper randomized trial to see whether it actually improved outcomes. In the meantime, a whole industry has been created around this.\"\n\nThe researchers and others stressed that angioplasty clearly benefits patients who are in the throes of a heart attack or are at very high risk for one. But the findings indicate that for a patient whose condition is stable, medical therapy is just as effective at reducing the major risks. Such patients constitute at least one-third of those undergoing the 1.2 million angioplasties performed each year, and perhaps as much as 85 percent.\n\nSome cardiologists who specialize in the procedures, however, argued that the study did not focus on the sickest patients who are most likely to benefit, and that the main purpose of angioplasty in many is to alleviate chest pain, not to prevent heart attacks.\n\n\"I don't think this is going to cause any huge paradigm shift,\" said Gregory J. Dehmer, president of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions. \"This study was limited to a fairly select group of patients with very stable symptoms.\"\n\nBut Boden said that the study did include patients with moderate to severe heart disease and that many such patients undergo the procedure in the belief it will protect them against heart attacks.\n\nIn the procedure, doctors thread a tiny balloon into clogged arteries, inflate the balloon to clear the blockage, and insert a stent -- a tiny wire lattice strut that props the artery open. The procedure costs about $50,000 and is considered safe, though it does carry some risks.\n\nThe findings come on the heels of questions about the safety of new stents coated with drugs to keep arteries from reclosing. Those concerns had led doctors to curtail their use of the newer devices, and the new findings are expected to have a similar effect on angioplasty overall.\n\n\"There was an overexuberance,\" said William O'Neill, a prominent cardiologist at the University of Miami. \"I think we're getting a midcourse correction.\"\n\nThe findings could also help fuel a resurgence of bypass surgery, which has become far less common with the rise of angioplasty.\n\n\"There was this sense that angioplasty would produce the same result as bypass surgery,\" Nissen said. \"I think this will cause a tilt toward more patients with stable conditions choosing medical therapy and more people who have more severe disease getting bypass surgery, which both relieves symptoms and reduces the risk for heart attack and death.\"\n\nThe new study, which was funded mostly by the Department of Veterans Affairs, involved 2,287 patients at 50 centers in the United States and Canada who had chest pain or other symptoms because one or more major arteries supplying blood to the heart had clogged. Half the patients received standard medical treatment involving medication and lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, eating better and exercising. The other half received the same treatment plus angioplasty.\n\nAfter about five years, the number of patients who experienced a heart attack, were hospitalized or died because of their heart problems was virtually identical in the two groups, the researchers found.\n\n\"There was no significant difference,\" Boden said. \"The data are clear.\"\n\nAlthough about one-third of patients who initially got medical treatment later turned to angioplasty, the findings show how much medical treatment of heart disease has improved, Boden said.\n\n\"The paradigm for the last 20 years for patients like this been: 'Mr. Jones, you need a procedure.' End of discussion,\" Boden said. \"I hope this will make people realize that patients have more options. They can safely choose to try medical therapy first.\"\n\nAlthough study patients receiving angioplasty were somewhat more likely to be free of chest pain, known as angina, even that benefit was marginal, Boden said.

Behavior and quality of life also improved.\n\nBut surgery also produced serious adverse effects in one-third of the children, most frequently a weakness on one side of the body, known as hemiparesis. The researchers said that was to be expected and, without surgery, patients probably would have experienced similar problems as a result of their continuing seizures.\n\n\u201cWhat the study clearly shows is surgery for children produces seizure freedom compared to children not operated on for similar conditions,\u201d senior author Dr. Manjari Tripathi, a professor of neurology and epilepsy at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi, told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.\n\nNot only \u201cdoes it reassure us that several surgical procedures are effective,\u201d she said, it demonstrates that surgery \u201cshould be done as early as possible\u201d once it becomes clear that a child is not responding to two anti-seizure medications.\n\nAbout 50 million people worldwide suffer with epilepsy and drugs can\u2019t control the seizures in approximately 30 percent of the cases.\n\n\u201cThis is the first randomized study to look at surgical outcome in children,\u201d said Dr. Donald Schomer, director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Program at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. He was not involved in the research.\n\n\u201cThe results are impressive,\u201d he told Reuters Health by phone. Adults who undergo surgery often suffer from the collective effect of years of uncontrolled seizures. \u201cThe study in kids shows if you reduce the time from the onset of seizures from the 15 to 20 years you see in adults down to four to five years, the outcome is much better. It\u2019s documentation that these techniques really work.\u201d\n\nAlthough 77 percent were judged by the Tripathi team to be seizure-free at the end of the study, some of those children actually had seizures immediately after surgery. Yet the cases were judged to be a success because the seizures decreased in frequency over time. Ultimately, 37 percent never had a seizure in the year after surgery.\n\nWhen all seizures were taken into account, children who did not have surgery were four times more likely to have a seizure during that year than youngsters in the surgery group, the researchers calculated.\n\nSuccess rates ranged from 87 percent to 100 percent depending on the type of surgery used to correct the child\u2019s particular brain abnormality.\n\nSurgery improved quality of life and social well-being, and it didn\u2019t affect IQ, something that can decline with ongoing seizures. But Dr. Schomer said the children were only followed for one year, and \u201cthat may be too soon to see a noticeable change\u201d in the intelligence quotient.\n\nPost-surgery weakness was seen in 15 of the 19 patients who had a serious side effect following surgery.\n\nThe weakness \u201cis significant,\u201d Dr. Tripathi said. \u201cThe child may not be able to ambulate by his- or herself. But with physical therapy, all regain the lower and upper limb function within six months. The only thing that does not improve is the wrist and the fingers. They are left with this minor deficit. But even before surgery, some of them have this weakness.\u201d\n\nOther side effects depended on the area of the brain that was removed or disconnected from the rest of the brain.\n\nIn contrast, 16.5 percent of the children waiting for surgery had a serious injury as a result of their continuing seizures.\n\nThe surgery \u201chad a transforming effect on how they get along in life,\u201d Dr. Tripathi said. \u201cMany could go back school earlier or go back to being tutored, and get on with their life.\u201d\n\nBut a major problem facing these children is getting insurance companies to pay for such surgeries, said Dr. Schomer of Beth Israel.\n\nRather than pay $35,000 to $50,000 on surgery that might cure the problem and prevent further damage to the child, insurance companies prefer to demand that more drugs be tried, even if the odds of them working in drug-resistant cases is small, he said.\n\n\u201cStudies like this lend credence to the idea that the earlier you do it, the better the outcome,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope insurance companies will look at this and realize that early detection and surgery, if appropriate, will ultimately save them money in the long term.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2gVClQv The New England Journal of Medicine, online October 25, 2017.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The article does an outstanding job of noting the cost of surgery, although the article could have been stronger if it had pointed out the estimated costs of drug therapies, hospitalizations and sometimes institutionalization of children and adults who are severely disabled by some forms of seizure disorders.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A California company has developed a genetic test that can predict whether patients treated for early-stage colon cancer are likely to suffer a recurrence of the disease, the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S.\n\nThe results of the test, based on an analysis of seven different genes found in colon-cancer tumors, yield a score that tells whether patients are at low, intermediate or high risk of having the disease come back after it is removed through surgery.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "A company official declines to estimate how much the test will cost.

What is hard is to keep the weight off.\n\nNow scientists think they know why. When people lose substantial amounts of weight, their physiology changes so that, although they may look normal, they have all the hallmarks of starvation.\n\nTheir metabolism slows down, they expend fewer calories when they exercise because their muscles become much more efficient, and their thyroid hormone and adrenaline levels drop. They also have much lower levels of the fat hormone, leptin.\n\nThey also usually stop losing weight and often gain back what they have already lost.\n\nA group of researchers at Columbia University devised an experiment to see whether if they could prevent these changes that occur with weight loss. Leptin, they reasoned, tells the brain how much fat is on the body.\n\nIf people lose weight, they have less leptin. But what if the researchers put people - fat and thin - on weight-reducing diets and gave them enough leptin to make their bodies think that they were still fat. The leptin would then serve as a sort of virtual fat. Would the subjects still show the metabolic changes of starvation?\n\nThe answer, published in the current issue of The Journal of Clinical Investigation, was that the leptin trick worked.\n\nTen subjects - five men and five women; of them three had never been fat and seven were obese - lived in the hospital, where they were fed a liquid diet formula to elicit a 10 percent weight loss. Then, for five weeks, they were given twice-daily injections with enough leptin to restore the levels they had before losing the weight.\n\nThe investigators measured muscular efficiency by having the subjects pedal a stationary bicycle with a mouthpiece, measuring their oxygen consumption to determine how many calories they burned.\n\nAt low levels of exertion, comparable to normal daily activities, they burned 23 percent fewer calories. When they took leptin, their calorie burning increased to pre-diet levels.\n\nThey also measured thyroid hormone concentrations in the blood and found that leptin reversed the declines in those levels that occurred with weight loss. And the scientists measured the effects of weight loss on the sympathetic nervous system, documenting lower levels of adrenaline in urine. Leptin reversed that, too.\n\nDr. Michael Rosenbaum, the lead investigator, said the 10-week study was too short and too small to determine whether continuous leptin treatments could allow dieters to keep off their weight permanently and effortlessly.

There could be fewer fillings in your future. A painless way to prevent cavities in adults is gaining traction.\n\n\"OK, Alice, we are going to put the fluoride varnish on your teeth,\" says Marion Manski, director of the dental hygiene program at the University of Maryland School of Dentistry. Fluoride varnish is standard practice for children's teeth, but Manski's patient, Alice Clash, is 91 years old. Like many older patients, Clash is taking medications that cause dry mouth, which puts her at high risk for cavities.\n\nSo Manski takes a skinny brush and a little pot of yellowish liquid and paints the varnish on Clash's teeth. \"We know that saliva helps us wash away bacteria and food in the mouth,\" Manski says. \"The fluoride varnish will help that.\"\n\nOne way fluoride helps is by seeping into the enamel and drawing the calcium and phosphate that's naturally present in the saliva. The minerals boost the teeth's natural healing process and make them more resistant to future decay. But there are other theories about how fluoride works. It strengthens the enamel before the tooth erupts, which is why it's so important for children. And it attacks the acid-producing bacteria in the mouth. One study shows fluoride makes it more difficult for these bacteria to stick to the teeth.\n\nIt takes about a minute, and the fluoride treatment is done. Some patients are also given a prescription for a concentrated fluoride gel that can be used at night.\n\n\"These preventative approaches work on adults just as well as they do on children,\" says Norman Tinanoff, a professor of pediatric dentistry at the University of Maryland. He says part of what's making fluoride treatments popular for adults is a move to make dental care personal, with an individual treatment plan for each patient. To do that, you have to weigh a patient's risk of getting cavities.\n\nOne of the biggest proponents of this approach is John Featherstone, dean of the University of California, San Francisco School of Dentistry. Featherstone came up with a comprehensive way of measuring a person's risk for caries, or tooth decay. It includes testing the level of bacteria in the mouth, and looking at dietary habits, medical conditions, medications, saliva flow and history of tooth decay. When Featherstone put his patients on personal treatment plans, he found the strategy worked.\n\n\"It really proved that drilling and filling did not fix the disease,\" Featherstone says. \"Putting in a filling fixes that hole in the tooth, but it doesn't deal with the bacteria in the rest of the mouth.\" Most bacteria are friendly, but a couple of bad actors can cause cavities. These guys feed on sugars and expel acid that eats away at the enamel.\n\nTraditionally, dentists were taught that the only way to deal with decay was to drill it out. That's still important in some cases, Featherstone says, but without fixing the underlying problem of bad bacteria, patients just keep coming back for more fillings. Featherstone saw another way. \"It's a little bit like your car is starting to rust,\" he says. \"If you can stop the rust before the rust goes right through the body of the car, then you're in good shape.\"\n\nLike rust, tooth decay is a slow process. A full-on cavity is a hole that needs to be fixed. But if you catch decay early, Featherstone says, it can be reversed using fluoride treatments like varnish and concentrated toothpaste and gels.\n\n\"In the past we believed tooth decay was a rapidly progressive disease. But research shows it's slowly progressive,\" says Wendell Evans, associate professor of dentistry at the University of Sydney in Australia. He recently published a study that found using these techniques reduced the need for fillings in adults by 30 to 50 percent.\n\nStriking as these results seem, the concept isn't new. This shift to a preventive model of dentistry is decades in the making. \"Some of the stuff in our study has been known for 50 years,\" Evans says, referring to the use of fluoride treatments.\n\n\"Prevention has always been a part of the world of dentistry,\" says Richard Valachovic, president of the American Dental Education Association. \"What we're seeing is a generational shift,\" Valachovic says. As dentists have come to better understand the microbiology of the mouth, more effective preventive techniques have followed.\n\nBut cost has been an issue. Insurance companies routinely pay for fluoride treatments for children, but not so much for adults. The National Association of Dental Plans couldn't give a definitive answer about coverage, but calls to some individual carriers and dental offices suggest it depends entirely on the type of plan you have. Some higher-end plans cover two fluoride treatments per year, while cheaper plans tend not to cover any. If you pay out of pocket, a varnish treatment costs from $23 to $55, compared with a filling, which ranges from $86 to $606, according to the American Dental Association.\n\nCost could also be a factor for dentists. Featherstone and Wendell say some dentists may be reluctant to embrace the preventive methods because they worry they'll lose money if they they do fewer costly procedures.\n\nAt this point, Featherstone says, two-thirds of dental schools in the U.S. teach some kind of disease management model based on a thorough risk assessment.

Previous research has found that one out of every four women with fibroids has problems related to fertility. The standard treatment option for such women is myomectomy, or surgical removal of the fibroids.\n\nHowever, myomectomy is not always possible or effective and can result in major complications including hysterectomy, according to study co-author Jo\u00e3o Martins Pisco, M.D., Ph.D., from the Department of Interventional Radiology at Saint Louis Hospital in Lisbon, Portugal.\n\nUterine fibroid embolization (UFE) is a less invasive option that involves injection of an embolic agent, typically made up of very small beads, into the uterine arteries to block the blood supply to the uterus and fibroids. As the fibroids die and begin to shrink, the uterus fully recovers. UFE can be performed in patients with a prior myomectomy or in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\nDespite its less invasive nature, UFE has yet to be fully embraced in the medical community as a fertility-preserving treatment for women with symptomatic fibroids due to concerns that the procedure may cause inadequate blood flow to the endometrium, or lining of the uterus, and the ovaries.\n\nFor the new study, Dr. Pisco and colleagues assessed pregnancy rates in 359 women with uterine fibroids who were unable to conceive and who underwent either conventional or partial UFE. In conventional UFE, all uterine artery branches are embolized. However, the partial procedure requires treatment of only the small vessels to the fibroids, leaving the corresponding larger vessels unaffected. Partial UFE may help reduce the risks of infertility associated with conventional UFE.\n\nAfter an average follow-up of almost six years, 149 of the 359 women, or 41.5 percent, had become pregnant one or more times, and 131 gave birth to a total of 150 babies. It was the first pregnancy for more than 85 percent of the women who gave birth.\n\nThe procedures had a clinical success rate of approximately 79 percent for fibroid-related symptoms. Complication rates were 14.6 percent for partial UFE and 23.1 percent for conventional UFE. The procedure was repeated in 28 patients whose fibroids had not been fully treated, as shown by MRI, and 11 of those patients subsequently got pregnant.\n\n\"Our findings show that UFE is a fertility-restoring procedure in women with uterine fibroids who wish to conceive, and pregnancy following UFE appears to be safe with low morbidity,\" Dr. Pisco said. \"Women who had been unable to conceive had normal pregnancies after UFE and similar complication rates as the general population in spite of being in a high-risk group.\"\n\nDr. Pisco suggested that UFE may become the first-line treatment for women with fibroids who wish to conceive, particularly for those with numerous or very large fibroids. Such patients have a fibroid recurrence rate of more than 60 percent after myomectomy, making UFE an important option.\n\nThe researchers are continuing the treatments and compiling data. Since the time of writing, there were 12 additional pregnancies.\n\n\"In our study there are now almost 200 newborns following UFE,\" Dr. Pisco said. \"Our next step will be a randomized study comparing the results of partial and conventional UFE.\"\n\n\"Spontaneous Pregnancy with a Live Birth after Conventional and Partial Uterine Fibroid Embolization.\" Collaborating with Dr. Pisco were Marisa Duarte, M.D., Tiago Bilhim, M.D., Ph.D., Jorge Branco, M.D., Ph.D., Fernando Cirurgi\u00e3o, M.D., Marcela Forjaz, M.D., L\u00facia Fernandes, M.D., Jos\u00e9 Pereira, M.D., Nuno Costa, M.D., Joana B.

Patients who received treatment endoscopically had shorter hospital stays and lower costs than those who had laparoscopic surgery.\n\n\"Obesity continues to be a problem in America and it is an epidemic rapidly spreading around the world,\" said Reem Z. Sharaiha, MD, MSc, assistant professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and attending physician at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, the study's lead author. \"Our research -- the first to compare these treatments -- demonstrates that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is safe and effective in helping patients lead healthier lives. It should be considered as another tool available to clinicians and patients in the fight against obesity.\"\n\nDr. Sharaiha followed 278 patients who underwent ESG (91 patients), laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (120 patients) or laparoscopic banding (67). During the one-year follow-up period, patients went to an academic bariatric center of excellence as part of their treatment.\n\nAt one-year follow-up, patients who chose laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery achieved the greatest percent total body weight loss at 29.28 percent, compared to 17.57 percent for endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty patients and 14.46 percent for laparoscopic banding patients. Researchers found that patients who received endoscopic treatment had lower complications (1 percent) than those who received surgical treatment (10 percent for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and 11 percent for laparoscopic banding).\n\nDr. Sharaiha noted that these findings do not suggest that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty will replace the two surgical treatments as weight-loss interventions. Instead, these results show that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is another possibility that patients and health-care providers should consider when discussing options.\n\nWhile endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is performed with an endoscopic device through the mouth, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy involves a small surgical incision in the belly to place a tube in the abdomen, allowing doctors to reduce the stomach's volume. With laparoscopic banding, doctors insert a tube through an incision in the belly to place a band around the stomach, restricting food intake.\n\nThe team also reported that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty patients customarily left the hospital on the same day of treatment, while laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy patients stayed for about three days and laparoscopic banding patients for a day and a half.\n\nWhen examining cost, researchers reported endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty resulted in the lowest-cost, with an average institutional procedure cost of $12,000, compared to $22,000 for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and $15,000 for laparoscopic banding.\n\n\"For years, patients seeking weight-loss interventions had limited options because they could not tolerate or did not want surgery, or it was not even an option for them,\" added Dr. Sharaiha. \"Our research shows that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty can be the treatment they've been looking for. It's less invasive than surgery and helps them reach their health goals.\"\n\nObesity is associated with heart disease, stroke, diabetes and some cancers, and researchers estimate that it is the second-leading cause of preventable death, after tobacco use.

It may actually help you live longer, according to new research from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nThe study, published in the American Journal of Epidemiology, found that women who were optimistic had a significantly lower risk of dying from several major diseases, including cancer, heart disease, stroke, and respiratory disease, compared to other women whose outlook on life was less positive.\n\n\u201cOptimism in prior research has been shown to be related to better health behaviors and better health outcomes, particularly in cardiovascular disease,\u201d postdoctoral research fellow Kaitlin Hagan, co-lead author of the study, told CBS News. \u201cSo in our study we wanted to expand that and look at all-cause mortality and be able to see whether optimism improves other health behaviors that then affects mortality, or whether there\u2019s an independent effect of optimism on mortality.\u201d\n\nFor the study, the researchers analyzed data on from 2004 to 2012 on 70,000 women who participated in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, a long-running research project tracking women\u2019s health via surveys every two years.\n\nTo measure levels of optimism, participants were asked to use a five-point scale to either agree or disagree with six statements, such as, \u201cIn uncertain times, I usually expect the best.\u201d\n\nThe results showed that the most optimistic women \u2013 those in the top 25 percent \u2013 had a nearly 30 percent lower risk of dying from any of the diseases analyzed in the study when compared to the least optimistic participants in the lowest 25 percent.\n\nSpecifically, the researchers found that the most optimistic women had:\n\nThe researchers controlled for a number of factors that could have had an impact on lifespan, including marital status, education level, and other socioeconomic factors.\n\nWhile the study is observational and cannot prove a cause-and-effect relationship between optimism and a longer life, the researchers have some theories for what might be behind the connection.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a combination,\u201d Hagan said. \u201cIf you\u2019re more optimistic, you tend to have healthier behaviors. Optimistic people are likely to have better diets, they\u2019re exercising more, and they\u2019re getting better sleep.\u201d\n\nHowever, even after the researchers accounted for these factors, the results still suggest that optimism itself is linked to a longer life.\n\n\u201cSo it could be that optimism directly impacts our biological functioning,\u201d Hagan said. \u201cOptimism is linked with lower inflammation and healthier biomarker levels and lipid levels, so there could be an independent effect on optimism.\u201d\n\nShe said her team plans to focus more on the potential impact of optimism on biological functioning in future research.\n\nThe authors point out that since the study was only done in women, who were mainly white, the results might not be generalizable to other populations. However, they note, \u201cthere is no clear basis for believing that the effects of optimism on health differ by sex or race.\u201d\n\nFinally, the researchers emphasize that while some people may think they\u2019re just not optimistic, it is something that is modifiable. They suggested a number of steps people can take to improve their level of optimism.\n\n\u201cOne is called \u2018best possible self,\u2019\u201d Eric Kim, who also co-led the study, told CBS News. \u201cSo you think about your different domains of life, whether it\u2019s your personal relationship, your spouse, your career, your friendships, and in each of those domains you think about the best possible outcome.\u201d\n\nHagan had some suggestions, too. \u201cSimple things like thinking about what you\u2019re grateful for every day or writing down what things make you happy or what things you\u2019re looking forward to can help someone to increase their optimism, which can improve health outcomes as we\u2019ve seen here,\u201d she said.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Optimism is free of charge, and anyone who says differently is overly optimistic about stealing your money.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Prostate cancer is more likely to be life-threatening if the man's PSA level rose rapidly during the years before he was diagnosed, says a new study that may help change how PSA tests are used.\n\nThe finding could help doctors diagnose aggressive cancers earlier, when they might be easier to fight.\n\nPerhaps more important, it suggests a more in-depth evaluation of the common blood tests could better predict who needs aggressive treatment and who has a slower-growing tumor that may be OK to monitor instead.\n\n\"This is a test that doesn't just diagnose prostate cancer. It diagnoses prostate cancer that's going to actually cause harm,\" said Dr. H. Ballentine Carter, urology chief at Johns Hopkins University, who led the research published Tuesday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nThe study is far from proof that making health decisions based on so-called PSA velocity can really save lives.\n\nBut Carter contends the findings suggest that men should consider getting a baseline PSA test around age 40, instead of the more usual 50, to use as a comparison for future changes.\n\nPSA tests are used to screen men for prostate cancer, but they're imprecise. Too much PSA, or prostate-specific antigen, in a man's blood can indicate that he has either a benign enlarged prostate or cancer. Only a biopsy can tell the difference.\n\nIt's not even clear when is the best time to do a biopsy. Some men have cancer despite a \"normal\" PSA count of 4 or below. Yet routinely biopsying men with low PSA would worsen another problem, overdiagnosis. Many specialists say too many men today are undergoing side effect-prone treatment for tumors too small and slow-growing to ever threaten their lives.\n\nTwo years ago, Boston researchers reported that men whose PSA levels jumped more than 2 points the year before diagnosis were more likely to relapse and die despite prostate surgery. But those were men whose PSA levels were already fairly high.\n\nHopkins' Carter wondered if doctors could catch such men far sooner, when the cancer might be more treatable.\n\nHe turned to a study of aging that has been collecting and freezing blood samples from participants since 1958. The Hopkins team tracked PSA changes in that blood from 980 men, 20 of whom eventually died of prostate cancer and 104 of whom survived it.\n\nHow fast a man's PSA was rising a decade before his cancer was diagnosed \u2014 even before it reached that biopsy-triggering level of 4 \u2014 predicted his survival 25 years later, regardless of his ultimate cancer treatment, Carter concluded.\n\nThose with a higher PSA velocity \u2014 the level rose more than a count of 0.35 a year \u2014 had a 54 percent survival rate, while those whose PSA rose more slowly had a 92 percent survival rate.\n\nWhat does that mean for men today? That it's a good idea to order a biopsy for a man with a low but fast-rising PSA, Carter said. And men diagnosed with prostate cancer whose PSA is rising slowly may be ideal candidates for monitoring instead of surgery or other treatment, he added.\n\nA study with just 20 deaths is far too small to prove the value of PSA velocity, cautioned Dr. Durado Brooks, a prostate specialist with the American Cancer Society.\n\nStill, growing numbers of doctors are using the method already to help decide when to order a biopsy, and \"I think the study does raise the question as to whether PSA velocity may at some point be a helpful factor in determining prognosis,\" he said.\n\nThe work is \"another step on the road to more sophisticated\" prostate cancer screening and treatment, Dr. Timothy Church of the University of Minnesota wrote in an editorial accompanying the work.\n\nSome 234,000 U.S. men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year, and just over 27,000 of them will die, the cancer society estimates.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not mention any costs of PSA testing (or the number of tests over what period of time are\u00a0needed to determine PSA velocity).\u00a0 ", "answer": 0}, {"article": "TUESDAY, Jan. 30, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Stimulating the brain with an implantable device may be safe -- and possibly helpful -- for some people with Alzheimer's disease, a small pilot study suggests.\n\nIn what researchers described as a \"proof of concept\" treatment, three Alzheimer's patients had deep brain stimulation (DBS) wires implanted in the brain -- in areas related to skills like planning, judgment and problem-solving.\n\nOver the next 18 months or more, the tactic appeared to be safe. And there were \"signals\" that it was slowing down two of the patients' decline, said lead researcher Dr. Douglas Scharre, director of cognitive neurology at Ohio State University's Wexner Medical Center.\n\nDeep brain stimulation is already used to treat some cases of Parkinson's disease and certain other brain disorders.\n\nBut it's far too early to know whether it has value for people with Alzheimer's, Scharre stressed.\n\n\"This is not ready for prime time,\" he said. \"It's not something patients can ask their neurologist for.\"\n\nKeith Fargo, who directs scientific programs and outreach for the Alzheimer's Association, agreed.\n\nIt's \"much too early\" for patients or caregivers to seek out DBS, said Fargo, who was not involved in the study.\n\nInstead, he said, these findings suggest that deep brain stimulation is \"a reasonable route\" to study in larger clinical trials.\n\nThe results were published online Jan. 30 in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.\n\nDeep brain stimulation involves implanting electrodes in the brain, then connecting them to a pulse generator placed under the skin of the chest. Sometimes called a \"brain pacemaker,\" it delivers electrical pulses that alter the activity in specific brain \"circuits.\"\n\nThe theory behind trying DBS for Alzheimer's patients, Scharre said, is similar to the \"use it or lose it\" principle: If key brain areas can be stimulated to form new connections among cells, it might slow decline.\n\nRight now, Scharre noted, medications for Alzheimer's target brain chemicals involved in memory.\n\nBut Alzheimer's impairs all kinds of mental functions -- including judgment, planning and decision-making. And those issues have a huge impact on daily life, for patients and their caregivers, Scharre added.\n\nSo, the patients in his study received DBS, for at least 18 months, to brain areas that regulate those mental skills. All three patients were in the earlier stages of Alzheimer's and were on standard medications.\n\nAfter starting DBS, all saw a general decline in their memory, problem-solving and other skills. But they declined at a slower rate, compared to 96 similar patients whose information was taken from an Alzheimer's research database.\n\nTwo of the DBS patients declined at a \"meaningfully\" slower rate, according to Scharre. That included one who actually showed some improvements.\n\nThat patient was LaVonne Moore, 85, of Delaware, Ohio. When she entered the study, she was not preparing any meals. After two years of deep brain stimulation, she'd regained that skill -- and was better able to perform some other simple tasks, like selecting her clothes and organizing outings.\n\nIn a Ohio State news release, her husband, Tom Moore, said her Alzheimer's has progressed, but more slowly than he'd expected.\n\n\"LaVonne has had Alzheimer's disease longer than anybody I know, and that sounds negative, but it's really a positive thing because it shows that we're doing something right,\" Moore said.\n\nIf DBS ever becomes an option for Alzheimer's, Scharre said it would not be for everyone.\n\nIt would not be appropriate, for example, for people who are frail or have other serious medical conditions.\n\nIn the pilot study, side effects included hot flashes, heart palpitations and burning sensations in the skin, which were reversed by adjusting the DBS settings, the researchers said.\n\nThere is no larger trial in the works yet, according to Scharre.\n\nWhat's needed, said Fargo, is research that compares deep brain stimulation against a placebo device.\n\nOn a broader level, he noted, this study highlights an important point: \"Alzheimer's disease is more than just amnesia.\"\n\nFor caregivers, Fargo said, the problems with abilities like judgment and planning can actually be more challenging.

Another advantage is not having to worry about an implant breaking or hardening.\n\nBut the disadvantages cannot be discounted. It\u2019s usually more expensive than implants, it takes a year to see how much fat survived, and breast volume can fluctuate with weight. Dr. Scott L.

Such fasting already shows benefits after only six weeks. This is according to a study by Kyoung-Han Kim and Yun Hye Kim in the journal Cell Research which is published by Springer Nature. Intermittent fasting in mice helped to kick-start the animals' metabolism and to burn fat by generating body heat. The research team was led by Hoon-Ki Sung of The Hospital for Sick Children in Ontario, Canada.\n\nResearch has shown that our unhealthy eating habits and sedentary lifestyles are playing a major role in the development of lifestyle-related metabolic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and obesity. For this reason, dietary interventions like intermittent fasting are gaining popularity to treat conditions such as obesity.\n\nThe research team in this study wanted to better understand the reactions that interventions such as fasting trigger on a molecular level in the body. They exposed groups of mice to sixteen weeks of intermittent fasting. The recurring regimen saw the animals being fed for two days, followed by one day without anything to eat. Their calorie intake was not adjusted otherwise. Four months later the mice in the fasting group weighed less than those in the control group who continued to eat the same volume of food. The lower body weight of the mice in the fasting group was not the only effect. The fasting regime helped lower fat build-up in the white fat by increasing the brown-like fat (involved in burning energy and producing body heat) of mice on the high fat diet. Their glucose and insulin systems also remained more stable. In a further experiment, similar benefits were already seen after only six weeks of intermittent fasting.\n\nThrough an analysis into the underlying biology involved, the researchers found that such intermittent fasting tempers an immune reaction in fat cells. There are changes in certain gene pathways involved in the immune system and the body's reaction to inflammation. A type of white blood cell known to play a role in fighting inflammation is triggered. Known as anti-inflammatory macrophages, these cells stimulate the fat cells to burn stored fats or lipids by generating heat. This happens during periods of intermittent fasting because there is an increase in vascular growth factor (VEGF) that help form blood vessels and activate anti-inflammatory macrophage.\n\n\"Intermittent fasting without a reduction in calorie intake can be a preventative and therapeutic approach against obesity and metabolic disorders,\" says Kyoung-Han Kim.\n\n\"Strikingly, these fasting-stimulated changes in the growth of vascular cells and subsequent immune alterations occur even after a single cycle of 24-hour fasting, and are completely reversed when mice start eating again,\" adds Yun Hye Kim.\n\nReference: Kim, K-H. et al (2017).

But while the research clearly shows that the interval between diagnosis and death was longer in screened patients, it does not definitively show they lived longer -- a subtle difference with significant public health consequences.\n\nLung cancer kills about 162,000 Americans a year and is the leading cause of cancer death in men and women.

He has a great job as the creative director of an advertising firm in New York City. He enjoys spending time with his wife and kids.\n\nAnd it has all been possible, he says, because for the past six years he has been taking a drug called ketamine.\n\nBefore ketamine, James was unable to work or focus his thoughts. His mind was filled with violent images. And his mood could go from ebullient to dark in a matter of minutes.\n\nKetamine \"helped me get my life back,\" says James, who asked that we not use his last name to protect his career.\n\nKetamine was developed as a human and animal anesthetic in the 1960s. And almost from the time it reached the market it has also been used as a mind-bending party drug.\n\nBut ketamine's story took a surprising turn in 2006, when researchers at the National Institutes of Health showed that an intravenous dose could relieve severe depression in a matter of hours. Since then, doctors have prescribed ketamine \"off label\" to thousands of depressed patients who don't respond to other drugs.\n\nAnd pharmaceutical companies are testing several new ketamine-related drugs to treat depression. Johnson & Johnson expects to seek approval for its nasal spray esketamine later this year, though the approval would be limited to use in a clinical setting.\n\nMeanwhile, doctors have begun trying ketamine on patients with a wide range of psychiatric disorders other than depression. And there is now growing evidence it can help people with anxiety, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and perhaps even obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\n\"I think it's actually one of the biggest advances in psychiatry in a very long time,\" says Dr. Martin Teicher, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the Developmental Biopsychiatry Research Program at McLean Hospital.\n\nKetamine may also offer new hope for people like James who have symptoms of several different psychiatric disorders.\n\nJames had a happy childhood, he says. But his thoughts were out of control. \"I always felt like I was crossing a freeway and my thoughts were just racing past me,\" he says.\n\nHe spent much of his childhood terrified of \"an unknown, an ambiguous force out there.\" The fear was \"overwhelming,\" he says. \"I literally slept with the cover over my head with just room to breathe through my mouth until I went to college.\"\n\nAnd there was something else about James: his body temperature.\n\n\"I overheated constantly,\" he says. \"I would wear shorts all year long. In my 20s in my apartment I would sleep with the windows open in the middle of the winter.\"\n\nIn his late 20s, James saw a doctor who told him he had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. So he started taking stimulants.\n\nAt first, the pills helped him focus. Then they didn't, no matter how many he took.\n\nHe'd done well as an idea guy in the advertising industry. But now James was trying to work at home, and it wasn't going well.\n\n\"ADHD pills will make you interested in anything,\" he says. \"So I was putting the desk together and taking the desk apart. I was putting a laptop stand together and taking it apart. I was going in a massive downward spiral.\"\n\nJames had always suffered from mood swings. But now they were rapid and extreme. And he couldn't stop thinking about gruesome scenarios, like a murderer coming for his family.\n\n\"My wife took a summer off to be with me because she was scared of what was going to happen to me,\" he says. \"She would go to work for a few hours, then rush home. There would be times I'd call her just screaming, 'Please come home. I can't get through another minute.' \"\n\nEventually, James found his way to Dr. Demitri Papolos, an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.\n\n\"He was like a whirling dervish when he came into my office,\" Papolos says. \"He was extremely fearful and scanning the environment all the time and he overheated at the drop of a hat.\"\n\nPapolos diagnosed James with a variant of bipolar disorder he calls the \"fear of harm phenotype.\" It typically appears in childhood and often doesn't respond to traditional psychiatric drugs.\n\nBut Papolos has found that the condition does respond to ketamine. \"It's been transformational,\" he says.\n\nIn January, Papolos published a study of 45 children with the problem. They inhaled a nasal mist containing ketamine about twice a week. Nearly all got dramatically better.\n\nScientists still aren't sure why ketamine works, but there's evidence that it encourages the brain to rewire, to alter the connections between cells. That process has been linked to recovery from depression. And it may also explain why ketamine helps people who have symptoms associated with several different psychiatric disorders.\n\n\"I think it's having multiple effects, and that means it's probably useful for multiple different disorders,\" Teicher says.\n\nOne of those effects involves a part of the brain involved in temperature regulation. And that could explain why patients like James usually stop overheating once they are taking ketamine.\n\nJames started taking a ketamine nasal spray every other day. He says his response was dramatic.\n\n\"One day I turn to my wife and I'm like, 'I feel calm today. I don't know if it's the sun coming in, I don't know if it's just the way we're sitting here, but I feel like I could go and sit at the computer and work.' \"\n\nThe next day, James did sit down at his computer.

A group of researchers led by Dr. Christine Beeton at Baylor College of Medicine has found that one of the hundreds of components in scorpion venom can reduce the severity of the disease in animal models, without inducing side effects associated with similar treatments. The study appears in the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.\n\n\"Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease - one in which the immune system attacks its own body. In this case, it affects the joints,\" said Beeton, associate professor of molecular physiology and biophysics and member Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center at Baylor College of Medicine. \"Cells called fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) play a major role in the disease. As they grow and move from joint to joint, they secrete products that damage the joints and attract immune cells that cause inflammation and pain. As damage progresses, the joints become enlarged and are unable to move.\"\n\nCurrent treatments target the immune cells involved in the disease and none are specific for FLS. Beeton and her colleagues studied FLS looking for an 'Achilles' heel' that would allow them to prevent or stop them from damaging the joints.\n\n\"In previous work, we identified a potassium channel on FLS of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and found that the channel was very important for the development of the disease,\" Beeton said. \"We wanted to find a way to block the channel to stop the cells damaging the joints.\"\n\nPotassium channels work by opening gates on the surface of cells that allow potassium ions - small charged atoms - to flow in and out of the cell. The flow of ions through the channels is necessary for the cells to carry out many of their essential functions. Animals such as scorpions have venoms that block potassium and other ion channels. They use the venoms to paralyze and kill prey. Decades ago, scientists discovered this and realized that, if handled correctly, venoms also might have medicinal applications.\n\nScorpion venom may lead to improved treatments for rheumatoid arthritis\n\n\"Scorpion venom has hundreds of different components. One of the components in the venom of the scorpion called Buthus tamulus specifically blocks the potassium channel of FLS and not the channels in other cells such as those of the nervous system,\" said first author Dr. Mark Tanner, a graduate student in the Beeton lab during the development of this project. \"Here, we investigated whether this venom component, called iberiotoxin, would be able to specifically block the FLS potassium channel and reduce the severity of the rheumatoid arthritis in rat models of the disease.\"\n\nWhen the researchers treated rat models of the disease with iberiotoxin, they stopped the progression of the disease. In some cases they reversed the signs of established disease, meaning that the animals had better joint mobility and less inflammation in their joints. In addition, treatment with iberiotoxin did not induce side effects, such as tremors and incontinence, observed when treating with another channel blocker called paxilline.\n\n\"It was very exciting to see that iberiotoxin is very specific for the potassium channel in FLS and that it did not seem to affect the channels in other types of cells, which might explain the lack of tremors and incontinence,\" Tanner said.\n\n\"Although these results are promising, much more research needs to be conducted before we can use scorpion venom components to treat rheumatoid arthritis,\" Beeton said. \"We think that this venom component, iberiotoxin, can become the basis for developing a new treatment for rheumatoid arthritis in the future.\"\n\nOther contributors of this work include Michael W.

Sondak, chairman of cutaneous oncology at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Fla.\n\nAlso, the number of melanoma cases has been rising, unlike for many other types of cancer. Doctors say that is because of unprotected sun exposure years ago, the proliferation of tanning salons and perhaps more attention to detecting the disease.\n\nThere were about 68,000 new cases of melanoma and about 8,700 deaths last year in the United States, up from 48,000 cases and 7,700 deaths in 2000, according to the American Cancer Society. Particularly fast increases have occurred among people older than 65 and among women 15 to 39 years old.\n\nVemurafenib is the latest so-called targeted therapy, which inhibits the effects of genetic mutations that spur tumor growth and spread. In particular, the drug counters the effect of a mutation in a gene called B-RAF that was discovered in 2002 to be common in melanomas. (The drug\u2019s name comes from V600E mutation in RAF.)\n\nThe drug, which is taken orally twice a day, would be used only by the roughly half of melanoma patients whose tumors have this mutation. The drug significantly shrinks tumors in about half of these patients \u2014 or about a quarter of all melanoma patients.\n\nIt was developed by Roche and Plexxikon, a biotechnology company in Berkeley, Calif., that was recently acquired by Daiichi Sankyo of Japan. The drug is expected to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration within a few months.\n\nIpilimumab, the other new drug, releases a brake on the body\u2019s immune system, allowing it to more effectively attack the tumor. Developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, it was approved in March and is sold under the name Yervoy.\n\nA series of articles in The New York Times last year followed the development of vemurafenib, then known as PLX4032, and recounted how some patients close to death seemed to make miraculous recoveries.\n\nThe effect, however, typically lasts only about seven months before the cancer starts to grow again, though some patients benefit for more than two years.\n\nS. Taylor Chance, a 67-year-old real estate agent in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., has been taking vemurafenib in a clinical trial since March 2010. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the trial I wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d she said.\n\nIt has not been all good.

It measures the amount of AMH circulating in a women\u2019s bloodstream. This hormone is released by follicles in the ovaries and predicts the amount of possible eggs a woman has. The higher the result the more eggs, the lower the result the fewer eggs. The test doesn\u2019t measure the quality of the eggs and it\u2019s not a guarantee of fertility.

Nearly all modern vaccines are given via injection, according to background information in a news release about the study, which is published in the Jan. 17 issue of Nature Medicine.\n\nIn a series of tests, the Brigham and Women's Hospital researchers also found that the memory of T-cells -- the cells that mount an immune response against invading viruses -- may be more important than the antibodies generated by injected vaccines. T-cells are located in lymph nodes and blood, as well as in peripheral tissues such as skin and lung.\n\n\"This research illustrates the remarkable capacity of the most superficial layer of skin to generate powerful protective immune responses after vaccination,\" study senior researcher Dr. Thomas Kupper, chairman of the dermatology department at the hospital, said in a news release from the hospital.\n\n\"The ability of vaccination through injured epidermis -- or scarification -- to generate such powerful tissue-resident protective T-cells is a completely novel observation that should make us reconsider the way we think about vaccine delivery for all infectious diseases, as well as cancer. After all, our immune system evolved over millions of years to respond to infections of injured skin, not vaccines delivered by hypodermic syringe into muscle,\" he noted.\n\nIn their experiments, Kupper and colleagues found that scarification with the vaccinia virus offered much greater protection against smallpox than injecting the vaccine. They also found that a melanoma vaccine delivered by scarification was much more effective than injected vaccines in protecting animals against melanoma tumor growth.\n\n\"The lessons we are learning from these studies of vaccination by scarification could help us develop new and more powerful vaccines for influenza, HIV, malaria and other infectious diseases,\" Kupper explained. \"We should also continue to explore the implications for developing powerful cancer vaccines, like the one demonstrated by melanoma vaccine results in this study.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has more about vaccines.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "There was no discussion of costs, but that seems like a minor issue in this context, so we\u2019ll grade this Not Applicable.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "No, she\u2019s not RoboCop or Darth Vader.

Psoriasis is an autoimmune disorder that occurs more commonly in patients with a family history of the disease, and most often begins in people between the ages of 15 and 35. The most common form of psoriasis is plaque psoriasis, in which patients develop thick, red skin with flaky, silver-white scales.\n\nSiliq\u2019s active ingredient (brodalumab) binds to a protein that causes inflammation, inhibiting the inflammatory response that plays a role in the development of plaque psoriasis.\n\nSiliq\u2019s safety and efficacy were established in three randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with a total of 4,373 adult participants with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. More patients treated with Siliq compared to placebo had skin that was clear or almost clear, as assessed by scoring of the extent, nature and severity of psoriatic changes of the skin.\n\nSuicidal ideation and behavior, including completed suicides, have occurred in patients treated with Siliq during clinical trials. Siliq users with a history of suicidality or depression had an increased incidence of suicidal ideation and behavior compared to users without this history. A causal association between treatment with Siliq and increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior has not been established.\n\nBecause of the observed risk of suicidal ideation and behavior, the labeling for Siliq includes a Boxed Warning and the drug is only available through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Siliq REMS Program. Notable requirements of the Siliq REMS Program include the following:\n\u2022 Prescribers must be certified with the program and counsel patients about this risk. Patients with new or worsening symptoms of depression or suicidality should be referred to a mental health professional, as appropriate.\n\u2022 Patients must sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement Form and be made aware of the need to seek medical attention should they experience new or worsening suicidal thoughts or behavior, feelings of depression, anxiety or other mood changes.\n\u2022 Pharmacies must be certified with the program and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive Siliq.\n\nSiliq is also approved with a Medication Guide to inform patients of the risk of suicidal ideation and behavior, and that because Siliq is a medication that affects the immune system, patients may have a greater risk of getting an infection, or an allergic or autoimmune condition. Patients with Crohn\u2019s disease should not use Siliq. Health care providers should also evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with Siliq. Health care providers should not administer Siliq to patients with active TB infection, and should avoid immunizations with live vaccines in patients being treated with Siliq.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions reported with the use of Siliq include joint pain (arthralgia), headache, fatigue, diarrhea, throat pain (oropharyngeal pain), nausea, muscle pain (myalgia), injection site reactions, influenza, low white blood cell count (neutropenia) and fungal (tinea) infections.\n\nSiliq is marketed by Bridgewater, New Jersey-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

The findings suggest that many of our expectations about the inevitability of physical decline with advancing years may be incorrect and that how we age is, to a large degree, up to us.\n\nAging remains a surprisingly mysterious process. A wealth of past scientific research has shown that many bodily and cellular processes change in undesirable ways as we grow older. But science has not been able to establish definitively whether such changes result primarily from the passage of time \u2014 in which case they are inevitable for anyone with birthdays \u2014 or result at least in part from lifestyle, meaning that they are mutable.\n\nThis conundrum is particularly true in terms of inactivity. Older people tend to be quite sedentary nowadays, and being sedentary affects health, making it difficult to separate the effects of not moving from those of getting older.\n\nIn the new study, which was published this week in The Journal of Physiology, scientists at King\u2019s College London and the University of Birmingham in England decided to use a different approach.\n\nThey removed inactivity as a factor in their study of aging by looking at the health of older people who move quite a bit.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to understand what happens to the functioning of our bodies as we get older if we take the best-case scenario,\u201d said Stephen Harridge, senior author of the study and director of the Centre of Human and Aerospace Physiological Sciences at King\u2019s College London.\n\nTo accomplish that goal, the scientists recruited 85 men and 41 women aged between 55 and 79 who bicycle regularly. The volunteers were all serious recreational riders but not competitive athletes. The men had to be able to ride at least 62 miles in six and a half hours and the women 37 miles in five and a half hours, benchmarks typical of a high degree of fitness in older people.\n\nThe scientists then ran each volunteer through a large array of physical and cognitive tests. The scientists determined each cyclist\u2019s endurance capacity, muscular mass and strength, pedaling power, metabolic health, balance, memory function, bone density and reflexes. They also had the volunteers complete the so-called Timed Up and Go test, during which someone stands up from a chair without using his or her arms, briskly walks about 10 feet, turns, walks back and sits down again.\n\nThe researchers compared the results of cyclists in the study against each other and also against standard benchmarks of supposedly normal aging. If a particular test\u2019s numbers were similar among the cyclists of all ages, the researchers considered, then that measure would seem to be more dependent on activity than on age.\n\nAs it turned out, the cyclists did not show their age. On almost all measures, their physical functioning remained fairly stable across the decades and was much closer to that of young adults than of people their age. As a group, even the oldest cyclists had younger people\u2019s levels of balance, reflexes, metabolic health and memory ability.\n\nAnd their Timed Up and Go results were exemplary. Many older people require at least 7 seconds to complete the task, with those requiring 9 or 10 seconds considered to be on the cusp of frailty, Dr. Harridge said. But even the oldest cyclists in this study averaged barely 5 seconds for the walk, which is \u201cwell within the norm reported for healthy young adults,\u201d the study authors write.\n\nSome aspects of aging did, however, prove to be ineluctable. The oldest cyclists had less muscular power and mass than those in their 50s and early 60s and considerably lower overall aerobic capacities. Age does seem to reduce our endurance and strength to some extent, Dr. Harridge said, even if we exercise.\n\nBut even so, both of those measures were higher among the oldest cyclists than would be considered average among people aged 70 or above.\n\nAll in all, the numbers suggest that aging is simply different in the active.\n\n\u201cIf you gave this dataset to a clinician and asked him to predict the age\u201d of one of the cyclists based on his or her test results, Dr. Harridge said, \u201cit would be impossible.\u201d On paper, they all look young.\n\nOf course, this study is based on a single snapshot of an unusual group of older adults, Dr. Harridge said. He and his colleagues plan to retest their volunteers in five and 10 years, which will provide better information about the ongoing effects of exercise on aging.\n\nBut even in advance of those results, said Dr. Harridge, himself almost 50 and an avid cyclist, this study shows that \u201cbeing physically active makes your body function on the inside more like a young person\u2019s.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "It\u2019s difficult for many people to be active as cyclists, especially in low-income areas that lack bicycle paths.

Nocturnal hot flashes are among the most problematic because they can contribute to poor sleep.\n\nA new study shows that electro-acupuncture may be effective in providing some relief. The study is being published online in Menopause, the journal of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS).\n\nCompared with women who undergo natural menopause, women with breast cancer are at a greater risk of experiencing hot flashes, partially as a result of the premature menopause that results from chemotherapy and surgery, as well as estrogen deficiency caused by the use of breast cancer treatments such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors. It is estimated that by the year 2020 there will be nearly six million breast cancer survivors in the United States.\n\nResearchers analyzed data from a randomized, controlled trial involving 58 breast cancer survivors experiencing bothersome hot flashes. They compared the benefits of using electro-acupuncture (the application of a pulsating electric current) to prescribing gabapentin, an anti-seizure medication frequently prescribed to treat sleep disturbances related to hot flashes. The study showed electro-acupuncture to be comparable to, if not better than, gabapentin in helping to reduce hot flash severity and frequency and improving overall sleep quality (including falling asleep faster and fewer sleep disruptions). Although it is not exactly understood how acupuncture affects sleep, it has been shown to affect a number of neurotransmitters associated with sleep, such as serotonin and melatonin.\n\nPoor sleep is particularly bothersome for breast cancer survivors experiencing nighttime hot flashes because it has been shown to increase levels of pain, fatigue, depression and anxiety.

This new research analyzed data from multiple trials to determine the relative effectiveness of various nonsurgical treatments for knee OA. The treatments that were compared and ranked included acetaminophen; ibuprofen; intra-articular (IA) or joint injections of cortisone; platelet-rich plasma (PRP); hyaluronic acid (HA); several NSAIDs, such as naproxen, celecoxib, and diclofenac; and both oral and IA placebo.\n\n\"This is the first comprehensive mixed-comparison analysis comparing best-evidence scientific research and excluding lower quality studies that can bias the outcomes,\" said lead author and orthopaedic surgeon David Jevsevar, MD, MBA. \"Using a statistical ranking technique, we worked to provide evidence regarding which of the most common NSAIDs are most likely to decrease pain and improve function, and we attempted to fill in the gaps in evidence for more inconclusive treatments such as HA, PRP, and corticosteroids.\"\n\nAuthors analyzed 53 randomized controlled trials that examined knee OA treatments for at least 28 days and included a minimum of 30 participants per study group. Knee OA treatments were ranked on a scale of one to five, with one being the most effective.

The researchers then found a comparison group of women without the disease, who matched the first group in age, ethnicity and clinics where they received treatment.\n\nEarlier studies have found that women taking bisphosphonates have a lower risk of breast cancer. But it was unclear if that effect could be chalked up to the drugs, because the condition they are meant to treat \u2014 bone thinning, or osteoporosis \u2014 is tied to low estrogen levels, which also cuts breast cancer risk.\n\nColon cancer, on the other hand, has not been linked to estrogen, said Dr. Gad Rennert of the Carmel Medical Center in Haifa, whose findings are published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\nHis team found that women who had been taking bisphosphonates \u2014 mainly the drug alendronate (Fosamax), which costs around $10 per month in the U.S. \u2014 for at least a year had a considerably lower risk of developing colon cancer later on.\n\nEven after considering other factors tied to the disease \u2014 like aspirin or statin use and eating lots of vegetables \u2014 their risk was 59 percent lower than that of women who hadn\u2019t taken the drugs.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, one in 19 men develops colorectal cancer at some point, and slightly fewer women do.

A new study from the University of Cincinnati (UC), published online this week in the Journal of Athletic Training, assessed the use of colored lenses in post-concussion patients and found wearing certain color-tinted sunglasses may be a good alternative to dark sunglasses.\n\n\"While sunglasses can provide some relief, they are not very practical indoors or in low light environments,\" says Joe Clark, PhD, professor in the Department of Neurology and Rehabilitation Medicine at the UC College of Medicine and lead author of the study. \"What is needed is a light mitigation strategy that can be readily employed indoors, which can optimize relief in those who suffer from photophobia, or light sensitivity.\"\n\nClark and researchers at the College of Medicine assessed visual symptoms of 51 concussion patients and used frames with varying colored lenses to find out if certain hues provided relief from photophobia.\n\n\"We found that 85 percent of patients reporting photophobia had relief of the symptoms with one or more colors-- blue, green, red and purple--with no reported adverse events,\" Clark says.\n\n\"Sensitivity to light can be common and impact activities of daily life suggesting that light mitigation might improve quality of life in many of these patients.

As with many other health conditions, the presentation of concussion symptoms can vary greatly--while some individuals exhibit very little to no change in functionality and may report no symptoms at all, others may report confusion, headache, decreased balance and vision disturbances including blurry vision, trouble focusing and sensitivity to light.\n\nPhotophobia is so common that many neurosurgical intensive care units consider it standard operating procedure to keep lights dimmed in rooms containing TBI patients says Clark.\n\nIn addition to trying colored-lens sunglasses, the article suggests other ways to mitigate photophobia including wearing a wide-brimmed hat when outdoors, adjusting digital screen and device settings to an appropriate hue and brightness or purchasing filters for screens. However, the researchers noted, they do not recommend wearing colored glasses while driving. Certain colors make seeing stop lights or emergency vehicle lights difficult.\n\n\"We believe that an athletic trainer, in consultation with team physicians, may find it useful to apply this photophobia assessment and recommend colored glasses to his or her athlete,\" Clark says. \"The use of the colored glasses in the high school, college or other setting can allow a person to engage in some medically approved activities, while minimizing the risk of symptom exacerbation.

The people assigned to the diet group stopped any diabetes drugs they were taking on the same day they began the diet.\n\nThe diet, which was designed to help people lose up to 30 pounds, involved three to five months of a strict low-calorie liquid formula diet averaging no more than 850 calories a day, followed by two to eight weeks of reintroducing food, along with nutritional education and cognitive behavioral therapy to help people stick with the new eating plan.\n\nTaylor and his team tracked outcomes including weight loss, diabetes remission and level of fat in the pancreas and liver. After a year, most of the people in the diet group lost about 22 pounds, compared to two pounds in the control group. Nearly a quarter of the people who managed their weight were able to lose 33 pounds or more, while none in the control group were able to lose that much. Most importantly, 46% of the people in the diet group went into remission with their diabetes, compared to just 4% in the control group.\n\nMORE: Antibiotics Are Linked To Type-2 Diabetes\n\n\u201cPeople newly diagnosed with diabetes for the first time can look at this and know it isn\u2019t necessarily for life,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cIt isn\u2019t an irreversible, inexorable condition that you can never escape from \u2014 at the moment, people are told that.\u201d\n\nPrevious studies have suggested that lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise, can be powerful ways to lose weight and combat diabetes. The Diabetes Prevention Program in the U.S. revealed in 2002 that diet and exercise alone can prevent people from progressing from pre-diabetes to diabetes, in some cases better than medications designed to control blood sugar. Gastric bypass surgery, which can result in dramatic weight loss, can also help to reverse diabetes, but the procedure is costly and carries a high risk of complications.\n\nThe current study takes that work a step further and shows that it\u2019s possible to actually reverse the disease in people who have been diagnosed. Taylor stresses that the study only addressed people diagnosed relatively recently \u2014 within the past six years \u2014 and that the effect may not apply to more long-term patients. That\u2019s because as the disease continues, he says, insulin-producing cells start to die off. Initially, the cells slowly shut down, entering a so-called resting state. Those are the cells that weight loss can re-activate.\n\nBut left in this state too long, the cells eventually die and cannot be revived. Studies suggest that people living with diabetes for more than 10 years, for example, may not be able to rely on weight loss alone to push them into remission.\n\nThat points to an important lesson that Taylor hopes doctors and patients will learn from the results. He says that it\u2019s critical to discuss from the start \u2014 when people are diagnosed with diabetes \u2014 the possibility of using diet and weight loss to treat their disease. If more people can benefit from losing weight alone, then that would mean less cost to the health care system, as fewer people will suffer the serious complications of advanced disease, which can include heart problems, neuropathy, vision issues and even amputations.\n\nTaylor says he intends to follow up on the people in the study for another four years to see if they are able to maintain their weight, and, if they are, whether they continue to remain in remission. \u201cFrom the very clear data we produced in this trial, yes, this is a watershed moment for diabetes,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can offer people hope from the start.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story makes no mention of costs, although the diet intervention included weeks of a liquid formula diet, along with support services such as nutritional education and cognitive behavioral therapy.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "(CNN) A one-time treatment with Luxturna, the first US Food and Drug Administration-approved gene therapy for an inherited disorder, will cost $425,000 per eye.\n\nSpark Therapeutics Inc., the Philadelphia-based maker of voretigene neparvovec, announced Wednesday in a statement that it reached an agreement in principle with Harvard Pilgrim and affiliates of Express Scripts to make the one-time treatment available to patients with a rare genetic defect that often leads to blindness.\n\nThe mutation affects both eyes, usually at the same pace, so most patients would need treatment for both eyes, a Spark Therapeutics spokeswoman said.\n\nIn some cases, the gene therapy will be available under an \"outcomes-based rebate arrangement.\" The company also stated that its proposal to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the government program that covers about 100 million Americans, would allow installment payments for the drug.\n\n\"For a one-time therapy, like Luxturna, a non-traditional payment and distribution model is necessary to ensure needs of all parties -- patients, payers and providers -- are addressed,\" said Jennifer Luddy, a spokeswoman for Express Scripts.\n\nAt least one patient advocate disagrees.\n\n\"The new payment models announced today are merely a way to disguise a price that is simply too high,\" David Mitchell, president and founder of Patients For Affordable Drugs, said in a statement . \"Spark Therapeutics is charging as much for Luxturna as they think they can get away with.\"\n\nOne-time-only treatments for rare genetic disorders are still unique, he noted.\n\nThe drug is intended for patients with retinal dystrophy due to a mutation of the RPE65 gene. This rare genetic defect causes severe visual impairment beginning in infancy and can eventually lead to blindness. The company believes the total \"population in the US, Europe and select additional markets in the Americas and Asia/Pacific is up to approximately 6,000 individuals\" who have the mutation targeted by Luxturna, explained Monique da Silva, a spokeswoman for Spark Therapeutics.\n\nThe drug will be available in the United States in early spring, with an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 people in the US standing to benefit from this treatment, according to Spark.\n\nLuxturna is only the third gene therapy approved for use in the United States; two others were also approved in 2017. This is the first to correct an inherited genetic mutation.\n\nLuxturna is a liquid that is injected directly into the eye with a microscopic needle during a surgical procedure. The drug supplies a third gene -- a normal RPE65 gene -- to cells in the retina, a layer of tissue lining the back of the eye. This third version of the gene does not remove or replace the two mutated genes causing the disease, which remain inside the cells. However, the normal gene delivered by the treatment is able to function within the retinal cells and correct vision problems.\n\nIn the phase 3 clinical trial, 27 out of 29 participants -- 93% -- who received the gene therapy demonstrated a gain in functional vision as assessed by a mobility test performed in a maze, according to the company. Risks of the treatment include cataracts, elevated eye pressure, retinal tears and holes and inflammation.\n\nThe company's offer of unusual payer models, including rebates and installment payments, will \"help ensure patients' individual financial situation does not hinder access to treatment,\" da Silva said.\n\n\"New technologies such as gene and cell therapies hold out the potential to transform medicine,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a statement announcing the August approval of Kymriah, considered to be the first gene therapy to be approved for the US market.\n\nKymriah is a leukemia treatment made by pharmaceutical giant Novartis.

Writing in the January 6, 2015 issue of the journal Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Disease, a team of scientists and physicians from the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, with counterparts at University of California, Los Angeles, describe a novel imaging technique that measurably improves upon current prostate imaging \u2013 and may have significant implications for how patients with prostate cancer are ultimately treated.\n\n\u201cThis new approach is a more reliable imaging technique for localizing tumors. It provides a better target for biopsies, especially for smaller tumors,\u201d said Rebecca Rakow-Penner, MD, PhD, a research resident in the Department of Radiology and the study\u2019s first author.\n\nThe technique is also valuable in surgical planning and image staging, said David S. Karow, MD, PhD, assistant professor of radiology at UC San Diego and the study\u2019s corresponding author. \u201cDoctors at UC San Diego and UCLA now have a non-invasive imaging method to more accurately assess the local extent of the tumor and possibly predict the grade of the tumor, which can help them more precisely and effectively determine appropriate treatment.\u201d\n\nThe current standard of care for detecting and diagnosing prostate cancer is contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which involves intravenously injecting patients with a contrast agent to highlight blood flow. Greater blood flow is often a requirement of growing cancer cells. When compared to surrounding healthy tissues, it\u2019s hoped that contrast enhanced MRIs will reveal the shape and nature of any tumors present.\n\nBut many tumors do not significantly differ from surrounding healthy tissues with contrast enhanced MRI and so evade easy detection. An imaging technique called diffusion MRI measures the diffusion of water and has been a standard imaging technique in the brain and an emerging technique in the prostate. Cancer tissues are denser than healthy tissues and typically limit the amount and mobility of water within them. But diffusion MRI suffers from magnetic field artifacts that can distort the actual location of tumors by as much as 1.2 centimeters or roughly half an inch \u2013 a significant distance when surgeons are attempting, for example, to assess whether a tumor extends beyond the prostate and into adjacent nerve bundles.\n\nThe new approach described in today\u2019s published paper is called restriction spectrum imaging-MRI or RSI-MRI. It corrects for magnetic field distortions and focuses upon water diffusion within tumor cells. By doing both, the ability of imaging to accurately plot a tumor\u2019s location is increased and there is a more refined sense of the tumor\u2019s extent, said Nathan White, PhD, assistant project scientist at UC San Diego, study co-author and co-inventor of the RSI-MRI technique.\n\nIn a related paper to be published in the journal Frontiers in Oncology, the same team of researchers reported that RSI-MRI appears to predict tumor grade. Higher grade tumors correlate with higher restricted water volume in the cancer cells\u2019 large nuclei.\n\n\u201cProstate cancer can often be an indolent disease, where a patient may only require surveillance rather than aggressive surgery,\u201d noted co-author Christopher J. Kane, MD, professor of urology at UC San Diego.\n\n\u201cIf by imaging we could predict the tumor grade,\u201d added Robert Reiter, MD, professor of urology at UCLA, \u201cwe may be able to spare some patients from prostate resection and monitor their cancer with imaging.\u201d\n\nCo-authors include senior author Anders M.

Additionally, they demonstrated that the DNA for all three human genes and one viral gene could be successfully extracted from urine, and they could identify such lesions with 75 percent sensitivity.\n\nTwo commercial tests based on markers of DNA chemical changes called methylation, released in Europe last summer, require Pap smears or swabs of cervical tissue, and show 64 percent sensitivity in identifying similar lesions, according to senior investigator Rafael Guerrero-Preston, Dr.P.H., M.P.H., assistant professor of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and member of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center.\n\n\"If further studies confirm these findings, we see a significant use of urine screening as a way to quickly and inexpensively determine if a biopsy is warranted, or if physicians can use a 'watch and wait' approach before intervening,\" says Guerrero-Preston. Typically, he says, a woman who tests positive for HPV and has an abnormal Pap smear undergoes a biopsy to rule out cervical cancer using cells taken directly from cervical tissue. But previous studies suggest more than 50 percent of these biopsies are unnecessary and can result in pain, worry, infertility and higher health care costs.\n\n\"Our urine test would serve as a molecular triage,\" he says, \"at times supplementing Pap test information. In developing countries that don't have the money, medical infrastructure or cultural approval for Pap test, our test could be used instead.\"\n\nThe new study builds on the Johns Hopkins team's previously published work, in which investigators identified three genes associated with cervical cancer or abnormal-looking cells known to become cancerous: FKBP6, INTS1 and ZNF516. As abnormalities progress, these genes were more likely to have a chemical methyl group attached to their DNA in certain spots.\n\nThe researchers tested the value of these genes as markers using 214 cervical cell samples collected from women undergoing Pap smears at Hospital Dr. Hernan Henriquez Aravena in Chile. The women ranged in age from 18 to 86. Among the test samples, 34 showed no abnormalities in their cervix; 87 showed one of three types of precancerous, abnormal tissue; and 90 showed clear evidence of cervical cancer.\n\nNext, Guerrero-Preston's team isolated DNA from each cervical tissue sample and used advanced genetic sequencing methods to spell out the DNA makeup of cells in the cervical tissue samples. The researchers then compared the number of methyl groups attached to each gene in samples from the 34 healthy women to 53 samples with a specific subset of precancerous markers.\n\nUsing methylation as a value to diagnose malignancy, the three genes together showed a 90 percent sensitivity, meaning that their presence was able to predict a true positive cancer sample this percentage of the time. The test had an 88.9 percent specificity, meaning the percent of time the test correctly identified someone without the disease.\n\nTo further improve the accuracy of the test, the investigators added a new gene marker to the test. This time, rather than using a human gene, they used one from the virus, HPV16-L1, which also becomes methylated in human cells as cancer develops. They did the test again with the four-gene combination on a new population of women from the University of Puerto Rico. The 115 women ranged in age from 21 to 49; 41 participants had healthy cervical tissue, and 74 had one of three types of precancerous cells. Using all four genes, the test now had a sensitivity of 90.9 percent and a specificity of 60.9 percent.\n\n\"When developing a new cancer screening test, we want something in the range of 90 to 95 percent sensitivity, which is competitive with the effectiveness of tests developed and now marketed in Europe,\" says Guerrero-Preston.\n\nThe next step, the researchers report, was to verify that the four-gene test worked using freely circulating DNA from blood and urine, rather than DNA taken directly from cervical tissue.\n\nFor this experiment, they tested 40 samples of paired cervical tissue, blood and urine from a subset of the patients from Puerto Rico. Using the DNA from blood, they found the test had an 85.7 percent sensitivity and a 60.9 percent specificity. Using urine, they found a 75 percent sensitivity and an 83.3 percent specificity.\n\nDuring the course of the study, the time to process cervical samples, blood or urine and get a test result took four days. They plan to continue modifying the test to improve the urine sensitivity to that of the cervical tissue samples.\n\nAccording to World Cancer Research Fund International, 84 percent of cervical cancers occur in less developed countries, with the highest rates in Africa, Latin American and the Caribbean. In the United States, cervical cancer used to be the highest cause of cancer deaths among women, but that soon changed when the yearly Pap smear was introduced over 40 years ago. Countries without the infrastructure or cultural acceptance for regular Pap tests have not seen declining cancer rates.\n\nGuerrero-Preston and his colleagues have a research agreement with Cepheid to develop a way to reduce the waiting time for a test result from a maximum of four days in the lab to under three hours in a Cepheid instrument using sealed cartridges to minimize sample handling and contamination.\n\nAdditional authors on the study include Blanca Valle, Anne Jedlicka, Nitesh Turaga, Oluwasina Folawiyo, Francesca Pirini, Fahcina Lawson, Angelo Vergura, Maartje Noorhuis, Amanda Dziedzic, Gabriela Perez, Marisa Renehan, Carolina Guerrero-Diaz, Bruce Trock Liliana Florea and David Sidransky of The Johns Hopkins University; Edgar De Jesus Rodriguez, Jose Rodriguez Orengo, Keimari Mendez and Josefina Romaguera of the University of Puerto Rico; and Teresa Diaz-Montes of the Institute for Cancer Care at Mercy.\n\nThe research was funded by National Cancer Institute grants (U01 CA084986, K01 CA164092 and U01 CA084986).", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The release suggests\u00a0that a urine test would be less costly than a Pap test, but it makes no effort to indicate what the cost is of either the proposed test or a Pap test.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Sun Pharma announced successful Phase 3 confirmatory clinical trial results for Seciera\u2122 (cyclosporine A, 0.09% ophthalmic solution), for the treatment of dry eye disease.

Atherosclerotic disease, in which plaque buildup narrows the brain arteries, is one of the most common causes of strokes.\n\nNeurosurgeons performing EDAS reroute arteries from the scalp and the membranes that cover the brain and place these arteries under the skull near areas of the brain at risk of stroke. Over time, new blood vessels form, creating fresh pathways for blood and oxygen to reach the brain.\n\nThe trial, led by Nestor R. Gonzalez, MD, professor of Neurosurgery and director of the Neurovascular Laboratory at Cedars-Sinai, enrolled 52 patients with severe brain atherosclerosis, also known as intracranial atherosclerotic disease, or ICAD, who showed symptoms of either a recent stroke or a mini-stroke, called a transient ischemic attack. These patients received EDAS surgery, along with intensive medical management, which included diet and lifestyle changes, blood thinners and other medications to control blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels.\n\nAfter one year, 9.6 percent of the patients treated with the surgery experienced another ischemic stroke or died, compared with 21.2 percent of patients in a matched control group who received only intensive medical management. Two of the EDAS patients had small wound openings that required additional surgical interventions, but there were no intracranial hemorrhages or other serious adverse events, the researchers reported.\n\n\"Our findings in this intermediate-stage trial are promising for applying EDAS surgery to intracranial atherosclerotic disease,\" said Gonzalez said. Previously, EDAS has been used for moyamoya disease, a rare cerebrovascular disorder that affects younger patients.\n\nGonzalez said the new trial addressed a serious medical need. \"Even under the best current treatments, ICAD carries high rates of recurrent stroke and death, compared with other causes of stroke,\" he said. \"Developing new therapeutic strategies is crucial for ICAD patients.\"\n\nCurrent ICAD therapies--in addition to intensive medical management--include bypass surgery to connect a blood vessel from outside the brain to a vessel inside the brain, as well as angioplasty with stenting, which involves inflating a tiny balloon inside a cerebral artery to open it up and placing a stent device inside the artery. Despite advances in medical care, annual rates of recurrent stroke and death are remain high, at 15 percent or more for ICAD patients, according to published research.\n\nGonzalez said his team is working with the stroke prevention working group of the National Institutes of Health to develop a proposal for a Phase III randomized clinical trial across multiple institutions to further test the effectiveness of EDAS as compared with intensive medical management. While this Phase IIa trial selected patients from previous studies as the control group, the Phase III study would enroll new ICAD patients for both the control and experimental groups, he explained.\n\n\"This clinical trial moves us significantly closer to preventing strokes and death in high-risk populations,\" said Keith Black, MD, professor and chair of the Department of Neurosurgery. \"As a nationally renowned physician-investigator, Dr. Gonzalez personifies the dedication of Cedars-Sinai to translating the most advanced research into new cures.\"\n\nBesides Gonzalez, the trial involved other investigators from the stroke centers of Cedars-Sinai and UCLA.\n\nFunding: Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Strokes of the National Institutes of Health under award number K23NS079477-01A1.", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The release doesn\u2019t mention cost although the surgical procedure used in the research is both already established practice and a complicated and extensive operation.\u00a0 Given that the surgery is being compared to simple medical management, the cost of the new approach will be substantially higher, and therefore deserves mention in this release.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "(Reuters Health) - People struggling with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) might feel better with antidepressants or psychotherapy, a recent study suggests.\n\nPeople with IBS typically suffer from chronic abdominal pain, gas, diarrhea and constipation.

But experts said the results are promising, and should prompt further studies.\n\n\"We just wanted to see if this is feasible, and this study shows that it is,\" said lead researcher Dr. Mark Cook, of the University of Melbourne and St. Vincent's Hospital in Australia.\n\nThe prospect of being able to predict seizures is \"very exciting,\" he said, in part because it's the uncertainty of the disorder that can dim people's quality of life.\n\nIf people know a seizure is coming, Cook said, they can avoid driving or swimming that day, for example. They might also be able to adjust their medication use.\n\nEpilepsy is a neurological disorder in which the brain's normal electrical activity is temporarily disrupted, leading to a seizure. Seizures can be obvious, causing unconsciousness or convulsions, but often they trigger subtler changes in a person's perceptions or behavior -- like a short staring spell, confusion or an altered sense of taste or smell.\n\nEpilepsy is usually managed with medication, but for 30 percent to 40 percent of people with the condition, drugs don't keep seizures at bay. The new study included 15 people who were having at least two to 12 \"disabling\" seizures a month that were resistant to drug therapy.\n\nCook's team implanted each patient with the experimental device, which consists of electrodes placed between the skull and the brain, plus wires that run to a unit implanted under the skin of the chest.\n\nThat unit wirelessly sends data to a hand-held device that flashes a red warning light if there is a \"high likelihood\" of an impending seizure. (A white light signals a \"moderate\" likelihood, while a blue light means the odds are low.)\n\nFor the first four months, the devices collected data on patients' seizures without actually flashing warnings. For 11 of the 15 patients, the implants seemed capable of correctly predicting a high risk of seizure at least 65 percent of the time. Those patients went on to the next four-month phase, where the devices were activated to give warnings.\n\nOver those four months, the implants worked fairly well for eight patients -- correctly giving the high-risk warning anywhere from 56 percent to 100 percent of the time.\n\nThere are plenty of questions left, said Dr. Ashesh Mehta, director of epilepsy surgery at the North Shore-LIJ Comprehensive Epilepsy Care Center in Great Neck, N.Y.\n\n\"This study is an important first step,\" said Mehta, who was not involved in the research. \"The next step would be to implant these in a larger sample of patients. And you need to see which groups of patients might be good candidates for this.\"\n\nMehta said someone who has seizures only once in a while might not get enough benefit to outweigh the downsides of false alarms, for example. And someone who has many seizures each month might get little added information from the warning system, he said.\n\nIt may be the people who fall in the middle -- who have disabling seizures at unpredictable intervals -- who would stand to benefit the most, he said.\n\nBut any benefits need to be weighed against the risks. Besides false alarms and unnecessary anxiety, the implant itself can cause problems. In this study, three patients had serious complications, including one with an infection and one whose chest device moved and caused her pain. Two patients ultimately had the implants removed.\n\nStill, Mehta agreed that the technology could prove helpful to some people with epilepsy. If they know a seizure is coming, they might take an extra dose of their medication, for example.\n\nAn implanted device like this could also give patients and their doctors more information about their epilepsy, he added. In this study, the implants revealed that most patients were suffering more seizures than they thought; one patient who reported 11 a month was actually having more than 100.\n\nIn real life, Mehta said, it can be hard to know if you're feeling bad because of side effects from epilepsy medication or because you're having a lot of seizures. A device like this could help sort that out.\n\nBut what's still needed is evidence that this device does improve the quality of patients' lives, Mehta said.\n\nThe study was funded by NeuroVista, the Seattle-based company developing the technology.

Lights out for the 69-year-old meant sleeping for a couple of hours before being jolted awake in the middle of the night and lying there electrified.\n\n\u201cI was exhausted all the time, from the time I woke to the time I went to bed,\u201d says Turner. \u201cIt was like how can I make it through this day because I am so tired? I thought since I'm older so that's what it is.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until a mother-daughter vacation that Turner\u2019s daughter noticed something interesting when her mother slept. Turner would make little gasping sounds throughout the night. This discovery, and the unrelenting exhaustion, led Turner to Stanford University where she underwent a sleep study. The doctors measured everything from brainwaves to breathing \u2014 what they found surprised Turner.\n\n\u201cIt was 41 times per hour that I would stop breathing,\u201d says Turner. \u201cAnd then the doctors looked piece by piece, and realized that what I have is sleep apnea.\u201d\n\nTurner\u2019s nightly interrupted breathing increased her chances of heart attack or stroke by three to four times, according to Dr. Robson Capasso, associate professor of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery at Stanford University.\n\nRoughly 18 million Americans suffer from sleep apnea and as many as 90 percent are undiagnosed, because gasps and choking sounds aren't always so severe they wake someone up. The condition more commonly affects men, as well as people who are overweight, over 40, and have large necks. Women with sleep apnea may suffer poorer heart health than men, according to a recent study.\n\nObstructive sleep apnea occurs when the soft tissues of the mouth and airway, especially the tongue, block air flow into the lungs. This causes breathing to stop multiple times throughout the night, and oxygen levels in the body to fall \u2014which was happening to Turner. The drop in oxygen while sleeping is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, say experts.\n\nAfter being diagnosed, Turner tried an external continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine, which proved too cumbersome for her continued use. What's more, a recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the bulky CPAP machines \u2014 standard treatment for many patients with sleep apnea \u2014 doesn't help prevent heart attacks or stroke, although it does help patients sleep better and improve mood.\n\nInstead, Turner underwent a relatively new procedure: implanting a pacemaker-like device called Inspire for obstructive sleep apnea. Approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2014, the device is a remote-controlled chest implant plus two thin wires that runs under the skin monitoring a patient\u2019s breath, delivering a mild electric current at night.\n\nA clinical trial of Inspire therapy found a 78 percent reduction in the number of sleep apnea events per hour for patients.\n\n\u201cThis is definitely an interesting solution for a good number of people,\u201d said Capasso.\n\nInspire is an invasive procedure, so it is not recommended as a first-line treatment and not everyone is a candidate.\n\nThe price tag for the Inspire device is $20,000, with surgery costing extra.

For Kothare, the out-of-pocket expense for the device, the risks of surgery, plus the potential for the mechanism \u2014which moves the tongue forward \u2014 to break, doesn\u2019t make it a viable option for everyone.\n\nThe main side effect from the device is that people can wake up with a sore tongue.

Symptoms include fever, cough, and rapid breathing. Chest X-ray is considered the test of choice for diagnosing pneumonia in children, but the WHO estimates three-quarters of the world's population does not have access to radiography.\n\nInvestigators conducted a randomized controlled trial in the pediatric Emergency Department at The Mount Sinai Hospital comparing lung ultrasound to chest X-ray in 191 children from birth to 21 years of age. The patients were randomly assigned into an investigational arm (received a lung ultrasound and if the physician needed additional verification, a chest X-ray) and a control arm (received a chest X-ray followed by a lung ultrasound). Researchers found a 38.8 percent reduction in chest X-rays in the investigational arm compared to no reduction in the control arm, with no missed pneumonia cases and no increase in any other adverse events.\n\nThe research team was led by James Tsung, MD, MPH, Associate Professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine and Department of Pediatrics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and former clinical fellow Brittany Pardue Jones, MD, who's currently Assistant Professor in the Department of Pediatrics at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.\n\n\"Ultrasound is portable, cost-saving and safer for children than an X-ray because it does not expose them to radiation,\" says Dr. Tsung. \"Our study could have a profound impact in the developing world where access to radiography is limited.\"\n\nFurthermore, the reduction in chest X-rays in the investigational arm resulted in an overall cost savings of $9,200, and length of stay in the Emergency Department was decreased by 26 minutes.\n\n\"In the era of precision medicine, lung ultrasound may also be an ideal imaging option in children who are at higher risk for radiation-induced cancers or have received multiple radiographic or CT imaging studies,\" says Dr. Tsung.\n\nAs more and more handheld ultrasound machines come to market, these results suggest that lung ultrasound has the potential to become the preferred choice for the diagnosis of pneumonia in children.

Harte, PhD, a research scientist at Randox Laboratories. \"This type of testing is important in our quest to understand and diagnose Alzheimer's and empower patients to understand risks, consider medication, and even make early lifestyle changes.\"\n\nThis test detects the presence of a protein in the blood produced by a specific variation of the apolipoprotein gene (ApoE4), which is associated with increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The apolipoprotein gene is inherited from each parent and when a patient inherits the ApoE4 variant from one parent they have a three times greater risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, whereas a patient who inherits ApoE4 from both parents is eight-to-12 times more likely to develop the disease.\n\nTo verify the accuracy of the biochip test, 384 samples were analyzed and results compared to those from a standard molecular diagnostic test. Researchers from Randox Laboratories collaborated with research colleagues at the Medical University of Vienna and found that results from the two tests were in 100% agreement. As biochip tests allow clinicians and researchers to quickly run multiple tests on one sample of blood, this new test is also faster and more affordable than the standard DNA test, producing results in only three hours. This enables doctors to predict the risk of an individual developing Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"Pairing this test with medical and family history for risk of Alzheimer's disease has the real potential to advance personalized medicine,\" said Harte. \"This fast, accurate testing will allow doctors and patients to make more informed choices earlier to potentially slow the possible progress of Alzheimer's.\"\n\nIn addition to this study, researchers will present the latest in Alzheimer's disease at the AACC Annual Scientific Meeting & Clinical Lab Expo, including:\n\u2022 New research explores using the level of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the brain and spinal cord as a biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease and AD. \"Cerebrospinal Fluid Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Activity Levels of Patients With Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease\" (A-118)\n\u2022 Researchers have shown that a specific protein in blood plasma could serve as a biomarker for early detection of AD. \"Plasma neuron derived exosomal protein biomarkers in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease\" (A-135)\n\u2022 A new meta-analysis of studies over 12 year suggests that a possible relationship between thyroid function and an increased risk of dementia. \"Higher FT4 or TSH Below the Normal Range are Associated with an Increased Risk of Dementia: a Meta-analysis of 10 Studies\" (A-180)\n\nSession Information \n\nRegistration for the AACC Annual Scientific Meeting is free for members of the media.

Many women with depression faced a difficult decision: continue their medication during pregnancy, potentially putting their child at risk, or jeopardize their own mental health by going off the drugs.\n\nThe FDA advisory pointed to a single study showing a six-fold increased risk of a condition called persistent pulmonary hypertension in newborns whose mothers were taking antidepressants.\n\nBut now a new, large-scale study finds that the risk is negligible -- much lower than previously believed, reports CBS Boston's Dr. Mallika Marshall.\n\nResearchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston looked at 3.8 million pregnant women nationwide and found that those taking popular antidepressants, called SSRIs, did not appear to be at significantly increased risk of having a baby with pulmonary hypertension.\n\n\"The risk increase of taking antidepressants late in pregnancy, if present, is much more modest than previous studies have found,\" says Krista Huybrechts, Ph.D., an epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital. \"So for women with severe debilitating depression that is not responsive to other non-pharmacological treatments, this should be reassuring information.\"\n\nIt's certainly reassuring news for Dr. Katherine Economy, a maternal fetal medicine specialist at the Brigham who cares for many pregnant women on antidepressants.\n\n\"They take them because they have a disease that impacts their daily life,\" Economy says. \"And for many women, they cannot get through their daily activities, getting out of bed, taking a shower, and preparing food for themselves.

Tests quickly revealed she had acute myeloid leukemia \u2014 a type of blood cancer that progresses quickly \u2014 and doctors told her that chemotherapy would probably not be enough; she would need a bone-marrow transplant.\n\nQuinn, who has a science background, knew that finding a donor would be difficult. In college, she had donated to a bone-marrow registry after learning that people like her, with a mixed racial heritage, have a much harder time than others finding a match.\n\nIn fact, when she and her doctors scoured the registry for a match for her, only one name came up: her own.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry,\u201d Quinn said.\n\nWhile searching unsuccessfully for a match for five months, Quinn underwent four cycles of chemotherapy to keep the leukemia at bay. What eventually saved her, though, was an experimental transplant using stem cells from the blood of a baby\u2019s umbilical cord, an approach that can be used without perfectly matching blood types.\n\nThis therapy and another \u2014 haploidentical transplantation, which uses bone-marrow cells that are only half-matched to a patient \u2014 have revolutionized the treatment of blood cancers in the past few years. Every biological child is a half-match for a parent, and vice versa.\n\n\u201cMany patients who previously died for lack of a match are now cured of their underlying malignancy,\u201d said Richard Jones, director of the bone-marrow transplant program at Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center.\n\nBone-marrow transplants, which infuse healthy blood cells taken from a donor, are used when chemotherapy and radiation fail to stop cancerous blood cells from taking over and ultimately destroying a person\u2019s immune system.\n\nThe transplant can be taken from either the blood or bone marrow, which produces blood cells. The procedure is typically preceded by high doses of chemotherapy and radiation that wipe out the patient\u2019s faulty blood cells and replace them with healthy ones from a donor.\n\nThe process is dangerous because it leaves a patient vulnerable to life-threatening infection for months before the reconstituted immune system begins to work.\n\nIn the past, a patient\u2019s body would reject as a foreign intruder anything but a perfect or near-perfect match, a usually fatal development. Umbilical-cord stem cells, however, are sort of a blank slate because they haven\u2019t been exposed to much life \u2014 such as bacteria and viruses \u2014 and thus are more easily accepted even if they aren\u2019t a perfect match.\n\nWhen Quinn\u2019s doctors found no match on the donor registry, she turned to a clinical trial examining the safety of taking blood cells from umbilical cords, expanding their numbers in a laboratory and then infusing them into patients.\n\nBecause each umbilical cord produces only a tiny number of stem cells, umbilical-cord transplants take longer to work than standard transplants, which makes patients more likely to get fatal infections. And if cells from several umbilical cords are used, the chances of immunity problems increase.\n\nThis expanded cord-blood technique has been a \u201chuge home run\u201d for patients, said Colleen Delaney of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, who helped create it.\n\n\u201cNo one had successfully taken stem cells and gotten them to grow and put back in a person,\u201d she said. The advance should be particularly valuable for minorities and people of mixed-race background, whose chances of finding a matched donor were slim to none.\n\n\u201cThis is where cord blood becomes an amazing and beautiful resource,\u201d Delaney said. \u201cWe can find cord-blood donors for 99 percent of patients who cannot find a donor.\u201d\n\nQuinn was hospitalized for 30 days, and she said the recovery was difficult but relatively uneventful. Mostly she had to deal with overwhelming fatigue for the first year. She also developed graft-versus-host disease, which caused rashes when her skin was exposed to the sun. But she has been free of cancer for five years.\n\nShe remembers learning that she had leukemia and assuming that she would soon die.\n\n\u201cIt still gives me pause \u2014 I went to Costa Rica \u2014 that I am able to travel and went backpacking and kayaking,\u201d Quinn says. \u201cI was so sure I would never get to do those things again. It\u2019s an indescribable feeling.\u201d\n\nIn haploidential transplants, rather than wiping out the patient\u2019s immune system, doctors use just enough drugs to suppress it. This reduces the risk of damaging organs or causing a rejection of the donated marrow.\n\n\u201cParents are always haploidentical. Children are always haploidentical,\u201d Jones said. \u201cSiblings are half the time and all second-degree relatives (grandchildren, nieces, nephews) have a 50 percent chance of being a half-match. . . . Everybody now has a donor, and that is a major advance.\u201d\n\nYet doctors and patients may not be aware there are choices other than conventional bone-marrow transplants, Jones said.\n\n\u201cDespite the recent data showing equivalency of half-matched and cord-blood transplants with conventional matched transplants, many cancer doctors and even some transplant doctors still consider these newer transplants not standard practice,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere are still lots of patients in need of transplants that are not getting them because of lack of matched donors, and that is unacceptable in the year 2016.\u201d\n\nJones estimates that about 7,500 transplants of donated stem cells were done in 2014 \u2014 primarily for leukemia and lymphoma but also for nonmalignant blood disorders such as sickle cell and aplastic anemia \u2014 but that more than 15,000 could easily be done annually if more doctors embraced the new methods now available.\n\nGregg Gordon, 44, developed leukemia in 2011.

Of those who survive, about 70 percent will be left disabled, making the cardiac event a major cause of adult disability. While there are therapies to help improve patients' mobility, they\u2019re only effective within the first few hours of an event.\n\nRecently, researchers from the Stanford University School of Medicine have made it their mission to improve these outcomes. They hypothesized that injecting stem cells into the brains of chronic stroke patients would increase their survival rates. And in a clinical trial testing the technique, researchers found injections can safely improve patients' motor function.\n\n\u201cWhat surprised us most was the remarkable recovery some patients had,\u201d Dr. Gary Steinberg, professor and chair of neurosurgery at Stanford, told Medical Daily, \u201cWhile we had hoped for that, we didn\u2019t really expect it. Patients recover from strokes over the first six months, and then there\u2019s very little recovery [after that]. You know, they go to rehab and there\u2019s not much more [more] they can recover usually.\u201d\n\nFor the study, Steinberg and his team recruited 18 patients who had suffered their first and only stroke six months to three years prior to the trial. Each patient had a small hole drilled through their skulls in order for researchers to be able to inject stem cells taken from the bone marrow of two donors directly into parts of their brains that were damaged from stroke. After patients were sent home, researchers continued to monitor their health through blood tests, clinical evaluations, and brain imaging.\n\nResults showed that the implanted stem cells didn\u2019t survive very long in the brain, disappearing about one to two months after injections; however, patients still showed significant motor recovery at six and 12 months post-surgery. Some of the patients bound to wheelchairs were even able to walk again.\n\n\u201cThe recovery some patients showed was not just minimal, it was significant,\u201d said Steinberg, who has researched stem cell therapies for more than 15 years. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just someone who couldn\u2019t move their thumb now being able to move their thumb, [it was more profound than that].\"\n\nThe types of stem cells used, called mesenchymal stem cells, can differentiate into a variety of cell types. In other words, they are the precursors to muscle, fat, bone, and tendon tissue. Past research has shown that these cells can be used to treat the effects of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, brain damage caused by loss of oxygen.\n\nIn Steinberg's study, it did not \u201ccause problems by differentiating into unwanted tissues or forming tumors.\u201d And even when the stem cells came from an unrelated donor, the participants did not experience a strong immune reaction. Although more than 75 percent of patients reported suffering headaches afterward, the researchers said it was probably due to the surgical procedure rather than the stem cells themselves. Furthermore, there were no life-threatening effects linked to the procedure used to administer them.\n\nMotor improvement was also independent of the severity of the stroke patients\u2019 conditions\u2014 an important detail considering older adults tend to respond less to treatment, the researchers said.\n\nIn addition to setting the stage for an expanded trial of the procedure, the promising results also change \u201cour notion of what happens after a stroke,\u201d Steinberg explained. The findings suggest that stroke-damaged areas of the brain, once thought to be dead or irreversible, can actually be \u201cresurrected.\u201d\n\nSource: Steinberg G, Kondziolka D, Wechsler L, et al.

The firm, which markets itself as \u201cThe Women\u2019s Health Company,\u201d makes other products, including a 2-D digital mammography machine, a test that assesses risk of preterm labor, gynecological products, including Adiana (a permanent contraception technique), and widely used equipment that measures bone density. But 3-D mammography could become its flagship, because for the moment it owns the entire market \u2013 although other companies, including powerhouse GE, are developing their own 3-D machines, Hologic is the only one with FDA approval thus far. Of course, given the sluggish economy and the continuing state of uncertainty around American health care, persuading hospitals to upgrade may be challenging. So perhaps it\u2019s not surprising that the company\u2019s PowerPoint presentation to the FDA included the unsubtle phrase \u201chuge breakthrough,\u201d or that the first American patient to undergo 3-D mammography \u2013 Laura Lang, a polished 55-year-old Boston marketing executive and breast cancer survivor \u2013 did so in front of a CBS camera crew last February.\n\nIndeed they do. They\u2019re catching on like \u2013 well, it\u2019s not a slow burn. The device earned Food and Drug Administration approval on February 11, and for a short time it was available only at MGH. Now it is available in at least nine states, three of which have multiple sites, and most of the several dozen hospitals around the United States that assisted with clinical trials are planning to buy systems, too. The images aren\u2019t the only selling point. The early data are compelling as well. In studies presented to the FDA, radiologists reported a 7 percent improvement in their ability to distinguish cancerous from noncancerous cases when they used the new system. If that sounds unimpressive, consider that 39 million women are screened each year; any significant reduction in callbacks for additional testing would mean hundreds of thousands of women would be spared painful, and expensive, follow-up.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Rafferty is trying not to lapse into rhapsodic cliches. \u201cI don\u2019t want to call it a magic bullet, because that would oversell,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a panacea.\u201d Then, five minutes later: \u201cI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s catching on like wildfire.\u201d After a few minutes more, though, Rafferty can\u2019t help herself. She lets her enthusiasm loose. \u201cPeople have been waiting for it for a long time,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a step, but it\u2019s a step by a person who has a stride of 7 feet.\u201d \u201cIt\u201d is a 3-D mammography machine, the Selenia Dimensions system, one of which sits in the breast imaging clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital that Rafferty, a radiologist, runs. The machine, which is made by the Bedford company Hologic and developed partly at MGH under Rafferty\u2019s supervision, produces images that are so vivid and clear they seem to speak out loud: \u201cHey, right here! This is a tumor!\u201d If you look at enough of them, you may become convinced that you don\u2019t need medical training to spot a case of breast cancer or distinguish a false positive on a mammogram from a true one. The distinction seems that clear. \u201cIf you can tell the difference as a non-radiologist, imagine how a radiologist feels,\u201d says Rafferty. \u201cThe images sort of sell themselves.\u201d\n\nMuch of the criticism focused on the data the task force had used to make its decision, which consisted largely of the results from prospective, randomized clinical trials conducted in the United States. Trials like this are the gold standard of medical evidence. They are also expensive and time-consuming, and thus hard to come by. The most recent such trial looking at mammography and mortality in the United States was published in the 1980s. \u201cA lot of the people on the task force are my friends, and I have tremendous respect for them, but this was a big point where we differed,\u201d says Brawley. \u201cThe standard type of mammography that\u2019s used all over the country today may very well be better than what was used in that trial. So the outcomes may be better, too.\u201d The studies the task force had chosen to examine showed that screening beginning at age 40 had little impact on mortality while at the same time generating a significant number of false positives. Those data were complete and comprehensive. But, says Brawley, they were outdated.\n\nThe task force wasn\u2019t expecting a firestorm. That, however, was what it got. Breast cancer advocacy groups mutinied, saying the guidelines would cause significant numbers of women to go undiagnosed for years, some of them fatally. Politicians started giving scary speeches about rationing health care. Many radiologists \u2013 including the MGH department as a whole \u2013 rejected the new guidelines. Daniel Kopans, a world leader in breast imaging (he wrote the textbook of that name) and a radiologist at MGH, now says that the panel didn\u2019t \u201cunderstand mammography screening.\u201d Furthermore, he adds, the new guidelines had \u201cno biological or scientific reason\u201d behind them.\n\nThe last time someone tried to improve the way American women are screened for breast cancer, it turned into a national debacle. In November 2009, the US Preventive Services Task Force, a government-backed group of doctors charged with making recommendations that often influence what insurers will pay for, updated its guidelines for mammography. Previously, it had advised women to begin annual or biannual screening at 40. The new guidelines pushed that age to 50, emphasizing that starting earlier should be an individual choice.\n\nDebates about mammography are often so emotionally charged that this type of nuance goes missing. \u201cI think some of our rhetoric \u2013 medicine\u2019s in general, and also that of advocates?\u2013 has made people think that every metastatic breast cancer is a failure of the woman to get a mammogram or of a doctor to read a mammogram correctly,\u201d says Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society and a professor at Emory University\u2019s School of Medicine in Atlanta. \u201cIn reality, yes, mammography does save lives \u2013 but it is far from perfect. It\u2019s not as good as many people think it is.\u201d So if the new 3-D mammography isn\u2019t perfect, just how good is it?\n\nBut the company, and the rest of us, should be careful not to overhype 3-D mammography. As Rafferty says, it\u2019s not a panacea. The technology does come with costs, financial and medical. A fully equipped 3-D machine runs on average $474,541, not including the annual service fee Hologic charges for maintenance, and even hospitals that already own an upgradeable 2-D system made by Hologic have to pay about $125,000 to get it adapted for 3-D use. There are also costs in the sense of risks: Women who get a combo 2-D and 3-D mammogram, the protocol that confers the most dramatic jump in benefits, are exposed to twice as much X-ray radiation as the norm (albeit still an amount that\u2019s under the FDA\u2019s permitted limit). And no one yet knows if the new technique will actually save lives.\n\nIs Hologic's 3-D mammography machine likely to fare better? There are reasons to think it will. Unlike MRI, which requires an injection with contrast dye and an hour in the imaging machine, it isn\u2019t an ordeal \u2013 or at least it\u2019s no worse than a conventional mammogram. (Yes, you still have to endure the dreaded clamp.) And it seems to be more effective than its most similar precursor, the 2-D digital technique. Early data from Rafferty\u2019s trial showed that the same group of women who did benefit from 2-D digital benefited even more dramatically from 3-D. (It\u2019s worth noting that this is not a small group of people. Fifty percent of women are in what the American Cancer Society considers the \u201cintermediate zone\u201d of risk, which overlaps considerably with the group that saw some benefit in DMIST.) Perhaps more important, even the women who didn\u2019t see any improvement in accuracy with 2-D get a small boost with 3-D over film. And 3-D seems to be both more sensitive and more specific \u2013 improvement in one area doesn\u2019t have to come at the cost of the other.\n\nBut when the definitive trial of 2-D digital techniques, called DMIST, was published in 2005, tracking nearly 50,000 patients, it didn\u2019t provide the answers that advocates had been expecting. Digital mammography did seem to perform more accurately than film in women who were younger than 50, women who were pre- or perimenopausal, and women with dense breast tissue. But when all women were considered as a group, that benefit disappeared. On the whole, it turned out, digital just didn\u2019t live up to the way it had been sold.\n\nWhen 2-D digital mammography was introduced in 2000, doctors hoped it would vault over those problems. (Well, most of them. The cost concern was still present: Digital mammography machines were five times as expensive as film ones.) The marketing materials suggested it already had. An ad for GE\u2019s 2-D digital system that ran during the Summer Olympics called it a \u201cmajor new breakthrough in the fight against breast cancer.\u201d Digital technology, the thinking went, would show nuances that film never could, because it could render, literally, many more shades of gray.\n\nThe problem, however, was that each time they introduced a new imaging tool for breast cancer, they found that they could not advance on one front without taking a step backward on the other. \u201cFirst there was ultrasound,\u201d says Rafferty. \u201cWe did find more cancers, but we also found so many false positives that it was untenable.\u201d Then there was MRI, which had the same problem \u2013 and it was 10 times more expensive than mammography.\n\nRafferty had already been running trials of 3-D mammography for two years when the task force\u2019s guidelines came out. She understood its concern about false positives \u2013 she was trying to address it, herself, albeit in a very different way. In fact, technology developers had been trying in various ways for years to increase mammography\u2019s sensitivity (its ability to flag possible cases of cancer) while also increasing its specificity (its ability to filter out the false positives).\n\nThere\u2019s an intuitive argument for why 3-D mammography might be more accurate. The technique works a little like a CT scan does; it takes 15 pictures of the breast at slightly different angles, then fuses them into a single synthesized image. If breast cancers were spherical in shape, they\u2019d look basically the same in all 15 images, or, for that matter, on a conventional 2-D picture. But they\u2019re very rarely shaped that way in reality. \u201cIn the breast, in particular, cancer cells tend to creep out single-file along the architecture of the body,\u201d says Rafferty. \u201cAnd that makes some of them especially hard to see on a [2-D] mammogram. They look like distortions, not blobs.\u201d There\u2019s another thing about cancer that is much clearer on a 3-D mammogram: spicules, or thin, spidery tentacles emerging from the center of a tumor. 2-D images, when taken from the wrong angle, are often too fuzzy to show them. In 3-D, however, the spicules are visible in high resolution \u2013 and seeing them is critical, since they are a hallmark of malignancy.\n\nTo Rafferty, the existing data are persuasive enough. \u201cI own no stock in Hologic. I have no financial ties to them. And I was skeptical of this idea at first. You think to yourself, it is that simple? That elegant?\u201d she says. \u201cBut this really does address the fundamental flaw of mammography. I want every woman to have access to this technology. I got my sisters down here when it was approved. I was like, \u2018You\u2019re all going to get this!\u2019 Because in my heart I know it\u2019s better.\u201d\n\nAndy Smith, Hologic\u2019s vice president of imaging science, is similarly hopeful. \u201cIt\u2019s expected to improve the cancer detection rate. It is going to reduce the recall rate,\u201d he says, referring to suspicious findings that require women to return for follow-up tests, some of which turn out to be false alarms. \u201cAnd we will have more numbers on that within one to two years.\u201d This last part, at least, is very likely true. Mammography is heavily regulated, and clinics are required to send their recall statistics \u2013 the number of women they call back for second looks \u2013 to the federal government. The data on whether 3-D will save more lives than 2-D may not be known immediately. But they will exist.\n\nHowever, the most meaningful data \u2013 the numbers that would show whether 3-D mammography saves women\u2019s lives \u2013 won\u2019t be available for decades. Only a prospective, randomized trial with mortality as its \u201cendpoint\u201d can say for sure, and that\u2019s how long it takes to conduct one. Smith knows that that\u2019s the reality. \u201cWe are expecting a reduction in morbidity and mortality, but we won\u2019t know that for a long time,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know, this technology has only been approved for two months.\u201d\n\nBy the time such data do come out, mammography will surely have changed again. There are already efforts to augment it with contrast dyes, to develop a complementary tool called a \u201cgamma camera,\u201d and to augment imperfect human judgment by refining computer programs that can spot tumors as well as a radiologist might.\n\nWhat this means is that the next time the US Preventive Services Task Force or anyone else wants to take a hard look at mammography, the data it has will once again be outdated. It\u2019s inevitable. Three-D mammography may very well be more accurate than 2-D. It may see more cancers and fewer impostors. But whether it\u2019s truly a \u201chuge breakthrough\u201d by the metric that matters most is a question that can\u2019t currently be answered \u2013 and that may be irrelevant by the time it can be. Rafferty may know \u201cin her heart\u201d that 3-D is better.

Winer, chief of women\u2019s cancers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said that even women who completed their five years of tamoxifen months or years ago might consider starting on the drug again.\n\nTamoxifen blocks the effect of the hormone estrogen, which fuels tumor growth in estrogen receptor-positive cancers that account for about 65 percent of cases in premenopausal women. Some small studies in the 1990s suggested that there was no benefit to using tamoxifen longer than five years, so that has been the standard.\n\nAbout 227,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year in the United States, and an estimated 30,000 of them are in premenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive cancer and prime candidates for tamoxifen. But postmenopausal women also take tamoxifen if they cannot tolerate the alternative drugs, known as aromatase inhibitors.\n\nThe new study, known as Atlas, included nearly 7,000 women with ER-positive disease who had completed five years of tamoxifen. They came from about three dozen countries. Half were chosen at random to take the drug another five years, while the others were told to stop.\n\nIn the group assigned to take tamoxifen for 10 years, 21.4 percent had a recurrence of breast cancer in the ensuing 10 years, meaning the period 5 to 14 years after their diagnoses. The recurrence rate for those who took only five years of tamoxifen was 25.1 percent.\n\nAbout 12.2 percent of those in the 10-year treatment group died from breast cancer, compared with 15 percent for those in the control group.\n\nThere was virtually no difference in death and recurrence between the two groups during the five years of extra tamoxifen. The difference came in later years, suggesting that tamoxifen has a carry-over effect that lasts long after women stop taking it.\n\nWhether these differences are big enough to cause women to take the drug for twice as long remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cThe treatment effect is real, but it\u2019s modest,\u201d said Dr. Paul E. Goss, director of breast cancer research at the Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nTamoxifen has side effects, including endometrial cancer, blood clots and hot flashes, which cause many women to stop taking the drug. In the Atlas trial, it appears that roughly 40 percent of the patients assigned to take tamoxifen for the additional five years stopped prematurely.\n\nSome 3.1 percent of those taking the extra five years of tamoxifen got endometrial cancer versus 1.6 percent in the control group. However, only 0.6 percent of those in the longer treatment group died from endometrial cancer or pulmonary blood clots, compared with 0.4 percent in the control group.\n\n\u201cOver all, the benefits of extended tamoxifen seemed to outweigh the risks substantially,\u201d Trevor J. Powles of the Cancer Center London, said in a commentary published by The Lancet.\n\nDr. Judy E. Garber, director of the Center for Cancer Genetics and Prevention at Dana-Farber, said many women have a love-hate relationship with hormone therapies.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t feel well on them, but it\u2019s their safety net,\u201d said Dr. Garber, who added that the news would be welcomed by many patients who would like to stay on the drug. \u201cI have patients who agonize about this, people who are coming to the end of their tamoxifen.\u201d\n\nEmily Behrend, who is a few months from finishing her five years on tamoxifen, said she would definitely consider another five years. \u201cIf it can keep the cancer away, I\u2019m all for it,\u201d said Ms. Behrend, 39, a single mother in Tomball, Tex. She is taking the antidepressant Effexor to help control the night sweats and hot flashes caused by tamoxifen.\n\nCost is not considered a huge barrier to taking tamoxifen longer because the drug can be obtained for less than $200 a year.\n\nThe results, while answering one question, raise many new ones, including whether even more than 10 years of treatment would be better still.\n\nPerhaps the most important question is what the results mean for postmenopausal women. Even many women who are premenopausal at the time of diagnosis will pass through menopause by the time they finish their first five years of tamoxifen, or will have been pushed into menopause by chemotherapy.\n\nPostmenopausal patients tend to take aromatase inhibitors like anastrozole or letrozole, which are more effective than tamoxifen at preventing breast cancer recurrence, though they do not work for premenopausal women.\n\nMr. Peto said he thought the results of the Atlas study would \u201capply to endocrine therapy in general,\u201d meaning that 10 years of an aromatase inhibitor would be better than five years. Other doctors were not so sure.\n\nThe Atlas study was paid for by various organizations including the United States Army, the British government and AstraZeneca, which makes the brand-name version of tamoxifen.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Clearly stated.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Ohio\u2019s roads stink.

It also doesn't change the very limited treatment choices.\n\nBut the new criteria, which were developed by the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association, are almost guaranteed to prompt confusion, even in people who are thinking quite clearly.\n\nThe guidelines say, for instance, that newly developed \"biomarker\" tests, such as assays for proteins in spinal fluid, and some specialized brain scans can be used for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's. But, the guidelines say, the tests are to be used only for research, and not for diagnosing Alzheimer's in the general public.\n\nThe distinction is nothing to worry about for patients and their families. \"You don't need a biomarker test\" for everyday clinical practice, says David Knopman, a professor of neurology at the Mayo Clinic, who was co-chairman of the group that revised the dementia diagnosis. The existing tests for Alzheimer's are adequate, he says. And those biomarkers? \"It's in the fine print, but it definitely says in multiple places that the biomarkers are for research purposes.\"\n\nWhy? Well, the biomarker tests and PET scans aren't yet accurate enough to reliably diagnose Alzheimer's, and haven't been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. And it's also because there are no treatments that can prevent, slow or stop early signs of Alzheimer's.\n\n\"For research, there's a lot of value,\" Knopman says. \"For everyday clinical use, very very little.\"\n\nAbout 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's. The hallmark signs are problems with thinking, learning, and memory. The current definition, created in 1984, describes Alzheimer's that way. But over the past few years there's been solid evidence that Alzheimer's starts damaging the brain years before a person starts having noticeable problems thinking. Scientists have been putting a lot of effort into trying to identify what starts the disease process, but have so far come up empty.\n\nThe new definitions, which were just published online by the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia, acknowledge this dimly understood early phase of Alzheimer's. Now there are two new pre-dementia phases: mild cognitive impairment and \"preclinical Alzheimer's.\"\n\nIn mild cognitive impairment, a person's changes in thinking are noticeable to himself, friends, or family. They would show up on tests of memory and recall, but don't interfere with everyday activities. Alzheimer's is just one possible cause. Because there are no treatments to prevent or stop Alzheimer's, many people may not consider this diagnosis a blessing.\n\nThe second new phase, preclinical Alzheimer's, is much squishier. There's no list of symptoms that a doctor can whip out to say you've got it. Rather, the goal in creating this category is to see if scientists can define when the disease starts, and track it through biomarker tests, brain imaging, or other yet-to-be-invented tests. If that happens, it might someday lead to ways to prevent Alzheimer's. But for now this category is useful only to researchers.\n\nThe goal in all this, according to the Alzheimer's Association, is to increase opportunities for earlier diagnosis and treatment. The problem is that there aren't yet any reliable tools for earlier diagnosis and treatment. The new criteria are really a call for more research \u2014 and the money to fund it. That would be good for the Alzheimer's Association and the National Institute on Aging, which sponsored the work on the new criteria.\n\nAnd it does leave one wondering if a lot more worry will be generated by the notion of \"preclinical Alzheimer's,\" when science and medicine can't offer anything to ease those fears.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "\n\n\nThe story clearly points out that brain scans and biomarker tests are \u201care to be used only for research, and not for diagnosing Alzheimer\u2019s in the general public.\u201d Since there are no recommended changes that directly affect readers today, and since it is not known which diagnostic tests may eventually prove useful, it is reasonable to put off discussions of cost.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "MONDAY, Sept. 27, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- In a head-to-head comparison of drug-coated stents -- the metal mesh tubes used to keep clogged arteries open -- the well-established model using the drug sirolimus came out on top, South Korean researchers report.\n\nA newer version, one coated with zotarolimus, fell short, the study found.\n\nCoating stents with time-released drugs can help prevent infection or clogging in stents, but researchers have questioned the safety and effectiveness of different coatings.\n\n\"Drug-coated stents have reduced re-stenosis rates compared to bare metal stents, but require prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy to prevent clotting of the drug-coated stent,\" said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, an American Heart Association spokesman. \"There has been great interest in developing stents coated with alternative drugs and different polymers,\" he explained.\n\nThe study was released online Sept. 27 ahead of print publication in the Oct. 5 issue of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.\n\nIn preventing major cardiac events, the researchers found that zotarolimus-coated stents, the new entry in the field, were less effective than the sirolimus-eluting stents, but better than stents coated with paclitaxel.\n\n\"Similar to other comparative stent trials, the sirolimus-eluting stent seemed to come out ahead in safety and efficacy,\" said Fonarow, who is also a cardiology professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nFor the study, a team led by Dr. Duk-Woo Park from the University of Ulsan College of Medicine and Asan Medical Center in Seoul randomly assigned 2,645 patients undergoing angioplasty, a procedure to restore blood flow through the artery, to one of the three stents.\n\nAfter a year, Park's team tallied the number of adverse cardiac events the patients experienced, including death, heart attack and the need for a new angioplasty on the same artery in which the stent was placed.\n\nThe researchers found that 10.2 percent of the patients who received zotarolimus-coated stents suffered a major adverse cardiac event, compared with 8.3 percent of the patients who received sirolimus-coated stents and 14.1 percent of those with paclitaxel-coated stents.\n\nThe number of heart attacks and deaths was about the same in each group, but the rate of blood clots in the stents was significantly lower with sirolimus-eluting stents, Park's team also found.\n\n\"In this large-scale, practical randomized trial, the use of zotarolimus-eluting stents resulted in similar rates of major adverse cardiac events compared with sirolimus-eluting stents and in fewer major adverse cardiac events compared with paclitaxel-eluting stents at 12 months,\" the researchers concluded in their report.\n\nHowever, they said a limitation of their study is the one-year follow-up period, and noted that a longer, ongoing study pitting zotarolimus-eluting stents against sirolimus-eluting stents will provide more safety information.\n\nThe trial was partially funded by Medtronic, maker of the zotarolimus-eluting stent.\n\nFonarow said the study results can help cardiologists arrive at treatment decisions. \"These studies help to better inform interventional cardiologists in the optimal choice of drug-eluting stents for their patients being treated for coronary artery disease,\" Fonarow said.\n\nFor more information on stents, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Costs aren\u2019t discussed.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Monitoring high-risk pregnancies with ultrasound tests may help prevent some fetal and newborn deaths, a new research review finds.\n\nThe review assessed a technology called Doppler ultrasound, which measures blood flow through the umbilical cord. Abnormal findings indicate that the fetus may be under stress.\n\nDoppler ultrasound, done in the third trimester, is an established way to monitor high-risk pregnancies \u2014 those complicated by problems like poor fetal growth or health conditions in the mother, such as high blood pressure and heart and kidney diseases.\n\nStill, the benefits of such monitoring had not been entirely clear. There have been concerns that abnormal findings on Doppler ultrasound may prompt doctors to sometimes unnecessarily intervene \u2014 by, for instance, performing a cesarean section.\n\nBut in the new review, researchers found that across 16 studies of more than 10,000 high-risk pregnancies, Doppler ultrasound testing was linked to a 29 percent reduction in fetal and newborn deaths.\n\nAmong women who did not receive ultrasound monitoring, 1.7 percent suffered a fetal or newborn death, versus 1.2 percent of women who underwent ultrasound.\n\nThe benefit seemed to stem from better decisions on C-sections and inductions of labor, according to the researchers, led by Dr. Zarko Alfirevic of the University of Liverpool in the UK.\n\nHe and his colleagues report their review findings in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, which is published by the Cochrane Collaboration, an international research organization that evaluates medical studies.\n\nIn an interview, Alfirevic said that the evidence supports using Doppler in high-risk pregnancies where the mother has high blood pressure or the fetus is abnormally small. In these cases, the fetus may not be getting enough nutrients and oxygen through the placenta.\n\n\u201cThese women really should have a Doppler investigation of the umbilical artery,\u201d Alfirevic said.

Age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, is the leading cause of vision loss among seniors, gradually eroding crucial central vision. There are different forms but more than 5 million people worldwide, and a million in the U.S., have an advanced type of so-called \u201cdry\u201d macular degeneration that has no treatment. First patients may notice blurriness when they look straight ahead. Eventually many develop blank spots, becoming legally blind.\n\n\u201cThese are seniors who are entering their golden years and now they\u2019ve lost the ability to read, watch television, see their loved ones,\u201d said Dr. Rahul Khurana, a retina specialist and spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. The experimental drug, lampalizumab, aims to slow the destruction of light-sensing cells in the retina, creeping lesions that characterize the stage of dry AMD called \u201cgeographic atrophy.\u201d When those cells die, they can\u2019t grow back \u2014 the vision loss is irreversible.\n\nIn an 18-month study of 129 patients, monthly eye injections of the drug modestly slowed worsening of the disease when compared with patients given dummy shots. What\u2019s exciting for scientists came next, when researchers from drugmaker Genentech Inc. took a closer look at exactly who was being helped. It turns out that nearly 6 in 10 of the study\u2019s participants carry a gene variation that makes part of the immune system go awry \u2014 a genetic flaw already known to increase the risk of getting macular degeneration in the first place. Those are the only patients who appeared to benefit from the drug; they had 44 per cent less eye damage than the untreated patients, the Genentech team reported Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine. While the study is too small to prove if lampalizumab really helps maintain vision, that\u2019s a bigger difference than the overall results suggested. Why would an immune-related gene affect aging eyes? One arm of the immune system, the complement pathway, helps fight infections by attracting immune cells to attack bacteria.\n\nNormally, there\u2019s a barrier that keeps such cells away from the retina. But that barrier can break down with age, opening sensitive eye cells to harm from the spillover, explained Genentech immunologist Menno van Lookeren Campagne. Now for the gene connection: Previous studies have linked macular degeneration to gene variations that remove some of that pathway\u2019s natural brakes, so it can become too active.\n\nThe hypothesis: Genentech\u2019s drug, lampalizumab, essentially offers a backup method for tamping down the immune reaction. An antibody, it works by inhibiting a particular enzyme named factor D that helps power the immune pathway. \u201cWe try to reinsert the braking ability,\u201d said study lead author Brian Yaspan, a Genentech senior scientist. Wednesday\u2019s study detected no safety concerns, clearing the way for Genentech and its parent company Roche to open two large-scale studies that aim to prove if the drug works. Results are expected later this year. The current research sheds light on how that long-suspected immune culprit might be working, and is \u201cthe first suggestion that there may be a treatment for geographic atrophy coming up in the future,\u201d said National Eye Institute retina specialist Dr. Wai Wong, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very exciting study,\u201d said Khurana, the ophthalmologist association\u2019s spokesman, who also wasn\u2019t part of the research. \u201cFrom the basic science perspective, it makes a lot of sense.\u201d Macular degeneration tends to occur after age 60, but it sometimes strikes earlier. According to the National Eye Institute, it\u2019s less common in people who exercise regularly, avoid smoking, and eat a diet high in green leafy vegetables and fish. Symptoms often aren\u2019t noticeable early on. But several eye tests can detect signs of macular degeneration, including a dilated eye exam and a tool called an Amsler grid with straight lines that may look wavy if the macula, the centre of the retina, is harmed. Macular degeneration patients often are advised to take certain vitamin combinations that may help stave off advanced disease. And it\u2019s important for patients to know what type they have.

At a week old, doctors amputated his dead forearm and hand. They were afraid his body would be become infected and he would die. Falardeau mourned her boy's missing arm for years but, in time, embraced her son as he was.\n\nWyatt also learned to adapt. They tried a couple of prosthetics when he was younger and each time the toddler abandoned the false limb within months.\n\n\"His main interest was to create a shocking response from onlookers by pulling it off in the grocery store,\" Falardeau wrote on CNN iReport . In truth, she had been more concerned about getting him therapy for his autism-related delays -- the limb difference was secondary.\n\nSo when a friend shared a story from the \"Today Show\" with Wyatt in mind, about a team of University of Central Florida (UCF) students and graduates that made an electronic arm for 6-year-old Pring using a three-dimensional printer on campus, Falardeau was defensive.\n\n\"He doesn't need this,\" she thought.\n\nHer fifth-grader had a different reaction: \"I want one of these robot arms!\" Falardeau remembers Wyatt telling her and her husband. \"I could ride a bike! I might even be able to paddle a kayak!\"\n\nThere were other things the 12-year-old boy said he would do if he had two hands. A proper somersault. Clap with two hands. Dance with a pretty girl with one hand on her back and the other leading. Stuff she hadn't really thought about but he clearly had.\n\nFalardeau got in touch with the Orlando students through E-Nable , an online volunteer organization started by Rochester Institute of Technology research scientist Jon Schull to match people who have 3-D printers with children in need of hands and arms. The organization creates and shares bionic arm designs for free download at EnablingTheFuture.org that can be assembled for as little as $20 to $50. Middle and high school student groups and Girl and Boy Scout troops are among those donating their time and materials to assemble limbs for kids and give them to recipients for free.\n\n\"It's really just a step-by-step process of solving problems. The first problem we solved was: how do we make the hand move electronically? And then: how do we attach this arm to a child?\" said sophomore Tyler Petresky. \"It's just one problem after another we keep solving. That's what engineering is all about.\"\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about 1,500 babies in the United States are born with upper limb deformities each year. Comprehensive statistics aren't available for the number of children with amputations, such as Wyatt.\n\nThe UCF project started when Albert Manero, an engineering doctoral student, heard a story on the radio about one of the inventors of the 3-D printed hand. He got involved with E-Nable and met Alex, a local boy teased because of his missing arm, and set about designing a robotic replacement. They gave it to Alex for free.\n\nEach electronic limb takes about 30 to 50 hours to make and assemble. The students use the printer in the school's manufacturing lab and cover the cost of materials -- about $350 -- through donations.\n\nPetresky got involved with the design of Pring's hand because Manero knew he was good with electronics.\n\n\"He bribed me with some pulled pork sandwiches. I went over to his house and helped him out with electronics,\" he said. \"I found out he was working on an arm, and I thought that was the coolest thing in the world.\"\n\nEventually Manero moved to Germany for a Fulbright scholarship and left Petresky in charge of running the operations in Orlando.\n\nPetresky says they ask every family about the child's favorite color, superhero and interests, so the new limb can \"not just be a piece of plastic ... but be a part of them.\"\n\nAs they've designed the bionics, they've learned that kids don't necessarily want to blend in. Children have requested colorful designs inspired by superheroes, Disney's \"Frozen,\" and in Wyatt's case, the blue-skinned men from \"Blue Man Group.\" For Christmas, the group upgraded Alex's plain vanilla white arm to a new one resembling Optimus Prime from \"Transformers.\"\n\n\"We quickly found out this is much less about fitting in and feeling normal, and much more about expressing yourself,\" Petresky said. \"There's a large aspect of being artistic and being creative.\"\n\nThe team has made electronic arms for five children and are working with three more kids including Wyatt. He traveled with his mom to UCF last week and practiced flexing his muscle to make the hand open and close.\n\nHe expects to get fitted with his new arm later this month.\n\nHis mom, Cynthia, was most excited about seeing Wyatt being celebrated for who he is.\n\n\"The adoration of college students was an affirmation that money can't buy. He was wrapped in the joy of leading and advising students on how to help children like himself,\" she wrote in her iReport. \"Wyatt felt like he was making a difference for himself and other children.\"\n\nAs they got ready to leave the campus, her son told her he can't wait to see what he will accomplish with his new arm.

The third in a series of studies from the Andersen lab involving PD and low-dose lithium, the results add to mounting evidence that low-doses of the psychotropic drug could benefit patients suffering from the incurable, degenerative condition.\n\nThis study, published online in Brain Research, involved Parkinsonian mice that were given Carbidopa/Levodopa (sold as Sinemet\u00ae), a drug used to boost levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is lost in PD. While the medication remains the single most effective agent in the management of PD symptoms, long-term use causes its own side effects, among them abnormal involuntary movements or AIMS. Buck professor and senior scientist Julie Andersen, PhD, says AIMS become problematic for 30 percent of patients after four to six years of treatment with Sinemet, with 90 percent of patients suffering from the complication after nine years of chronic use. \"For patients these side effects are just as devastating as the freezing that is associated with PD.\" \"In our mice we saw significant behavioral improvement.\"\n\nIn this study, Andersen and her team dosed the mice with an amount of lithium equivalent to about a quarter of what humans receive for the treatment of psychiatric diseases. Researchers found that lithium boosted the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase which increases dopamine synthesis via the inhibition of calpain-1, an enzyme that normally reduces dopamine synthesis.\n\nIn earlier studies, Andersen's team found that low-dose lithium was protective in two different mouse models of PD. Treatment in mice with a human mutation for PD began when the animals reached late middle-age, the human equivalent of about 60, which is the average age of onset of Parkinson's in humans. \"We clearly saw a prevention of the motor difficulties we would expect to see in the animals,\" said Andersen. \"The treatment also protected the area of the brain that is normally damaged by Parkinson's.\"\n\nPlans for a clinical trial of low-dose lithium for PD patients are in early stages. \"This study suggests potential therapeutic benefit in PD,\" said David K. Simon, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Simon chairs the Scientific Review Committee for the Parkinson's Study Group, a not-for-profit network of Parkinson's Centers. \"One caveat is that other agents that have shown clear efficacy in this model of PD have subsequently failed to show benefit in clinical studies in PD (e.g. CoQ10, creatine, and pioglitazone). However, this study provides additional evidence on top of prior work from Dr. Andersen's lab and others that lithium may have therapeutic potential in PD, which is a hypothesis that should be tested in clinical trials,\" he said.\n\nLithium is a naturally occurring element, not a 'developed' molecule like most medications. It was approved by the FDA for the treatment of bipolar disorder in 1970 and has shown to be effective for treating mood disorders and suicidal thoughts.

Patients were tracked from four to 12 years, with a median of 9.2 years. The research builds on a 2006 Lancet Neurology study that followed patients for a median of 5.2 years, beginning with a group of 137 volunteers with mild cognitive impairment.The new study is important because of the long follow-up period, according to Adam Brickman, assistant professor of neuropsychology at Columbia University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research.\n\nKnowing which patient with mild cognitive impairment patients may go on to develop Alzheimer's is vital information for researchers, who are looking for treatments for the fatal brain disease. The current thinking is that interventions will be most effective when given to a patient as early as possible, Brickman said. Clinical trials can better focus their efforts if patients are known to be in the early stages of Alzheimer's. Generally, about 30% to 60% of patients with mild cognitive impairment show evidence of underlying symptoms of Alzheimer's, so not everyone with this condition is a good candidate for an Alzheimer's trial.\n\nResearchers focused on two biomarkers previously thought to be involved in Alzheimer's disease: a kind of protein called beta-amyloid, and another protein type called tau. Experts believe a decrease in beta-amyloid in the fluid of the spinal cord is associated with a toxic buildup of that protein in the brain, which causes the formation of plaques linked to Alzheimer's disease. Tau has been tied to neurofibrillary tangles in the brain; researchers find that an increase in tau in cerebrospinal fluid is associated with Alzheimer's also.\n\nThe results from the study suggest that beta-amyloid is a much earlier predictor of Alzheimer's disease than tau, which supports the hypothesis that beta-amyloid accumulation in the brain occurs first in the course of the disease.\n\nSome of the participants, who were originally found to be stable with mild cognitive impairment after about five years, went on to develop Alzheimer's disease during the longer follow-up. That suggests that a five-year follow-up period is not long enough to determine how well biomarkers can predict which patients will develop Alzheimer's disease, researchers say.\n\nThe association between biomarkers in the fluid and Alzheimer's was also described in studies in December 2009 and August 2010, building on the idea that a spinal tap could be useful in predicting Alzheimer's.\n\nWhen these sorts of studies get published, Brickman and other doctors get phone calls from aging adults wondering whether they should be getting spinal taps to assess their risk. But it's too early to use this as a diagnostic tool in clinical settings, says Brickman. Down the road, the \"fantasy\" is that asymptomatic people will be able to get a biomarker test to determine whether they'll one day get Alzheimer's, but that's not possible right now, he adds.\n\n\"What I tell people is: If they\u2019re worried about their thinking abilities, that they should make an appointment with a neuropsychology or a neurologist to get an evaluation,\" Brinkman says. \"The way we diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s disease is by evaluating the behavior and the risk factor medical profile, not by looking at biological markers at this point.\"\n\nAs scientists gain more insight into predicting Alzheimer's, aging adults may struggle with the question of whether they want to know their risk, especially since there's still no cure. Some people want to enroll in clinical trials as soon as they start showing symptoms; others would rather be ignorant of their status since there is no cure. In looking for treatments, however, researchers depend on people's willingness to contribute to science.\n\nThe Alzheimer's Association runs a system called TrialMatch.

Results of the study are expected to be presented April 17 at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2016 in New Orleans (abstract CT017).\n\nGuadecitabine works to reverse a so-called epigenetic change in cancer cells known as methylation, which may alter genetic activity in cells in a way that can block the action of tumor-suppressing genes, pushing cells to become cancerous and resistant to therapy. By reversing this change in cancer cells, the drug restores cancer cells' vulnerability to drugs such as irinotecan.\n\nThe clinical trial included 22 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had been treated previously with irinotecan and whose disease was progressing. The patients were divided into four groups, each receiving different doses of guadecitabine in combination with irinotecan, over an average period of four months.\n\nDuring the study, 15 patients had at least one imaging scan to retest the extent and location of their cancers -- with 12 patients experiencing stable disease -- for more than the four-month period, on average, and one patient experiencing a partial response to the treatment (measured as at least a 30 percent reduction in the size of the tumors.)\n\nAlthough the study's main purpose was to test the safety rather than the effectiveness of guadecitabine doses, \"we were very happy to see some patients who benefited from the combination of the therapies for many months to more than a year,\" says Nilofer Azad, M.D., professor of oncology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\nThe study also showed signs that guadecitabine reduced methylation among the cancer cells. \"We did see that giving a higher dose of the drug seemed to produce a better methylation response among patients,\" says Valerie Lee, M.D., a fellow at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center. \"However, it seemed that patients were responding at all levels of the drug.\"\n\nAmong the side effects of the combined treatment, 16 patients experienced neutropenia, a low count of the infection-fighting white blood cells called neutrophils; five patients with neutropenia had fevers; three patients became anemic; and two patients developed thrombocytopenia, a lowered count of blood-clotting platelets. Other side effects included diarrhea (three patients), fatigue (two patients) and dehydration (two patients). There was one death during the study, possibly resulting from febrile neutropenia caused by the treatment.\n\nThe current study was based on previous studies in the laboratory of Nita Ahuja, M.D., director of the Sarcoma and Peritoneal Surface Malignancy Program and professor of surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, which showed that guadecitabine limited the growth of colorectal cancer cell lines when combined with irinotecan, says Azad.\n\nThe drug combination is being tested in an ongoing phase II clinical trial (NCT01896856) in a larger group of metastatic colorectal cancer patients at multiple institutions to determine the effectiveness of the dual therapy compared with chemotherapy regimens that do not include guadecitabine, says Azad.\n\nScientists leading the new study will also look for biomarkers in patients that could help determine which of them are most likely to benefit from guadecitabine and irinotecan. Lee says the research team will measure the amount of methylation in patients' cells when they begin their treatment and the presence of genes associated with irinotecan resistance, among other possible biomarkers.\n\nIn 2015, there were more than 130,000 people in the U.S. diagnosed with colon cancers. Five-year survival rates among people with localized colon cancers are more than 90 percent, but they are only 20 percent in those with metastatic cancer.\n\nGuadecitabine is an experimental drug that has not been approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It is manufactured by Astex Pharmaceuticals, a supporter of the Johns Hopkins-led study.

It\u2019s worth noting, however, that guadecitabine is also being considered for use in treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML) \u2014 and is much further along in development for that clinical application. In fact, there is already discussion about whether the potential benefits associated with using guadecitabine to treat AML outweigh the fact that other drugs are available in generic form (and are therefore less expensive).

The researchers say this may lead to new national guidelines for treating this cancer subtype, known as uterine serous carcinoma.\n\nUterine serous carcinoma makes up less than 10 percent of all cancers of the endometrium, or lining of the womb, diagnosed in the United States each year, but it accounts for more than a third of the 10,000 endometrial cancer deaths annually. The aggressive carcinomas often don't cause symptoms until they've begun to spread throughout the body. As a result, the average time that standard chemotherapy and surgical treatments can keep the tumor from growing or spreading--known as progression-free survival--is only about eight months.\n\n\"The fact that these tumors grow rapidly, but also have a propensity to spread to lymph nodes and other organs very early, is a double whammy for women,\" says Amanda Fader, M.D., associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and first author of the new study.\n\nFader and her colleagues knew that about 30 percent of all uterine serous carcinomas test positive for HER2/neu, a receptor protein that is also overexpressed in about 10 percent of all breast cancers. Trastuzumab binds to and blocks HER2/neu, keeping it from driving tumor growth, and has been shown to be effective in so-called HER2 positive breast cancers.\n\nFrom August 2011 through March 2017, Fader, Alessandro Santin, M.D., professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Yale University, and collaborators at 11 other cancer treatment centers in the U.S. randomly assigned 61 women with uterine serous carcinoma, being seen at the participating institutions, to receive either the standard chemotherapeutic regimen--a combination of the drugs carboplatin and paclitaxel--or those drugs plus trastuzumab. Some 41 of the patients had stage 3 or 4 uterine serous carcinoma--known as advanced disease--and 17 had recurrent uterine serous carcinoma. All tested positive for the HER2/neu receptor.\n\nAmong all patients, the 28 controls receiving only the standard carboplatin and paclitaxel combination had an average progression-free survival time of eight months, and the 30 who received trastuzumab in addition had an average progression-free survival time of 12.6 months. However, the difference was even more profound in the 41 patients with advanced disease, whose progression-free survival time went from an average of 9.3 months to 17.9 months with the addition of trastuzumab.\n\n\"Even an improvement of a few months may be quite meaningful for women with these cancers,\" says Fader, who is also affiliated with the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins.\n\nAmong patients with recurrent disease, progression-free survival time increased from an average of six months to 9.2 months. The difference, Fader says, may be that these patients have been heavily treated in the past, are more likely to have overall poorer health and are more likely to have mutated or heterogeneous tumors, or tumors with different levels of HER2 expression.\n\nFollow-up studies of the women who remain alive--who now number 35--continue, the researchers say, to track the impact of trastuzumab on overall survival time even after tumor progression. But the results of the trial, they add, were strong enough to warrant submission to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, which guides the design of standard treatment plans around the country.\n\nFader cautions that a larger study of the drug combination, or other combinations, is needed to confirm the findings and potentially extend survival even more. She notes that using trastuzumab to selectively treat uterine serous carcinoma that express HER2/neu is part of a broader trend at Johns Hopkins and other cancer centers to use the tools of tailored therapy, or precision medicine, based on the molecular and genetic makeup of tumors and patients.\n\nOther authors of the paper are Dana M.

People who ate that amount ended up with lower blood pressure readings than those who ate white chocolate.\n\nThe researchers note that eating a small amount of dark chocolate daily is a dietary change that's \"easy to adhere to,\" reports CBS News partner WebMD.\n\nUniversity of Cologne researcher Dr. Dirk Taubert, the study's lead author, said the blood pressure reductions with dark chocolate were small but still substantial enough to potentially reduce cardiovascular disease risks, although study volunteers weren't followed long enough to measure that effect.\n\nThe research involved just 44 people aged 56 through 73, but the results echo other small studies of cocoa-containing foods. Cocoa contains flavanols, plant-based compounds that also are credited with giving red wine its heart-healthy benefits.\n\nOne problem is chocolate bars containing cocoa tend to have lots of calories, so Taubert and his colleagues tested small amounts containing just 30 calories each.\n\nThe study appears in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.

They also kept food diaries so researchers could see if other foods might have influenced the results.\n\nBut, said Taubert, \"It is very unlikely that other factors may explain the blood pressure reduction.\"\n\nChocolate-makers have embraced these findings and have developed new ways to satisfy the sweet tooth and curb the guilt by introducing more varieties of dark chocolates, fortifying them with vitamins and anti-oxidants, reports Miller.\n\nDr. Lawrence Appel of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine said the most proven non-drug methods for lowering blood pressure are losing weight and eating less salt.

Results were published November 2 in the Obesity Journal.\n\nWhile the Weight Management Center has a high success rate at helping patients lose weight to fight diabetes, many people with the condition don't live near a specialized program and need help that's readily available. O'Neil said because Weight Watchers has centers all over the country, including sites in small towns with limited or no medical facilities, its program could help meet this need if combined with diabetes-specific counseling.\n\nThat's why he said it was important for MUSC to be involved in the study, which was funded by a grant from the commercial weight loss program, Weight Watchers. Promoting healthy communities is part of MUSC's mission.\n\nThe multi-site study's results were statistically and clinically significant, O'Neil said.\n\n\"The Weight Watchers people were significantly better off than people who received standard care.\" They achieved better control of their blood sugar and lost more weight, he said. They still had diabetes, but many were able to reduce the amount of medication they were taking.\n\nThe study's 563 participants were all overweight or obese and under a doctor's care for uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes. Half got standard care: a session of nutrition counseling with a registered dietitian and written materials. The other half went to Weight Watchers meetings, had access to Weight Watchers' online materials and had two phone consultations and follow-up email contact with certified diabetes educators who told them how to modify the Weight Watchers plan to help with their diabetes.\n\nParticipants had four follow-up visits related to the study and continued to see their regular doctors for medical management of their diabetes.\n\nAfter a year, people in the Weight Watchers group had an average weight loss of about 4 percent of their starting weight, compared to 2 percent for the standard care group. The Weight Watchers group also had a bigger improvement in a measure of long-term control of their blood sugar, which can reduce the risk for serious problems related to Type 2 diabetes. Left uncontrolled, the condition can damage blood vessels and nerves, putting people at risk of having a heart attack or stroke. It can also cause eye problems, kidney damage and even lead to amputations.\n\u2022 Not getting enough exercise\n\nCertain racial and ethnic groups are more at risk, including African-Americans and Hispanics.

It's by far the more common form of diabetes and can lead to about $85,000 in medical costs.\n\nDiabetes is a growing problem. O'Neil said the rate jumped from about 9 percent to 12 percent between 2002 and 2012. Weight loss is seen as a good way to slow its progression.\n\nThe MUSC Health Weight Management Center takes a scientific approach to weight loss, focusing on changes in activity levels, behavior, thinking, diet and support systems. O'Neil said it's important to help people, not blame them.\n\nThe Weight Watchers study is new evidence of what that help might include when it comes to a side effect of weight gain: Type 2 diabetes. \"You do have some power and control,\" he said. \"You can lose some weight and lower your blood sugar - and may even be able to change your medications.

The paper, The Sternum-Nipple Distance is Double the Nipple-Inframammary Fold Distance in Macromastia, is published Ahead-of-Print online in the Annals of Plastic Surgery.\n\n\"Breast reduction is one of the most commonly performed plastic surgery procedures. The long-term appearance after reduction is not optimized 50% of the time using standard reduction techniques,\" notes lead author Dr. Frank Lau. \"At LSU Health New Orleans, we offer an improved technique that preserves more of the critical breast anatomy. This study provides an anatomical foundation for why our technique may yield better, longer-lasting results.\"\n\nAbout 50% of patients who undergo the most commonly used breast reduction technique experience pseudoptosis or \"bottoming out\" as a long-term complication. This occurs when breast tissue drops to the lower portion of the breast independent of nipple position.\n\n\"We want our patients to have a long-lasting, aesthetically pleasing breast shape,\" says Lau.\n\nBelieving that disruption of the lower suspensory ligaments may be a critical factor because they are stronger than the upper sensory ligaments, the researchers conducted a retrospective review of 208 patients who underwent breast reduction surgery from 2008-2015, studying the results in 400 individual breasts. In all patients, only one reduction technique was performed per patient. Ninety-two percent of the 174 reductions performed with the inferior pedicle technique used a Wise pattern incision, which disrupts the lower suspensory ligaments, and 7.5% used a Boston modification of Robertson technique, which preserves the lower suspensory ligaments. Of the 33 superomedial pedicle reductions, 25 (75.8%) used a Wise pattern incision and 8 (24.2%) used a vertical pattern incision.\n\nBy measuring the sternal notch-nipple distance and the nipple-inframammary fold distance ( proxies for upper and lower sensory ligament strength, respectively), the study found a differential rate of stretch - for every 1 cm in upper sensory ligament stretch, the lower sensory ligament length increases by 0.45 cm. This relationship strengthens the researchers' hypothesis that the lower pole ligaments stretch at a significantly slower rate than the upper pole ligaments. An anatomic basis for this differential may exist. A horizontal membrane of dense connective tissue originating at the level of the fifth rib that divides the breast into segments at the level of the nipple has been described. This division may signify a transition point in sensory ligament strength. On that basis, the authors recommend that techniques such as the Boston modification of Robertson technique should be preferred by surgeons seeking to avoid pseudoptosis. Other advantages of the Boston modification of Robertson technique include decreased operative time and elimination of the \"triple point,\" the most common site of postoperative incision rupture.\n\n\"This study is one of the largest breast anthropometry (measurement) studies ever performed,\" says Lau. \"These results help us provide the best breast reduction outcomes to our patients.\"\n\nCo-authors include Thomas Steele, a 4th-year medical student at LSU Health New Orleans School of Medicine, and Julian Pribaz, MD, of Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School.\n\nLSU Health Sciences Center New Orleans educates Louisiana's health care professionals.

A shorter urethra makes it easier for bacteria from rectum to enter the vagina and travel to the bladder.\n\nStudy author Dr. Thomas Hooton said it's thought that increasing fluid intake decreases UTI risk in two ways: by preventing bacteria from adhering to the bladder and by reducing the overall concentration of bacteria that could cause an infection.\n\n\"Flushing bacteria out of the bladder, it's been known, at least it's been thought, that it is protective. This study suggests that it is,\" said Hooton, clinical director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Miami School of Medicine.\n\nDr. Hunter Wessells, who wasn't involved in the study, called the additional fluid intake \"substantial,\" leading to a corresponding increase in urine output.\n\n\"It is the urine output which is of course the key factor leading to the effect seen in the study,\" said Wessells, chair of the department of urology at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.\n\nDr. Susan Bleasdale, medical director of infection control at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said the study \"may be a game changer\" for antibiotic \"stewardship\" programs aimed at reducing inappropriate antibiotic use.\n\nShe cited a 2010 review estimating that 11 million to 12 million women a year will suffer from a UTI, accounting for 1.6 billion antibiotic prescriptions a year.\n\n\"We might not even need to use antibiotics,\" she said.\n\nThe study, conducted in Bulgaria, involved 140 healthy premenopausal women who had at least three UTIs in the past year. All reported low daily fluid intake. They drank roughly four cups of fluid per day, including just 2 cups of water a day.\n\nHalf of the women in the study were asked to consume 1.5 liters of water, or about 6 cups, each day in addition to their usual daily fluid intake. Specifically, they were asked to begin drinking a 1/2-liter water bottle at each meal and finish each bottle before the next meal.\n\nThe remaining women served as a control group. They continued their usual fluid intake.\n\nThe women were followed for a year, with clinic visits at the beginning of the study as well as 6 and 12 months later. Researchers measured their water and fluid intake; urine volume, frequency and concentration; and symptoms. They also called the women each month to assess compliance and counsel them to return to the clinic for evaluation and possible treatment if they were experiencing UTI symptoms.\n\nOverall, the water group increased daily water intake by close to 5 cups a day. Their total daily fluid intake, including water and other beverages, averaged nearly 12 cups.\n\nBy contrast, the control group's total daily fluid intake was less than half of that.\n\nHooton noted that it's not clear exactly how much fluid intake must increase to deliver a benefit.\n\n\"There's no magic in a liter-and-a-half,\" he said.\n\nLikewise, he believes any increase in fluid -- not just water -- may be beneficial since fluids are mostly water. And while the study involved younger women, he said older women who experience recurrent UTIs may benefit from increasing their daily fluid intake as well.\n\nWhether the advice would benefit women with normal urine output, however, is unclear, Wessells noted.\n\n\"In addition, the bother associated with the higher urine output, and feasibility of implementing this water intake strategy across a range of occupations and ages, requires further study as well,\" he said.\n\nResearchers presented the findings Saturday at IDWeek 2017, the annual meeting of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, the HIV Medicine Association and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society.\n\nResearch presented at meetings is generally considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed publication.\n\nVisit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more on UTIs.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Although tap water generally costs very little, the sponsors of this research have helped turn bottled water into a multi-billion dollar industry.

To qualify, their risk had to be at least that of an average 60- to 64-year-old woman \u2014 a 1.66 percent chance of getting the disease within 5 years. On average, the participants actually had more than twice that risk, around 4 percent, meaning that 40 of 1,000 would be affected.

Their rates of invasive breast cancer were the same, 163 cases for tamoxifen and 167 for raloxifene \u2014 about half as many as would have been expected without treatment.\n\nSo raloxifene looked just as good as tamoxifen. Even better news, the cancer institute said, was that those taking raloxifene \"had 36 percent fewer uterine cancers and 29 percent fewer blood clots.\" Based on those findings, it is easy to see why raloxifene was declared the winner.\n\nBut numbers can be tricky. Expressed as percentages, the differences between the drugs for uterine cancer and blood clots sound large.\n\n\"But the actual numbers are small,\" Dr. Lichtenfeld said.\n\nAmong women taking tamoxifen in the study, 36 of 4,732 got uterine cancer, while for raloxifene the number was 23 of 4,712.

That fact was not stated in the news release, and the researchers mentioned it only briefly during the news conference, calling the results \"borderline\" significant.\n\nMany researchers say that results don't count unless they pass the statistical tests. But Dr. Leslie Ford, an associate director for clinical research at the cancer institute, said that the differences could not be ignored because they came so near to being significant. Had the study gone on a little longer, they might have crossed the line, she said.\n\nAnother issue is that the message from the cancer institute seemed to play down a shortcoming of raloxifene that cancer doctors consider important. The institute emphasized that raloxifene lowered the risk of \"invasive\" breast cancer, tumors that have penetrated surrounding tissue and that have the potential to spread and turn deadly.\n\nBut raloxifene did not prevent two other serious breast conditions, whereas tamoxifen did reduce their risk by 50 percent. Those conditions, sometimes called noninvasive breast cancers, are L.C.I.S. and D.C.I.S., for lobular and ductal carcinomas in situ. Lobular growths increase the likelihood of invasive cancer, and ductal ones can become invasive. D.C.I.S. is often treated like breast cancer, with surgery and radiation.\n\n\"D.C.I.S. is not inconsequential,\" said Dr. Lichtenfeld, adding that it leads some women to have both breasts removed. Since tamoxifen lowers the risks of both invasive and noninvasive tumors, he said, it \"has a broader spectrum of activity against breast cancer.\"\n\nDr. Larry Norton, a breast cancer expert at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said he also found it worrisome that raloxifene did not share tamoxifen's ability to prevent the noninvasive growths.\n\nWhen it came to L.C.I.S. and D.C.I.S., the difference between the two drugs was statistically significant, meaning it was likely to be real and not due to chance. Yet that distinction was not pointed out in the news release, and, Dr. Lichtenfeld noted, it was \"de-emphasized\" during the news conference.\n\nBut Dr. Ford of the cancer institute said raloxifene's ability to prevent invasive cancers was more important.\n\n\"Invasive cancer is what kills you,\" she said, adding that only about 10 percent of D.C.I.S. turn invasive, and that those that do can be treated. She called it \"twisted logic\" to dwell on tamoxifen's superior ability to prevent the noninvasive cancers because, she said, \"We're not preventing noninvasive cancers because nobody's taking tamoxifen anyway.\"\n\nGiven that there are shades of gray and room for debate about these findings, some critics questioned the way they were made public.\n\nThe results were announced by the cancer institute in a news release and a telephone conference for news reporters. Contrary to usual practice, the complete data had not yet been revealed to scientists or published in a medical journal, though the institute said it intended to do so. Officials said they announced the findings before publishing them because they had implications for public health.\n\nMs. Visco said, \"How is it ethical to do that, to make this much hype around something that is not a health emergency, and you can't check their data?\"\n\nShe said she also worried that the announcement might have left the impression that the drugs could prevent breast cancer entirely.\n\n\"It's not prevention,\" Ms. Visco said. \"It's risk reduction, short term, for a subset of women we cannot identify.\"\n\nThe concern is that many women would have to take tamoxifen or raloxifene for a few to benefit. In 1,000 high-risk women like those in the study, for instance, without treatment 40 would be expected to develop invasive breast cancer over the next five years. If all 1,000 were treated, only 20 cases would occur.\n\nBut since there is no way to predict who will actually get cancer, everyone has to be treated, meaning that 980 will be exposed to the drug's risks but will get no cancer benefit.\n\n\"The hope is that at some point we'll be able to pinpoint who really is at high risk of breast cancer and then we'll know what to do,\" Ms. Visco said. \"But we're not anywhere near there.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Dr. Ford said, at least tamoxifen and raloxifene give women at risk the chance to do something. She compared the drugs to statins and blood pressure drugs, which people take even though they feel well, to lower their risks of heart attacks and strokes. But others argue that heart attacks are far more common than breast cancer, and the drugs to prevent them much safer.\n\nTo Dr. Norton, the most important conclusion to be drawn from the study is that more research on breast cancer prevention is needed. He said the next step should be to test another class of drugs called aromatase inhibitors, already in use to treat breast cancer, to see if they can do better at risk reduction than tamoxifen or raloxifene.\n\n\"Until we have zero cancer,\" he said, \"I'm not going to make any claims about a great advance.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "No costs were mentioned.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Hormone replacement therapy in menopause is back, and it\u2019s come a long way.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the treatment became standard for menopausal symptoms \u2014 the hot flashes, night sweats, headaches, incontinence and other problems that eventually strike almost all women.\n\nMost American women begin to experience menopause around age 50, with some changes in their menstrual cycles earlier. Hormone treatment gives the body a smoother landing from menopause to post-menopause.\n\nBut in 2002, when concerns were raised by a set of studies by the Women\u2019s Health Initiative of the National Institutes of Health showing hormones correlated with elevated breast cancer, heart disease and stroke risk, women and their doctors hit the brakes.\n\nFor most women, menopausal symptoms degrade quality of life for at least some amount of time, maybe two years, maybe as long as 12. Even after the Women\u2019s Health Initiative news broke, some women couldn\u2019t face the changes without hormone treatment.\n\nNow doctors are once again saying they shouldn\u2019t have to.\n\nThe difference? For one thing, the conclusions of the study have been discredited by subsequent studies. Many women in the Women\u2019s Health Initiative study were well past menopause, were obese or were smokers and therefore already at risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nFor another, the formulations used were less safe in their dosage, mix of hormones and delivery method (pills, which travel through the liver and can cause clots).\n\nThe sheer number of choices today and the need for a thorough initial health assessment make the decision on hormone therapy highly dependent on close communication between a woman and her doctor, experts say.\n\n\u201cSome women need higher doses, some need lower doses. Once a woman is educated, then she knows what to go in and ask for. If a doctor won\u2019t work with you, then find another doctor,\u201d says Dr. Marina Johnson, a Dallas endocrinologist and pharmacist and author of Outliving Your Ovaries: An Endocrinologist Weighs the Risks and Rewards of Treating Menopause With Hormone Replacement Therapy.\n\nDr. Noushin A. Firouzbakht, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Fort Worth, says that despite the alarm provoked by the Women\u2019s Health Initiative study, much was learned, especially about the ideal candidate for hormone replacement.\n\n\u201cWe also learned that we see fewer strokes and heart attacks from non-oral methods like a patch or a cream,\u201d she says. \u201cThe rule of thumb now is the lowest dose for the shortest amount of time. It\u2019s no longer that you need to stay away from hormone replacement therapy, it\u2019s that you need to use it wisely.\u201d\n\nThat wisdom comes from a careful medical assessment and ongoing surveillance of blood pressure, blood work, breast changes, side effects and effectiveness.(Women who\u2019ve had breast cancer cannot take hormone replacements.)\n\n\u201cThis requires a thorough exam and a thorough history, and individualized care, but women need to know: It\u2019s not a death sentence or a dependence. It\u2019s an unfortunate thing that that\u2019s out there,\u201d Firouzbakht says, \u201cbecause women also need to know: You don\u2019t have to suffer, you don\u2019t have to have incontinence or vaginal prolapse or hot flashes. There is help available. It\u2019s a process, but hormone replacement therapy is helping women have a better life in an era when they live longer.\u201d\n\nJohnson, Firouzbakht and other experts will tell you that hormone therapy protects against heart disease, a much more common killer of women than breast cancer, as well as against dementia, colon cancer, osteoporosis and other health issues.\n\nThe doctors emphasized not just the medical benefits, but that the treatment can enable and boost a woman\u2019s overall day-to-day existence, too. Too many women have been taught to accept suffering in this stage of life, they say. Johnson notes that in her book, she included chapters aimed at young women far from menopause in an effort to dispel that notion.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when most women were just patted on the head and told, \u2018Honey, that\u2019s just what happens when you get old,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cBut this is going to help you improve the quality of your life and prevent serious diseases. Why wouldn\u2019t you want to learn about it?\u201d\n\nBio-identical hormones, which come from plants, are getting a lot of attention and add to the confusion about the treatment. Johnson, who runs the Institute of Endocrinology and Preventive Medicine in Dallas, says she only trusts the quality-controlled, safety-tested pharmaceutical bio-identical hormones that are made by drug companies and approved by the Food and Drug Administration. (Bio-identical hormones are made from plants. Still commonly prescribed synthetic drugs are made from the urine of pregnant mares, and, although they are FDA-approved, she considers them less effective and less safe.)\n\nJohnson, who runs the Institute of Endocrinology and Preventive Medicine in Dallas, says she only trusts the quality-controlled, safety-tested formulations that are made by pharmaceutical companies and approved by the Food and Drug Administration, whether the hormones come from plants or equine sources.

The study, led by Tonya Orchard, an assistant professor of human nutrition at The Ohio State University, appears in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research.\n\nWomen with the least-inflammatory diets (based on a scoring system called the Dietary Inflammatory Index) lost less bone density during the six-year follow-up period than their peers with the most-inflammatory diets. This was despite the fact that they started off with lower bone density overall.\n\nFurthermore, diets with low inflammatory potential appeared to correspond to lower risk of hip fracture among one subgroup of the study -- post-menopausal white women younger than 63.\n\nThe findings suggest that women's bone health could benefit when they choose a diet higher in beneficial fats, plants and whole grains, said Orchard, who is part of Ohio State's Food Innovation Center.\n\n\"This suggests that as women age, healthy diets are impacting their bones,\" Orchard said. \"I think this gives us yet another reason to support the recommendations for a healthy diet in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.\"\n\nBecause the study was observational, it's not possible to definitively link dietary patterns and bone health and fracture outcomes.\n\nRebecca Jackson, the study's senior author and director of Ohio State's Center for Clinical and Translational Science, said the new findings support a growing body of evidence that factors that increase inflammation can increase osteoporosis risk.\n\n\"By looking at the full diet rather than individual nutrients, these data provide a foundation for studying how components of the diet might interact to provide benefit and better inform women's health and lifestyle choices,\" said Jackson, who is national chair of the Women's Health Initiative steering committee.\n\nPrevious studies have connected high levels of inflammatory markers in the blood to bone loss and to fractures in older women and men, which prompted Orchard and her colleagues to wonder what they'd find if they took one more step back - to the dietary choices that contribute to inflammation in the body.\n\nThe Dietary Inflammatory Index - developed to assess the quality of diet from maximally to minimally inflammatory based on nutrients consumed - helped them accomplish that. Dietary information as well as data on bone density and fracture were collected from a large group of the participants in the Women's Health Initiative, the largest study of postmenopausal women's health undertaken in U.S. history.\n\nParticipants in the WHI were 50 to 79 when they enrolled in the study of prevention and control of common diseases impacting older women. Enrollment ran from 1993 to 1998.\n\nFor the new analysis - the first of its kind - the research team looked at dietary data from 160,191 women and assigned inflammation scores based on 32 food components that the women reported consuming in the three months prior to their enrollment.\n\nThe researchers used bone-mineral-density data from a subset of 10,290 women. Fracture data was collected for the entire study group.\n\nOrchard and her colleagues found a correlation only between high-inflammatory diets and fracture in younger white women in the study. Higher scores were associated with an almost 50 percent larger risk of hip fracture in Caucasian women younger than 63, compared with the risk for women in the group with the lowest inflammatory scores.\n\n\"This suggests that a high-quality, less-inflammatory diet may be especially important in reducing hip fracture risk in younger women,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nBut in the study group overall, more-inflammatory diets were not linked to fracture and - in fact - the researchers found a modestly lower risk of lower-arm and total fracture in women with the highest dietary inflammation scores. One possible explanation included in the study: The women with lower inflammation scores were more physically active as a group and therefore were at a slightly greater risk of falls.\n\nWomen with the least-inflammatory diets had lower bone mineral density overall at the start of the study, but lost less bone than their high-inflammation peers, the researchers found. The lower bone density to start could be because women with healthier diets are more likely to be of a smaller build, Orchard said. Larger people have higher bone density to support their larger frames.\n\n\"These women with healthier diets didn't lose bone as quickly as those with high-inflammation diets, and this is important because after menopause women see a drastic loss in bone density that contributes to fractures,\" Orchard said.\n\nVedat Yildiz of Ohio State's Center for Biostatistics also worked on the study, which was supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The release does not discuss costs.

Their approach detects micrometastases, breakaway tumor cells with the potential to develop into dangerous secondary breast cancer tumors elsewhere in the body. The approach may offer an improved way to detect early recurrence of breast cancer in women and men. The work was completed at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Cleveland and was funded by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), part of the National Institutes of Health.\n\n\u201cMRI has a wide array of diagnostic applications and shows promise in breast cancer detection and treatment monitoring,\u201d said Richard Conroy, Ph.D., director of NIBIB Division of Applied Science and Technology. \u201cThe technique used by researchers in this study enables very early detection of metastatic spread, which would allow adaptation of treatment more quickly and hopefully lead to better outcomes in the future.\u201d\n\nThe study, published online in the Aug. 12, 2015, issue of Nature Communications, was led by Zheng-Rong Lu, Ph.D., CWRU M. Frank Rudy and Margaret Domiter Rudy Professor of biomedical engineering and an expert in molecular imaging for cancer and other diseases.\n\n\u201cWe showed with this technique that we can detect very tiny tumors of just a few hundred cells,\u201d Lu said, adding that the study pushed imaging boundaries, revealing smaller cancers than can be detected with current clinical imaging modalities. \u201cOur imaging technology has the potential to differentiate aggressive tumors from low-risk tumors. These are two things that potentially can make a big impact on clinical practice and also management of cancer.\u201d\n\nOne-third of patients diagnosed with breast cancer eventually develop metastases in distant organs, with an increased risk of death. Breast cancer has a high rate of metastasis to bone, lung, liver, lymph nodes, and the brain. Since small, early-stage cancers are the most responsive to drug treatments, screening is an important aspect of follow-up care for breast cancer patients, and early detection is critical in tailoring appropriate and effective therapeutic interventions. While multiple imaging techniques, including MRI, are currently used in breast cancer detection and clinical management, they are neither able to detect specific cancer types or early cancer growth.\n\nThe earliest signs of cancer spread are called micrometastases. As the name implies, they are often too small to be detected with standard screening. Dr. Lu\u2019s team used a biochemical approach combined with MRI to detect molecular changes that signal micrometastases. To detect micrometastases, Lu and his team used MRI imaging \u2014 which uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images \u2013 and combined it with a special chemical contrast solution.\n\nThe contrast solution that the team developed contains a short piece of protein, or peptide, tagged with a minuscule magnet. They chose the peptide \u2014 a chain of just five amino acids \u2014 for its inclination to bind to protein matrix structures around cancer cells, called fibrin-fibronectin complexes. More importantly, the fibronectin part of the complex is expressed during a cell\u2019s transition to cancer and plays a role in cell growth, migration and differentiation. Fibronectin is associated with high-risk breast cancer with poor prognosis.\n\nThe researchers collected images depicting metastases where breast cancer had spread beyond the original tumors. Metal molecules within the contrast solution are magnetized during the MRI process and enhance the image wherever the molecules of solution bind with the targeted protein.\n\n\u201cThe primary tumor sends signals to distant tissue and organs to prepare the soil for metastasis,\u201d Lu said. \u201cBy also binding with the magnetically tagged peptide, the biomarker is enhanced, generating enough signal for MRI detection of small, high-risk cancer and micrometastases.\u201d\n\nThe researchers tested the approach in mice into which they had introduced breast cancer cells. After a two-week waiting period, the researchers injected the contrast solution and performed MRI. The MRI imaging detected metastatic tumors, including micrometastases, in lung, liver, lymph node, adrenal gland, bone, and brains of the mice.\n\nAnalysis of images showed that the contrast used by the research team bound almost exclusively to the fibrin-fibronectin complexes, producing a strong and prolonged image enhancement of micrometastases and tumors compared with normal tissue. Using a microscopic imaging approach, called cryo-imaging, and MRI, the researchers verified that the MRI technique could detect micrometastases, even observing bone micrometastases that were less than 0.5mm \u2014 the diameter of a very fine pencil lead.\n\nPrior to their study with this contrast agent, Lu\u2019s team had conducted studies to determine its clearance from the body after the imaging, which is essential for safe clinical use. Their testing showed that the agent is readily cleared from the body and has a low level of retention in tissues. Therefore, they expect it will be safe if ultimately developed for clinical use.\n\n\u201cThe recurrence rates of some forms of breast cancer and the consequence of metastatic cancer make these efforts urgent and important,\u201d said Lu, adding that his research team also hopes to advance the approach for prostate cancer detection. \u201cWe think this targeted approach holds great promise for earlier imaging of high-risk cancers in the clinic. It could also become useful as a non-invasive way to assess breast cancer treatment progress.\u201d\n\nThe team plans to complete safety testing of the imaging agent during the next three years.

So, the researchers theorized that the poor performance of the supplements may simply reflect the overwhelming power of the medications.\n\nStudy author Daan Kromhout, from the division of human nutrition at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, is to present the findings Sunday at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Stockholm; the study will appear online in the New England Journal of Medicine simultaneously.\n\nIn the study, researchers focused on a group of more than 4,800 Dutch heart attack patients between the ages of 60 and 80, slightly more than three-quarters of whom were men.\n\nAll had experienced a heart attack at some point in the decade leading up to the study, and all were taking blood pressure medications, anti-clotting drugs and statins.\n\nAt the study's start, the patients were instructed to consume (over a period lasting a little over three years) one of four different types of margarines: one supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids; one supplemented with the plant-derived ALA; one supplemented with both omega-3 fatty acids and ALA; and one with no supplements.\n\nThe amount of supplementation added to the various margarines was deemed to be \"low-dose.\" During the study, the patients consumed an average of 18.8 grams of margarine per day, which meant ingestion of an average of 226 milligrams of EPA combined with 150 milligrams of DHA omega-3 fatty acids and/or 1.9 grams of ALA.\n\nBy the study's end, almost 14 percent of the heart attack patients had experienced another \"major cardiovascular event,\" with some cases ending in death.\n\nNone of the low-dose supplements seemed to stave off such events in most of the patients. One exception appeared to be among women ingesting ALA; researchers saw a 27 percent reduction in the risk for further cardiac complications, although that reduction did not quite reach statistical significance.\n\n\"The bottom-line finding of the Alpha Omega Trial is that [omega]-3 fatty acids did not reduce the primary endpoint major cardiovascular events,\" Kromhout said, noting that the ALA finding needs further confirmation.\n\nDr. Murray A. Mittleman, director of the cardiovascular epidemiology research unit at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said he was \"not that surprised by these results.\"\n\n\"Other studies have shown no benefit from omega-3, other than specifically protecting against cardiac death linked to arrhythmia among patients who have just survived a heart attack,\" Mittleman noted. It is during this acute post-attack period, he explained, when patients are most vulnerable to a subsequent event.\n\n\"But here, in some cases the patients they looked at are years following their first heart attack when they start taking these supplements,\" he stressed. \"So, that's a big difference in what kind of patient they're examining. And they're also not just looking at preventable fatalities but all heart-related events that follow. And on top of that, the supplement doses they use here are very low, much lower than those used in prior studies.\"\n\n\"So it might be big differences in study design that account for this new finding,\" Mittleman cautioned. \"In any case, I would say this is absolutely worth further investigation.\"\n\nDr. Gregg C. Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, agreed.\n\n\"It is possible that improvements in other treatments for heart attack patients have made fish oil supplementation less important for reducing cardiovascular risk,\" he acknowledged. \"But it's also possible that the different dosing used in this study relative to previous work made a difference in the outcome. The dosing here may have been just too low, whereas higher doses given immediately following an initial heart attack might have been protective.\"\n\n\"So I would say,\" Fonarow added, \"that this is by no means the final word regarding omega-3s and cardiovascular health.\"\n\nFor more on omega-3 fatty acids, visit the National Institutes of Health.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Not applicable.

It\u2019s an emotional decision that women often make quickly, considering that surgeries often take place within days of their cancer diagnosis.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about the women who are on the fence and make a very quick decision before really considering the other options or the fact that it is an irreversible procedure,\u201d said Dr. Todd Tuttle, the U\u2019s chief of surgical oncology and lead author of the study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\nWhen diagnosed with cancer in her right breast last year, Debra Elmore-Nesheim talked with her new husband and other relatives about the appropriate treatment. But the 43-year-old\u2019s instinct was to have both breasts removed.\n\n\u201cPart of it is emotional,\u201d said Elmore-Nesheim, a pediatric nurse who lives in St. Paul. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t do as much as possible to eliminate the cancer, I would feel like I was almost waiting for the other shoe to drop.\u201d\n\nWomen removing a single cancerous breast have a 1 percent chance per year of suffering cancer in the other breast. That makes removing both breasts a better option for younger women with longer life spans. Many oncologists also recommend it for women with genetic predispositions for breast cancer.\n\nFor other women, a double mastectomy might eliminate another breast cancer, but it won\u2019t stop cancer from resurfacing in vital organs, Tuttle said. He hopes women aren\u2019t making the choice believing it will result in longer life, because the evidence is sketchy at best.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then we have a problem on our hands, because we\u2019re not providing adequate information to our patients,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s happening because of fear or the common reason I hear \u2013 \u2018I just want to be done with it\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s a different situation.\u201d\n\nTuttle\u2019s study found 60 percent of women with breast cancer chose lumpectomies, which remove only the tumors, not the whole breasts. Research has found this procedure is equally effective, particularly with smaller tumors and often when used in combination with radiation.\n\nOf the women in Tuttle\u2019s study who received mastectomies in 2003, 11 percent chose to have both breasts removed. That is an increase from 4.2 percent in 1998.\n\nThe rising use of magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, is likely contributing to the increase in double mastectomies, said Dr. Joseph Leach, a medical oncologist with Park Nicollet Health Services. Such scans are becoming standard for women who appear to have cancer in one breast, and half the time they raise suspicions about the other breast.\n\nWhile these suspicions rarely end up as cancer, they do often result in follow-up tests such as biopsies and ultrasounds that can frighten patients, Leach said.\n\n\u201cOur own impression is that women in some ways are getting sort of scared into having prophylactic mastectomies because of having these uncertain tests,\u201d Leach said.\n\nBoth Leach and Tuttle are pursuing research studies to address the why question.\n\nWomen choosing to have both breasts removed face higher surgery costs and slightly higher risks of post-surgery complications and infections.\n\nMost women are satisfied after double mastectomies, but a Mayo Clinic survey showed that as many as 10 percent are unsatisfied because of their appearance or medical complications. The survey results came a decade ago, however, when the safety of breast implants was a major issue, said Mayo\u2019s Dr. Lynn Hartmann.\n\nThe safety concerns have been reduced and cosmetic procedures have improved, but some women still probably regret the decision, she said.\n\nHartmann said doctors could take pressure off women by performing lumpectomies first to eliminate their cancer tumors. Then the women can have genetic tests and assess their risks for follow-up cancers before deciding whether to have one or both breasts removed.\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019ve just put some time on the table for them rather than trying to have them make this major decision \u2026 in a brief period of time,\u201d she said.\n\nElmore-Nesheim, the nurse with breast cancer, said cosmetic concerns played a role. She wondered with age what she would look like with an implant on one side and a healthy breast on the other. But mostly, she was scared for her life. Even if removing both breasts only offered a small chance at a longer life, it seemed worthwhile to her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a survival thing,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re fighting for your life.

That\u2019s why doctors at the Cleveland Clinic will test deep brain stimulation (DBS)\u2014a procedure in which electrodes are implanted in the brain to provide small electric pulses as a way to help people recover control of their movements.\n\nThe hospital recently received the green light from federal authorities to start the first ever human trial of DBS for stroke, and plans to announce Tuesday that it will perform the procedure as soon as an initial patient is identified.\n\nClose to 800,000 Americans have a stroke each year and estimates suggest about half of those people will be disabled from it. With physical therapy, many people regain some motor function, but the brain damage cannot be reversed and many still have profound movement problems.\n\n\u201cDespite advances in physical therapy and acute treatment of stroke there are still too many people who live with long term disabilities, and new technologies are needed,\u201d said Dr. Andre Machado, the chairman of the Cleveland Clinic Neurological Institute who is leading the trial and will perform the procedures.\n\nDBS has been used to treat tremors associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease, but Machado said the new approach, if successful, will achieve something novel. \u201cThe big difference is that when we are treating the motor symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease, we\u2019re trying to make the symptom, like a tremor, go away,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we are treating stroke, we are really trying to make movement come back. There is something inherently different about that.\u201d\n\nAnd inherently harder. DBS has never been used on humans as a way to regain a function. And experts aren\u2019t even entirely sure why it works for Parkinson\u2019s in the first place. But for 10 years, Machado and his team have been studying the effects of DBS on rats. They found that rats with strokes who received DBS had more proteins in the brain that are associated with brain plasticity\u2014and twice as many synapses or connections between nerve cells compared to rats with strokes who did not undergo DBS.\n\nIf all goes as planned, Machado will insert the electrodes in the brain of someone severely disabled by stroke who has exhausted all other options without improvement. The electrodes will be placed on parts of the brain that communicate with the damaged region and surrounding areas. The electrodes will be attached to a wire that connects them to a battery pack located under the skin in the chest\u2014the pack looks similar to a pacemaker. The stimulation will hopefully jump-start the brain\u2019s recovery process and help them gain more control while undergoing standard therapy.\n\nThe team will focus on people who suffer ischemic strokes, which is when blood flow to the brain is blocked. About 87% of all strokes are this type.\n\nDBS is a type of brain surgery, and comes with risks like bleeding, infection and need for more surgeries. Since the procedure is experimental, there may be some unknown risks as well. Depending on how the first procedure goes, the hospital will enroll more people into its trial. If ultimately successful, DBS could become a treatment used in tandem with physical rehabilitation. \u201cThe goal of this therapy is not to replace physical training, but rather to boost the effects,\u201d Machado said. \u201cThe proposition here is to make that recovery greater.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "While this story admittedly is announcing a new procedure never tried in human stroke patients, it conveniently glosses over the sheer complexity of what is being proposed\u2013intricate brain surgery\u00a0for stroke patients\u2013a procedure that inevitably will cost tens of thousands of dollars, and that if successful will actually only be an adjunct to aid in subsequent physical therapy following a stroke.\u00a0 Given that the story says that annually, nearly half of stroke patients will be disabled \u2014 400,000 \u2014 the cost of using this procedure on even a portion of those represents a staggering public health cost.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "TUESDAY, March 23, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- An ingredient in agave -- the plant used to make tequila -- may help fight bone-weakening osteoporosis and other diseases, Mexican researchers say.\n\nAgave, artichokes, garlic, onions and chicory are rich, natural sources of fructans -- nondigestible carbohydrates consisting of molecules of fructose linked together into chains, according to background information in a news release from the American Chemical Society.\n\n\"Experimental studies suggest that fructans may be beneficial in diabetes, obesity, stimulating the immune system of the body, decreasing levels of disease-causing bacteria in the intestine, relieving constipation and reducing the risk of colon cancer,\" Mercedes Lopez, of the National Polytechnic Institute in Guanajuato, said in the news release.\n\nPrevious research has also suggested that fructans stimulate the growth of beneficial bacteria in the large intestine in a way that increases the body's absorption of minerals, including calcium and magnesium, which are needed for bone growth.\n\nIn this study, Lopez and colleagues tested the effects of agave fructans on bone growth in mice.

Shigenaga at Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute (CHORI), was shown in clinical trials to improve metabolism in overweight/obese (OW/OB) otherwise healthy adults in ways that are consistent with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Consumption of the bar for two months also reduced chronic inflammation, and initiated a reduction in weight and waist circumference. Decreased inflammation and improved weight and weight distribution can lower the risk of many chronic diseases.\n\nThese effects occurred without requiring that participants make any change in their current diet or other lifestyle practices other than to eat two CHORI-bars each day for two months. The CHORI-bar is not just another nutrition bar. It is a serious intervention to improve health. Its composition is therefore complex, and required a number of years and a series of clinical trials to develop.\n\nThe publication describing this work appeared online today (April 22, 2015)1 at The FASEB Journal. The bar was developed over the past 10 years by a team of scientists led by Drs. Bruce N. Ames and Joyce C. McCann at CHORI (2,3), in collaboration with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\nMost people do not eat an optimally nutritious diet - particularly the obese. This results in unhealthy metabolism, which not only diminishes vigor, but increases future risk of many diseases. While poor diets contain much that is not healthy (e.g., too much salt, sugar), they also are missing or deficient in a number of important components (e.g., vitamins/minerals, omega-3 fatty acids, fiber) necessary for healthy metabolism. The CHORI-bar is intended to fill these gaps with components present in the bar in normal dietary amounts.\n\nConsiderable evidence in the scientific literature, including Drs. Ames and McCann's work on vitamins and minerals, supports the idea that simply supplying missing or deficient dietary ingredients will improve metabolism (4-7). Development of the CHORI-bar has also been guided by Dr. Mark Shigenaga's insights into the importance of a healthy gut supported by optimal nutrition for disease prevention.\n\nBecause of the strong flavors associated with some vitamins and minerals, CHORI partnered with the United States Department of Agriculture to produce a tasty bar. Formulation development was guided by over 15 small clinical trials to ensure that beneficial properties of the bar were retained. Most early trials were two weeks in length and involved primarily lean individuals, most of whom benefited by increased HDL cholesterol. Results presented in this publication are compiled from 3 two-month clinical trials that also included a significant number of overweight/obese individuals. These trials were conducted over a 4-year period using very similar bar formulations. These trials employed a simple, economical design in which participants acted as their own controls (i.e., change in metabolic markers was measured before and after eating the bar).\n\nHealthy metabolism is like a complex, smooth-running machine. Unhealthy metabolism is like an old machine with many rusted out joints. There is no magic bullet ingredient in nutrition - \"oiling\" one joint is not going to allow the rusted out machine to run. The CHORI-team thinks the broad scale improvements observed with the CHORI-bar may be the result of \"oiling\" multiple joints by the complex nutrient mixture. They are currently conducting experiments to better understand which ingredients in the bar are most important in the complex mixture for the observed effects.\n\nThe increasing prevalence of obesity is taking a huge toll on public health. Conventional approaches that encourage weight loss by improving dietary habits, reducing caloric intake and modifying activity can be successful, but prove difficult for many to initiate and sustain. The CHORI-bar is intended as a non-traditional means to positively impact the obesity epidemic by initiating a healthier metabolism without requiring sudden drastic behavioral changes. It may therefore assist in weight loss programs by beginning a process of favorable metabolic change. Improved metabolism resulting from eating the bar is also associated with a number of reports of feeling better (though this observation has not yet been formally tested), which the CHORI team predicts will help people transition to improved lifestyle habits.\n\nThe power of nutrient-rich, properly formulated food-based supplements, such as the CHORI-bar, to move dysregulated metabolism in a healthy direction may help reverse obesity-associated conditions, and thereby reduce the risk of future chronic diseases. The full potential of food-based supplements to do the work of some drugs without their negative side effects is just beginning to be seriously investigated.\n\nUCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland (formerly Children's Hospital & Research Center Oakland) is a premier, not-for-profit medical center for children in Northern California, and is the only hospital in the East Bay 100% devoted to pediatrics.

But some doctors believe even if that's the explanation for acupuncture's effectiveness, there's no reason not to offer it if it makes people feel better.\n\nThe new analysis examined 29 studies involving almost 18,000 adults. The researchers concluded that the needle remedy worked better than usual pain treatment and slightly better than fake acupuncture. That kind of analysis is not the strongest type of research, but the authors took extra steps including examining raw data from the original studies.\n\nThe results \"provide the most robust evidence to date that acupuncture is a reasonable referral option,\" wrote the authors, who include researchers with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and several universities in England and Germany.\n\nTheir study isn't proof, but it adds to evidence that acupuncture may benefit a range of conditions.\n\nThe new analysis was published online Monday in Archives of Internal Medicine. The federal government's National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine paid for most of the study, along with a small grant from the Samueli Institute, a non-profit group that supports research on alternative healing.\n\nAcupuncture's use has become more mainstream. The military has used it to help treat pain from war wounds, and California recently passed legislation that would include acupuncture among treatments recommended for coverage under provisions of the nation's new health care law. That law requires insurance plans to cover certain categories of benefits starting in 2014. Deciding specifics is being left up to the states.\n\nSome private insurance plans already cover acupuncture; Medicare does not.\n\nIn traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture involves inserting long, very thin needles just beneath the skin's surface at specific points on the body to control pain or stress. Several weekly sessions are usually involved, typically costing about $60 to $100 per session. Fake acupuncture studied in research sometimes also uses needles, but on different areas of the body.\n\nScientists aren't sure what biological mechanism could explain how acupuncture might relieve pain, but the authors of the new study say the results suggest there's more involved than just a placebo effect.\n\nAcupuncture skeptic Dr. Stephen Barrett said the study results are dubious. The retired psychiatrist runs Quackwatch, a Web site on medical scams, and says studies of acupuncture often involve strict research conditions that don't mirror how the procedure is used in the real world.\n\nThe new analysis combined results from studies of patients with common types of chronic pain -- recurring headaches, arthritis or back, neck and shoulder. The studies had randomly assigned patients to acupuncture and either fake acupuncture or standard pain treatment including medication or physical therapy.\n\nThe authors explained their statistical findings by using a pain scale of 0 to 100: The patients' average baseline pain measured 60; it dropped to 30 on average in those who got acupuncture, 35 in those who got fake acupuncture, and 43 in the usual treatment group.\n\nWhile the difference in results for real versus fake acupuncture was small, it suggests acupuncture could have more than a psychological effect, said lead author Andrew Vickers, a cancer researcher at Memorial Sloan-Kettering. The center offers acupuncture and other alternative therapies for cancer patients with hard-to-treat pain.\n\nThe analysis was more rigorous than most research based on pooling previous studies' results, because the authors obtained original data from each study. That makes the conclusion more robust, said Dr. Andrew Avins, author of an Archives commentary and a physician and researcher with the University of California at San Francisco and Kaiser-Permanente.\n\nAcupuncture is relatively safe and uncertainty over how it works shouldn't stop doctors from offering it as an option for patients struggling with pain, Avins said.\n\n\"Perhaps a more productive strategy at this point would be to provide whatever benefits we can for our patients, while we continue to explore more carefully all mechanisms of healing,\" he wrote.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story notes that sessions cost $60 to $100 and are covered by some private insurance, but not Medicare.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "WASHINGTON -- Bacteria live on everyone\u2019s skin, and new research shows some friendly germs produce natural antibiotics that ward off their disease-causing cousins.

Learning what makes a healthy microbiome is a huge field of research, and already scientists are altering gut bacteria to fight diarrhea-causing infections.\n\n\n\nWednesday\u2019s research sheds new light on the skin\u2019s microbiome \u2014 suggesting that one day it may be possible to restore the right balance of good bugs to treat skin disorders, too.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really important paper,\u201d said Dr. Emma Guttman-Yassky of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new research. \u201cIt does open a window for a potential new treatment.\u201d\n\nHealthy skin harbors a different mix of bacteria than skin damaged by disorders such as atopic dermatitis, the most common form of eczema. Those patches of dry, red, itchy skin are at increased risk of infections, particularly from a worrisome germ known as Staphylococcus aureus.\n\nGallo\u2019s team took a closer look at how microbes in healthy skin might be keeping that bad staph in check.\n\nThey discovered certain strains of some protective bacteria secrete two \u201cantimicrobial peptides,\u201d a type of natural antibiotic. In lab tests and on the surface of animal skin, those substances could selectively kill Staph aureus, and even a drug-resistant strain known as MRSA, without killing neighboring bacteria like regular antibiotics do, the team reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\nBut those good bugs are rare in the skin of people with atopic dermatitis, Gallo said.\n\n\u201cPeople with this type of eczema, for some reason that\u2019s not quite known yet, have a lot of bacteria on the skin but it\u2019s the wrong type of bacteria. They\u2019re not producing the antimicrobials they need,\u201d he explained.\n\nWould replenishing the good bugs help? \u201cThey\u2019re normal skin bacteria, so we knew they would be safe,\u201d Gallo noted.\n\nHis team tested five volunteers with atopic dermatitis who had Staph aureus growing on their skin\u2019s surface \u2014 what\u2019s called colonization \u2014 but didn\u2019t have an infection. Researchers culled some of the rare protective bacteria from the volunteers\u2019 skin, grew a larger supply and mixed a dose into an over-the-counter moisturizer. Volunteers had the doctored lotion slathered onto one arm and regular moisturizer on the other.\n\nA day later, much of the staph on the treated arms was killed \u2014 and in two cases, it was wiped out \u2014 compared to the untreated arms, Gallo said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re encouraged that we see the Staph aureus, which we know makes the disease worse, go away,\u201d he said.\n\nThe study couldn\u2019t address the bigger question of whether exposure to the right mix of protective bacteria might improve atopic dermatitis itself, cautioned Mount Sinai\u2019s Guttman-Yassky.\n\nNext-step clinical trials are underway to start testing the effects of longer-term use.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "This is\u00a0preliminary research, but if it\u2019s not too early to speculate about benefits, it\u2019s not too early to discuss costs.

Prebiotics reduce body fat in children who are overweight or obese by altering their gut microbiota, according to new research published in Gastroenterology, the official journal of the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA). Prebiotics are non-digestible food ingredients (such as fiber) that act as fertilizers to help stimulate the growth of good bacteria already in the gut, different from probiotics, which introduce new bacteria into the system.\n\n\"This is a well-designed trial that demonstrates how a prebiotic could potentially help combat one of the most prevalent and costly conditions afflicting children in the developed world -- overnutrition -- by targeting the gut microbiome,\" said Geoffrey A. Preidis, MD, PhD, a member of the AGA Center for Gut Microbiome Research and Education scientific advisory board. \"It is promising to see this evidence that alteration of the gut microbiota can be used to restore health. As a clinician, I hope that continued research into prebiotics will lead to a new strategy for the treatment of obesity.\"\n\nFor this study, researchers from the University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 42 participants. Participants included children, 7 to 12 years old, who were classified as overweight or obese (>85th percentile of body mass index) but otherwise healthy. Participants were randomly assigned to groups given either the prebiotic fiber -- oligofructose-enriched inulin -- or a placebo, once daily for 16 weeks. The prebiotic was provided as a white powder, mixed in water.\n\n\"Powdered fiber, mixed in a water bottle, taken once a day is all we asked the children to change, and we got, what we consider, some pretty exciting results -- it has been fantastic,\" added Raylene A. Reimer, PhD, RD, professor and researcher in the Faculty of Kinesiology at University of Calgary, who led the study.\n\nBased on four-month intervention data, the annual projected body weight increase in the prebiotic group would be 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds), within the expected healthy range, whereas the projected increase in the placebo group was 8 kilograms (17.6 pounds), almost triple the expected yearly weight increase. Thus, supplementation with the prebiotic improved outcomes in children who were overweight or obese. Importantly, the researchers show that the prebiotic induced specific gut bacterial shifts compared to placebo.\n\nThis is the first randomized controlled study to assess comprehensive changes in gut microbial composition with prebiotic intervention in children who are overweight and obese. Excess weight in childhood tends to persist into adulthood and is an early risk factor for obesity-associated morbidity and mortality, highlighting the importance of early intervention.\n\nThe metabolic and microbial findings from this study provide a foundation for a larger clinical trial in the pediatric population. Prebiotics are inexpensive and non-invasive and therefore a plausible dietary treatment in the overweight and obese pediatric population.\n\nThis work was supported by grants from the BMO Financial Group Endowed Research Fund in Healthy Living, Alberta Children's Hospital Foundation, Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (MOP115076-1).

For the study, researchers from Lund University in Sweden recruited 121 young adults who had injured their A.C.L.\u2019s. The volunteers, between 18 and 35, were physically active, and many were competitive athletes. They agreed, rather bravely, to be randomly assigned to one of two groups and accept radically different treatments for their torn A.C.L.\u2019s. The first group began physical therapy and then underwent surgical reconstruction of the ligament, considered by many people to be the best option for injured athletes. The second group received only physical therapy, with the option to have the operation later. Twenty-three subjects of that group did eventually have the operation. (For those fortunate enough not to be personally familiar with A.C.L. surgery, reconstruction involves replacing the injured ligament with tissue from elsewhere in your own leg or from a cadaver.)\n\nOver two years, the injured knees were assessed using a comprehensive numerical score that rated pain, function during activity and other measures. At the time of the original injury, the knee also had been scored. At the end of the two years, both groups showed considerable improvement. The scores for the surgically repaired knees had risen by 39.2 points. The scores for the more conservatively treated knees also had risen, by 39.4 points. In other words, the outcomes were virtually identical. Despite a widespread belief that surgery leads to a stronger knee, the results showed that surgically reconstructing the A.C.L. as soon as possible after the tear \u201cwas not superior\u201d to more conservative treatment, the study\u2019s authors wrote. The findings suggest, the authors concluded, that \u201cmore than half the A.C.L. reconstructions\u201d currently being conducted on injured knees \u201ccould be avoided without adversely affecting outcomes.\u201d\n\nThis possibility should reverberate across playing fields nationwide, where, at the moment, preseason high school, collegiate and adult-league sports practices are under way, with a concomitant surge in A.C.L. tears. By one estimate, as many as 1 in every 556 fit, active people will tear an A.C.L. \u2014 particularly if they participate in sports that involve frequent pivoting and landing, like soccer, football, tennis, skiing and basketball. At the same time, the urge to treat the injury with surgery appears to be growing. The \u201cbelief among most surgeons and patients is that surgery is a \u2018must,\u2019 at least if you aim to go back into an active lifestyle,\u201d the Swedish authors of the study e-mailed in response to questions.\n\nPart of the reason for A.C.L. surgery\u2019s popularity is that by most measures, it works. In the current study, most of the group members who had reconstructive surgery reported that their injured knees felt healthy after two years and that they had returned to activity \u2014 not, in most cases, at the same level as before their injuries, but they were active. Significantly, their knees also were notably more \u201cstable\u201d than the joints that hadn\u2019t been surgically fixed. Stability is, in theory, desirable. A stable knee rarely gives way.\n\nBut in practice, the importance of stability after A.C.L. treatment is \u201ccontroversial,\u201d The New England Journal study\u2019s authors, Richard Frobell, Ph.D., and Stefan Lohmander, M.D., Ph.D., of Lund University, wrote in their e-mail. In an important 2009 study published in The British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers retrospectively compared outcomes after 10 years in competitive athletes who had surgery or had opted for conservative treatment of their torn A.C.L.\u2019s. The surgically repaired knees were notably more stable. But they weren\u2019t fundamentally healthier. The surgically reconstructed knees and the conservatively treated joints experienced similar (and high) levels of early onset knee arthritis, a common occurrence after an A.C.L. tear. The treatments were almost identical, too, in terms of whether the athletes could return to sports and whether they reported subsequent knee problems.\n\nWhy, then, undergo A.C.L. reconstruction, an operation that can be expensive and, like all surgical procedures, carries risks? Several top-flight orthopedic surgeons I contacted say that they remain convinced that surgery leads to a better long-term outcome for certain patients, particularly if they want to return to pivoting sports. \u201cThe reason to have the surgery is to preserve\u201d other parts of the knee from injury during activity, says Dr. Warren Dunn, an assistant professor of orthopedics and rehabilitation at Vanderbilt University who has extensively studied A.C.L. tears. He points out that in The New England Journal of Medicine study, only 8 percent of the patients in the first surgical group subsequently tore a meniscus, a fragile pillow of cartilage that can rip if a knee gives way. Twenty-five percent of those in the physical therapy group eventually tore their meniscuses.\n\nWhat these numbers mean for anyone who tears an A.C.L. or is the parent of a young athlete in that situation is that they should have a long, frank conversation with an orthopedic surgeon and possibly also a nonsurgical sports-medicine specialist about options. \u201cWe recommend surgery based on activity level and sports,\u201d Dr. Dunn says. \u201cMost subjects can do in-line activities\u201d like running or biking \u201cwithout an A.C.L.\u201d He adds, \u201cOn the other hand, we believe that A.C.L.-deficient subjects that do return\u201d to sports involving cutting, pivoting or planting the leg \u201ccan consequently injure the meniscus\u201d or other cartilage in the knee and would benefit from a replacement A.C.L.\n\nThe authors of the study are less sure. \u201cOn the basis of our study results, we\u2019d tell patients\u201d that \u201cthere is no apparent downside of starting a good rehab program and waiting with the surgery decision to see if it is needed or not,\u201d the authors wrote to me.\n\nThe ultimate lesson of The New England Journal study is almost certainly that more science on the subject is needed. \u201cWe definitely know only parts of the long-term outcome\u201d after different A.C.L. treatments, says Dr. Duncan Meuffels, an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam and lead author of The British Journal of Sports Medicine study.\n\nBut large-scale, randomized controlled studies, the gold standard of medical research, may be difficult to orchestrate, in part because people with shredded A.C.L.\u2019s can balk at being denied surgery. In The New England Journal study, some of those assigned to physical therapy wound up requesting surgery, although they weren\u2019t experiencing any knee problems. For them, it seems, \u201cthe desire to undergo surgery was based on expectations rather than symptoms,\u201d the authors told me.

They returned at weeks 26, 39 and 52 for safety assessments, which included an evaluation of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests and physical examinations.\n\u2022 LPCN 1021 was well tolerated and had a favorable safety profile in the long-term management of hypogonadal patients\n\u2022 No hepatic, cardiac or drug-related serious adverse events were reported\n\u2022 The most common drug-related adverse events for LPCN 1021 and T gel 1.62 percent were acne (2.9 percent vs. 2.9 percent, respectively), headache (0.5 percent vs. 3.8 percent, respectively), weight increase (2.4 percent vs. 0 percent, respectively), hematocrit increase (1.9 percent vs. 0 percent, respectively), liver enzyme level increase (1.4 percent vs. 0 percent, respectively), fatigue (0.5 percent vs. 1.9 percent, respectively), and hypertension (0.5 percent vs. 1.9 percent, respectively)\n\u2022 Lipid parameters (i.e., cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and TG) were comparable between treatment groups at Week 52\n\u2022 Androgenic parameters including hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelet, prothrombin, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) showed no significant differences in change from baseline to end of study between treatments\n\n\"Based on the results of this study, we might be closer than ever to having an oral form of therapy to treat the millions of men with hypogonadism,\" said Dr. K\u00f6hler. \"Making sure an oral treatment is safe and effective for men and for the children and partners at risk for inadvertent testosterone transference is the top priority, and what we've found so far has shown we're on the right track.\"\n\nAbout the American Urological Association: The 111th Annual Meeting of the American Urological Association takes place May 6 \u2013 10 at the San Diego Convention Center in San Diego, CA.\n\nFounded in 1902 and headquartered near Baltimore, Maryland, the American Urological Association is a leading advocate for the specialty of urology, and has more than 21,000 members throughout the world.

They were presented at an academy meeting and published in the journal Neurology.\n\nMedicines backed by the strongest evidence include anti-seizure drugs (divalproex sodium, sodium valproate and topiramate), blood pressure drugs (metoprolol, propranolol and timolol) and, for menstrual-related migraines, a medicine called frovatriptan, the guidelines say. They also cite strong support for the herbal remedy butterbur and include a longer list of prescription and non-prescription therapies patients can consider.\n\nThese preventive treatments usually are used daily. The guidelines do not look at the options patients have once symptoms begin.\n\nNot everyone with migraines needs prevention medicine. But nearly 40% have headaches that are so frequent (at least once a week), severe or hard-to-treat that they qualify, Silberstein says. Studies find that just 3% to 13% use the treatments.\n\nWhy so few? One reason is that it's hard to persuade people to take medicines on days when they feel fine, says Elizabeth Loder, a neurologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Silberstein adds that some patients have not been properly diagnosed or made aware of their options. Still others try the treatments and decide they don't work or have unacceptable side effects.\n\n\"You have a lot of gun-shy patients because of a lot of bad experiences,\" says Michael John Coleman, founder of the patient group MAGNUM, also known as the National Migraine Association. Many spend months or years taking medicines that don't work and make them miserable, he says.\n\nThat's what happened to Emily Guzan, 26, a lawyer from Pittsburgh who was diagnosed with migraine in 2008. She was given a prescription for Topamax (topiramate), and it \"was a real nightmare,\" she says. She kept having headaches bad enough to land her in an emergency room once a month and suffered nightmares, an altered sense of taste, an unwanted 30-pound weight loss and memory problems \u2014 all of which she attributes to the drug.\n\nShe tried some other medications, but for now, she's given up on all of them and says she's getting better results with diet, yoga and other lifestyle changes.\n\nFinding the right medication for the right patient can take a lot of trial and error and careful dosing, Silberstein says. But about 80% will get relief, he says \u2014 defined as a headache reduction of at least 50% \u2014 after trying three or four drugs, alternative remedies and lifestyle changes.\n\nEven hard-to-treat patients may eventually respond to something, Loder says, so she urges frustrated patients to keep trying.\n\n\"The life toll that poorly controlled headaches take is really underappreciated,\" she says. \"You don't get back the time you lost at work or the time you lost with your children.\"\n\nColeman, of Alexandria, Va., also urges fellow sufferers to keep working with their doctors: His own migraines took 40 years to control. \"This is not a cookie-cutter disease and there is no magic bullet, but there is hope.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Costs were not discussed.

Taking tamoxifen for five years after diagnosis reduces breast cancer mortality by about one-third.\n\nIn the new study, women with early tumors who took tamoxifen for 10 years cut their risk of dying from breast cancer by another 29%, compared to women who stopped after five years.\n\nIn absolute terms, 12% of women on tamoxifen for 10 years died of breast cancer within five to 14 years after diagnosis, compared to 15% of those who stopped at five years.\n\nOverall, women who take tamoxifen for a decade cut their risk of dying from breast cancer nearly in half, compared with those who don't take it at all, says study co-author Richard Gray of the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.\n\nThat's significant, given that tamoxifen is used by hundreds of thousands of women worldwide, says Gray, whose study was presented Wednesday at the annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Oxford funded the study, which included more than 6,800 women from 36 countries, While tamoxifen delays tumor growth in some women, it appears to cure others, Gray says.\n\n\"This is a dream come true for women,\" says V. Craig Jordan, a researcher who led tamoxifen's development, but who wasn't involved in the new study. \"It's very exciting.\"\n\nTamoxifen, which has been used for decades, is far cheaper than most new chemotherapies and biological drugs, which cost thousands of dollars a month. A generic version costs about $100 a month in the USA, according to Susan G. Komen for the Cure.\n\nIn the U.K., tamoxifen costs only $5 a month. In India, it's 2 cents a pill, says Jordan, scientific director at Georgetown's Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nJordan says the new findings will quickly change care for some patients.\n\nYounger women with more aggressive tumors may want to extend their tamoxifen use, says Jennifer Litton, an assistant professor at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who wasn't involved in the study.\n\nTamoxifen is the only hormonal option for women before menopause, Litton says.\n\nDoctors may not want to change the care of older patients, however, she says. That's because postmenopausal women have the option of tamoxifen or another class of hormonal therapies, called aromatase inhibitors, or AIs. These drugs are slightly more effective than tamoxifen, although they don't work before menopause, Litton says.\n\nBecause the study didn't include AIs, doctors can't say how whether tamoxifen would benefit women who've taken them, Litton says. Other researchers are conducting trials comparing five versus 10 years of AIs, although these results won't be out for several years.\n\nGray noted that tamoxifen has risks. In his study, doubling the length of treament also doubled the risk of endometrial cancer, which affects the uterine lining, to about 3%. However, because this cancer is very treatable, death rates were low: 0.4% of those on tamoxifen for 10 years died of endometrial cancer, compared to 0.2% of those taking it for five years.\n\nDoctors saw no increase in strokes, which has long been a concern with tamoxifen, Gray says.\n\nBreast cancer survivors have mixed reactions to the results.\n\nSome women will be glad to have another treament option, says breast cancer survivor Lillie Shockney, 59, administrative director of the Johns Hopkins Cancer Survivorhip Program in Baltimore.\n\n\"Patients get very nervous when they stop any hormonal therapy, because they feel like now they aren't doing anything,\" says Shockney, 59. \"The opportunity to 'do something' might be appealing, despite the side effects.\"\n\nShockney says she'd like to see research on other ways to prevent recurrences, such as weight loss. \"If someone lost 40 pounds, would that do as much as another five years on tamoxifen?\" Shockney asks.\n\nSome patients may be reluctant to prolong their use of a drug that causes so many side effects, says Boston breast cancer survivor Alicia Staley.\n\nStudies show that only 80% of women take tamoxifen for five years, Litton says. Some switch to an AI, although these drugs can also cause problems, such as joint pain and osteoporosis.\n\nStaley say she tamoxifen gave her \"many, many side effects,\" including severe hot flashes. \"Dry eyes, joint pain, weight gain \u2014 you name it, I had it,\" she says.\n\nAfter 2\u00bd years, Staley and her doctor stopped the drug \"to regain a measure of quality of life.\"\n\nFor Shockney, tamoxifen took a heavy toll on her marriage, causing dryness that made sex unbearably painful.\n\nPatients and their partners need to have honest talks with doctors about how extended treatment will affect their relationship, she says.\n\n\"If we are going to look at giving women tamoxifen for 10 years, by golly, we better get the partners involved,\" Shockney says.\n\nYet Shockney says her husband of nearly 35 years would have wanted her to do everything possible to survive.\n\n\"If someone said to my husband, 'I know this has been a rough road for you, and a big impact on your sex life, but if she stays on it another five years. it could affect her survival,' he would have said, 'Please, please, take the pill.' \"", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story did a good job discussing costs.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "More than 35 million Americans are trying to quit smoking. Smoking cigarettes causes 480,000 premature deaths each year due mainly to a two-fold risk of cardiovascular disease and a 20-fold risk of lung cancer. In a commentary published in the current issue of the American Journal of Medicine, researchers from the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine at Florida Atlantic University reassure clinicians and their patients that varenicline, whose brand name is Chantix, is a safe and effective way to achieve smoking cessation and that failure to use this drug has caused preventable heart attacks and deaths from cardiovascular disease.\n\nIn 2006, varenicline was approved as a safe and effective means to quit smoking and achieved permanent quit rates of approximately 25 percent. In 2009, however, varenicline received a black box warning by the FDA based on their adverse event reports of neuropsychiatric symptoms like depression and thoughts of suicide.\n\nThere were plausible alternative explanations including that nearly half of the subjects had psychiatric histories, 42 percent were taking psychotropic drugs and about 42 percent were suffering from depression. Nonetheless, since then, there has been a 76 percent decline in the number of prescriptions dispensed from a peak of about 2 million in the last quarter of 2007 to about 531,000 in the first quarter of 2014.\n\nIn their commentary, the FAU researchers emphasize that, until recently, the totality of randomized evidence on varenicline had been restricted to eight small trials, which did not demonstrate a hazard. The researchers caution that the reliable detection of small to moderate risks and benefits of drug therapies requires cogent data from large-scale randomized trials designed a priori to test the hypothesis.\n\nSuch a large randomized trial was recently completed that included both apparently healthy individuals as well as those with severe mental illness. The trial was conducted for 12 weeks on about 8,000 long-term smokers and included equal subgroups of those without as well as with psychiatric disorders. In subjects without psychiatric disorders, those treated with varenicline had less neuropsychiatric symptoms and in subjects without psychiatric disorders there were no increases in these symptoms. Both groups of participants assigned at random to varenicline achieved significantly higher abstinence rates at 12 weeks than those assigned to placebo, nicotine patch or bupropion. Just a few months ago, the FDA removed the black box warning from varenicline.\n\nThe commentary was coauthored by Dianna Gaballa, a fourth-year medical student; Joanna Drowos, D.O., M.P.H., an associate professor of integrated medical science and associate chair of the Department of Integrated Medical Science; and Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., Dr.P.H., the first Sir Richard Doll Professor and senior academic advisor to the dean, all in FAU's Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine.\n\n\"The existing totality of evidence suggests an urgent need to increase the use of varenicline in the general population as well as in those with serious mental illness who on average die about 20 years earlier than the general population, in part, because their smoking rates may be as high as 75 percent,\" said Hennekens.\n\nQuitting smoking significantly reduces risks of cardiovascular disease beginning within a matter of months and reaching the non-smoker status within a few years, even among older adults. For lung and other cancers, however, reductions do not even begin to emerge for years after quitting and, even after 10 years, quitters achieve death rates only about midway between the continuing smoker and non-smoker.\n\n\"For reducing risks of cardiovascular disease it's never too late to quit, but to reduce risks of cancer, it's never too early,\" said Hennekens.\n\nThe authors speculate that if use of varenicline had not plummeted by 76 percent following the black box warning in 2009, perhaps 17,000 premature deaths from cardiovascular disease may have been avoided each year during the last few years. Public health efforts and effective cessation treatments including behavioral counseling and medication have resulted in a 14 percent decrease in smoking in the U.S. while the rates are markedly increasing in developing countries.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heart disease is the leading killer among men and women causing approximately 600,000 deaths each year.\n\nAmong the numerous honors and recognitions Hennekens has received include the Ochsner Award for reducing premature deaths from cigarettes in 2014. From 1995 to 2005, Science Watch ranked him as the third most widely cited medical researcher in the world and five of the top 20 were his former trainees and/or fellows. In 2012, Science Heroes ranked Hennekens No. 81 in the history of the world for having saved more than 1.1 million lives.

Dr. Vigneswaran is division director of thoracic surgery and a professor in the department of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery of Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine.\n\nMalignant pleural mesothelioma is caused by environmental factors such as exposure to asbestos as well as a genetic predisposition to the cancer. It develops in the pleura, the thin layer of tissue surrounding the lungs. As the tumor grows, it restricts the lungs, typically causing shortness of breath, fatigue, weight loss and/or chest discomfort and pain. In PD surgery, the pleura is removed. While the procedure cannot cure mesothelioma, it can help control the buildup of fluid, improve breathing and lessen cancer pain. Dr. Vigneswaran and colleagues administered a cancer quality-of-life survey known as the EORTC QLQ-C30 to 114 mesothelioma patients who underwent PD surgery. The median age was 70, with a range of 50 to 88. Prior to surgery, 31 percent of the patients had a performance status score of 0 (fully functional); 65 percent had a performance status score of 1 (able to do light house work or office work); and 4 percent had a performance status of 2 (ambulatory and capable of self-care, but unable to work). Following surgery, all patients were surveyed at 1 month, 4-5 months, 7-8 months and 10-11 months.\n\nThe quality of life survey measured overall functioning (physical, emotional, cognitive, etc.); general symptoms (fatigue, nausea/vomiting and pain); individual items (shortness of breath, diarrhea, insomnia, constipation and financial difficulties) and overall health.\n\nImproved quality of life was observed in the first month after surgery and was maintained at late follow-up in all patients. Quality of life was not adversely affected by surgery at any time in patients who, prior to surgery, had performance status of 1 or 2; a tumor volume greater than 600 ml. or a type of tumor cell called non-epithelioid.\n\n\u201cThe net benefit of pleurectomy and decortication justifies the procedure in the majority of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma,\u201d Dr. Vigneswaran concluded.\n\nThe study is titled \u201cQuality of Life in Patients Undergoing Pleurectomy and Decortication for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma.\u201d The surgeries were performed by Dr. Vigneswaran at University of Chicago Medicine, where he practiced before recently joining Loyola.", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "There is no mention of costs in the news release.

And while mice are different from humans in many ways, their immune systems are quite similar.\n\n\u201cIf this works, it is going to be absolutely fantastic,\u201d said Bill Heetderks, who directs outside research at the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, part of the National Institutes of Health, which helped pay for the research. \u201cEven if it doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s going to be another step down the road.\u201d\n\nIn autoimmune disease, the body\u2019s immune cells mistakenly attack and destroy healthy tissue. In MS, it\u2019s the fatty protective sheath around the nerves; in type-1 or juvenile diabetes it\u2019s cells in the pancreas that make insulin; in rheumatoid arthritis it\u2019s tissue in the joint.\n\nCurrently, the main treatment is to suppress the immune system, an approach that can leave patients vulnerable to infections and cancer. The new treatment re-educates the immune cells so they stop the attacks.\n\nThe approach uses tiny little balls called nanoparticles made of the same material used to make surgical sutures that dissolve harmlessly in the body. They\u2019re attached to little bits of the protein that the immune cells are attacking, the researchers report in Sunday\u2019s issue of the journal Nature Biotechnology.\n\nStephen Miller of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago had been trying a slightly different approach to treating MS. When normal cells die naturally through a self-destruction process called apoptosis, immune cells called macrophages come in and eat up the mess.\n\nThe macrophages are carried to the spleen where they show these ground-up bits of cells to other immune cells called T-cells. It\u2019s a kind of introduction that familiarizes the T-cells with the body\u2019s normal cells. Then T-cells know not to attack healthy cells.\n\nMiller\u2019s team had been trying to find ways to use this process to re-educate the T-cells. They have been attaching bits of the myelin that T-cells mistakenly attack to healthy cells from MS patients that were self-destructing, then infusing the concoction back into MS patients.\n\nThe idea would be to \u201cintroduce\u201d the myelin to the T-cells at the same time they were \u201cmeeting\u201d the healthy tissue, and educate them to leave the myelin alone.\n\nSo far the team has only shown the process is safe \u2013 a phase 1 clinical trial. But Miller says the experiment also seemed to show they were beginning to repair the patients\u2019 immune systems. However, it was hideously expensive. \u201cIt cost probably about a million dollars to treat 10 patients using live cells,\u201d he said.\n\nObviously, the researchers needed something cheaper. Miller got together with Lonnie Shea, a professor of chemical and biological engineering at Northwestern. They substituted cheap little balls of plastic called polystyrene nanoparticles for the self-destructing cells.\n\nThese new nanoparticles stopped the course of a MS-like disease in mice, the researchers found. But polystyrene is no good to use in people. It doesn\u2019t break down and contains a compound, styrene, that may cause cancer.\n\nShea had another possibility, called poly(lactide-co-glycolide) or PLG for short. \u201cIt turns out this is an FDA approved substance that is used in resorbable sutures,\u201d said Miller.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing rare or exotic or strange here,\u201d said NIBIB\u2019s Heetderks. The particles are easy to produce, he said.\n\nThis worked just as well in mice. It only takes an hour in a chemical bath to attach little bits of myelin to the nanoparticles of PLG. When infused into a vein, they\u2019re carried by the blood right to the spleen, where the nanoparticles \u201cmeet\u201d the T-cells.\n\nIf the treatment was done as soon as the mice had their first MS-like attack, the attacks stopped. The effects lasted for the entire lives of the mice, Miller said.\n\nWhat\u2019s great about the approach, Miller says, is that it can be used to treat any autoimmune disease. For diabetes, little bits of pancreatic beta cells could be attached to the nanoparticles. For a food allergy, the part of the food that causes the allergic response could be attached. \u201cYou can try to induce tolerance to peanuts or eggs or shellfish or whatever you are allergic to,\u201d he said.\n\nOne shortcoming is that scientists don\u2019t always know what\u2019s causing an autoimmune disease. \u201cWe know that in rheumatoid arthritis, your joints get attacked, but what we don\u2019t know really well is what specific protein in your joints is being attacked. We really need to know that before we can apply this therapy,\u201d Miller said.\n\nNow the researchers are looking for funding so they can test this new approach in people. They\u2019re in discussions with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation to test it in people with type-1 diabetes, and the Myelin Repair Foundation to test it in MS patients, Miller said. They may form their own company to develop it as a medical treatment, something that would be years away.\n\nMice don\u2019t live very long, and it\u2019s not clear if human patients would need repeat treatments.

But most of those fears are related to the use of a combination of two hormones, estrogen and progestin, which are prescribed to relieve hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause, and have been shown to increase a woman\u2019s risk of breast cancer.\n\nThe new findings, reported Tuesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association, come from 10,739 women in the Women\u2019s Health Initiative study who had previously had a hysterectomy, the surgical removal of the uterus. Nationwide, about one-third of women in their 50s have had a hysterectomy.\n\nThe Women\u2019s Health Initiative was begun in 1991 by the National Institutes of Health as a sweeping investigation of hormone use and other health issues of postmenopausal women.\n\n\n\nWhile most women in the hormone study were taking combination hormone therapy, women without a uterus took estrogen alone or a placebo for about six years and were followed for nearly 11 years. The estrogen-only group was not given progestin, which is prescribed only to protect the uterus from the harmful effects of estrogen. Although all the women in the estrogen study stopped using the treatment in 2004, the investigators have continued to monitor their health, as is typical in large clinical trials.\n\nThe most surprising new finding relates to breast cancer. The women with hysterectomies who used estrogen alone had a 23 percent lower risk for breast cancer compared with those who had taken a placebo. This is in stark contrast to the higher risk of breast cancer shown in the estrogen-progestin part of the trial.\n\n\u201cThe decreased risk of breast cancer in this group is something we totally didn\u2019t expect when we started the W.H.I. hormone therapy trials,\u201d said Andrea Z. LaCroix, the study\u2019s lead author and a professor of epidemiology at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. \u201cThis study differentiates estrogen alone from estrogen and progestin in a very big way. I hope it gets across to women, because we are not reversing ourselves.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the investigators emphasized that the results do not change recommendations concerning combination hormone therapy for the two-thirds of menopausal women who still have a uterus. The Women\u2019s Health Initiative data have consistently shown that the combination of estrogen and progestin raises breast cancer risk, and that the treatment should be used only to relieve severe menopause symptoms, using the lowest dose for the shortest possible time.\n\nBut the data are reassuring for millions of middle-aged women without a uterus who take estrogen to relieve hot flashes and other menopause symptoms.\n\nAn accompanying editorial in the journal was skeptical about the results, arguing that the design of the initiative, which is skewed toward older women and stopped all forms of hormone treatment after several years of use, does not match the way doctors typically prescribe treatment to women in their 50s at the onset of menopause.\n\nDr. Graham Colditz, an author of the editorial and professor of surgery at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said he thought data collected from observational studies that show a higher risk of breast cancer associated with estrogen use were more reliable than the data gathered from the Women\u2019s Health Initiative clinical trial.\n\n\u201cThe finding doesn\u2019t reflect how hormones are used in the U.S. at the moment,\u201d Dr. Colditz said.\n\nThe trial has, however, been held up for years as the gold standard for medical research, and its findings linking combination hormones to breast cancer and heart problems led to significant changes in the way doctors around the world treated menopause.\n\nA major caveat in interpreting the new estrogen data is that the study used conjugated equine estrogens, which are estrogen compounds derived from the urine of pregnant mares and marketed by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals under the brand Premarin. The brand has fallen out of favor with many women who are choosing treatments that contain estradiol, which is chemically similar to a woman\u2019s natural estrogen. It is not known whether the benefits of estrogen shown in the Women\u2019s Health Initiative would be replicated using a different type of estrogen.\n\nNobody knows why estrogen treatment alone appeared to lower breast cancer risk in the study, but one explanation may be that in menopausal women with low levels of natural estrogen, the effects of estrogen drugs induce cell death in existing tumors. Nobody is suggesting that women start using estrogen to prevent breast cancer, but the finding opens a potentially new avenue of research in the prevention of the disease.\n\n\u201cWe need to look closely at these findings to see if we can learn more about ways to prevent breast cancer in women,\u201d said Dr. JoAnn Manson, a Women\u2019s Health Initiative investigator and an author of the study who is chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston.\n\nIn the final analysis of the estrogen-only trial, use of the hormone was not associated with any significant risks or benefits pertaining to blood clots, stroke, hip fracture, colon cancer or overall death rates.\n\nBut there were surprising differences in the risks and benefits of estrogen use on heart risk when comparing the youngest and oldest women in the study. Women who were in their 50s when they first started using estrogen also had significantly fewer heart risks, including almost 50 percent fewer heart attacks, compared with those assigned to the placebo group.\n\nThe data indicate that for every 10,000 women in their 50s, those using estrogen would experience 12 fewer heart attacks, 13 fewer deaths and 18 fewer adverse events like blood clots or stroke in a given year, compared with those taking a placebo.\n\nBut the risks of estrogen use were pronounced in older women. For every 10,000 women in their 70s, using estrogen would cause 16 extra heart attacks, 19 extra deaths and 48 serious adverse events.\n\n\u201cThe big message there is that the data look much more favorable for younger women and much riskier for older women,\u201d said Dr. LaCroix.\n\nDr. Rowan Chlebowski, another author of the study and a medical oncologist at Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute, said the findings underscored the fact that the risks and benefits of menopause hormones change depending on a woman\u2019s health status, her age and the type of hormone used.\n\nDr. Chlebowski previously led research that showed cancer risks associated with combination hormone therapy, but he says the new data on estrogen alone show that in certain women, estrogen use to relieve menopausal symptoms is a \u201cgood choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the debate, people are saying hormones are good or not good \u2014 it\u2019s been all or nothing. This calls attention to the fact that there are differences,\u201d Dr. Chlebowski said. \u201cI hope that separation will become clearer now.\u201d\n\n \n\n\n\nThis article appeared in print on Wednesday, April 6, 2011 on page A1.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story does not touch on costs.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "MONDAY, Aug. 1, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- When women take a supplement of the omega 3 fatty acid DHA during pregnancy, their babies have fewer cold symptoms and shorter illnesses, new research indicates.\n\nAt 1 month and 3 months of age, about 38 percent of babies exposed to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the womb experienced cold symptoms, compared to about 45 percent of the babies whose mothers were given a placebo supplement while they were pregnant.\n\n\"The data suggested that for most of the symptoms we looked at, duration of symptoms was less when mothers received DHA.

The research was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the March of Dimes Foundation.\n\nOmega 3 fatty acids are a class of nutrients considered essential for neural and retinal development during pregnancy. They are often obtained through diet by eating fish. But, concerns about mercury contamination in fish have led to recommendations that advise pregnant women to limit their fish consumption. Pregnant women are also advised to avoid certain fish, such as swordfish, altogether.\n\nTherefore, the current study looked at DHA supplements derived from algae. Ramakrishnan said there are no concerns about mercury contamination in DHA from algae.\n\nMore than 800 Mexican women were included in the study. Half were randomly selected to be in the treatment group while the other half received a daily placebo pill. The treatment group received 400 milligrams of DHA each day, beginning when they were between 18 and 22 weeks pregnant. Treatment continued at least until the birth of the baby.\n\nRamakrishnan said Mexican women tend to be deficient in DHA, much like many American women are.\n\nThe babies were assessed at 1, 3 and 6 months of age, and the mothers completed questionnaires about their babies' health. To aid their recall, the mothers were also asked to keep a diary, recording any illness symptoms.\n\nBabies in the DHA group had a 24 percent drop in the odds of having a combination of cold symptoms at 1 month compared to babies whose mothers were given a placebo.

This common practice is based on the assumption that it will help them recover more quickly. An international study coordinated at KU Leuven, Belgium, has now disproven this theory. The study shows that receiving little to no nutrition during the first week in intensive care makes children recover faster.\n\nCritically ill children in intensive care are unable to eat independently. The current standard of care for such children is based mostly on the assumption that they need to eat to regain their strength. Therefore, the method that is applied worldwide is to artificially feed these children during the first days of their stay in intensive care.

McEvoy, MD, MCR, and her co-authors report that at three months of age, the infants whose mothers took 500 mg of vitamin C in addition to their prenatal vitamin had significantly better forced expiratory flows (FEFs). FEFs measure how fast air can be exhaled from the lung and are an important measure of lung function because they can detect airway obstruction.\n\nThe researchers also discovered an association between the infant FEFs and a genetic variant some of the mothers possessed that appeared to amplify the negative impact of nicotine on the babies before they were born. Other studies have linked this genetic factor, specifically for the \u03b15 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, to increased risk of lung cancer and obstructive lung disease.\n\n\u201cSmoking during pregnancy reflects the highly addictive nature of nicotine that disproportionately affects the most vulnerable populations,\u201d said Dr. McEvoy, lead study author and professor of pediatrics at Oregon Health & Science University. \u201cFinding a way to help infants exposed to smoking and nicotine in utero recognizes the unique dangers posed by a highly advertised, addictive product and the lifetime effects on offspring who did not choose to be exposed.\u201d\n\nIn a previous study, the authors had shown that 72 hours after birth, babies of mothers who smoked had better lung function if their mothers were randomized to vitamin C (500 mg/day) during their pregnancies compared to those born to mothers who smoked and were randomized to placebo. That study used passive methods to measure lung function, and the authors note that FEFs provide a more direct assessment of airway function and are similar to methods used to diagnose lung disease in adults and older children.\n\nIn the current study, 251 pregnant women who smoked were randomly assigned at 13 to 23 weeks of gestation to either receive vitamin C (125 women) or a placebo (126 women). Smoking was defined as having had one or more cigarettes in the last week. All participants received smoking cessation counseling throughout the study, and about 10 percent of the women quit smoking during the study.\n\nThe researchers wrote that study results support the hypothesis that oxidative stress caused by cigarette smoking reduces the amount of ascorbic acid, a component of vitamin C, available to the body.

Those levels rose in study participants who received vitamin C to become comparable to women who do not smoke.\n\nInfants in this study will continue to be followed to track their lung function and respiratory outcomes.

It is a painful infection of a single sensory nerve on one side of the body that can occur almost anywhere but most commonly involves the torso or face. Initial symptoms of tingling or burning pain within days develop into a red bumpy rash and very painful blisters.\n\nThe blisters heal in a week or two to form crusty scabs that eventually fall off. But for about 15 percent of people, shingles does not end there. Instead, it leaves them with deep, searing nerve pain \u2014 a condition called postherpetic neuralgia, or PHN \u2014 that can last for months or years and has no treatment or cure. More than half the cases of PHN affect people over 60.\n\nOther possible complications of shingles include pneumonia, hearing problems, blindness and encephalitis.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. Although most people get shingles only once, it can happen again, especially if you have a weakened immune system, which most everyone does with advancing age.\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky you may detect the onset of shingles before the rash appears. Years ago when I went to bed with what had been a daylong gnawing irritation on one side of my back, I awakened in the middle of the night with the thought, \u201cI have shingles.\u201d First thing in the morning I got a prescription for the antiviral drug acyclovir, which halted progress of the disease.\n\nNot willing to trust my luck a second time, I got the new vaccine. Here\u2019s how it compares to its predecessor Zostavax, which over all reduces the risk of shingles by 51 percent and of PHN by 67 percent. According to the C.D.C., Shingrix can protect 97 percent of people in their 50s and 60s and 91 percent of those in their 70s and 80s. It also reduces the risk of PHN by 86 percent, and it appears to be longer lasting than Zostavax, which starts to lose its protection after three years.\n\nWhat makes Shingrix so much better is the inclusion of a substance called an adjuvant that boosts the body\u2019s immune response to the vaccine. Another difference is that Zostavax contains a live, weakened virus, making it unsuitable for people with poor immunity, whereas Shingrix contains a nonliving virus particle and may eventually be approved for those with compromised immunity, who are especially susceptible to a severe case of shingles.\n\nI should tell you that the new vaccine is not exactly a walk in the park. The shot itself is painful and can cause a sore arm for a day or two. Some people develop immune-related side effects like headache, fever or an upset stomach that last less than three days, according to the manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline. My only reaction beyond local soreness was an acid stomach for a day or two.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The reporter noted that the \u201clist price is $280 for the two-part shot without insurance.\u201d\u00a0 Since Medicare Part D insurance covered it with a $40 co-pay for each part it is likely affordable for many people.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Breaking a sweat? Researchers are creating a skin patch that can test those droplets while people exercise and beam results to their smartphones, possibly a new way to track health and fitness.\n\nThe experimental gadget goes well beyond activity monitors like the Fitbit. A little larger than a quarter, it\u2019s almost like a tiny lab stuck to the skin \u2014 and a study published Wednesday found it worked on sweaty bicyclists, sticking even during a long-distance race in Arizona.\n\nIf you think of perspiration as just a drippy nuisance, think again.\n\n\u201cSweat has biochemical components within it that tell us a lot about physiological health,\u201d said John A. Rogers, who directs Northwestern University\u2019s Center for Bio-Integrated Electronics and led the new research.\n\nToday\u2019s wearable technology helps people track their calories, activity and heart rate. A wearable biosensor would be \u201cradically different,\u201d Rogers said.\n\nFor simple fitness purposes, it could give an early warning that it\u2019s time to replenish electrolytes before someone starts to feel dehydrated. But eventually with additional research, Rogers envisions more sophisticated use of such devices, such as real-time monitoring of how the body adjusts during military training, or even to screen people for diseases such as diabetes or cystic fibrosis.\n\nRogers, who did much of the research while at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, has long worked to develop electronic devices that can stretch and twist with the body. The skin-like sweat patch adds a capability called microfluidics, capturing and analyzing tiny amounts of body fluid.\n\nHow it works: Stick the patch on the skin and start moving. Tiny channels collect perspiration and route it to different compartments where it interacts with chemicals that change color to reflect sweat loss, the perspiration\u2019s acidity level, and concentrations of chloride, glucose and lactate.\n\nTogether, those measurements can indicate such things as hydration levels or electrolyte loss. Hold a smartphone over the patch, and an app takes a picture of the colors and interprets what they mean.\n\nIn two studies reported Wednesday, Rogers\u2019 team stuck patches to the arms and backs of 21 healthy volunteers. Nine rode exercise bikes in a gym to compare the sweat patches\u2019 performance with the decidedly lower-tech method of sweat-testing used today \u2014 taping on absorbent pads and carting the resulting wet samples to a laboratory. For a more real-world test, the other 12 bicyclists wore the patches while competing in a long-distance outdoor race in Tucson.\n\nThe patches stayed in place and worked even in the challenging outdoor race, and the patches\u2019 biochemical test results agreed with the indoor bikers\u2019 conventional sweat tests, the researchers reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\n\u201cIt seems really practical,\u201d said Stanford University chemical engineering professor Zhenan Bao, who also researches novel biomedical materials but wasn\u2019t involved with the sweat patch. By simply looking at a color change, \u201csuch a patch allows people to now have an opportunity to understand their health and how it changes depending on activities.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a growing field: Other research groups around the country, including some of Bao\u2019s colleagues, are pursuing wearable biosensors.\n\nRogers\u2019 sweat patches are designed for one-time use over a few hours.

Destounis, a diagnostic radiologist at Elizabeth Wende Breast Care in Rochester, N.Y., and the study's lead author, said in a news release from the Radiological Society of North America. \"It's an easy way to eliminate needle biopsy for something that's probably benign.\"\n\nElastography measures the compressibility and mechanical properties of a lesion. Cancerous tumors tend to be stiffer than surrounding tissues or cysts, whereas benign lesions are more compressible.\n\n\"You can perform elastography at the same time as hand-held ultrasound and view the images on a split screen, with the two-dimensional ultrasound image on the left and the elastography image on the right,\" Destounis said.\n\nAs part of an ongoing study, 179 women underwent breast ultrasound and elastography. The researchers performed biopsies on the 134 solid lesions they detected. . They found that elastography correctly identified 98 percent of cancerous lesions and 82 percent of benign lesions, and they also determined that elastography was more accurate than ultrasound in gauging the size of the lesions.\n\nThe findings were to be presented Nov. 30 in Chicago at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America.\n\nIn another study scheduled to be presented at the meeting, researchers found that high-frequency ultrasound with elastography can help distinguish between cancerous and benign skin lesions, which could improve the efficiency of skin cancer diagnosis.\n\nDr. Eliot L. Siegel, vice chairman of the radiology department at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore and the study's lead author, said in the news release that \"dermatologists tend to biopsy any lesions that seem visually suspicious for disease.\"\n\n\"Consequently,\" he said, \"many benign lesions are needlessly biopsied in order to avoid the risk of missing a potentially deadly melanoma.\"\n\nSiegel and his colleagues used ultra-high-frequency ultrasound to image cancerous and benign skin lesions on 40 people. They also calculated the elasticity ratio of the lesions and adjacent normal skin and used laboratory analysis to confirm their diagnoses. They found that benign lesions had high levels of elasticity, whereas cancerous lesions were much less elastic. The elasticity ratio of normal skin to adjacent lesions ranged from 0.04 to 0.3 for benign lesions to above 10.0 for cancerous lesions.\n\n\"The visualized portion of a skin lesion can be just the tip of the iceberg, and most dermatologists operate 'blindly' beyond what they can see on the surface,\" Siegel said. \"High-frequency ultrasound provides almost microscopic resolution and enables us to get size, shape and extent of the lesion prior to biopsy.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more about cancer diagnosis.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story makes no mention of the cost of elastography.\u00a0The use of a second additive technology will clearly add to the costs of diagnosis unless the sensitivity and specificity of the test is sufficiently high to reduce unnecessary biopsies.

A stool sample containing high levels of these markers will be strong enough to change the test's liquid display from pink to yellow, indicating high levels of Bifidobacterium. The liquid will remain pink if a sample has low levels of acetate and lactate, indicating that Bifidobacterium is missing and that key nutrients from breast milk, human milk oligosaccharides (HMO), are being wasted. Evivo has commenced rigorous clinical trials with the prototype to demonstrate the results from infant stool samples.\n\nPoint-of-Care Diagnostic Expert Turns Focus to the Infant Gut\n\nThe development of the prototype is led by Dr. Bethany Henrick, Ph.D., Director of Immunology and Diagnostics for Evivo. With more than a decade of experience designing and creating rapid, point-of-care diagnostics, Henrick was formerly an integral part of the team that developed and optimized the world's fastest point-of-care HIV test in 2005.\n\n\"This is the first and only point-of-care screening test designed to identify infants that do not have enough Bifidobacterium levels to create a stable infant gut microbiome,\" said Dr. Henrick. \"With recent research indicating most babies born after 1980 do not acquire Bifidobacterium at birth, our ability to detect significant levels of Bifidobacterium gives pediatricians and parents an immediate indication of whether or not their baby has this beneficial gut bacteria that set them up for lifelong health.\"\n\nIdentifying a Disappearing, Yet Critical Piece of Gut Health\n\nDr. Henrick's previously published findings, which are the basis for the Evivo test, show an inverse correlation between rising infant fecal pH, reduced acetate and lactate, and lower levels of beneficial Bifidobacterium, proving that the infant gut microbiome has been rapidly changing over the last three generations. In the past, babies acquired Bifidobacterium from their mother during childbirth, but due to the increased use of modern medical practices such as antibiotics, C-sections and formula feeding, nine out of 10 babies born in the U.S. today no longer acquire it. The generational loss of this good bacteria in the infant gut allows for potentially harmful bacteria such as E. Coli and Clostridia to thrive, which are linked to higher risk of short- and long-term health issues such as colic, eczema, allergies, diabetes, and obesity.\n\n\"Currently there is no way to easily determine whether a baby is colonized with healthy bacteria,\" said Mark Underwood, M.D., Chief of Neonatology at UC Davis Medical Center. \"The ability to quickly measure levels of Bifidobacterium in a stool sample would enable pediatricians to identify babies with low levels of these beneficial bacteria and take appropriate action.\"\n\nEvolve BioSystems' Evivo is the only baby probiotic clinically proven to restore Bifidobacterium to a baby's gut and reduce potentially harmful bacteria by 80 percent.

The results are presented in the journal The Lancet Oncology.\n\nRectal cancer affects some 2,000 men and women in Sweden every year. Preoperative radiotherapy was gradually introduced in the early 1990s, with a consequent improvement in prognosis for people with rectal cancer and reduction in the risk of local recurrence.\n\n\"Back then we showed that preoperative radiotherapy reduces the risk of local recurrence by over 50 per cent for patients with rectal cancer,\" says principal investigator Anna Martling, senior consultant surgeon and professor at Karolinska Institutet's Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery. \"Thanks to our results, radiotherapy is recommended to many rectal cancer patients.\"\n\nHowever, radiotherapy can cause adverse reactions and the optimal radiotherapeutic method and the interval between it and the ensuing surgery have been mooted. The study now presented in The Lancet Oncology is based on the claim that the adverse effects of rectal cancer treatment can be reduced by administering more but lower doses of radiation for a longer time, or by increasing the interval between radiotherapy and surgery. These hypotheses have now been tested in a study in which rectal cancer patients were randomly assigned to three different treatment arms:\n\u2022 Delayed surgery with short-course (5x5 Gy) radiotherapy followed by surgery after 4-8 weeks.\n\u2022 Delayed surgery with long-course (25x2 Gy) radiotherapy followed by surgery after 4-8 weeks.\n\nThe results of the study show that patients with delayed surgery develop fewer complications with equally good oncological outcomes. It also showed that there is no difference between long-course and short-course radiotherapy other than that the former considerably lengthens the time for treatment.\n\n\"The results of the study will give rise to improved therapeutic strategies, fewer complications with a sustained low incidence of local recurrence, and better survival rates for rectal cancer patients,\" says Professor Martling. \"The results can now be immediately put to clinical use to the considerable benefit of the patients.\"\n\nEighteen Swedish hospitals took part in the study, which was financed by the Swedish Research Council and the Cancer Society in Stockholm, and through the regional ALF agreement between Stockholm County Council and Karolinska Institutet.

Massage Therapy May Rub It Out\n\nLow back pain is second only to cold symptoms when it comes to complaints that send people to the doctor. Sooner or later, back pain seems to get most of us.\n\nNow, a study in the July 5 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine shows that massage is an effective treatment for lower back pain. In some cases, researchers report, the benefits of massage lasted for six months or longer.\n\nResearchers headed by epidemiologist Daniel Cherkin, a senior investigator at Group Health Research Institute in Seattle, enrolled 401 people with chronic low back pain and no identifiable reason for the pain.\n\nStudy participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatments. One group received full-body relaxation massage. A second received targeted deep tissue massage. The third group got the usual care \u2014 medication and physical therapy.\n\nIn relaxation massage, often referred to as Swedish massage, a variety of maneuvers are used to promote a feeling of relaxation throughout the body and muscles. Structural massage, commonly referred to as deep tissue massage, targets specific pain related tissues, ligaments and joints.\n\nAfter 10 weeks, the results were dramatic: Nearly two-thirds of the patients who received either type of weekly massage said their back pain was significantly improved or gone altogether. Only about one-third of patients receiving the usual care experienced similar relief.\n\n\"We found that both types of massage were equally effective in helping people improve their function and diminish their symptoms,\" Cherkin says. He says massage relieved the pain for six months or more.\n\nPrior studies of massage for back pain had tested only structural forms of massage, not relaxation massage. But relaxation massage is more widely available, and it's often less costly.\n\nPeggy O'Brien-Murphy was among the study participants. In her late 60s, a retired state employee, O'Brien Murphy tried just about everything to get rid of the pain in her lower back. The massage therapy finally seemed to do the trick.\n\n\"I'm so very lucky,\" she says.\n\nPrior to the study, O'Brien-Murphy says she had found herself increasingly debilitated by back pain. At one point, she says she could hardly get out of a chair.\n\n\"It was really bad,\" she says. \"In fact, I was pulling myself up the stairs by the banister.\" It was difficult getting into the car. And she could no longer walk the hills where she lives. For an active person, this was devastating.\n\nSo when she came upon an ad in her HMO's newsletter, Group Health Cooperative in Seattle, she jumped at the chance to take part in the massage study.\n\nAfter just two or three sessions with massage therapist Loretta Lanz, O'Brien-Murphy said she felt better. After each session she walked around the block, standing straighter and walking further each time. By the end, she felt \"back to normal,\" with a \"spring to my walk and some energy in it!\"\n\nFor O'Brien-Murphy, the massage-therapy experience has been life-changing: She has traveled to China, where she walked all over without problems, and she's already planning her next trips.\n\nNo one knows exactly how massage works to relieve pain, says Dr. Richard Deyo of Oregon Health Sciences University, who also took part in the study.\n\n\"It may be that it helps with relaxation of muscles that are tense,\" Deyo says. \"But it may also be there are simply more generalized effects of relaxation \u2014 in the caring and attention and someone laying hands on \u2014 that may all be important.\"\n\nResearchers say future studies should look more closely at the benefits of massage and focus on cost-benefit analysis.\n\nAs for O'Brien-Murphy, she remains free of back pain, but not without some effort on her part.

This can be made from their own vessels. But because dialysis is done so regularly, kidney patients often run out of healthy vessels and need an artificial one, often made out of gortex. Those are prone to infection and inflammation.\n\nIn the study, doctors took a small snippet of skin from patients. Cells from those samples were grown in a lab, to help them produce proteins like elastin and collagen. From those, scientists made sheets of tissue that were rolled into blood vessels 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 centimeters) long.\n\nThe vessels were finished after 6 to 9 months.

Procedural sedation is commonly used for painful or uncomfortable procedures like setting fractures, repairing lacerations and draining abscesses in emergency departments worldwide.\n\n\"Although sedation-related serious adverse events occur infrequently, recognition and early intervention is necessary to ensure patient safety,\" said Dr. Maala Bhatt, lead author, director of pediatric emergency research at CHEO, and assistant professor at the University of Ottawa. \"We've been able to identify sedation medications and practices associated with the best clinical outcomes, which is practice-changing.\"\n\nAccording to the authors, this study represents the largest and most robust prospective emergency department procedural sedation cohort to date. It includes children from six emergency departments across Canada, sedated with six different medication combinations.\n\nThe results of the study show that choice of sedation medication had the biggest impact on the incidence of adverse events and need for significant interventions in response to those events. The incidence of serious adverse events was lowest among patients sedated with ketamine-alone and highest among patients sedated with combination drugs ketamine plus propofol or fentanyl.\n\nThe overall incidence of adverse events in the study population was 11.7%. The most common events were a decrease in oxygen saturation (5.6%) and vomiting (5.2%). Significant interventions in response to an adverse event were rare, occurring in only 1.4% of children. Two other practices - receiving an opioid prior to sedation and having a laceration repair - were associated with the occurrence of vomiting, oxygen desaturation and need for significant interventions.\n\n\"The low rate of serious adverse events and significant interventions supports the safety of procedural sedation in the hands of emergency department physicians,\" said Dr. Bhatt. \"While all sedation medications and combination of medications are effective and safe in the hands of experienced providers, ketamine-alone is associated with the fewest serious adverse events and significant interventions, making it a logical choice for providing procedural sedation for children in emergency departments.\"\n\nCo-authors include: Drs.

It finds that in the three years before widespread PSA testing (1983-1985), men getting their first diagnosis of prostate cancer were three times more likely to learn they had very late-stage cancer than men diagnosed in the most recent three years for which data is available (2006-2008).\n\n\"By not using PSA tests in the vast majority of men, you have to accept you are going to increase very serious metastatic disease threefold,\" says study leader Edward Messing, MD, chief of urology at the University of Rochester Medical Center.\n\nIn 2008, about 8,000 U.S. men were diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer. By projecting data from the pre-PSA era forward, Messing calculates that without routine PSA tests, 25,000 men would have been diagnosed in 2008 -- an extra 17,000 cases of deadly disease.\n\nBut it's not that simple, says Barnett Kramer, MD, MPH, associate director for disease prevention at the National Institutes of Health. Studies looking back at cancer trends in a population are very unreliable when it comes to showing what caused those trends.\n\nFor example, Kramer says, what if a man got a PSA test when his prostate cancer was in the very earliest stages of metastatic disease? Microscopic cancers already have seeded his body. But he would not yet have symptoms or detectable metastatic disease, so he'd be diagnosed with earlier-stage disease. He's subtracted forever from the men whose first diagnosis was late-stage disease, even though screening could not save his life.\n\nMessing says this misses the point of his study, which appears in the online July 30 issue of the journal Cancer.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "There is no cost information in the story, and this is a big gap seen in other stories that covered the topic \u2013 in TIME.com and HealthDay.

When patients are in an abnormal irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation, blood clots can form in the LAA, which can then circulate out through the bloodstream and cause stroke. Once the device is in place in the opening of the LAA, a thin layer of tissue grows over it, preventing blood clots from forming in the LAA and therefore preventing stroke.\n\nIt has been suggested that as treatment for atrial fibrillation, the Watchman device may be preferable to standard blood thinning medications, such as warfarin, which raise the risk of bleeding. To assess the cost-effectiveness of the device versus medication, the researchers developed a statistical model based on data from two key research trials, known as PROTECT AF and PREVAIL.\n\nThe researchers found that while results from the trials varied, the device did appear to be more cost-effective in the larger, longer-term trial. \"What we know is that the PROTECT AF trial enrolled more patients and has longer follow-up at this time and this allows greater statistical certainty,\" said Dr. James Freeman, assistant professor of cardiology and first author on the paper. \"Based on that, the study may provide more certainty in terms of cost-effectiveness.\" However, longer-term results are needed to be completely certain of the device's value in clinical practice, he said.\n\nThe study published online May 16 in Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology.", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The news release does not say how much the new device costs, nor does it say how\u00a0it compares with the cost of warfarin or non-warfarin oral anticoagulants.\nThis is of concern, since the news release focuses on the cost-effectiveness of the device.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Strobe lighting has been shown to reduce levels of the toxic proteins seen in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, in findings that raise the tantalising possibility of future non-invasive treatments for the disease.\n\nThe study, in mice, found that exposure to flickering light stimulated brain waves, called gamma oscillations, that are known to be disturbed in Alzheimer\u2019s patients. Boosting this synchronous brain activity appeared to act as a cue for the brain\u2019s immune cells, prompting them to absorb the sticky amyloid proteins that are the most visible hallmarks of the disease in the brain\u2019s of people with Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThe authors caution that a \u201cbig if\u201d remains over whether the findings would be replicated in humans \u2013 and whether cognitive deficits as well as visible symptoms of the disease would be improved.\n\n\u201cIf humans behave similarly to mice in response to this treatment, I would say the potential is just enormous, because it\u2019s so non-invasive, and it\u2019s so accessible,\u201d said Li-Huei Tsai, director of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at MIT, and the paper\u2019s senior author.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s research has faced a number of major setbacks \u2013 most recently the failure of Eli Lily\u2019s drug trial \u2013 after promising results in rodents did not translate into clinical improvements for patients.\n\nThe latest intervention, scientists predict, should be quicker and cheaper to confirm in humans than pharmaceuticals, which typically take more than a decade to develop and assess for safety before the clinical efficacy is even examined.\n\nThe study, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature, hinges on the observation that Alzheimer\u2019s patients show a loss of synchronised brain activity, known as gamma oscillations, which is linked to attention and memory.\n\n\n\nTo restore the activity, the scientists first used mice that had been genetically engineered such that the neurons that generate gamma activity in the brain were sensitive to light. The technique, known as optogenetics, allowed the scientists to artificially cause groups of neurons to fire in unison by pulsing light into the brains of the mice.\n\n\n\nAfter an hour of stimulation, the researchers found a roughly 50% reduction in the levels of beta amyloid proteins in the hippocampus, the brain\u2019s memory centre. Closer inspection showed that the amyloid had been taken up by microglia, the brain\u2019s immune cells.\n\nIn a healthy brain, microglia act as chemical rubbish collectors, surveying the local environment, clearing up unwanted compounds, but in Alzheimer\u2019s these cells can lose this function and switch into an inflammatory state in which they secrete toxic compounds instead. Strengthening gamma oscillations appeared to switch the microglia back into a productive state.\n\nNext, the scientist showed that gamma oscillations could also be stimulated non-invasively in the visual brain region simply by exposing the mice to a flickering light. At 40Hz the flicker of the light is barely discernible and would be \u201cnot offensive at all\u201d for a person to have in the background.\n\nAfter being given one hour of flickering light each day for a week, the scientists saw a 60% reduction of harmful amyloid plaques in the brains of the mice.\n\nEd Mann, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Oxford, said: \u201cI was surprised, and it\u2019s exciting, that such a simple stimulus can target a molecular pathway and have such an effect in an hour.\u201d\n\nQuestions remain, however, about whether boosting gamma oscillations and sweeping amyloid plaques out of the visual brain region would help with memory, which is centred in the hippocampus, or broader cognitive abilities.\n\nDavid Reynolds, chief scientific officer at Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, said: \u201cIt is conceivable that changing brain cell rhythms could be a future target for therapies, but researchers will need to explore how light flickering approaches could not only reduce amyloid in the visual area of the brain but in those areas more commonly affected in Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThe authors suggest that it may be possible to take a multi-sensory approach, using a combination of flashing lights and vibrating chairs.

Maybe we were brainwashed by the industry paying people to tell us that in medical school.\"\n\nNow, other drugs have come into use for hot flashes, but not much is known about their effectiveness or long-term safety. Until recently, there was little interest in studying them rigorously, because hormones worked so well for most women.\n\n\"There's a lot of hype around trying things that we haven't proven effective and, sadly, we haven't proven they're safe,\" said Dr. Heidi D. Nelson, the first author of the journal article and an internist and professor at the Oregon Health and Science University.\n\nThe report is based on a review of 43 studies of various nonhormonal drugs being used for hot flashes. Most were originally approved for other purposes. The drugs include the antidepressants Paxil (paroxetine), Effexor (venlafaxine), Prozac (fluoxetine) and Celexa (citalopram), the blood pressure drug Catapres (clonidine), and the seizure drug Neurontin (gabapentin). Some came into use for menopause because women taking them for other reasons told doctors the drugs seemed to diminish their hot flashes.\n\nThe researchers also examined studies of nonprescription extracts from soy and red clover, which contain plant estrogens called isoflavones and are marketed as a \"natural\" treatment for hot flashes.\n\nNone of the drugs or extracts are approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat hot flashes \u2014 only hormones are approved for that purpose \u2014 but doctors are free to prescribe medicines for any use they see fit, and many recommend the drugs or plant products for hot flashes, based on study findings and their patients' experiences.\n\nThe researchers found that on average, antidepressants and Catapres each appeared to reduce hot flashes by about one per day, and Neurontin by about two per day. For women with a lot of hot flashes, that is not a very impressive performance, Dr. Nelson said, but she added that the drugs may also lessen their severity.\n\nEstrogen, by comparison, gets rid of two to three flashes a day, and also makes them milder, Dr. Nelson said. Though hormones cause small increases in the risks for breast cancer and heart disease, a short course may still be the best choice for women with very severe symptoms, she said, though she added that women who have had breast cancer should definitely not take hormones.\n\nAll the nonhormonal drugs have side effects. The antidepressants can cause headache, nausea, dry mouth, dizziness and insomnia or sleepiness. Catapres can cause some of the same symptoms and also constipation. Neurontin causes sleepiness, and soy extracts can produce gastrointestinal troubles.\n\nAmong the antidepressants, Paxil seemed to have the strongest evidence of benefit. There were only two studies for Effexor, just one of which suggested it might help.\n\nFor the other antidepressants, Prozac and Celexa, and for the plant extracts, there was no statistically significant evidence that they worked for hot flashes.\n\n\"But I wouldn't want any drug company to get an edge,\" Dr. Nelson said. \"It's just where we are today. It's not the end of the story.\"\n\nShe took a cautious view because she and her colleagues found that there was relatively little reliable data on using the drugs for hot flashes. Of 10 studies on antidepressants, for instance, the researchers judged only two of the studies to be good, and the rest fair or poor. The poor rating often meant a study, even though well conducted, was too small or too short to be conclusive.\n\n\"If there were only 20 women in the study, how do we say it's appropriate for all the women in the country?\" Dr. Nelson said.\n\n\"Now we know what we need,\" she said. \"More bigger studies on more things.\"\n\nIn the meantime, both Dr. Tice and Dr. Nelson said that for women who find their symptoms intolerable and want treatment, they would favor antidepressants over hormones. But Dr. Tice warned that the drugs should not be used long term.\n\n\"I wouldn't encourage the mindset of putting women on these drugs thinking they're going to be on them for life,\" he said, adding that patients should try the drugs for a few months and then try to stop.\n\n\"We hate to medicalize a natural process,\" Dr. Nelson said, but she added that severe symptoms should not be dismissed. \"We want to take it seriously, but not everybody needs to be on prescription drugs for it.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "No mention of the cost of hormonal or non-hormonal treatments, which would be important to note if they are taken daily (or several times a day for some medications) for several months or years.

Such an analysis is months away. And they pointed out that the study offers no reassurance about the safety of smoking or the advisability of CT scans for younger smokers or nonsmokers.\n\n\u201cNo one should come away from this thinking that it\u2019s now safe to continue to smoke,\u201d said Dr. Harold E. Varmus, director of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nPatients wishing to get a CT lung screen will most likely have to pay the roughly $300 charge themselves, since few insurers pay for such scans unless an illness is suspected. The federal Medicare program will soon reconsider paying for such screens, a Medicare official said.\n\nThe study, called the National Lung Screening Trial, was conducted by the American College of Radiology Imaging Network and the cancer institute. It involved more than 53,000 people ages 55 to 74 who had smoked at least 30 pack-years \u2014 one pack a day for 30 years or two packs a day for 15 years. Ex-smokers who had quit within the previous 15 years were included in the group.\n\nEach was given either a standard chest X-ray or a low-dose CT scan at the start of the trial and then twice more over the next two years. Participants were followed for up to five years. There were 354 lung cancer deaths among those who received CT scans and 442 among those who got X-rays. The $250 million study, which began in 2002, was paid for by the cancer institute and carried out at 33 sites.\n\nIts preliminary results were announced days after an independent monitoring board determined that the benefits of CT scans were strong enough to stop the trial. The study will be published in the coming months.\n\nThe study found that for every 300 people who were screened, one person lived who would otherwise have died during the study. But one-quarter of those given CT scans were found to have anomalies, nearly all of which were benign. These false signals generally led to more worry, more CT scans and sometimes to lung biopsies and thoracic surgery.\n\n\u201cThere are economic, medical and psychological consequences of finding these abnormalities,\u201d Dr. Varmus said.\n\nDeaths due to all causes declined by 7 percent among study participants who received CT scans, suggesting the tests helped to detect other life-threatening diseases besides lung cancer.\n\nDr. Claudia Henschke, a clinical professor of radiology at Mount Sinai Medical Center and a longtime advocate for use of CT to screen for lung cancer, said the study was likely to have underestimated the benefits of CT scans because participants were screened only three times. Had the screening continued for 10 years, as many as 80 percent of lung cancer deaths could have been averted, she said. Dr. Henschke\u2019s research has been controversial because of its statistical methods and its financing, which included money from a tobacco company. She earns royalties from makers of CT machines.\n\n\u201cWhat we also have found is that low-dose CT scan gives information on cardiovascular disease, emphysema\u201d and other pulmonary diseases, Dr. Henschke said. \u201cThose are the three big killers of older people. There is just tremendous potential.\u201d\n\nBut Dr. Edward F. Patz Jr., professor of radiology at Duke who helped devise the study, said he was far from convinced that a thorough analysis would show that widespread CT screening would prove beneficial in preventing most lung cancer deaths. Dr. Patz said that the biology of lung cancer has long suggested that the size of cancerous lung tumors tells little about the stage of the disease.\n\n\u201cIf we look at this study carefully, we may suggest that there is some benefit in high-risk individuals, but I\u2019m not there yet,\u201d Dr. Patz said.\n\nSince 46 million people in the United States smoke and tens of millions more once smoked, a widespread screening program could cost billions annually. Any further refinement of those most at risk could reduce those costs. Low-dose CT scans expose patients to about the same radiation levels as mammograms. Little is known about how the cumulative risks of years of such scans would balance the benefits.\n\nThe study\u2019s results could have both legal and political consequences. Suits against tobacco companies have sought to force cigarette makers to pay for annual CT screens of former smokers. But with the science uncertain, those claims have so far been rebuffed. Congress has diverted some research money to create pilot CT lung screening programs, diversions that may gain momentum now.\n\nSome Obama administration officials argued during the debate on the health care law that patients\u2019 health was often harmed by getting too many tests and procedures that, if reduced, would improve health while reducing costs. This study suggests that, at least in lung cancer, spending more on tests saves lives.\n\nLaurie Fenton, president of the Lung Cancer Alliance, which has lobbied for widespread CT lung screening, said the debate about the advisability of such scans is now over.\n\n\u201cThe challenge now shifts from proving the efficacy of the method to developing the proper quality standards, infrastructure and guidelines to bring this needed benefit to those at high risk for the disease \u2014 now,\u201d Ms. Fenton said.\n\nBut Dr. Peter B. Bach, a pulmonologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said no one should rush out and get a CT scan yet because further analysis will better define whom the screening helped.\n\n\u201cVery soon we\u2019ll have an answer about who should be screened and how frequently,\u201d Dr. Bach said, \u201cbut we don\u2019t have that answer today.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "\n\n\nMixed bag and, in the end, not specific enough to warrant a satisfactory score. \nThe story does say that a nationwide lung cancer screening program would be \u201cenormously costly,\u201d and it does mention that screening leads to additional tests and treatments.

It also found that the protective effect increases with age. The study is by Peter Rothwell, MD, PhD, FRCP, of John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, England, and colleagues, and has been published online by the journal the Lancet. A previous study by the same authors showed that low doses of aspirin (75-300 milligrams) reduced the number of cases of colorectal cancer by a quarter and deaths caused by the disease by more than a third. The latest study confirms the earlier results and concludes that similar effects can be shown for other types of cancers.\n\nThe study looked at eight trials examining the effects of a daily dose of aspirin on preventing heart attacks involving 25,570 patients, 674 of whom died from cancer. They showed a 21% reduction in the number of deaths caused by cancer among those who had taken aspirin, compared with people who had not. The investigation also showed that the benefits of taking aspirin increased over time. After five years, death rates were shown to fall by 34% for all cancers and by 54% for gastrointestinal cancers. Participants were also followed up after 20 years, by which point 1,634 of the original participants had died as a direct result of cancer. This 20-year follow-up established that the risk of cancer death remained 20% lower among those who had been allocated aspirin than those in the control group for all solid cancers, including lung, prostate, brain, bladder, and kidney cancers, and by 35% for gastrointestinal cancers. The fall in the risk of death broke down according to individual types of cancer: Reductions in pancreatic, stomach, and brain cancers were difficult to quantify because of smaller numbers of deaths, the authors say.\n\nThe protective effect of taking low doses of aspirin varied according to the type of cancer and how long aspirin had been taken, the authors found. For instance, it only became apparent after about five years for esophageal, pancreatic, brain, and lung cancer; about 10 years for stomach and colorectal cancer; and about 15 years for prostate cancer. Any benefit for lung and esophageal cancer was limited to adenocarcinomas, which are most commonly seen in nonsmokers.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "This story does not discuss the cost of daily aspirin intake.

The FDA reviewed and authorized for marketing the Banyan Brain Trauma Indicator in fewer than 6 months as part of its Breakthrough Devices Program.\n\nMost patients with a suspected head injury are examined using a neurological scale, called the 15-point Glasgow Coma Scale, followed by a computed tomography or CT scan of the head to detect brain tissue damage, or intracranial lesions, that may require treatment; however, a majority of patients evaluated for mTBI/concussion do not have detectable intracranial lesions after having a CT scan.

TBI is caused by a bump, blow or jolt to the head or a penetrating head injury that disrupts the brain\u2019s normal functioning. Its severity may range from mild to severe, with 75 percent of TBIs that occur each year being assessed as mTBIs or concussions. A majority of patients with concussion symptoms have a negative CT scan. Potential effects of TBI can include impaired thinking or memory, movement, sensation or emotional functioning.\n\n\u201cA blood test to aid in concussion evaluation is an important tool for the American public and for our Service Members abroad who need access to quick and accurate tests,\u201d said Jeffrey Shuren, M.D., director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. \u201cThe FDA\u2019s review team worked closely with the test developer and the U.S. Department of Defense to expedite a blood test for the evaluation of mTBI that can be used both in the continental U.S. as well as foreign U.S. laboratories that service the American military.\u201d\n\nThe Brain Trauma Indicator works by measuring levels of proteins, known as UCH-L1 and GFAP, that are released from the brain into blood and measured within 12 hours of head injury. Levels of these blood proteins after mTBI/concussion can help predict which patients may have intracranial lesions visible by CT scan and which won\u2019t. Being able to predict if patients have a low probability of intracranial lesions can help health care professionals in their management of patients and the decision to perform a CT scan. Test results can be available within 3 to 4 hours.\n\nThe FDA evaluated data from a multi-center, prospective clinical study of 1,947 individual blood samples from adults with suspected mTBI/concussion and reviewed the product\u2019s performance by comparing mTBI/concussion blood tests results with CT scan results. The Brain Trauma Indicator was able to predict the presence of intracranial lesions on a CT scan 97.5 percent of the time and those who did not have intracranial lesions on a CT scan 99.6 percent of the time. These findings indicate that the test can reliably predict the absence of intracranial lesions and that health care professionals can incorporate this tool into the standard of care for patients to rule out the need for a CT scan in at least one-third of patients who are suspected of having mTBI.\n\nThe Brain Trauma Indicator was reviewed under the FDA\u2019s De Novo premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for some low- to moderate-risk devices that are novel and for which there is no prior legally marketed device.\n\nThe FDA is permitting marketing of the Brain Trauma Indicator to Banyan Biomarkers, Inc.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

The research was led by Robert Langer, a prolific inventor who heads a biological engineering lab at MIT.\n\nWriting in the journal Nature Materials, the team said they searched databases for materials that were already on the market and recognized as safe that could take a whole new approach to skin care.\n\nBetty Yu, the company\u2019s principal scientist, earned her PhD in biochemistry and toxicology. She has studied how to deliver drugs into the skin and led efforts to develop hair care products. She wanted to move on to skin products.\n\nThey wanted something stretchy and strong that wouldn\u2019t pucker up when it dried on the skin and that would be breathable.\n\n\u201cIt has to have the right optical properties, otherwise it won\u2019t look good, and it has to have the right mechanical properties, otherwise it won\u2019t have the right strength and it won\u2019t perform correctly,\u201d Langer said.\n\n\u201cCreating a material that behaves like skin is very difficult,\u201d added Dr. Barbara Gilchrest, a dermatologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital who worked on the study.\n\n\u201cMany people have tried to do this, and the materials that have been available up until this have not had the properties of being flexible, comfortable, nonirritating, and able to conform to the movement of the skin and return to its original shape.\u201d\n\nThey screened about 100 compounds before settling on polysiloxane, a silicone-based gel. They call it a cross-linked polymer layer or XPL for short.\n\n\u201cIt works in two parts,\u201d Langer told NBC News. \u201cYou put on a primer layer, just kind of rub it in. Then you put on a second layer and rub that one in. There\u2019s cross-linking and it tightens it up.\u201d\n\nCross-linking is a well-understood process. Separate strands of material become stronger when they link up. \u201cVulcanization, used to make tires, is a cross-linking process,\u201d Langer said. \u201cRubber alone would not be that strong.\u201d\n\nIn this case, the catalyst is platinum-based and it turns the gel into a thin, stretchy sheet. There are hundreds of skin products that do this now, but this one sticks better and doesn\u2019t pucker the skin, the team reports.\n\nLight-scattering particles are added to the second layer, and they reflect light off the skin, making it look clearer and smoother.\n\nLanger tried it on his arm. \u201cIt was almost like you couldn\u2019t see it. After a minute, I didn\u2019t know it was there,\u201d he said.\n\nThey ran four experiments on the product. In one, they applied it to the skin under the eyes of 25 volunteers. It lasted for 16 hours before it started peeling off, and smoothed out the eye bags that become so common as people age, they wrote.\n\n\u201cSuch a result has been previously achieved only by a lower lid blepharoplasty, an invasive surgical procedure,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThey demonstrate it in this video.\n\nThey also put tested at against petroleum jelly and regular moisturizer on 22 people with dry, flaky legs. The XPL lasted longer and helped keep the skin from losing moisture better than the petroleum jelly, which lasted better than moisturizer.\n\n\u201cThe results confirmed the XPL as a \u2018second skin\u2019 barrier that protects the skin from excessive moisture loss to the environment,\u201d they wrote.\n\n\u201cRepeated daily wear resulted in no report of irritation or other adverse events resulting from the XPL use. Furthermore, the XPL remained intact following activities such as swimming, running and exposure to rain,\u201d they added.\n\nThe stuff can just be peeled off, or taken off with makeup remover, the researchers said.\n\nDermatologist Dr. Jennifer Lucas of the Cleveland Clinic, who was not involved in the study, said she\u2019d have to see long-term results to make a judgment. \u201cConceptually, it\u2019s a great and novel idea,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cFor now, there is no magical cream that can make you look younger.\u201d\n\nOlivo will work first to develop the product to deliver drugs to the skin \u2013perhaps allergy or eczema medication, or long-lasting sunscreen, MIT said.

It is estimated that about one in every 100 people in the UK has ASD, with more boys diagnosed with the condition than girls.\n\nScientists said their research found a link between ASD and damage to proteins in blood plasma. They found the most reliable of the tests they developed was examining protein in blood plasma, which found children with ASD had higher levels of the oxidation marker dityrosine (DT) and certain sugar-modified compounds called advanced glycation end-products (AGEs).\n\nGenetic causes are thought to be responsible for about a third of cases of ASD, while the rest are believed to be caused by a combination of environmental factors, mutations, and rare genetic variants. However, researchers believe their new tests could reveal yet-to-be-identified causes of ASD.\n\nThey also confirmed the previously held belief that mutations of amino acid transporters are a genetic variant associated with ASD.\n\nThe Warwick team worked with collaborators at the University of Bologna in Italy, who recruited 38 children who had been diagnosed with ASD along with a control group of 31 other children between the ages of five and 12. Blood and urine samples were taken from the children for analysis.\n\nThe Warwick team discovered there were chemical differences between the two groups. Working with a further collaborator at the University of Birmingham, the changes in multiple compounds were combined using artificial intelligence algorithm techniques to develop a mathematical equation to distinguish between ASD and healthy controls. The outcome was a diagnostic test better than any existing method.\n\nThey said the next steps were to repeat the study with further groups of children to confirm the good diagnostic performance and to assess if the test could identify ASD at very early stages, indicate how the ASD is likely to develop further to more severe disease, and assess if treatments were working.\n\nThe research was led by Naila Rabbani, reader of experimental systems biology at the University of Warwick, who said: \u201cOur discovery could lead to earlier diagnosis and intervention.

Although ACE inhibitors were developed 10 years earlier, both types of drugs showed similar effects in the analysis, challenging previous findings that suggest ACE inhibitors have greater benefits.\n\nAccording to the new analysis, published online Jan. 4 in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings, the only difference between the medications is that ARBs are more easily tolerated.\n\n\"There has been debate for many years over the safety and efficacy of ACE inhibitors compared to ARBs, with many of them using an 'ACE inhibitor-first' approach, with ARBs regarded as less effective,\" study author Dr. Sripal Bangalore said in a medical center news release.\n\n\"We believe that our study ends the debate and gives physicians the option to prescribe either drug for their patients,\" added Bangalore, an associate professor in the division of cardiology, in the department of medicine at NYU Langone.\n\nBoth ARBs and ACE inhibitors interfere with the function of a hormone called angiotensin II, which regulates blood pressure, but they do this in different ways, the study authors said.\n\nAngiotensin II restricts blood flow through vessels, raising blood pressure. ACE inhibitors prevent the body from making angiotensin II, while ARBs prevent the hormone from doing its job by taking its place on the surface of blood vessels, the researchers explained.\n\nPrevious studies have suggested that older ACE inhibitors are more effective than ARBs. But, this latest analysis attributed that difference to changes in the standard of care over the decade between trials of the two types of drugs, greater emphasis on quitting smoking, and wider use of cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins.\n\nHowever, when trials were conducted at similar times, one drug was not more effective than the other, the findings showed.\n\n\"This is the first time that we have a clear and consistent message from the three buckets of trials of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, all of which show that there is no outcome difference between the two agents, except for better tolerability of ARBs,\" Bangalore said.\n\n\"The results of our analysis are especially important for patients, given that many ARBs are now also generic, which reduces their costs,\" he added.\n\nFor more about blood pressure drugs, visit the American Heart Association.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "We\u2019ll give the story a grudging satisfactory in this category since it mentions, as a closing statement, that many ARBs are now generic, which means their cost is lower than brand-name equivalents.\u00a0 But the story would be more helpful to readers if it provided an idea of the comparative costs for the two types of drugs, as well as an average annual cost, since patients remain on them for long periods of time, if not for life. Though more ARBs are now available generically, the costs of generic ARBs generally remain higher than for ACEIs. For many doctors and patients, the use of ACEIs may still be preferred simply because they\u2019re cheaper \u2013 even given similar efficacy and a slightly greater need to stop them due to side effects.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "CHICAGO - Screening patients for diabetes based solely on their age and weight - a recommendation from a leading medical expert group - could miss more than half of high-risk patients, according to a new Northwestern Medicine study of a nationwide sample. These limited screening criteria also missed more racial and ethnic minorities, most notably Asians.\n\nFailing to screen high-risk adults could lead to delayed treatments to prevent type 2 diabetes or manage the condition for those who already have it, possibly contributing to a worsening of the diabetes epidemic. Prediabetes and diabetes affect half of U.S. adults with an estimated cost of $327 billion per year.\n\nThe United States Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) currently recommends that physicians screen patients for dysglycemia (prediabetes or type 2 diabetes) when they are 40 to 70 years old and are overweight or obese. By following this recommendation, 53 percent of patients who had prediabetes or type 2 diabetes would not be screened. The study showed that screening patients using an expanded set of risk factors, which the USPSTF suggests but does not formally recommend, would identify most cases of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.\n\nOnly 23 percent of patients with prediabetes or diabetes would be missed if expanded screening criteria were used to make screening decisions, the study found. The expanded criteria include a family history of diabetes, history of gestational diabetes or polycystic ovarian syndrome or non-white race or ethnicity.\n\n\"This seems like a no-brainer to screen patients who have any of these additional risk factors,\" said lead author Dr. Matthew O'Brien, assistant professor of medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. \"By demonstrating how well these expanded criteria work in identifying patients with prediabetes and diabetes, we're proposing a better path for the USPSTF to strengthen its screening guidelines.\"\n\nThe study was published today, Friday, April 13, in the Journal of General Internal Medicine. O'Brien will be presenting his findings today at the Society for General Internal Medicine conference in Denver, Colorado. This is the first study to report how these expanded screening criteria would perform in practice among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults.\n\nThe USPSTF has come under scrutiny for other screening recommendations, most notably for breast cancer. But there has been little attention focused on this group's most recent diabetes screening guideline.\n\nIntensive lifestyle programs and some medications have been proven to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes among adults with prediabetes. A large volume of research over the last three decades has demonstrated that treating type 2 diabetes prevents life-threatening complications such as heart attacks, strokes and kidney failure.\n\n\"The earlier patients are diagnosed with these conditions, the sooner they can begin to combat them,\" O'Brien said.\n\nAfrican-Americans and Latinos develop type 2 diabetes at younger ages, so waiting until they are 40 years old to screen them is problematic, O'Brien said. In the study, 50 percent of whites with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes were identified using the limited criteria compared to only 48 percent of African-Americans and only 44 percent of Latinos.\n\nAsians are at high risk of developing diabetes even at a healthy weight. By following the limited guidelines and only screening patients who are overweight or obese, approximately 30 percent of Asians with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes would be identified. That would leave 70 percent of Asians with prediabetes or diabetes undiagnosed until their next screening test, which could occur years later.\n\nThe study also touches on the financial implications of these guidelines. Under a provision in the Affordable Care Act, all services recommended by the USPSTF must be fully covered by insurers. But O'Brien said it is unclear whether insurers will be required to pay for diabetes screening if patients only meet the expanded criteria.\n\n\"This could be a particular problem for people of low socioeconomic status who are at high risk of developing diabetes and may be unable to pay for a screening test,\" O'Brien said.\n\nThe study was conducted collaboratively with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), using data collected every year from a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. It builds on findings from a previous study O'Brien conducted that incorporated electronic health record data from 50,515 adult primary care patients at community health centers in the Midwest and Southwest between 2008 and 2013.\n\nOther Northwestern authors are senior author Dr. Ronald Ackermann and co-authors Mercedes Carnethon and Dr. Namratha Kandula.

Results of the study were published today (Dec. 17, 2018) in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nMeasuring less than 1 centimeter across, or about a third of the area of a U.S. penny, the tiny devices -- which are safe for use in the body and implantable via a minimally invasive procedure -- generate gentle electric pulses from the stomach's natural churning motions and deliver them to the vagus nerve, which links the brain and the stomach.\n\nThat gentle stimulation dupes the brain into thinking that the stomach is full after only a few nibbles of food.\n\n\"The pulses correlate with the stomach's motions, enhancing a natural response to help control food intake,\" says Xudong Wang, a UW-Madison professor of materials science and engineering.\n\nUnlike gastric bypass, which permanently alters the capacity of the stomach, the effects of the new devices also are reversible. When Wang and his collaborators removed the devices after 12 weeks, the study's rats resumed their normal eating patterns and weight bounced right back on.\n\nWang's device has several advantages over an existing unit that stimulates the vagus nerve for weight loss. That existing unit, \"Maestro,\" approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2015, administers high-frequency zaps to the vagus nerve to shut down all communication between the brain and stomach. It requires a complicated control unit and bulky batteries which frequently must be recharged.\n\nThat ongoing maintenance can be a big barrier to use, says Luke Funk, a surgery professor in UW-Madison's Division of Minimally Invasive, Foregut and Bariatric Surgery. \"One potential advantage of the new device over existing vagus nerve stimulators is that it does not require external battery charging, which is a significant advantage when you consider the inconvenience that patients experience when having to charge a battery multiple times a week for an hour or so.\"\n\nIn fact, Wang's device contains no batteries, no electronics, and no complicated wiring. It relies instead on the undulations of the stomach walls to power its internal generators.\n\nThat means the device only stimulates the vagus nerve when the stomach moves.\n\n\"It's automatically responsive to our body function, producing stimulation when needed,\" says Wang. \"Our body knows best.\"\n\nWang is a world expert in wearable and implantable capacitive electricity-generating devices, having previously created implantable nanogenerators that harvest energy from people's beating hearts and breathing, a motion-powered bandage for wound healing, and other such devices.\n\nHe and his collaborators patented the weight-loss device through the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and are moving forward with testing in larger animal models.

The side effects, particularly of the treatment component known as interferon, can be \"pretty hard to deal with,\" said Nicholas A. Meanwell, a co-author of the study and a researcher with the Bristol-Myers Squibb pharmaceutical company.\n\nThe study, published online April 21 in Nature, examines an experimental drug designed to combat the hepatitis C virus. It appears to work by interfering with a protective coating around a part of the virus that's key to its ability to reproduce, Meanwell said.\n\nIn a phase 1 trial, the first of three types of studies that new drugs must go through, researchers gave doses of the drug to a small number of people.\n\nThe level of the virus in their bodies dropped significantly for several days. The main side effect was headache, Meanwell said.\n\nAt this point, it's not clear how much the drug might cost or how it would work with existing drugs. However, Meanwell said, it could become part of a combination treatment of several drugs.\n\nSchiff, the University of Miami doctor, said other companies are pursuing similar drugs.\n\nFor now, much of the attention in the world of liver disease is on two drugs -- telaprevir and boceprevir -- that Schiff expects will become available within the next year and a half.\n\nCombination treatments using these drugs will become the standard treatment for many people, he said, and boost cure rates into the range of 70 to 80 percent. The drugs now under development, like the one in the new study, could be added to the regimen, he said.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on hepatitis C.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Since BMS-790052 is still in early testing, we don\u2019t know what it will cost, so the criterion is not applicable.\u00a0However, given the huge costs of the existing treatment regimen of an interferon and ribavirin, a comment on the potential economic impact of a third drug would have been helpful.\u00a0 Current treatments cost several thousand dollars per month with treatments lasting for 6-12 months.\u00a0 The addition of a third and presumably expensive antiviral is an important aspect of the costs of treatment.\u00a0", "answer": 2}, {"article": "(CNN) Jet lag might be the worst part of long-distance travel, especially when it leaves you feeling tired, cranky and off-kilter for days.\n\nBut scientists at Stanford University say there may be a way to prevent jet lag without medication or adjusting your sleep schedule.\n\nA team of researchers led by neurobiologist Jamie Zeitzer is working on a technique that exposes people to short flashes of light while they sleep to help them adjust more quickly to time zone changes.\n\nCurrent light therapy treatment includes sitting in front of bright lights for hours at a time during the day, which allows you to transition your body clock to a new time zone in small steps prior to taking a trip. Zeitzer's latest study, published Monday in the Journal of Clinical Investigation , could make treatment easier by providing light exposure during sleep, before the trip, without changing or interrupting your routine.\n\nThe circadian system is synchronized to the outside world through exposure to light; it controls sleep timing, hormone release and mood, said Zeitzer, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences. Jet lag occurs when sleeping and waking patterns are not synchronized to circadian rhythms.\n\nTo adapt to a new time zone, most people try to get as much light exposure as possible corresponding to their destination, either by waking up early before a trip or staying up late when they arrive, Zeitzer said. Or they do nothing and suffer the exhausting consequences; the body eventually adjusts at a slow pace of about one hour a day, taking up to three days to catch up.\n\nThrough light therapy, the technique Zeitzer is experimenting with, a person's brain can be tricked into adjusting more quickly to disturbances in sleep cycles by increasing how long he or she is exposed to light prior to traveling to a new time zone. The treatment \"exploits biology in the eye\" to speed up the brain's adjustment to time changes, he said.\n\nThis study builds on previous research published in 2014, which found that light therapy works best at night because the body's circadian rhythms are more sensitive to light at night, even through closed eyelids. In this latest study, Zeitzer and Raymond Najjar, a former postdoctoral scholar at Stanford now at Singapore Eye Research Institute, found that short flashes of light at night are more effective than continuous light exposure and could speed up the process of adjusting to a different time zone before a trip.\n\n\"The previous study was proof of principle: Can we elicit these kinds of changes and can we do it without interfering with sleep?\" Zeitzer said. This time around, researchers tried to further optimize the process.\n\nTo determine which would provide the fastest method of adjusting sleep cycles, researchers recruited 39 participants ages 19 to 36. They put them on a routine sleep-wake cycle, going to bed and waking up at the same time every day for about two weeks. They then had the volunteers sleep in the lab, where some were exposed to continuous light for an hour and others were exposed to a sequence of flashes of various frequencies for an hour.\n\nThey found that exposing people to two millisecond flashes of light, similar to a camera flash, every 10 seconds elicited two hours of change in circadian timing, compared with 36 minutes for those exposed to continuous light. Participants were able to sleep through the flashes of light without waking.\n\n\"You get more effectiveness out of flashes of light. It will enable us to have more potent countermeasures to jet lag than continuous light, which is the current prescribed light therapy treatment,\" Zeitzer said.\n\nThe treatment could benefit not only travelers but also overnight shift workers and people with constantly changing schedules, he said, but that's a long way off. There's still more testing to be done before the technique is available to the public.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Costs are not discussed.

Another existing set of guidelines doesn\u2019t call for screening in any children.\n\nScreening all children would \u201cidentify a number of children who are of very significant risk of premature heart disease,\u201d said Dr. William Neal of West Virginia University in Morgantown, who led the new study.\n\nNeal said treating youth with cholesterol-lowering drugs, the so-called statins, would curb the risk that they went on to develop heart problems in middle age. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the Western world.\n\nBased on data from West Virginia, Neal and colleagues found that more than one percent of all fifth-graders had cholesterol levels that warranted drug treatment. But a third of those children didn\u2019t have relatives with heart disease or high cholesterol, and so wouldn\u2019t have been screened under the current guidelines, issued by the government\u2019s National Cholesterol Education Program.\n\n\u201cI have gradually become convinced that universal screening in children is not only preferable, but necessary,\u201d said Neal. He added that although universal screening would be expensive, it would save a lot of money later on if heart disease could be prevented.\n\nBut not all scientists agree that screening is a good idea. For example, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federal expert panel, currently doesn\u2019t recommend routine cholesterol screening in any children.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, there is no evidence that starting a ten-year-old on cholesterol-lowering drugs will prevent heart disease 40 years later,\u201d said Dr. Michael L. LeFevre, a member of the task force.\n\nHe said statin treatment in children was still controversial, and that no long-term safety data existed.\n\nThe new study tapped into data from more than 20,000 children who had been screened at public schools in West Virginia over five years.\n\nMore than seven in 10 school kids had first-degree relatives with heart disease, and about one percent of those had \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol (LDL cholesterol) levels that might require drug treatment in addition to diet changes and exercise, according to the researchers.\n\nYet among the kids without heart disease in their family, the percentage of children who might benefit from treatment was closer to two percent than to one, meaning that family history didn\u2019t seem to make a difference.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore prudent to implement universal screening in the pediatric population independent of family history,\u201d the researchers conclude.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "1clip_filelist.xml\" rel=\"File-List\"/>\n\n\n\nThe story says universal screening would be expensive, but it does not provide any dollar amounts.

The other suggests that treating people based on the new guidelines would be cost-effective, even with the tremendously increased use of statins.\n\nThe new studies are not large clinical trials that will definitively settle the matter of whether to expand drug treatment to millions more people in hopes of preventing cardiovascular disease, the leading killer of Americans.

This research shows that eating whole grains reduces the risk of heart disease,\" said John Kirwan, Ph.D., principal investigator and director of the Metabolic Translational Research Center, which is part of Cleveland Clinic's Endocrinology & Metabolism Institute.\n\nResearchers conducted a double-blind, randomized, controlled crossover trial. In the study, a group of 33 overweight and obese adults followed a whole grain diet (intervention) or a refined grain diet (control) for two eight-week periods. The diets were exactly the same, except for their content of whole grains or refined grains. At the beginning and end of each diet period, participants spent three days undergoing metabolic testing in a clinical research setting. Participants taking antihypertensive medication were instructed to maintain medication usage throughout the study.\n\nWhile on the whole grain diet, participants saw a three-fold improvement in diastolic blood pressure (the lowest pressure when your heart relaxes between beats) compared to the refined grain diet. This improvement equates to reducing the risk of death from heart disease by almost one-third, and the risk of death from a stroke by two-fifths.\n\n\"The uniqueness of this study is that each of the 33 participants consumed both diets,\" said Kirwan. \"This level of control can only be performed for small numbers and provides the essential empirical data that cannot be obtained from large observational studies. These evidence-based data demonstrate the effect of diet on cardiovascular disease outcomes, particularly diastolic blood pressure.\"\n\nBlood pressure is typically recorded as two numbers. Systolic is the top number that measures the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats. Diastolic is the bottom number, which measures the pressure in the arteries when the heart muscle is resting between heartbeats.\n\nHypertension - or high blood pressure - is a common obesity-related condition that affects about 30 percent of U.S. adults and it is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Before age 50, an elevated diastolic blood pressure is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. As they age, people with elevated diastolic blood pressure are at a higher-than-average risk of developing elevated systolic blood pressure.\n\nOverall, there were substantial reductions in body weight, fat loss, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol during both diet periods, but these differences were due to the people changing their normal dietary habits to carefully controlled diets.\n\nThis collaborative research began in 2010.

Symptoms including serious memory loss, confusion and mood changes develop gradually and worsen with time. Recently, many strides have been made in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease earlier, but doctors have been stymied by a lack of effective treatments to stop or slow the course of the disease.\n\nIt's long been known that a protein fragment called beta-amyloid builds up in the spaces between nerve cells in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease. The new drug, gantenerumab, targets these amyloid proteins by priming the body's immune system to recognize them as invaders.\n\nOf 16 people with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease, those who received two to seven infusions of the experimental drug every four weeks showed marked reductions in the amount of plaque in their brains via imaging tests that were conducted several months after their treatments.\n\nBy contrast, amyloid load increased among people who were randomized to receive the placebo. The new drug was given at either 60 or 200 milligrams (mg) doses. The higher dose yielded greater reductions in amyloid levels, the study showed. People who were given the 60 mg doses saw a nearly 16 percent reduction in the amount of amyloid, and those given the 200 mg doses saw a 36 percent reduction. The new study was conducted and funded by the drug's manufacturer, F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd., in Basel, Switzerland.\n\nThe big question is whether or not reducing amyloid levels has any effect on the symptoms or progression of Alzheimer's disease, said Dr. Patrick Lyden, chief of neurology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. \"There is a growing concern that amyloid is a guilty bystander, but not the actual culprit in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease, and taking away the bystander may not help the patient,\" he said.\n\nThere are approximately one dozen therapies, including vaccines, for Alzheimer's disease that are currently in the pipeline, Lyden noted. \"They are all extremely exciting and promising in animals,\" he said. \"This is the first one to show a preliminary result in people, but we have a huge way to go to make sure it is safe and improves symptoms.\"\n\nMany in the Alzheimer's research community are awaiting these drugs with bated breath, but \"none are ready for prime time,\" he said.\n\nThe leading theory of Alzheimer's disease is that an imbalance in the production or clearance of the amyloid plaque in the brain initiates a cascade of events that lead to dementia, explained Dr. Neelum Aggarwal, an associate professor of neurological sciences at Rush Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.\n\n\"Accumulation of the plaques cause a variety of cellular responses: inflammation, neuronal death, and thus any potential treatment that can alter these processes would be beneficial,\" she said. The hope is that gantenerumab or other drugs like it will not only prevent amyloid from accumulating in the brain, but also slow down the cognitive impairment that occurs in people with Alzheimer's disease, she added.\n\nThat said, these experimental drugs carry the potential for serious side effects, including causing the immune system to go haywire. \"The main issue that remains for this type of drug development is managing the immune response,\" Aggarwal said. Other side effects include a potentially fatal fluid build-up in certain areas of the brain. \"This is problematic in that use of these treatments may carry a very high risk for neurologic complications, thus necessitating heightened monitoring, and diminishing its applicability as a treatment for a larger patient population such as the Alzheimer's disease population,\" she said.\n\nIf any of these drugs make it through the pipeline, it also needs to be determined who will get them, including whether the drugs will be given to prevent Alzheimer's in patients at high-risk of the disease or to treat it once it's started.\n\nThe need for a drug to delay the onset or slow progression of Alzheimer's disease can't be underestimated, Aggrawal said. In the United States alone, there are 5.4 million people with Alzheimer's disease, and the numbers are expected to increase to 13 million by 2050, when approximately three of every five people over the age of 85 will have Alzheimer's disease, she said.\n\nFor more information about Alzheimer's disease signs, symptoms and treatments, visit the Alzheimer's Association.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Not applicable.\u00a0 It\u2019s understandable that costs wouldn\u2019t be discussed in such early research.", "answer": 2}]
