[{"article": "Newswise \u2014 CHAPEL HILL, NC \u2013 UNC researchers say the results from the multi-site phase 2 and 3 trials of brexanolone injection are not only promising, but could change the way postpartum depression (PPD) is treated.\n\nBrexanolone injection works differently than existing anti-depressant medications, and if approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) later this year, will be the first new class of anti-depressants in decades, and the first drug specifically indicated for PPD.\n\n\u201cWith current anti-depressant SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) it could take four to six weeks to get a treatment response. In the brexanolone trials, we saw patients starting to feel better within days,\u201d said the trial\u2019s academic principal investigator, Samantha Meltzer-Brody, MD, MPH, director of Perinatal Psychiatry Program at the UNC School of Medicine.\n\nDavid Rubinow, MD, chair of the Department of Psychiatry at the UNC School of Medicine and a coauthor of the paper, says time is especially crucial for new mothers experiencing postpartum depression because the weeks and months following birth are a critical period for mother-infant bonding. Common symptoms of PPD \u2013 a mood disorder in women that can be triggered by fluctuations in reproductive hormones \u2013 include low mood, feeling overwhelmed, anxious and ruminating thoughts, potential withdrawal from the baby and her family, and suicidal thoughts in the most severe cases. PPD is one of the most common complications of pregnancy, with between 10 and 20 percent of mothers worldwide experiencing it.\n\n\u201cHaving a drug developed specifically for postpartum depression is a game-changer for women\u2019s health,\u201d said Meltzer-Brody. \u201cWith our latest results, we believe that brexanolone, if approved, could provide relief for women with a range of postpartum severity.\u201d\n\nThe paper, published in The Lancet, includes a new integrated analysis of results from three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that took place at 30 sites in the U.S., including UNC\u2019s Perinatal Psychiatry Unit. Eligible women were aged 18-45 years old and were six months postpartum or less at screening. They also had to be experiencing moderate to severe postpartum depression, which was assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D).\n\nThe integrated analysis looked at results of the trials which randomized 209 women to receive a double-blinded 60-hour infusion of either brexanolone injection 90 \u00b5g/kg/hr or placebo. A unique dose group of brexanolone 60 \u00b5g/kg/hr in one of the studies was not included in the integrated efficacy analysis, but was included in integrated analyses of safety. Brexanolone injection 90 \u00b5g/kg/hr was administered to 102 women with moderate or severe PPD who also were evaluated throughout the infusion, after the infusion stopped and then periodically for up to 30 days. Another 107 women were administered a placebo and evaluated during the same timeframe. The first statistically significant reduction in depression severity with brexanolone injection relative to placebo was observed as early as 24 hours after dosing. At the end of the 60-hour infusion, the average reduction in patients\u2019 Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D or depression severity score) was 17.0 points for women in the brexanolone injection 90 \u00b5g/kg/hr group, versus 12.8 in the placebo group (p<0.0001). The reduction of symptoms in the patients receiving brexanolone injection was maintained throughout the last study visit at Day 30. The most common (\u226510% of subjects) adverse events following during brexanolone injection administration were headache, dizziness and somnolence.\n\n\u201cThis is a very different model for how we treat depression. Having a drug approved to treat PPD that works quickly and effectively, yet is also durable, would be a huge step forward for psychiatry in general,\u201d Meltzer-Brody said.\n\nBrexanolone injection is an allosteric modulator of both synaptic and extra-synaptic GABA\u1d00 receptors. In postpartum depression, the GABA pathway may play a key role in regulating hormones that researchers believe can lead to PPD.\n\nSage Therapeutics is the developer of brexanolone injection and sponsor of the trials. A New Drug Application is currently under review by the FDA and brexanolone injection has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation. The FDA has assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act target date of December 19, 2018.", "question": "Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The release notes that\u00a0 there was a reduction in depressive symptoms of 17 points for those on the drug, and 12.8 for those in the placebo group based on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.

Testing revealed Evangelina was born with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency, also called SCID or \"bubble baby\" disease.\n\nIt's a genetic disorder that leaves the body with a weakened immune system, making infants extremely vulnerable to illness. It affects cells that play important roles in helping the immune system battle bacteria, viruses and fungi that can cause infections. Even the common cold can be deadly.\n\nSymptoms of the disease are frequently first noticed very early in life, as was the case with Evangelina. Babies with SCID often come down with recurrent, severe respiratory infections that can be life threatening, according to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology.\n\n\"We wore masks, we had hand sanitizer, we had raw hands from cleaning so much,\" Vaccaro recalled.\n\nThe Vaccaros turned to Dr. Donald Kohn at the Broad Stem Cell Research Center at UCLA, where Kohn focuses on the development of new methods to treat genetic diseases of blood cells. They enrolled baby Evangelina in a clinical trial there.\n\nDr. Kohn said of an experimental treatment for SCID, \"It's gone from a 'one day, maybe' to a real clinical reality.\"\n\nThat means an actual cure for the disease, said Kohn, who is also director of the Human Gene Medicine Program at UCLA. His treatment involves taking bone marrow from the patient to gather stem cells. A cloned gene is then added to correct what was missing at birth.\n\n\"Those stem cells are given back to the patient where they can go back to the bone marrow and make the blood cells for the rest of the patient's life,\" Kohn said.\n\nSo far, the treatment has restored immune systems in all 23 patients in the most recent clinical trials, including Evangelina.\n\n\"It is a cure. I know it's a cure. We're living the cure,\" said Vaccaro.\n\nNow 3 years old, doctors say Evangelina is in perfect health.\n\nDr. Kohn is currently working with the FDA to make his treatment available nationwide.

A study suggests online self-help behavior therapy could be a solution.\n\nSuicidal thoughts were much less common in new doctors who had four half-hour online sessions before starting their first year of training, compared with those who got no therapy.\n\nThe research involved about 200 medical interns \u2014 residents in their first post-graduate year, which is often one of the most intense periods of doctor training. It often involves 80-hour weeks and overnight hospital shifts dealing with multiple medical crises.\n\nAn earlier study of 740 interns found that suicidal thoughts increased almost four-fold during the first three months of residency, said Dr. Constance Guille of the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston. Her research group led both studies.\n\nSarah Dalechek, a first-year psychiatry resident at that university, said her program requires two month-long rotations of 16-hour overnight shifts in an emergency room. She said she became very depressed but had little time to seek help.\n\n\"It's very stressful because you're sleep-deprived, you're not eating right ... you're working back-to-back shifts and you're trying to catch up on sleep but you can't,\" Dalechek said. She was not involved in the study.\n\nDalechek said she looked into seeing a therapist but would have preferred a web-based program since it's confidential and requires no appointment. Luckily, her depression subsided when that rotation ended.\n\nGuille said offering web-based therapy routinely to medical residents could be beneficial, if her research results are confirmed in a broader study.\n\nThe results were published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry.\n\nThe study involved interns at Yale University and the University of Southern California. It used a free online program developed at the National Institute for Mental Health Research at the Australian National University in Canberra. Interns who got the sessions were 40 percent less likely to have suicidal thoughts during that first year compared to those who received four weekly emails with information about depressions and where to seek help.\n\nThe online program included sessions about how to put feelings of stress or despair into perspective. For example, a poor test grade or bad performance evaluation might lead to feelings of \"I'm not good enough,\" but the lessons encourage more positive thinking about \"how many exams have you passed, to put this failure in a more accurate light,\" Guille said.\n\nThe training also encourages seeking out activities or thoughts that bring pleasure, especially when feeling down.\n\nPrevious research has shown benefits from similar web-based therapy in other settings.\n\nGuille said medical students and residents tend to be high-achieving perfectionists, but that they need to learn \"you can't always be perfect in medicine, you have to figure out how to deal with failure.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story has some useful information on the benefits of the online therapy.

It is also important to point out that 48% of the medical interns participating had a baseline history of depression.

And even when we starve ourselves thin, we often can\u2019t reverse those alterations. So we just slowly pack the pounds back on because our brains think we need them.\n\nBack in the early '90s, doctors thought they had struck gold with a combination of drugs, fenfluramine and phentermine, or fen-phen, that seemed to magically melt fat away. But within a couple of years some patients began to develop very scary side effects: damage to heart valves that could lead to heart failure and a kind of high blood pressure, pulmonary hypertension, that proved to be fatal in some cases.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration called on drugmakers to pull fenfluramine \u2014 the culprit part of the combo \u2014 which they did. The media attention that followed would scare patients off diet pills for years \u2014 a fear that continues today.\n\nBut with America growing fatter with each passing year \u2014 two-thirds of Americans are now overweight or obese \u2014 doctors believed that they had no choice but to continue their quest for a safe, and at least moderately effective, medicine that would help patients drop excess pounds and keep them off.\n\nThe latest generation of drugs seems to do just that. They won\u2019t make a morbidly obese patient model-thin, but they\u2019ll shave off enough excess fat to improve heart disease risk factors such as hypertension, high blood sugar and high cholesterol, experts say.\n\nTake lorcaserin, for example. Researchers found that the drug could lead to consistent and sustained loss of more than 5 percent of weight in nearly 40 percent of patients at risk for heart attacks, strokes and death from cardiovascular disease without increasing the likelihood of such events, according to a report published recently in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThe new study followed participants for three years. \u201cMost prior studies of weight loss only followed patients for a year, and a few out to two years,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Erin Bohula, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a cardiologist and investigator with the TIMI Study Group at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. \u201cThe challenge with lifestyle interventions is that patients tend to lose weight up front, and then the weight is regained, sometimes beyond the original weight. So the challenge is to keep it off long term.\u201d\n\nWhile a 5 percent weight loss may not seem like a lot, \u201cthat is the point where there is a very significant reduction in the risk of diabetes,\u201d said Dr. Louis Aronne, a professor of metabolic research at Weill Cornell Medicine. \u201cA 5 percent loss of weight is associated with a 50 percent lower risk of diabetes and a 10 percent loss is associated with an 80 percent lower risk.\u201d\n\nPatients in Bohula\u2019s study did see improvements in hypertension and blood sugar levels with weight loss.\n\nPeople need to realize that in obesity treatment, just as in hypertension therapy, one drug won\u2019t fit all, Aronne said. \u201cIn hypertension, there are more than 100 medications and more than 10 therapeutic categories,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s why treatment of hypertension is so effective. No one medication for hypertension works for every single person. That\u2019s how we need to start looking at drugs for obesity.\u201d\n\nWhat many don\u2019t understand is that weight gain leads to changes in the brain that may not be reversible, Aronne said. \u201cThe process of weight gain makes it hard to lose weight,\u201d he explained, adding that in certain areas of the brain nerve cells are actually damaged and sometimes die.\n\nThat new understanding is why some major medical associations have come to see diet pills as intrinsic in the battle against obesity.\n\nWeight loss drugs are recommended supplements to diet and exercise \u2014 included, for example, in 2013 guidelines by the American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology and the Obesity Society, Bohula said. But there still \u201care relatively low rates of use. There are probably a few reasons for this, including cost, if not covered by insurance, and a perception that these agents are not safe in light of the history with weight loss agents.\u201d\n\nIn fact, a 2017 report that examined the medical records of 2.2 million patients found that fewer than one in 50 patients who were eligible for a diet pill prescription received one.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t surprise Dr. Vijaya Surampudi, an endocrinologist and an assistant professor of medicine at the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cI prescribe them all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they are not very popular. I think a lot of physicians are uncomfortable prescribing weight loss medications. Fen-phen scares off a lot of them.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to dieting, Americans need to reframe how they view weight loss, Surampudi said. \u201cPeople need to focus on the health benefits,\u201d she said. \u201cRather than thinking about how good you\u2019ll look in that dress, you need to be thinking, \u2018I won\u2019t get diabetes now.\u2019\"\n\nBeyond that, a little patience goes a long way. \u201cWe didn\u2019t put the weight on overnight,\u201d Surampudi said. \u201cAnd we shouldn\u2019t expect it to come off overnight.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Th story claimed the latest generation of diet pills can help \u201cshave off enough excess fat to improve heart disease risk factors such as hypertension, high blood sugar and high cholesterol.\u201d\nSpecifically,\u00a0that the drug lorcaserin (Belviq) helped \u201cnearly\u201d 40% of patients have sustained weight loss of more than 5% of body weight, which it said \u201cis associated with a 50 percent lower risk of diabetes and a 10 percent loss is associated with an 80 percent lower risk.\u201d\nIt also said patients in a lorcaserin study \u201cdid see improvements in hypertension and blood sugar levels with weight loss.\u201d\nWhen we looked up the results in a large\u00a0study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the numbers aren\u2019t as impressive sounding:", "answer": 0}, {"article": "The Food and Drug Administration approved a new drug on Tuesday to treat serious cases of eczema.\n\nThe drug, called Dupixent, is a twice-a-month injection under the skin.

This might include reducing blood pressure and inflammation, he added.\n\nPrevious research linked dementia risk with the amount of omega-3 fatty acids in blood plasma, which reflects how much people had eaten in the past few days. But in the current work, researchers could estimate the amount of omega-3s that participants had consumed in the past several months by looking at how much had built up in their red blood cells.\n\n\"This represents their average intake of fatty acids, not just a snapshot,\" Tan said.\n\nThe study, published in the Feb. 28 issue of the journal Neurology, did not prove that omega-3 fatty acids prevent mental decline, merely that there may be an association between consumption of fatty acids and brain health.\n\nFor the study, researchers measured the red blood cell level of fatty acids in 1,575 dementia-free people whose average age was 67. About three months later, participants underwent mental-functioning tests and MRI scans that examined brain size and blood supply in the brain.\n\nThe participants were in the Framingham Offspring Study, which is predominately white. Whether the association would apply to other ethnic and racial groups needs to be explored, the authors said.\n\nThe researchers found that those with the lowest levels of omega-3s had worse scores on tests of visual memory, attention and abstract thinking than people who ranked in the top 75 percent for fatty-acid levels.\n\nAdults in the bottom 25 percent also tended to have smaller brain volume overall. The decrease in brain volume was enough to make their brains appear two years older than those of people in the top three-quarters for fatty-acid levels.\n\nBrain scans also showed signs of less blood supply in the brains of people with the lowest omega-3 levels. This suggests they may play a role in promoting general vascular, or blood vessel, health in the brain, similar to how they are thought to help heart health, rather than acting on just one brain area, Tan said.\n\nThe researchers took into account various health and lifestyle factors, including age, education and body mass index, to explore whether other differences among the people with low levels of omega-3s could help explain their more rapid brain aging.\n\nBut after controlling for those risk factors, \"the difference [in brain aging] is still there so we conclude that omega-3 fatty acids likely explain them,\" Tan said.\n\nTan added, however, that it remains possible that factors they did not control for, such as fruit and vegetable consumption, are really responsible for the brain benefits. Another possibility is that the slight mental decline that the people in the older brain group were experiencing caused them to eat less healthy omega-3-rich foods, instead of vice versa.\n\n\"This is a strengthening of the argument that people with less [omega-3 fatty acids] have higher risk of dementia,\" said Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, associate professor of clinical neurology at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City.\n\nBut questions remain over whether fatty-acid levels really influence changes in brain size, Scarmeas added. A clinical trial comparing high and low intake of omega-3s in relation to brain imaging would help answer those questions, he said.\n\nIn the meantime, fish is \"a good prescription for other things and we have a hint it might be helpful for the brain,\" Scarmeas said.\n\nThat the current study reported a difference in brain health between people with omega-3 fatty-acid levels in the bottom 25 percent and top 75 percent suggests that there is a threshold level of consumption to attain brain gains.\n\nA previous study in which participants filled out food surveys found decreased risk of vascular brain problems among those who ate at least three servings of fish a week.\n\nFind out more about brain health at the Alzheimer's Association.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Although we think readers will come away with the correct bottom line message on this study, we\u2019re going to rate this criterion unsatisfactory, for two reasons:", "answer": 0}, {"article": "The bodies of many older Americans are practically bionic: more than 770,000 hip and knee replacements are performed each year in the United States.\n\nNow another aging joint is fast becoming a candidate for replacement. This year, 4,400 patients are expected to undergo surgery to replace arthritic or injured ankles with artificial joints made of metal alloys and lightweight plastic, according to industry estimates.\n\nFour models are commonly used in the United States, with Food and Drug Administration approval. And demand is expected to grow as more and more baby boomers hobble into their 60s and 70s with debilitating ankle pain.\n\nAnkle replacement has been around for three decades, but it has been slow to catch on. Problems with early devices left surgeons and patients wary. The operation is complex, and many foot and ankle surgeons lack experience. While Medicare pays for ankle replacement, many private insurers do not.\n\nEach year about two million Americans visit the doctor for ankle pain from arthritis or fracture. An estimated 50,000 people a year experience end-stage ankle arthritis, in which the ankle cartilage has worn away completely, causing painful bone-on-bone contact and some level of disability.\n\nUntil lately, such patients have had only one surgical option: ankle fusion surgery, in which the worn-out part of the joint is removed and the bones are permanently locked together with screws and plates. The procedure usually relieves pain, but the patient loses mobility in the ankle, leading to changes in gait and, ultimately, additional wear and tear and arthritic pain in other parts of the ankle. About 25,000 ankle fusions were performed in the United States last year.\n\nAndrew Keaveney, now 73, shattered his ankle in a fall from a truck while hanging flags as an American Legion volunteer. Surgery repaired the broken bones, but he continued to have severe pain.\n\nDoctors suggested ankle fusion, but he found a surgeon who offered total ankle replacement. He had the operation in December 2008, and now he says the ankle is \u201c99 percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore the surgery, I couldn\u2019t sleep at night,\u201d said Mr. Keaveney, of Locust Valley, N.Y. \u201cNow I\u2019m able to climb ladders.

Radnay, an associate at the Insall Scott Kelly Institute for Orthopedics and Sports Medicine in New York City and on Long Island, says he is now a \u201cbig believer\u201d in ankle replacement for certain patients.\n\n\u201cFor an ankle replacement you have to be a little more picky in who you select for those cases,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t tell you how many patients come in, and I mention this option they don\u2019t even know exists.\u201d (Dr. Radnay, who says he has performed more than 100 ankle replacements using an Inbone device from Wright Medical Group of Arlington, Tenn., is now a paid consultant to the company, helping to gather data on long-term success rates.)\n\nThe ideal patient is around 60 years old and of normal weight, although doctors consider older patients, depending on their health. People with diabetes may not be good candidates because they may risk complications as a result of poor blood circulation.\n\nDr. Jonathan T. Deland, chief of the foot and ankle service at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan, said that while the devices had improved, he remained cautious about offering the operation. (Dr. Deland is helping to develop a new ankle replacement device for Zimmer of Warsaw, Ind., which may be submitted for F.D.A. approval this year.)\n\n\u201cThe big concern about ankle replacement is how often do they fail and how often do they loosen,\u201d he said.\n\nComplications can include slow healing, as well as infection. Severe complications are rare, but they can result in amputation. Still, Dr. Deland said, \u201cwe\u2019re getting fewer and fewer failures.\u201d\n\nThe new models require that less bone be removed, so the bone to which the device is affixed is stronger. In addition, instruments used to guide surgeons in aligning the artificial joint have improved. Dr. Deland cited data showing that for some recent models, 90 percent of ankle replacements were still in place after an average of eight and a half years.\n\nThough the four devices in common use have technical differences in design and in how they are implanted, doctors say the choice of device matters far less than the experience of the surgeon. The procedure is among the most difficult that foot and ankle surgeons perform, and one of the biggest challenges is getting proper alignment of the replacement joint.\n\nDr. Brian Donley, an orthopedic surgeon who is director of the foot and ankle center at the Cleveland Clinic, says patients should always ask their doctor to disclose any financial interest in a device. (He performed the first United States operation using the Salto Talaris device from Tornier of Minneapolis, and receives consulting fees from the company.)\n\nEven with a successful implantation, patients should not necessarily expect to have the same ankles they did at 18. They should not try to return to activities like basketball and distance running.

Impaired insulin sensitivity is one risk factor for type 2 diabetes, which is associated with age and obesity and happens when the body can\u2019t properly convert blood sugar into energy.\n\nThe researchers did two brief sleep experiments. On one occasion, the volunteers were permitted just 4.5 hours of rest for four nights, followed by two evenings of extended sleep that amounted to 9.7 hours on average. On another occasion, the same men were allowed to sleep 8.5 hours for four nights.\n\nAfter the four nights of sleep deprivation, the volunteers\u2019 insulin sensitivity had fallen by 23 percent and their bodies had started to produce extra insulin. But when researchers checked again after two nights of extended rest, the men\u2019s insulin sensitivity, and the amount of insulin their bodies produced, had returned to normal, mirroring what was seen during the portion of the experiment when the volunteers consistently got a good nights\u2019 rest.\n\nThe volunteers were given a calorie-controlled diet to limit the potential for their food and drink choices to influence the outcomes.

An already approved drug could be quickly available and would then be the first breast cancer prevention drug.\n\nAbout one in eight women will develop invasive breast cancer over the course of her lifetime. Causes can be the use of synthetic sex hormones and other environmental factors, but also gene mutations like in the BRCA1 gene (BReast CAncer). US actress Angelina Jolie who underwent a preventive double mastectomy is the most famous carrier of a \u201efaulty\u201c BRCA1 gene. On average, women with this mutation have an up to 87% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. Tumors usually develop early in life. Until now, prophylactic surgery is the only procedure which significantly reduces the breast cancer risk, but which is also often associated with postoperative complications.\n\nIn 2010, Josef Penninger, the scientific director of IMBA in Vienna and his team have shown that sex hormones can trigger breast cancer (Schramek et al., Nature) through proteins called RANKL and its receptor RANK, which are key factors in bone metabolism. RANKL and RANK also link sex hormones to breast cells by providing signals telling the breast cells to grow. This occurs normally in every woman during pregnancy and the menstruation cycle. However, if deregulated, mammary cells start to divide and multiply and fail to die when they should, ultimately resulting in breast cancer.\n\nA multinational research effort now made the discovery that RANKL is also the main driver of BRCA1 mutation-driven breast cancer. In the current study, Verena Sigl, graduate student from Penninger's research group, showed that blocking the RANKL/RANK system in BRCA1 mutant mice led to largely normal mammary glands whereas invasive carcinomas could be found in the control group. To determine the relevance of their results for humans, scientists in Vienna and Toronto isolated breast tissue cells from women who had undergone preventive mastectomy because of their BRCA1 mutation. In the human cell culture, too, RANKL inhibition led to a significant reduction of growth and spreading of breast tissue cells. Moreover, the scientists \u2013 together with colleagues in Barcelona and from the CIMBA* consortium mapping more than 23,000 women \u2013 showed that genetic variants in the RANK gene are associated with a higher risk of developing breast cancer in women who carry BRCA1 and also BRCA2 mutations.\n\n\"Our finding is so exciting because there is already an approved drug against RANKL called \u201eDenosumab\u201d. It is an antibody with very few side effects, which binds tightly to RANKL, thereby inhibiting its ability to act. Based on our discovery, the already approved drug Denosumab or other future drugs that will block RANKL/RANK, could be used for breast cancer prevention in BRCA mutation carriers,\" explains Verena Sigl.\n\nScientists at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore have already tried the preventive use of a RANKL blocking drug in mice. Animals carrying BRCA1 mutations were divided into two groups. In the control group multiple early breast cancer lesions developed. The second group received RANKL blockade treatment for prevention with the result that virtually no malignant changes in breast tissue could be observed even over a longer period of observation.\n\nCareful phase III clinical trials are now needed to confirm the efficacy in humans. Thereafter, any woman who has been tested positive for a BRCA1 mutation could take RANKL blockade as prevention measure to reduce her dramatically increased breast cancer risk. Josef Penninger adds: \u201cThis work is a great example of an international collaboration of many scientists with one grand vision: Prevention of breast cancer. Cancer prevention is one of the key issues we face in medicine today, a world where much fewer women will get breast cancer in the first place. We have also shown that RANKL/RANK are critically involved in sex hormone-driven breast cancer. If the uncovered mechanism indeed works in the prevention of breast cancer in high risk patients, this could possibly be used to prevent breast cancer in general. One door for breast cancer prevention has now been opened and this can be tested very fast.\u201d\n\nThe present work is the result of international collaboration. Scientists from Austria (IMBA, AKH Wien) participated as well as researchers from the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore and the University of Maryland-Baltimore County, Baltimore, USA; Toronto, Canada and Barcelona, Spain.

Rather, they said that for certain patients who may not be eligible for more standard surgical approaches, the therapy has potential as an alternative means for offering an improved quality of life for a longer period of time.\n\n\"'Promising' is the perfect way to describe our findings,\" said study lead author Dr. David Woodrum, an interventional radiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. \"But whether or not this minimally invasive approach would ultimately become a primary method of treatment in the future will depend on the long-term results of this trial, which is still under way. At this point I would say that cryoablation has the most applicability as a kind of last-ditch treatment for patients who are not good surgical candidates for a variety of reasons.\"\n\nWoodrum and his colleagues are scheduled to discuss their findings Sunday in New Orleans at the annual meeting of the Society of Interventional Radiology. Funding for their work was provided by Galil Medical, a medical device manufacturer based in Arden Hills, Minn.\n\nBecause this study was presented at a medical meeting, the conclusions should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute points out that while cryoablation (also known as cryosurgery) is a well-known practice, researchers are still in the process of assessing its long-term benefits.\n\nThe procedure is performed by an interventional radiologist on patients coping with metastasized lung tumors, the researchers noted. Using CT-imaging equipment, the physician inserts a small needle-like instrument directly into the tumor to deliver the freezing power (at temperatures as low as minus 100 degrees Celsius) of liquid nitrogen to cancer cells, while sparing healthy surrounding tissue.\n\nTo date, the team behind the new study has used the procedure to tackle a total of 36 tumors in 22 American and French patients --13 men and nine women -- whose average age was 60. Fifteen patients had just one tumor, while the rest had two or more. None of the patients was deemed eligible for standard surgical interventions.\n\nThe targeted tumors were less than 3.5 centimeters (about 1.4 inches), which Woodrum described as being \"small to medium in size.\"\n\nThe procedure was performed under either general anesthesia or conscious sedation, and lasted anywhere from 45 minutes to nearly three hours. Typically, patients were able to return home the following day.\n\nThe result: Among the 15 patients seen roughly three months post-procedure, tumor control was found to be 100 percent, although six patients were found to have developed new lung tumors in the interim.\n\nAmong five patients seen six months after the procedure, tumor control continued to be 100 percent.\n\nThe authors noted that side effects were minimal, typically involving air or fluid around the lungs after the procedure, and in all cases were resolved quickly.\n\nThe team concluded that cryoablation appears to be both safe and effective, at least in the short-term. But they acknowledged that more research needs to be done to track the treatment's impact over the long haul.\n\n\"It would be overreaching to say that we're curing cancer with this,\" Woodrum said. \"But this is one of many therapy options that is looking to turn cancer into a chronic fight, and to give patients for whom the choices are limited a chance at a good quality of life with minimal treatment complications.\"\n\nFor his part, Dr. David Carbone, a professor and director of the James Thoracic Center at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, said that the findings regarding cryoablation are \"not incredibly novel,\" given that the procedure has been around for years.\n\n\"And I would say that there are multiple different technologies for doing this kind of very localized approach,\" he added. He mentioned stereotactic radiosurgery -- which targets the tumor with high-power X-rays -- as another way to go.\n\n\"While I've done cryoablation myself in the past, it's not what I typically do,\" Carbone noted. \"Stereotactic is noninvasive and doesn't require general anesthesia, so that's what I'd tend to do, although certainly what approach is ideal will depend on a particular patient's situation and symptoms.

These are signals that a debilitating migraine is on its way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re possessed,\u201d said Lorie Novak, who has suffered from chronic migraines since childhood. \u201cI almost feel separate from my body, like it\u2019s just this painful shell around me that\u2019s not me.\u201d\n\nNovak, now in her 60s, is one of the roughly 35 million Americans who suffer from migraines. There are few effective treatments, and no new drugs have been developed since the early 1990s.\n\nBut that could soon change. A handful of drug companies are pressing ahead with novel injectable therapies for migraines, chasing a blockbuster market that Wall Street analysts say could reach $8 billion a year in worldwide sales.\n\nThe new drugs target a bodily protein called CGRP, which plays a role in the dilation of blood vessels in the brain. Scientists haven\u2019t nailed down just how the protein affects migraines, but they\u2019re sure about two things: CGRP levels rocket up when headaches attack and normalize when they go away.\n\nAnd thus four drug makers \u2014 Amgen, Eli Lilly, Teva Pharmaceuticals, and Alder Biopharmaceuticals \u2014 have fashioned antibodies that can bind to CGRP molecules and block their activity. The goal: to relieve the scourge of chronic migraines by stopping CGRP in its tracks.\n\nSo far, it seems to be working. In mid-stage clinical trials, each of the four treatments has eased symptoms for about half of study participants, cutting the number of days they\u2019re afflicted by migraines roughly in half. It\u2019s by no means a cure for migraines, but it should be enough to merit Food and Drug Administration approvals if the companies can replicate those results in larger trials, according to Eric Schmidt, a securities analyst at Cowen and Co.\n\nEach treatment is now in late-stage development, targeting the roughly 38 percent of migraine sufferers who, like Novak, have at least four headache days per month. The first therapy could hit the market in 2018, and, if everything works out, all four could available by the end of the decade.\n\nSo far, the four drugs have performed similarly in clinical trials, and analysts expect the contenders will have to compete on price to grab market share.\n\n\u201cThere will certainly be hypercompetition,\u201d said William Ratner, Lilly\u2019s senior director of global headache marketing. But the companies\u2019 fortunes are intertwined, he said, and \u201cthe class only wins if headache care in America improves.\u201d\n\nAiming to prevent migraines before they start\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of room for improvement. Existing therapies are plagued by inconsistent efficacy and troublesome side effects, and patients are often left to rely on a repurposed treatment for epilepsy. That medication, Topamax, has been dubbed dubbed \u201cSleepomax\u201d by doctors and patients because it\u2019s also a heavy sedative.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very enthusiastic, as I think everyone in the field is, about having another treatment option for people with migraines,\u201d said Dr. Elizabeth Loder, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and chief of the headache division in the department of neurology at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital.\n\nTargeting CGRP is not a particularly new idea. Researchers picked up on the protein\u2019s scent more than 30 years ago, and drug companies spent years trying to craft pills that might block its activity. Merck got all the way into late-stage trials with an anti-CGRP tablet, spending more than $1 billion only to find in 2011 that the drug had toxic effects on the liver and thus no future.\n\nWith the \u201cexquisite sensitivity\u201d of an antibody, however, scientists believe they can block CGRP without triggering dangerous side effects, Alder CEO Randy Schatzman said.\n\nBecause antibodies stay active in the body for weeks, the drug companies see their new products as preventative therapies, injected monthly or quarterly to keep headaches at bay. (Merck\u2019s failed pill, by contrast, was meant as an on-the-spot treatment after the pain started.)\n\n\u201cSo in some senses, it\u2019s a paradigm shift,\u201d Schatzman said.\n\nBut there are still hurdles to clear. Only about half of patients seem to respond to CGRP antibodies, and the companies have no way of predicting who they are ahead of time. A genetic test would be \u201cthe Holy Grail of personalized medicine,\u201d said Rob Lenz, Amgen\u2019s global development lead for neuroscience, but no one has made one yet.\n\nAnd long-term safety remains a major question mark. To date, none of the companies has reported serious side effects in clinical trials, but they\u2019ve only reported data from 12-week studies on about 1,500 total patients. It will take years to determine just what the new therapies do to the body over time, Loder said.\n\n\u2018I felt like my life was being stolen from me\u2019\n\nAny advance, even an incremental one, would be a major leap for the field, said Emily Bates, who studies the genetic causes of headaches at the University of Colorado and is not affiliated with any of the companies working on migraine treatment.\n\nBates struggled with chronic migraines in high school and college. Like many patients, she didn\u2019t respond to any of the preventative therapies available.\n\n\u201cThe pain is more than anything I\u2019ve ever experienced, and I\u2019ve run on broken legs before,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like my life was being stolen from me.\u201d\n\nCollectively, Americans miss about 113 million workdays each year because of migraine. That lost productivity costs society about $13 billion each year, according to the Migraine Research Foundation.\n\nYet scientific progress has been slow, in part because migraine was long considered a psychosomatic condition not worthy of serious research funding, Bates said.\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201csubjective symptom that predominantly affects women,\u201d said Loder, the Harvard neurologist. \u201cThat\u2019s a perfect combination of things that make people feel able to dismiss it.\u201d\n\nNovak, a professor of photography at New York University\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts, spent years trying to hide her migraines because of the stigma attached to the condition.

It raises more questions, and many more experiments that can be done.\"\n\nSeven patients awaiting possible surgery for the seizure disorder epilepsy had electrodes implanted in their brains to pinpoint the origin of their convulsions. The researchers followed them and found they were better able to recognize landmarks and to navigate routes more quickly in a video game featuring a taxi cab, virtual passengers and a cyber city. Patients played the role of cab drivers who picked up passengers and delivered them to one of six requested shops in the city.\n\nStimulation of the entorhinal cortex -- a region considered crucial to transforming daily experience into lasting memories -- produced the improvement, the researchers said.\n\nThe study is published Feb. 9 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nDuring the video game task, participants learned their way around a virtual town with and without five-second periods of deep brain stimulation, and were tested for their ability to reach predetermined landmarks. Six patients showed a 64 percent reduction in \"excess path length\" -- the ideal path between destinations, which indicated better performance -- for locations that had been learned during periods of deep brain stimulation.\n\nFor five patients, navigation to each of the three stores learned during stimulation was faster and shorter than navigation to the three stores learned without stimulation, indicating a consistent effect, the study said. Stimulating the hippocampus -- a brain region next to the entorhinal cortex which helps form and store memories -- produced no effect during this experiment, however.\n\n\"Critically, it was the stimulation at the gateway into the hippocampus, and not the hippocampus itself, that proved effective,\" senior study author Dr. Itzhak Fried, a professor of neurosurgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, said in a university news release.\n\n\"Our preliminary results provide evidence supporting a possible mechanism for enhancing memory, particularly as people age or suffer from early dementia.

For most people, they start to grow in between ages 17 and 25. They're thought to crowd out other teeth or cause tooth decay, which is why many dentists and oral surgeons think it's better to just nip those problems in the bud and take them out as a preventative measure.\n\nBut there's a serious debate between dentists and oral surgeons: should they preemptively remove someone's wisdom teeth if the patient doesn't have any symptoms?\n\nSimply put, there's no right answer. It comes down to what you, as a patient, want. Here's what you need to know to figure that out.\n\nDentists and oral surgeons are fighting over wisdom teeth\n\nDentists and oral surgeons agree across the board that there's cause to remove wisdom teeth if a patient is in pain or if there are signs of disease popping up, like tooth decay or infection. That's an obvious choice. But taking out wisdom teeth when there aren't any symptoms is where the professionals get into it.\n\nMany dental professionals stick with a watch and wait approach with wisdom teeth to avoid surgery if possible. \"Many people don\u2019t have adequate space in their jaw for the teeth to come into full position, but that alone isn\u2019t justification of having them all removed,\" says Dr. Scott Tomar of University of North Carolina's School of Dentistry. Tomar says that as a dentist he feels the risks of complication, including infection and hitting nerves during surgery, outweigh any benefits of preventative removal.\n\nIn 2007, oral surgeon Dr. Jay Friedman called the preventative removals a public health hazard in the American Journal of Public Health. The American Public Health Association has sided with this argument since 2008, when it formally opposed the preventative removal of wisdom teeth. (The same thing happened with tonsils, which doctors no longer remove just to get rid of the chance of infection later on.)\n\nAmericans spend an estimated $3 billion a year having their wisdom teeth removed\n\nSome doctors, though, still see preventative oral surgery as being two steps ahead of the problem. If you're going to need your wisdom teeth out eventually, why not have them removed when you're younger and are more likely to recover more easily? Some think of removing the wisdom teeth early on as a way to lessen the crowding of other teeth\n\n\"You might not have symptoms now, but you can't assume it's gonna be that way for the rest of your life,\" says Dr. Ray White, an oral surgeon working at University of North Carolina. Rather than let the teeth cause problems later on, many oral surgeons remove them.\n\nBut a 2012 Cochrane review of randomized clinical trials found there's no evidence that removing wisdom teeth will prevent or reduce crowding of other teeth down the line. And a different Cochrane review found that watching and waiting can \"may reduce the number of surgical procedures by 60 percent or more.\n\nThe question comes down to which side of the fence medical professionals fall on\n\nIt's worth noting that oral surgeons make a good chunk of their paychecks by removing wisdom teeth, so there is a financial incentive involved.\n\n\"Are there people gaming the system? Sure. You don't get paid much for not doing anything,\" White says. \"But I'd hope we can get past that.\"\n\nThe American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial surgeons says, \"There is no pat answer, cookbook recipe, or flow chart that is universally accepted regarding the decision making process\" in these cases. So the question comes down to which side of the fence medical professionals fall on, and what works best for their patients.\n\nThe risks and benefits of removing your wisdom teeth\n\nThere's a chance that if you opt not to have your wisdom teeth taken out, they might be fine for the rest of your life.\n\nThere's also a chance that they'll need to come out later. If that's the case, you can't always plan for it. Opting to have them removed gives patients time to plan around the procedure, which leaves people out of commission for about three days.\n\nBut inconvenience isn't the only risk. \"The risk for complications increases as people get older, and the duration of disability after the operation gets longer as people get older,\" says oral surgeon Dr. Thomas Dodson.\n\nIn some cases, the extraction can be more painful if you wait, Dodson says. That's because the tooth is easier to remove if its roots aren't fully developed.\n\nThe common risks related to the surgery include poor wound healing, infection, pain, and uncontrolled bleeding. Nerve injury, in rare cases of wisdom teeth removal, can leave people with permanent numbness around the face and mouth, according to the APHA.\n\nAmericans spend an estimated $3 billion a year having 10 million wisdom teeth removed, according to the American Public Health Association. That's a hefty bill for something we may or may not need. How much it costs depends on how the molars are situated. A simple surgical extraction for a wisdom tooth that's showing through the gums should run about $230, according to Healthcare Bluebook. If it's impacted (pushed against another tooth and unable to fully come through the gum), the cost jumps to about $400 per tooth.\n\nUpdate: Added information about the number of teeth removed.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "While thorough in its discussion of the potential benefits and risks of either preventative surgery or a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach, this story is rather thin on numbers.

But it does not attach any numbers to these benefits. An expert story source points out that older people have a higher risk of complications, experience more pain due to more deeply rooted wisdom teeth, and face a longer period of recovery from surgery. But how much less often do these complications occur in younger people and how much shorter is the recovery time for earlier surgery?\nSimilarly, when discussing the benefits of a \u201cwait and see approach,\u201d the debate is framed in general terms and there is little quantification. The story notes that the risk of surgical complications may outweigh any benefit from preventative removal. But it would\u2019ve been nice to have some estimate of how frequently wisdom teeth will end up overcrowding if they are left in, or how often patients experience surgical complications if they opt for the preventative surgery.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "A rare malignancy known as squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCA) is on the increase, and now researchers have reported results of the first-ever phase II clinical trial results for treatment with the immunotherapy drug nivolumab.\n\nThe phase II study, for which findings are being presented at this week's American Association for Cancer Research's annual meeting in New Orleans, was designed and led by researchers at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center's Human Papillomavirus-Related (HPV) Cancers Moon Shot Program.

The study was published in SLEEP, the official journal of the Sleep Research Society.\n\nChronic insomnia is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders as sleeping poorly at least three nights a week for a month or longer, despite adequate opportunity for a full night's sleep. It is \"a significant problem in the military,\" said Taylor, who noted that military personnel often develop insomnia because of rapidly changing schedules and deployments that keep them constantly on alert.\n\nChronic insomnia is a strong risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and substance abuse, absenteeism and occupational accidents, Taylor said. Treatment of insomnia may not only improve sleep in these soldiers, but also improve these other conditions, he said.\n\n\"About 10 percent of deployed military personnel take sleep medications, which are effective for short-term treatment of insomnia in civilian populations. For deployed military personnel, the side effects such as grogginess, slowed cognitive processing and slowed reaction time can be dangerous,\" Taylor said.\n\nOne hundred soldiers at Fort Hood who had chronic insomnia were recruited for Taylor's study. All completed one week of sleep monitoring by keeping sleep diaries and wearing activity monitors.\n\nOne third of the participants met with clinicians at Fort Hood for cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia once a week for six weeks, while another third received the therapy via the Internet once a week for six weeks. Both the in-person and Internet therapy had the exact same content, with the Internet lessons presented as audio recordings accompanied by visual graphics and animations. A third control group of participants was contacted by the researchers every other week during the six weeks, but did not receive cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\nTaylor discovered that the study participants who received in-person cognitive behavioral treatment for their insomnia reported significantly greater improvements in sleep quality -- as determined by the sleep diaries and activity monitors -- than those who received the Internet therapy. Both groups had greater improvements in sleep quality than those who did not receive cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\nHe noted that that cognitive behavioral therapy is \"a multifaceted intervention that can be difficult to administer without the benefit of a therapist.\" Additional training in the therapy for behavioral health providers in all branches of the military is needed, he said.\n\nIn a previous study of civilians with insomnia, Taylor and his research team discovered that cognitive behavioral therapy led to significant improvements in sleep efficiency, with the research subjects' use of sleep medication declining from 87.5 percent before therapy to 54 percent afterward, although the subjects weren't required to stop taking their medication.\n\nKristi Pruiksma, a STRONG STAR collaborating investigator and clinical psychologist, served as a clinician on Taylor's study. She said the benefits of the online therapy include easy access to the treatment and flexibility in times for completing the sessions, which \"is really helpful for those juggling work and family demands.\"\n\n\"The online program can also be done from home rather than at a military behavioral health clinic, which some service members may avoid due to concerns about stigma,\" said Pruiksma, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio).\n\n\"Successful treatment has a real impact on patients' daily lives.

The group numbers about 7,500 patients a year in the United States.\n\nThe one-time infusion, known as CAR T-cell therapy, is made by Kite Pharma, which is based in Santa Monica, Calif., and recently was bought by Gilead Sciences for $11.9 billion. Kite announced Wednesday that the treatment's brand name will be Yescarta and its price will be $373,000.\n\nIn late August, the FDA cleared the first CAR T-cell therapy, which is designed for children and young adults whose leukemia doesn't respond to standard treatments. About 600 patients in the United States fall into that category every year. Kymriah, which costs $475,000, is manufactured by Novartis.\n\nBiotech analysts had expected the Kite price to be lower than Kymriah's, in part because the number of eligible patients is larger and the response rates are lower. Even so, Yescarta's cost is likely to stoke the ongoing debate about high drug prices.\n\nThe FDA approval is the latest step forward for the fast-moving field of immunotherapy, which aims to bolster the immune system to attack malignancies. CAR T-cell therapies are among several approaches, along with treatments called checkpoint inhibitors and cancer vaccines, but they have recently grabbed much of the attention.

Following this procedure, patients are often prescribed long-term, daily oral anticoagulation medications -- also known as blood thinners. However, a new study shows the use of novel anticoagulants for AF prescribed on an \"as-needed basis\" guided by diligent pulse monitoring, can be a safe and effective alternative to lowering overall risk of stroke. Researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania presented their findings today at the Heart Rhythm Society's 37th Annual Scientific Session in San Francisco.\n\nOral anticoagulation therapy is recommended in patients with infrequent AF and high risk of stroke, however, prolonged use of blood thinners is associated with a higher bleeding risk. To determine an alternate but effective therapy, the researchers enrolled 100 patients age 45-78 with significant stroke risk and coupled with diligent pulse monitoring -- manually or by using a smartphone - twice a day with \"as needed\" anticoagulants for the treatment of AF. Patients were provided with novel oral anticoagulants and were instructed to start taking the medication if they suspected or detected an AF episode lasting longer than one hour.\n\n\"This kind of approach to anticoagulation therapy requires an open line of communication between the patient and the care team, and calls for a specific type of patient.

No patients experienced a stroke or transient ischemic attack - also called a mini-stroke -- and there was only one mild bleeding incident that required medical attention.\n\n\"It is extremely common for patients with AF to seek treatment that does not involve the use of chronic oral anticoagulants therapy, as there are other risks associated with their long term use,\" said co-author Francis E. Marchlinski, MD, FHRS, director of Electrophysiology for the University of Pennsylvania Health System and Richard T. and Angela Clark President's Distinguished Professor in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. \"The goal of this study was to find a safe and effected treatment option, and our initial results support 'as-needed' blood thinners and pulse monitoring as the alternative.\"\n\nAll patients enrolled had no AF recurrences during an extended period of telemetry monitoring before the study began, and were willing and able to check their pulses manually or by a smartphone-enabled device twice a day. Of these patients, 84 had been ablated, sixteen were being treated with drug therapy, and three had implanted devices that served as a quality control check.\n\n\"While this is an observational study with a relatively small patient sample, further research is certainly needed to better understand alternate treatment options,\" said Pammer. \"And, we stress that 'as-needed' blood thinners should not be considered unless the patient qualifies as highly motivated.\"\n\nPenn Medicine is one of the world's leading academic medical centers, dedicated to the related missions of medical education, biomedical research, and excellence in patient care.

About 23 percent of the women reported taking a low-dose aspirin (81 milligrams), 18 percent took ibuprofen, 11 percent took full-strength aspirin (325 mg) and about 10 percent took a COX-2 inhibitor or another nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).

Those taking low-dose aspirin were 16 percent less likely to have developed any type of breast cancer, compared with women who took no NSAID.

However, aspirin can increase the risk for internal bleeding, so women should talk with their doctors before starting a low-dose aspirin regimen, for any reason.\n\nThe researchers suggested that the difference in results between low- and regular-dose aspirin may have been attributable to most women taking low-dose aspirin more often than three times a week, even daily, for cardiovascular protection as opposed to more-sporadic use of regular-dose aspirin for pain relief.

Most existing mobile health diagnostic devices, meanwhile, can only analyze one sample at a time.\n\nThe WSU researchers found that their portable smartphone reader worked nearly as well as standard lab testing in detecting 12 common viral and bacterial infectious diseases, such as mumps, measles, herpes, and Lyme Disease. The researchers tested the device, which is about the size of a hand, with 771 patient samples at Hospital of University of Pennsylvania and found that it provided false positives only about one percent of the time (was 97. to 99.9 percent accurate).\n\nThe smartphone reader, which includes a portable device, takes a photo of 96 sample wells at once and uses a computer program to carefully analyze color to determine positive or negative results.\n\n\"This smartphone reader has the potential to improve access and speed up healthcare delivery,\" said Li. \"If we find out about infections, we can treat them more quickly, which makes a difference especially in low-resource, remote areas.\"\n\nBuying the components themselves, the research team was able to build the device for about $50, but the manufacturing cost would probably be lower than that, he said.

Symptoms including serious memory loss, confusion and mood changes develop gradually and worsen with time. Recently, many strides have been made in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease earlier, but doctors have been stymied by a lack of effective treatments to stop or slow the course of the disease.\n\nIt's long been known that a protein fragment called beta-amyloid builds up in the spaces between nerve cells in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease. The new drug, gantenerumab, targets these amyloid proteins by priming the body's immune system to recognize them as invaders.\n\nOf 16 people with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease, those who received two to seven infusions of the experimental drug every four weeks showed marked reductions in the amount of plaque in their brains via imaging tests that were conducted several months after their treatments.\n\nBy contrast, amyloid load increased among people who were randomized to receive the placebo. The new drug was given at either 60 or 200 milligrams (mg) doses. The higher dose yielded greater reductions in amyloid levels, the study showed. People who were given the 60 mg doses saw a nearly 16 percent reduction in the amount of amyloid, and those given the 200 mg doses saw a 36 percent reduction. The new study was conducted and funded by the drug's manufacturer, F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd., in Basel, Switzerland.\n\nThe big question is whether or not reducing amyloid levels has any effect on the symptoms or progression of Alzheimer's disease, said Dr. Patrick Lyden, chief of neurology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. \"There is a growing concern that amyloid is a guilty bystander, but not the actual culprit in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease, and taking away the bystander may not help the patient,\" he said.\n\nThere are approximately one dozen therapies, including vaccines, for Alzheimer's disease that are currently in the pipeline, Lyden noted. \"They are all extremely exciting and promising in animals,\" he said. \"This is the first one to show a preliminary result in people, but we have a huge way to go to make sure it is safe and improves symptoms.\"\n\nMany in the Alzheimer's research community are awaiting these drugs with bated breath, but \"none are ready for prime time,\" he said.\n\nThe leading theory of Alzheimer's disease is that an imbalance in the production or clearance of the amyloid plaque in the brain initiates a cascade of events that lead to dementia, explained Dr. Neelum Aggarwal, an associate professor of neurological sciences at Rush Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.\n\n\"Accumulation of the plaques cause a variety of cellular responses: inflammation, neuronal death, and thus any potential treatment that can alter these processes would be beneficial,\" she said. The hope is that gantenerumab or other drugs like it will not only prevent amyloid from accumulating in the brain, but also slow down the cognitive impairment that occurs in people with Alzheimer's disease, she added.\n\nThat said, these experimental drugs carry the potential for serious side effects, including causing the immune system to go haywire. \"The main issue that remains for this type of drug development is managing the immune response,\" Aggarwal said. Other side effects include a potentially fatal fluid build-up in certain areas of the brain. \"This is problematic in that use of these treatments may carry a very high risk for neurologic complications, thus necessitating heightened monitoring, and diminishing its applicability as a treatment for a larger patient population such as the Alzheimer's disease population,\" she said.\n\nIf any of these drugs make it through the pipeline, it also needs to be determined who will get them, including whether the drugs will be given to prevent Alzheimer's in patients at high-risk of the disease or to treat it once it's started.\n\nThe need for a drug to delay the onset or slow progression of Alzheimer's disease can't be underestimated, Aggrawal said. In the United States alone, there are 5.4 million people with Alzheimer's disease, and the numbers are expected to increase to 13 million by 2050, when approximately three of every five people over the age of 85 will have Alzheimer's disease, she said.\n\nFor more information about Alzheimer's disease signs, symptoms and treatments, visit the Alzheimer's Association.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story adequately described the responses of study participants at different dose levels.

He wasn't doing his homework. He was being very difficult with his little brother. And he was just melting down day after day,\" Ellison says. \"So I decided to devote a year to trying out different approaches to see if we could make it any better.\"\n\nIn recent years, more people have been trying an alternative approach called neurofeedback, a type of therapy intended to teach the brain to stay calm and focused. Neurofeedback is expensive, time consuming and still scientifically unproved. But, there's growing evidence that it can help.\n\nEllison says the idea appealed to her immediately.\n\n\"Because I was always wary about using meds as a single approach or for very long, it seemed to be an interesting alternative. It's really like meditation on steroids,\" says Ellison, a journalist who won a Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting -- and who has ADHD herself.\n\nEllison has written a book about living with ADHD called Buzz: A Year of Paying Attention. And one chapter of the book is devoted to neurofeedback.\n\nEllison says she tried meditation, but her mind kept wandering. Neurofeedback is better for people with ADHD, she says, because it provides constant feedback during a session, which is usually done in a therapist's office.\n\nPeople usually sit in a chair facing a laptop screen. The laptop is connected to electrodes applied to the scalp. Special software monitors the electrical activity in your brain. In particular, it measures rhythmic patterns known as theta and beta waves.\n\nProponents of neurofeedback say these patterns reveal when the brain is in a focused and attentive state. So the computer software looks for desirable brain wave patterns and changes the image on screen to let people know how they are doing.\n\nThe image that worked best for Ellison showed a field.\n\n\"When my brain responded the way that it was supposed to, the field would burst into color. I'd hear bird song and beautiful flowers would bloom,\" she says. \"But when I got distracted or when I got a little bit more sped up, the flowers would wilt. It would turn gray, and I'd know that I needed to work a little bit harder.\"\n\nAt first, people can't control their brain wave patterns, at least not consciously. But over time, their brains become conditioned to associate certain patterns with pleasant images or sounds -- a reward for good behavior. And our brains like rewards.\n\nThis sort of brain training can take 40 sessions or more, and typically costs thousands of dollars.\n\nEven though there are studies now showing that neurofeedback works for ADHD, all of these studies have serious limitations, researchers say. So the approach remains promising but unproved, says David Rabiner, a researcher at Duke University who writes a newsletter about treatments for ADHD.\n\n\"Parents do need to know that relative to treatments like medication treatment, to behavior therapy, at this point, the research base is not as extensive,\" Rabiner says.\n\nOn the other hand, Rabiner says, neurofeedback may offer something other treatments can't.\n\n\"The hope for neurofeedback is that after training ends, the benefits that resulted from training will persist -- that in some sense there's been more enduring change in the child's ability to focus and attend and to regulate their behavior,\" he says.\n\nBut it will take better research to figure out whether neurofeedback can live up to that promise, Rabiner says.\n\n\"There has been a need for some time to have the kind of carefully controlled study that would provide more definitive answers for parents and for the field,\" he says.\n\nAnd that research appears to be on the way.\n\nA team at The Ohio State University has nearly completed a pilot study of neurofeedback for ADHD that was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\nThe team had hoped to announce results last week at a scientific meeting in New York, but Gene Arnold, one of the scientists in charge of the study, says they had to delay that announcement because \"we weren't able to get the results analyzed in time,\" he says.\n\nThe results should be out within a few weeks, Arnold says. In the meantime, he says, the study has shown that it is possible to do neurofeedback research that involves a placebo.\n\nThe study used a video game involving race cars. For kids who got neurofeedback, he says, \"The ability to speed up the car and steer it was contingent on maintaining your brain waves in a more favorable ratio.\"\n\nBut other children got a placebo -- a race car that paid no attention to their brain waves.\n\nUntil a large study comes along using this sort of approach, parents and consumers will have to decide for themselves whether neurofeedback is worth the time and effort. Katherine Ellison says that for her and for her son, it was.\n\n\"What I noticed in my son was not necessarily that he'd stop losing things at school or do his homework better,\" she says. \"The improvement I saw was that he was easier to live with.\"\n\nBut brain training might not be the only reason, Ellison says.

Of those who survive, about 70 percent will be left disabled, making the cardiac event a major cause of adult disability. While there are therapies to help improve patients' mobility, they\u2019re only effective within the first few hours of an event.\n\nRecently, researchers from the Stanford University School of Medicine have made it their mission to improve these outcomes. They hypothesized that injecting stem cells into the brains of chronic stroke patients would increase their survival rates. And in a clinical trial testing the technique, researchers found injections can safely improve patients' motor function.\n\n\u201cWhat surprised us most was the remarkable recovery some patients had,\u201d Dr. Gary Steinberg, professor and chair of neurosurgery at Stanford, told Medical Daily, \u201cWhile we had hoped for that, we didn\u2019t really expect it. Patients recover from strokes over the first six months, and then there\u2019s very little recovery [after that]. You know, they go to rehab and there\u2019s not much more [more] they can recover usually.\u201d\n\nFor the study, Steinberg and his team recruited 18 patients who had suffered their first and only stroke six months to three years prior to the trial. Each patient had a small hole drilled through their skulls in order for researchers to be able to inject stem cells taken from the bone marrow of two donors directly into parts of their brains that were damaged from stroke. After patients were sent home, researchers continued to monitor their health through blood tests, clinical evaluations, and brain imaging.\n\nResults showed that the implanted stem cells didn\u2019t survive very long in the brain, disappearing about one to two months after injections; however, patients still showed significant motor recovery at six and 12 months post-surgery. Some of the patients bound to wheelchairs were even able to walk again.\n\n\u201cThe recovery some patients showed was not just minimal, it was significant,\u201d said Steinberg, who has researched stem cell therapies for more than 15 years. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just someone who couldn\u2019t move their thumb now being able to move their thumb, [it was more profound than that].\"\n\nThe types of stem cells used, called mesenchymal stem cells, can differentiate into a variety of cell types. In other words, they are the precursors to muscle, fat, bone, and tendon tissue. Past research has shown that these cells can be used to treat the effects of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, brain damage caused by loss of oxygen.\n\nIn Steinberg's study, it did not \u201ccause problems by differentiating into unwanted tissues or forming tumors.\u201d And even when the stem cells came from an unrelated donor, the participants did not experience a strong immune reaction. Although more than 75 percent of patients reported suffering headaches afterward, the researchers said it was probably due to the surgical procedure rather than the stem cells themselves. Furthermore, there were no life-threatening effects linked to the procedure used to administer them.\n\nMotor improvement was also independent of the severity of the stroke patients\u2019 conditions\u2014 an important detail considering older adults tend to respond less to treatment, the researchers said.\n\nIn addition to setting the stage for an expanded trial of the procedure, the promising results also change \u201cour notion of what happens after a stroke,\u201d Steinberg explained. The findings suggest that stroke-damaged areas of the brain, once thought to be dead or irreversible, can actually be \u201cresurrected.\u201d\n\nSource: Steinberg G, Kondziolka D, Wechsler L, et al.

In 2013 alone, according to the American Cancer Society, more than 230,000 were given that diagnosis. Each one very likely came as a devastating blow, both to the patient and to her family.\n\nBut what if some of these cases are preventable? What if there was a medication that could at least reduce a woman\u2019s risk of developing breast cancer?\n\nThe Breast Cancer Prevention Trial published results in 1998 indicating that women who took one of those drugs, tamoxifen, were half as likely to develop breast cancer as similar women who did not take the drug.\n\nOther medications, including raloxifene and a class of drugs called aromatese inhibitors, do much the same thing, though the Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved aromatese inhibitors for this use. Studies estimate that more than 2 million American women at high risk for breast cancer could benefit from taking a preventive drug.\n\nBut few women are opting for this protection, which goes by the name chemoprevention. A 2010 study found \u201cexceptionally low\u201d rates of usage.\n\nIn part this may be because many doctors are not even discussing this option with their patients. A small 2014 study in the Journal of Women\u2019s Health found that only 13 percent of internal medicine, family medicine and gynecology physicians reported having recommended or prescribed these medications to women who might benefit from them.\n\nThe \u201clow uptake of these medications is a missed opportunity,\u201d says Heidi Nelson, a professor of medical informatics and clinical epidemiology at the Oregon Health & Science University in Portland. \u201cMany high-risk women . . . could reduce their risks for invasive cancer by approximately 30 to 50 percent.\u201d On the other hand, these drugs don\u2019t suit everyone, and they are not without risks of their own. Because some of the side effects are serious \u2014 such as blood clots in the legs and in the lungs, and, in the case of tamoxifen, uterine cancer \u2014 only women who are deemed to be at high risk for the disease should consider them. But there are conflicting views on who meets that \u201chigh risk\u201d definition\n\nChemoprevention should not be confused with chemotherapy. Although both involve taking drugs, chemoprevention medications are taken with the goal of avoiding breast cancer altogether and the subsequent need for chemotherapy later.\n\nAnd they work on the body differently. Chemotherapy kills off cells, healthy ones as well as cancercous ones. The chemoprevention drugs, by contrast, work by blocking estrogen, a hormone known to promote the growth of cancer cells in breast tissue. Chemoprevention drugs are called SERMs, or selective estrogen receptor modulators, and two have been approved specifically for breast cancer prevention: tamoxifen, which was developed to treat breast cancer after its onset and only later was found to have a preventive benefit, and raloxifene, which was designed to treat osteoporosis.\n\nA 2013 study in the Lancet analyzed data for more than 80,000 women taking tamoxifen or other SERM drugs. The researchers found an overall 38 percent reduction in new cases of breast cancer 10 years after women took these drugs compared with women who took a placebo. The effect was even larger during the first five years of the study.\n\nInvestigators working for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent group of scientists and clinicians funded by the government, echoed these results. After looking at multiple trials of tamoxifen and raloxifene, the task force noted that these drugs reduced new cases of breast cancer significantly: from 23 cases per 1,000 women in the control groups to 16 cases per 1,000 women in the treatment groups.\n\nNelson, one of the lead authors of the analysis, is \u201cconfident\u201d that these results show a true benefit. Others are more cautious.\n\nKenneth Lin, a family physician at Georgetown University who worked on developing the task force\u2019s SERM guidelines, notes that while SERMs may have reduced new cases, they \u201chave not been shown to reduce breast cancer mortality in any study or meta-analysis.\u201d One possible explanation, he says, is that \u201cthese drugs are effective at preventing nonlethal cancers rather than the more serious ones.\u201d\n\nNot used enough?\n\nGiven that these drugs seem to offer some protection, why are they not in widespread use? Serious side effects is one reason. Beyond blood clots and uterine cancer, other known reactions to the drugs include strokes, cataracts, bone pain, hot flashes, nausea and vaginal dryness.\n\nFor some women, the risk of such side effects may be worth taking, depending on their particular odds of developing breast cancer. Those odds can be figured by using a commonly used calculator, often called the Gail model, that estimates a woman\u2019s chances of having breast cancer in a five-year period and over a lifetime.\n\nBut this is where it gets more complicated. While many experts agree that women at high risk should consider the medications, they do not agree on what Gail score should trigger that consideration.\n\nThe studies that served as the basis for the FDA approval of the drugs, along with recently released guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), set the threshold at a five-year Gail score of 1.67 percent.\n\nThe Preventive Services Task Force, however, recommended a threshold of 3 percent. At that point, the panel said, women \u201care likely to have more benefit than harm from using tamoxifen or raloxifene.\u201d\n\nASCO\u2019s lower cutoff worries some experts. \u201cAt the 1.67 percent high-risk threshold,\u201d Georgetown\u2019s Lin says, \u201cevery woman age 62 and older would be [considered] high-risk.\u201d That might lead to a situation in which millions of women would be encouraged, unnecessarily,to consider this therapy, along with its potential harmful effects.\n\nKala Visvanathan, the lead author of the ASCO recommendations and a faculty member at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, said the cutoffs provide only a rough estimate of risk.\n\nIt is important to realize, she adds, that \u201cas the risk increases, the benefits tend to be greater. This is an evolving field, and our goal is to better discern who is at high and low risk of breast cancer and develop a greater range of prevention strategies.\u201d\n\nAn individual risk analysis should prompt conversation between doctor and patient about the potential benefits and the risk of the therapy.\n\nBoth the ASCO and the task force guidelines recommend such a conversation. \u201cThe discussion should include the specific risks and benefits associated with each chemopreventive agent,\u201d according to ASCO.\n\nThe task force similarly recommends that \u201cclinicians engage in a shared, informed decision making\u201d with women and said that clinicians \u201cshould offer to prescribe\u201d these drugs. Many risk factors increase a woman\u2019s chances of having side effects. These factors include older age, obesity, having a history of a blood clot, history of any cancer, immobility, history of certain autoimmune conditions, history of using estrogen or oral contraceptives and history of some form of heart disease.\n\nInsured women with a high risk for breast cancer and a low risk for side effects who try this therapy will not incur out-of-pocket costs, because this treatment was included in the Affordable Care Act as mandated, no-charge preventive care.\n\nSo what should a woman do?\n\nMost important, become familiar with your family history, know your risk factors and discuss them with your primary-care physician. Age and family history cannot be controlled, but lifestyle changes \u2014 including eating a healthful diet, exercising, not smoking and not overconsuming alcohol \u2014 are eminently doable and can reduce your risk. These basic tenets of leading a healthy lifestyle have been shown to be important factors in breast cancer prevention.\n\nVisvanathan and her colleagues are hopeful that more women will be aware of this option.\n\n\u201cA discussion on the use of preventive agents needs to become part of routine care in women at high risk,\u201d she says. \u201cWe should begin to implement preventive strategies based on what we already know.\u201d\n\nMishori is an associate professor of family medicine at the Georgetown University School of Medicine and director of the Health & Media fellowship.

But the jury's still out as to how worthwhile the extra technology is overall.\n\nFor one thing, computer-aided detection (CAD) increases the amount of diagnostic testing among women who turn out not to have breast cancer. And the technology makes mammograms more expensive.\n\nCAD is becoming more widespread, said Dr. Joshua Fenton, an associate professor of family and community medicine at the University of California, Davis, and lead study author. \"It's an add-on and now is used in probably three-quarters of U.S. mammograms,\" he said.\n\nComputer-aided detection systems use a digitized mammogram image from either a traditional film mammogram or a digitally acquired mammogram, according to the American College of Radiology. The CAD software looks for areas that may indicate cancer so the radiologist can then look more closely at the mammogram.\n\nAlthough it has rapidly become part of mammogram screening, Fenton said there is limited and conflicting research on its effect.\n\nUnder Medicare payment rates, doctors get an additional $11 for adding computer-aided detection to a mammogram, said Fenton, citing Medicare data. The Medicare rate for a film mammogram is $81 while a digital mammogram is $139.\n\nHis team evaluated more than 409,000 mammograms -- with and without computer-aided detection -- from more than 163,000 women aged 67 to 89. The study is published in the April 16 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nFenton took data from a large U.S. epidemiology database from 2001 to 2006. During that time, computer-aided detection use increased from 3.6 percent to 60.5 percent. Now, with about 75 percent of mammograms adding it, it is even more common, Fenton said.\n\n\"In our study, we assessed its impact in the Medicare program,\" he said. The researchers compared the results when mammograms included CAD to when they did not.\n\nWhen computer-aided detection was used, doctors found a greater number of early cancers known as ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS. \"But the [overall] rate of invasive breast cancer diagnosis was no different with or without CAD,\" Fenton said.\n\nHowever, among the women who did have invasive cancer, computer-aided detection was linked with a greater likelihood of finding the cancer while it was stage 1 or 2 compared to stage 3 or 4, they found.\n\n\"CAD was also associated with increased diagnostic testing among women who turned out not to have breast cancer,\" he said. These women, because breast cancer was suspected, had to be called back for additional tests, such as repeat mammograms or biopsies.\n\nSo is the new computer technology worth it? \"Our study doesn't answer that question; it raises that question,\" Fenton said. The findings, he said, are a mix of potential good news and not so good. The additional tests that turn out to be unnecessary, because no cancer is found, are not desirable, he said.\n\nSome of the very early cancers diagnosed in older women, he noted, may not have caused them a problem during their lifetime. But doctors can't say with certainty which ones will progress and which ones will not.\n\n\"Women should recognize that CAD comes with some potential risks,\" Fenton said. \"It has the potential risk of a false-positive mammogram. If you are an older woman, [there is] the risk of overtreatment of noninvasive lesions.\"\n\nDr. Daniel Kopans, a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School and senior radiologist in the breast imaging division at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the study provides additional information to doctors and women, but has some limitations. He was not involved with the study.\n\n\"The good news is the use of CAD was related to finding invasive cancers at smaller sizes and earlier stages than before the CAD era,\" said Kopans, also a member of the American College of Radiology's Breast Imaging Commission. \"There should be no argument that finding invasive cancers at a smaller size and earlier stage is beneficial,\" he said, as they are more likely to be cured.\n\nWhile he calls finding more DCIS with computer-aided detection also ''likely a good thing,\" he acknowledged the debate about the possibility that a very early cancer in an elderly woman may not cause a problem in her lifetime. Although the treatment of DCIS is debated among experts, Kopans said, \"In my mind, it is always worth it to find additional cancers.\"\n\nOne limitation of the study, he said, is that the researchers cannot say for sure it was the computer-aided detection that made the difference. Other factors could have played a role, such as the radiologists becoming more experienced, he said.\n\nTo learn more about mammography, visit the American College of Radiology/Radiological Society of North America.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story pointed out that CAD use did increase the likelihood that a woman\u2019s cancer would be diagnosed at an earlier stage. \u00a0Readers should also have been told that the study found the increased association between using CAD & an earlier stage of cancer diagnosis may be stronger among women older than 75.\nThe endorsement of the use of CAD & minimization of its problems by Dr. Daniel Kopans, should have been balanced by comments from another expert not connected with the study.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A study from Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, shines more light on the link between consumption of fish and better long-term neurological health\n\nA new study from Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, shines more light on the link between consumption of fish and better long-term neurological health.

Now, new research from Chalmers has shown that the protein parvalbumin, which is very common in many fish species, may be contributing to this effect.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Parkinson's disease is amyloid formation of a particular human protein, called alpha-synuclein. Alpha-synuclein is even sometimes referred to as the 'Parkinson's protein'.\n\nWhat the Chalmers researchers have now discovered, is that parvalbumin can form amyloid structures that bind together with the alpha-synuclein protein. Parvalbumin effectively 'scavenges' the alpha-synuclein proteins, using them for its own purposes, thus preventing them from forming their own potentially harmful amyloids later on.\n\n\"Parvalbumin collects up the 'Parkinson's protein' and actually prevents it from aggregating, simply by aggregating itself first,\" explains Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede, Professor and Head of the Chemical Biology division at Chalmers, and lead author on the study.\n\nWith the parvalbumin protein so highly abundant in certain fish species, increasing the amount of fish in our diet might be a simple way to fight off Parkinson's disease. Herring, cod, carp, and redfish, including sockeye salmon and red snapper, have particularly high levels of parvalbumin, but it is common in many other fish species too. The levels of parvalbumin can also vary greatly throughout the year.\n\n\"Fish is normally a lot more nutritious at the end of the summer, because of increased metabolic activity. Levels of parvalbumin are much higher in fish after they have had a lot of sun, so it could be worthwhile increasing consumption during autumn,\" says Nathalie Scheers, Assistant Professor in the Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, and researcher on the study. It was Nathalie who first had the inspiration to investigate parvalbumin more closely, after a previous study she did looking at biomarkers for fish consumption.\n\nOther neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, ALS and Huntington's disease, are also caused by certain amyloid structures interfering in the brain. The team is therefore keen to research this topic further, to see if the discovery relating to Parkinson's disease could have implications for other neurodegenerative disorders as well. Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede stresses the importance of finding ways to combat these neurological conditions in the future:\n\n\"These diseases come with age, and people are living longer and longer. There's going to be an explosion of these diseases in the future - and the scary part is that we currently have no cures. So we need to follow up on anything that looks promising.\"\n\nA follow up study, looking at parvalbumin from another angle, is indeed planned for this autumn. Nathalie Scheers, together with Professor Ingrid Undeland, also of Chalmers, will investigate parvalbumin from herring, and its transport in human tissues.\n\n\"It will be very interesting to study how parvalbumin distributes within human tissues in more depth. There could be some really exciting results.\"\n\nMore About: Fish and Better Neurological Health\n\nThe link between higher consumption of fish and better long-term health for the brain has been long established. There is correlation between certain diets and decreased rates of Parkinson's disease - as well as other neurodegenerative conditions.\n\n\"Among those who follow a Mediterranean diet, with more fish, one sees lower rates of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's,\" says Tony Werner, a PhD student in the Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, and lead researcher on the study. This has also been observed in Japan, where seafood forms a central part of the diet. The team is careful to note that no definite links can be established at this point, however.\n\nMore About: Amyloids and Aggregation\n\nProteins are long chains of amino acids that fold into specific structures to carry out their function. But sometimes, proteins can fold incorrectly, and get tangled up with other proteins, a process known as aggregation. As these misfolded proteins aggregate together, they create long fibrous structures known as amyloids. Amyloids are not necessarily a bad thing, but can be responsible for various diseases. Some of them can interfere with neurons in the brain, killing those cells, and causing a variety of neurodegenerative conditions.\n\nMore About: The Study\n\nNathalie Scheers had looked at parvalbumin before in another context.\n\n\"I was on a previous study where we looked at possible compliance markers for fish intake. Parvalbumin is a cause of fish allergies, so we knew that it passed over to the blood, and that this form of parvalbumin is specific for fish\"\n\nShe joined forces with Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede, and together they took the idea forward.\n\n\"Because Nathalie had previously shown that parvalbumin passes into the body of the person eating fish, it made sense to study its interaction with human proteins. We already knew that they can meet in the gut, the blood, or the brain,\" explains Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede.", "question": "Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The release doesn\u2019t include any numbers to help put the benefits claimed in context.

The ideal study would randomly assign women to have mammograms or not. But, cancer experts said, no one would do such a study today when mammograms are generally agreed to prevent breast cancer deaths. In the study, which is continuing, women were followed for a maximum of 8.9 years. It is possible that benefits may emerge later.\n\nNonetheless, the new study is \u201cvery credible,\u201d said Dr. Barnett Kramer, associate director for disease prevention at the .\n\n\u201cThis is the first time researchers used real populations to compare the effects of treatment and mammography in the modern era of treatment,\u201d Dr. Kramer said. \u201cIt shows the relative impacts of screening versus therapy in an era in which therapy has been improving.\u201d\n\nDr. Otis Brawley of the said in a statement that the investigators used \u201ccareful methodology.\u201d The society, Dr. Brawley said, \u201cbelieves that the total body of the science supports the fact that regular mammography is an important part of a woman\u2019s .\u201d\n\nDr. Carol Lee, a radiologist at and chairwoman of the breast imaging commission of the American College of Radiology, said the new study affirmed that mammography saves lives.\n\n\u201cMortality from breast cancer is decreasing, and I have to believe that screening mammography has played a part,\u201d Dr. Lee said.\n\nIn their study, the investigators analyzed data from all 40,075 Norwegian women who had received a diagnosis of breast cancer from 1986 to 2005, a time when treatment was changing markedly.\n\nIn that period, 4,791 women died. And, starting in 1996, Norway began offering mammograms to women ages 50 to 69 and assigning multidisciplinary treatment teams to all women with breast cancer, similar to the teams at many major medical centers in the . The question was, Did the program of mammograms and optimal new treatment with coordinated teams of surgeons, pathologists, oncologists, radiologists and nurses lower the breast cancer death rate?\n\nThe investigators found that women 50 to 69 who had mammograms and were treated by the special teams had a 10 percent lower breast cancer death rate than similar women who had had neither.\n\nThey also found, though, that the death rate fell by 8 percent in women over 70 who had the new treatment teams but had not been invited to have mammograms. And Dr. Kramer said he knew of no evidence that breast cancer was more easily treated in women over 70 than in women ages 50 to 69.\n\nThat means, Dr. H. Gilbert Welch of Dartmouth wrote in an additional analysis in an accompanying editorial, that mammography could have reduced the breast cancer death rate by as little as 2 percent, an amount so small that it is not really different from zero.\n\nTwo percent is an estimate, Dr. Welch said. But, he said, whatever the effect of mammograms is, \u201call the signals here are that it is much smaller than we believed.\u201d\n\nDr. Laura Esserman, a professor of surgery and radiology at the in , said it tells her that \u201cif you get the same treatment and the outcome is the same if you find it earlier or later, then you don\u2019t make a difference when you find it early.\u201d\n\nAnd screening has a cost, Dr. Welch said. Screening 2,500 50-year-olds for a decade would identify 1,000 women with at least one suspicious mammogram resulting in follow-up tests. Five hundred would have biopsies. And 5 to 15 of those women would be treated for cancers that, if left alone, would have grown so slowly they would never have been noticed.\n\nWhen the study was planned, the scientists expected that screening would be even more effective than it was in studies from decades ago. After all, mammography had improved and, in Norway, each mammogram was independently read by two radiologists, which should make it less likely that cancers would be missed. The researchers expected mammograms to reduce the breast cancer death rate by a third.\n\n\u201cWe were surprised,\u201d said Dr. Mette Kalager, the lead author of the paper who is a breast surgeon at University and a visiting scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health.\n\nMarvin Zelen, a statistician at the Harvard School of Public Health and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who was a member of the research team said even though the mammography benefit is small, if he were a woman he would get screened.\n\n\u201cIt all depends on how you approach risk,\u201d Dr. Zelen said. His approach, he says, is \u201cminimax\u201d \u2014 he wants to minimize the maximum risk \u2014 which, in this case, is dying of a cancer.\n\nDr. Kalager came to the opposite conclusion. She worries about the small chance of benefit in light of the larger chance of finding and treating a cancer that did not need to be treated.\n\n\u201cSince I\u2019m a breast cancer surgeon, I know what being treated is like,\u201d she says. The decision to be screened, she says, \u201cis a matter of personal preference. Is it worth it to risk becoming a patient without it being necessary?\u201d\n\nMany women may still want mammograms, she says, and that is fine.\n\n\u201cI think we have to respect what women want to do.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "\n\n\nThis story uses several different statistics and expert perspectives to explain what the researchers found in their examination of the effects of mammography screening.

Skipping the diagnostic nerve blocks can save $10,000 in medical costs.\n\nThe results appear in the August issue of Anesthesiology.\n\nBecause the diagnosis of pain can be imprecise, doctors often order multiple tests before treatment. In doing so, they may weed out patients who would actually benefit from treatment, according to the study.

The American Chronic Pain Association for example says that a block test determines who should get radiofrequency treatment.\n\nCohen, who serves as a colonel in the U.S. Army Reserves, tell us he's seen immediate treatment work on soldiers, who need to quickly return to their posts, so there's no reason why skipping straight to radiofrequency treatment shouldn't also work on civilian patients.\n\nDoctors may not change their approach anytime soon, however.

At a week old, doctors amputated his dead forearm and hand. They were afraid his body would be become infected and he would die. Falardeau mourned her boy's missing arm for years but, in time, embraced her son as he was.\n\nWyatt also learned to adapt. They tried a couple of prosthetics when he was younger and each time the toddler abandoned the false limb within months.\n\n\"His main interest was to create a shocking response from onlookers by pulling it off in the grocery store,\" Falardeau wrote on CNN iReport . In truth, she had been more concerned about getting him therapy for his autism-related delays -- the limb difference was secondary.\n\nSo when a friend shared a story from the \"Today Show\" with Wyatt in mind, about a team of University of Central Florida (UCF) students and graduates that made an electronic arm for 6-year-old Pring using a three-dimensional printer on campus, Falardeau was defensive.\n\n\"He doesn't need this,\" she thought.\n\nHer fifth-grader had a different reaction: \"I want one of these robot arms!\" Falardeau remembers Wyatt telling her and her husband. \"I could ride a bike! I might even be able to paddle a kayak!\"\n\nThere were other things the 12-year-old boy said he would do if he had two hands. A proper somersault. Clap with two hands. Dance with a pretty girl with one hand on her back and the other leading.

The organization creates and shares bionic arm designs for free download at EnablingTheFuture.org that can be assembled for as little as $20 to $50. Middle and high school student groups and Girl and Boy Scout troops are among those donating their time and materials to assemble limbs for kids and give them to recipients for free.\n\n\"It's really just a step-by-step process of solving problems. The first problem we solved was: how do we make the hand move electronically? And then: how do we attach this arm to a child?\" said sophomore Tyler Petresky. \"It's just one problem after another we keep solving. That's what engineering is all about.\"\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about 1,500 babies in the United States are born with upper limb deformities each year.

He got involved with E-Nable and met Alex, a local boy teased because of his missing arm, and set about designing a robotic replacement. They gave it to Alex for free.\n\nEach electronic limb takes about 30 to 50 hours to make and assemble. The students use the printer in the school's manufacturing lab and cover the cost of materials -- about $350 -- through donations.\n\nPetresky got involved with the design of Pring's hand because Manero knew he was good with electronics.\n\n\"He bribed me with some pulled pork sandwiches. I went over to his house and helped him out with electronics,\" he said. \"I found out he was working on an arm, and I thought that was the coolest thing in the world.\"\n\nEventually Manero moved to Germany for a Fulbright scholarship and left Petresky in charge of running the operations in Orlando.\n\nPetresky says they ask every family about the child's favorite color, superhero and interests, so the new limb can \"not just be a piece of plastic ... but be a part of them.\"\n\nAs they've designed the bionics, they've learned that kids don't necessarily want to blend in. Children have requested colorful designs inspired by superheroes, Disney's \"Frozen,\" and in Wyatt's case, the blue-skinned men from \"Blue Man Group.\" For Christmas, the group upgraded Alex's plain vanilla white arm to a new one resembling Optimus Prime from \"Transformers.\"\n\n\"We quickly found out this is much less about fitting in and feeling normal, and much more about expressing yourself,\" Petresky said. \"There's a large aspect of being artistic and being creative.\"\n\nThe team has made electronic arms for five children and are working with three more kids including Wyatt.

So it's routine for patients to take clot-preventing drugs for some time afterward.\n\nSome doctors choose powerful anti-clotting drugs like heparin (Lovenox) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto), but it hasn't been clear whether these expensive prescription drugs work any better than cheap, readily available aspirin.\n\n\"Aspirin alone may provide similar protection compared to anticoagulation treatments,\" says Brian R. Hallstrom, M.D., an orthopaedic surgeon and associate chair for quality and safety at the University of Michigan Department of Orthopaedic Surgery.\n\nHallstrom is the lead author of a new study published in JAMA Surgery that found few patients developed a blood clot after surgery, and those patients on aspirin fared just as well as those on anticoagulants.\n\nDuring the two-year study period from 2013 to 2015, aspirin use rose from 10 percent to 50 percent among the patients cared for by orthopaedic surgeons in the Michigan Arthroplasty Registry Collaborative Quality Initiative, a statewide effort to give patients the best possible recovery and outcomes after hip and knee replacements.\n\nSince then, the shift has become even more distinct: Aspirin prescribing has risen to 70 percent among Michigan surgeons, says Hallstrom, who is co-director of the initiative and a health services researcher at U-M's Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation.\n\nBased on the experience of 41,537 Michigan patients undergoing knee replacement, the study may further the debate about the routine use of aspirin for clot prevention.\n\nA recent Canadian study looked at the issue, but the analysis had a caveat: Each of the more than 3,400 clinical trial patients received rivaroxaban the first five days after surgery. After that, they continued with the drug or switched to aspirin.\n\nThe new U-M study suggests patients may be adequately protected if they take aspirin alone from day one.\n\n\"This study is truly a real-world experience of what happened in Michigan when the majority of surgeons switched to aspirin,\" Hallstrom says. \"The incidence of blood clots, pulmonary embolus and death did not increase despite this dramatic change in practice.\"\n\nOver the past decade, surgeons have turned away from powerful anticoagulants and toward aspirin used in addition to nondrug improvements such as compression devices for thwarting clots.\n\nThese days, most patients have a generally low risk of blood clots after knee replacement for a number of reasons. Those reasons include shorter surgical times, less invasive procedures and use of regional anesthesia that allows early mobilization after surgery, Hallstrom says. Some patients are even going home the same day.\n\n\"The most important way to prevent blood clots is getting moving,\" says Hallstrom, noting that people are at risk for blood clots when they sit or lie in one position for too long, such as on an airplane or a hospital bed.\n\nThe critical care specialists who make up the American College of Chest Physicians favor heparin to reduce the risk of blood clots, while the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guidelines state that no one drug is better than another for preventing clots.\n\nThe U-M study involved patients undergoing knee replacement surgery at any of the 29 Michigan hospitals in the surgical quality group. One-third of the patients took aspirin alone; 54 percent took only an anticoagulant; and 13 percent took an aspirin/anticoagulant combination.\n\nOver three months, just 1.16 percent of aspirin patients developed a serious blood clot. That was true for 1.42 percent of anticoagulant patients, according to the Michigan study. This was not statistically different.\n\nSo, neither drug appeared better than the other -- but aspirin has some obvious advantages.\n\n\"Aspirin is easy to take and much less expensive,\" Hallstrom says. \"Patients can get it over the counter for pennies, while the other anticoagulants require monitoring, injections, frequent dose adjustments and are extremely expensive.\"\n\nThe reported cost for a 30-day supply of rivaroxaban is approximately $379 to $450; heparin is estimated at $450 to $890. Although warfarin costs a few dollars for a 30-day supply, its cost approaches that of the other anticoagulants when doctor visits for monitoring are factored in, Hallstrom says.\n\nThe study suggests most patients can have just aspirin without increasing the risk for venous thromboembolism, but doctors need to consider factors such as a patient's history of clots, obesity and ability to mobilize after surgery when determining the best measure for clot prevention, Hallstrom adds.", "question": "Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The release lists the percentages of patients who had a blood clot within three months of their knee replacement and emphasized that there was no statistical difference between those who took only aspirin and those who took anticoagulants.\u00a0 However, the release is remiss in not\u00a0pointing out that the majority of patients were also treated with pneumatic compression boots.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A new study from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden shows that short-course preoperative radiotherapy combined with delayed surgery reduces the adverse side-effects of rectal cancer surgery without compromising its efficacy.

Preoperative radiotherapy was gradually introduced in the early 1990s, with a consequent improvement in prognosis for people with rectal cancer and reduction in the risk of local recurrence.\n\n\"Back then we showed that preoperative radiotherapy reduces the risk of local recurrence by over 50 per cent for patients with rectal cancer,\" says principal investigator Anna Martling, senior consultant surgeon and professor at Karolinska Institutet's Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery. \"Thanks to our results, radiotherapy is recommended to many rectal cancer patients.\"\n\nHowever, radiotherapy can cause adverse reactions and the optimal radiotherapeutic method and the interval between it and the ensuing surgery have been mooted.

More Americans kill themselves than die from breast cancer.\n\nAs Dr.Thomas Insel, longtime head of the National Institute of Mental Health, prepared to step down from his job in October, he cited the lack of progress in reducing the number of suicides as his biggest disappointment. While the homicide rate in the U.S. has dropped 50 percent since the early 1990s, the suicide rate is higher than it was a decade ago.\n\n\"That to me is unacceptable,\" Insel says.\n\nIt hasn't been for lack of trying. The U.S. has a national suicide hotline, and there are suicide prevention programs in every state. There's screening, educational programs, and midnight walks to raise awareness. Yet over the past decade or so, the national suicide rate has increased. In 2003, the suicide rate was 10.8 per 100,000 people. In 2013, it was 12.6.\n\nAn effort that began in Detroit in 2001 to treat the most common cause of suicide \u2014 depression \u2014 is offering hope. With a relentless focus on finding and treating people with depression, the Henry Ford Health System has cut the suicide rate among the people in its insurance plan dramatically. The story of the health system's success is a story of persistence, confidence, hope and a strict adherence to a very specific approach.\n\nThat approach saved the life of a woman who prefers to be known only by her first name, Lynn. She agreed to share her medical history on the condition that we not use her full name to protect her privacy.\n\nLynn, who's now in her mid-50s, has had bipolar disorder, also known as manic-depressive illness, for nearly 30 years. The depressive part of her illness \"is like the pain of having a cancer,\" she says. About 15 years ago, she started getting irresistible urges to take her own life and she started making serious attempts \u2014 at times almost monthly.\n\n\"When I was in the depths of depression, I was being pulled and sucked into this black tunnel,\" she says. \"I was desperately trying to grab onto something to stop from being sucked in.\" Sometimes she couldn't find anything to hang on to. \"Those are the times when I finally let go and attempted suicide,\" she says.\n\nThe program that saved Lynn almost didn't get off the ground.\n\nFifteen years ago, suicide prevention care at Henry Ford, like in many places, was mostly reactive. When patients came in talking about suicide, health providers took notice. But little was done to find people before they reached that point.\n\nSome of the health providers in the psychiatric division decided they could do better. So they applied to a foundation for a grant to provide something they called \"perfect depression care\" for the 200,000 patients in the health system. The goal: zero suicides.\n\nThe mental health division failed to win the grant, but the health system went ahead with the proposed changes anyway.\n\nThe plan it developed is intensive and thorough, an almost cookbook approach. Primary care doctors screen every patient with two questions: How often have you felt down in the past two weeks? And how often have you felt little pleasure in doing things? A high score leads to more questions about sleep disturbances, changes in appetite, thoughts of hurting oneself. All patients are questioned on every visit.\n\nIf the health providers recognize a mental health problem, patients are assigned to appropriate care \u2014 cognitive behavioral therapy, drugs, group counseling, or hospitalization if necessary. On each patient's medical record, providers have to attest to having done the screening, and they record plans for any needed care.\n\nTherapists involve patients' families, and ask them to remove guns or other means of suicide from their homes. Clerks are trained to make sure that patients who need followup care don't leave without an appointment. Patients themselves come up with \"safety plans.\"\n\nLynn has two copies, one by her nightstand and one in her kitchen. Each lists things she can do when she feels depression coming on. She could sit on her balcony, or do some drawing or painting. The list includes her therapists' phone numbers. And there's a reminder that the feeling will pass \u2014 it has before.\n\nBefore the zero suicide plan went into effect, says psychiatrist Doree Ann Espiritu, acting head of the zero suicide program at Henry Ford, you might make a contract with a patient where the patient agrees not to commit suicide. Studies show it doesn't work very well, she says.\n\nToday, providers are trained to be comfortable asking their patients about suicidal thoughts. \"There is a fear among clinicians that if you ask questions about suicide, you are giving the patient an idea that this could be an option,\" says Espiritu, \"and if you ask about guns or pills, that you are giving them some hints on how they can carry out a plan.\" The Henry Ford therapists are trained to break that barrier.\n\nFor Lynn, the key was persistence \u2014 her therapists', and her own. \"I recall one time with my psychiatrist, who kept trying to encourage me and help me find ways of coping, and I can remember saying, 'I don't believe there's hope, I don't see it, I don't feel it, I need you to hold on to that for me because it's not there,' \" she recalls.\n\nHer therapists never gave up. \"There is no question that the message I got from Day 1 is that they knew they could help me, and they would help me,\" Lynn says. Over the years she's been in group therapy, day treatment, and, when things got bad, the emergency room.\n\nThe Henry Ford approach is catching on. A stream of visitors from U.S. health insurers and from the United Kingdom have made site visits. The Suicide Prevention Resource Center has run two zero suicide training academies for teams from health care systems based on the Henry Ford principles. Other health systems have adapted the plan, including Group Health Cooperative in Seattle and the behavioral health provider Centerstone in Tennessee.\n\nEspiritu started work at Henry Ford just as the program was starting, and she remembers the initial staff meetings: \"There was a lot of, 'How can you do this? How can you aim for zero? How can you expect your clinicians to be perfect and follow this protocol?' \" Some people didn't think it could be done, she says, or even attempted.\n\nStill, the health system went ahead, and the rewards were nearly immediate. Henry Ford epidemiologist Brian Ahmedani studies the numbers. In 2009, for those being actively treated for a mental health problem or substance abuse, \"we had a rate of zero per hundred thousand,\" he says. It's crept up to 20 per 100,000 per year, but that's still 80 percent lower than it was when the program began. The rate is five per 100,000 in the organization's general population, which is well below the national average and has remained steady despite an increasing rate of suicide statewide.\n\nThere's reason to think a full-bore effort to treat depression could reduce health costs, because untreated depression is associated with higher medical bills for chronic illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension. But there are training costs involved, and the Henry Ford system has had to keep its staffing up to be able to provide care for people who need it.\n\nOfficials at Henry Ford say they haven't analyzed the costs. But Centerstone has. The behavioral health provider in Nashville implemented the Henry Ford approach for nearly 200 patients who'd already made a suicide attempt. Reductions in emergency room visits and hospitalizations over the course of a year resulted in savings of more than $400,000.\n\nWhy push for zero, rather than just a reduction? \"Because if you say we're OK with five a year, one of those might be your brother or your friend,\" says Espiritu. \"We aim for zero because it reminds all of us of what we would want for ourselves.\" Maybe it is not possible, she says. But it is a goal.\n\nAnd as for Lynn, she doesn't consider herself cured. She says with the treatment she's received at Henry Ford, she's learned to live, even thrive, with bipolar disease. And she's alive.

The studies simultaneously were published by the New England Journal of Medicine on a day that some experts called the \u201cSuper Bowl of lung cancer immunotherapy.\u201d\n\nThe reports underscore the increasingly important first-line role that immunotherapy, which unleashes the immune system to destroy cancer cells, is taking against the deadliest cancer.\n\n\u201cImmunotherapy is rapidly, in combination with other treatments and on its own, dramatically changing the standard of care for lung cancer,\u201d said Leena Gandhi, an oncologist at NYU Langone Health who led the study on the immunotherapy-chemotherapy combination, called Keynote-189. \u201cInstead of chemo being the backbone on which to improve, immunotherapy is now the backbone on which we build.\u201d\n\nLung cancer is the second-most-common malignancy in the United States, after breast cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates that 234,000 people will be diagnosed with the disease this year, and 154,050 will die of it.\n\nMost patients diagnosed with advanced lung cancer \u2014 disease that has spread beyond its original site \u2014 initially receive chemotherapy, which provides only marginal benefit. But the disease is so lethal that many patients don\u2019t survive long enough to try second- or third-line treatments, so researchers are trying to develop and use more effective approaches earlier.\n\nThe trial that grabbed much of the spotlight Monday is a randomized effectiveness study that involved more than 600 untreated patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer \u2014 a common type of the disease. The patients did not have cancer-causing mutations. One group was treated only with chemo, while the other got an immunotherapy drug called Keytruda plus chemo. Some of the results had been released previously, but not specific details.\n\nAfter a median follow-up time of 10.5 months, Gandhi said, the patients in the combination group were 51 percent less likely to die, compared with patients in the chemo-only arm.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, adding another drug has significantly impacted the long-term outlook for those patients,\u201d she said.\n\nScientists who weren't involved in the study agreed that it was highly significant. H. Jack West, an oncologist at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle, said, \u201cIt is literally practice-changing \u2014 immediately.\u201d\n\nRoy Herbst, an oncologist at Yale Cancer Center said that most lung cancer patients now will be offered immunotherapy in some form much earlier than before. Still, he said, the approach was not a cure and there is a lot of room for improvement. The estimated proportion of patients in the combination therapy group who were alive and whose disease had not gotten worse at a year was about 34 percent, about double the proportion for the chemo-only group.\n\nLast May, the Food and Drug Administration approved the Keytruda-chemo combination based on an early-stage trial. But many doctors did not adopt it because the trial was small and didn\u2019t initially show a survival benefit, Gandhi said.\n\nExperts said it was especially significant that the study showed that patients benefited from the Keytruda-chemo combination regardless of the levels of a protein, called PD-L1, found on their cancer cells. Researchers already had known that patients with high levels of the protein were more likely to respond to immunotherapy.\n\nLast week, in a related development, Merck, which makes Keytruda, reported that a different trial showed that the medication prolonged survival even when used alone, compared with chemo. Experts said they will have to see more details before they can determine whether the medication is better used alone or with chemo.\n\nIn a second study published Monday, researchers used two other immunotherapy medications \u2014 Opdivo and Yervoy, both made by Bristol-Myers Squibb \u2014 to treat newly diagnosed patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with a high number of mutations in their tumors.\n\nThe patients experienced a significantly longer period during which their disease did not worsen, compared with people who received only chemotherapy, said Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center oncologist Matthew Hellmann, who led the study.\n\nHe said the results established the double-immunotherapy combination as a first-line treatment for patients with a high \u201ctumor mutational burden,\u201d but that it was too early to know whether the treatment leads to longer survival. And he said the trial showed that \u201ctumor mutational burden\u201d is a reliable way to predict who will benefit from the medications.\n\nAnother study published Monday used immunotherapy in a different way \u2014 for patients with early-stage lung cancer. Researchers at Johns Hopkins and Memorial Sloan Kettering gave patients two doses of Opdivo \u2014 the first a month before surgery, the second two weeks before the operation \u2014 to try to stimulate anti-tumor activity and reduce the risk of relapse.\n\nNine of the 20 patients who got Opdivo had a \u201cmajor pathologic response\u201d \u2014 a sharp reduction in the number of cancer cells found in the tumors removed by surgery.\n\nDrew Pardoll, director of Hopkins\u2019 Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, said that it is too early to know whether the findings will translate into longer survival. But if future studies show that, he added, then immunotherapy might be used to augment or even replace chemo typically given before surgery.\n\nImmunotherapy moves to the front lines in fight against lung cancer\n\nThe cancer death rate has dropped again.

Under previous therapies, none had shown progress.\n\nThis success, in a small study designed as a pilot to test the safety of the technique, suggests larger trials will confirm the effectiveness of the deep brain stimulation (DBS) device, the researchers wrote in the medical journal The Lancet.\n\nAnorexia has one of the highest mortality rates of any psychiatric disorder and is among the most common psychiatric disorders in girls aged between 15 and 19 years. Symptoms include deliberate weight loss induced and sustained by the patient, and a need to control calorie intake and output.\n\nTreatment usually focuses on changing behaviour, but experts say up to 20 percent of patients get no benefit from such treatments and are at risk of dying prematurely.\n\nCommenting on the results of this small trial, Janet Treasure and Ulrike Schmidt of King\u2019s College London\u2019s Institute of Psychiatry said the technique looked promising and would give hope to patients with especially pernicious forms of anorexia.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the procedure was associated ... with improvements in affective and obsessional symptoms is of key importance,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201c(This) will go some way towards reassuring patients that DBS is not just another treatment designed to fatten them up without making them feel better.\u201d\n\nDBS is used to treat several neurological illnesses including Parkinson\u2019s disease and chronic pain. Scientists are also investigating its use in depression and epilepsy, but this was the first time it had been used in patients with anorexia.\n\nImplanting the DBS device requires minimally invasive surgery which can be completely reversed if problems occur, the researchers said.\n\nFor their study, a team at the Krembil Neuroscience Centre and University Health Network in Canada identified an area of the brain known to be important when using DBS in depression.\n\nThey implanted electrodes into the area and connected them to a pulse generator under the skin. The devices were activated 10 days later and researchers measured changes in the patients\u2019 mood and anxiety to help find the correct level of stimulation.\n\nThe patients, all women, were aged between 24 and 57 and had had anorexia for between four and 37 years.\n\nInitially all six lost weight, but researchers said this was expected since studies of DBS in patients with depression also found a delay of a few months before treatment starts to work.\n\nThree months after treatment, the weight loss began to reverse in some patients, and after nine months, three patients weighed more than before treatment - the longest period of sustained weight increase since they had become ill. Around half also had better moods and less obsessive-compulsive behaviour.\n\nAndres Lozano, who led the study, said the results were encouraging because they pointed to a genuine therapeutic effect, rather than a placebo or hunger-increasing effect.\n\nHe also said the improvements in mood and anxiety even in patients who were still underweight were \u201cespecially striking\u201d given that severely anorexic patients did not respond well to conventional medicines or psychotherapies.

The medication is not available yet, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is reviewing it for possible approval, the researchers said.\n\nIn the United States, about 10 percent of people say they have chronic insomnia, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are sleep aids on the market, but they do not work for everyone and they can have side effects that include sleepwalking, daytime drowsiness and confusion.\n\nSuvorexant works differently from those drugs, zeroing in on specific brain chemicals involved in the ability to sleep, explained study author Dr. William Herring, executive director of clinical research at Merck.\n\nThe study, published online Nov. 28 and in the Dec. 4 print issue of the journal Neurology, included 254 healthy adults with primary insomnia, which means it wasn't caused by an underlying physical or mental health problem.\n\nAll of the patients spent four weeks on one of four doses of suvorexant and another four weeks on placebo pills. They had their sleep monitored in a sleep lab on their first night with each treatment, and then came back again after four weeks.\n\nOverall, Herring's team found, people slept better with the drug, although the improvement was not dramatic.\n\nAt the outset, when patients spent eight hours in bed, they were typically asleep for 66 percent of that time. One day on suvorexant boosted that by anywhere from 5 percent to 13 percent, relative to the placebo. Between 21 and 37 fewer minutes were spent awake during those sleep periods.\n\nThere was still a benefit four weeks later. One expert pointed out, however, that the benefit was small.\n\n\"The amount of additional sleep was not tremendous,\" said Dr. Carl Bazil, director of the division of epilepsy and sleep at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center.\n\nThe effect was essentially comparable to what has been seen with other sleep medications, said Bazil, who was not involved in the research.\n\nBut, he said, suvorexant is seen as a potentially important development in the world of sleep medicine, because the drug blocks specific brain chemicals called orexins, which help keep people awake. Standard sleep medications work more widely throughout the brain, Bazil explained, which is why they can have a host of side effects.\n\n\"The way [suvorexant] works makes a lot of sense,\" Bazil said. \"The hope is that it will help some people who haven't responded to [other drugs], and have fewer side effects.\"\n\nIt's promising news, Bazil added, that there were no serious side effects in this study.\n\nThe most common side effects were sleepiness (reported by about 10 percent of patients on the two higher doses of suvorexant), headache (reported by about 5 percent), dizziness and abnormal dreams (5 percent).\n\nThere are still many questions, including whether the drug would benefit people with insomnia due to a health condition, which doctors call secondary insomnia.\n\nThe study also excluded adults aged 65 or older -- an age group commonly affected by insomnia. But, Herring said, seniors were part of a larger, 12-month trial, and Merck has submitted those results to the FDA.\n\nAnother sleep specialist said the findings show \"some potential benefit\" from suvorexant, but he cautioned insomnia sufferers against relying completely on any drug.\n\n\"Medication can be important,\" said Dr. William Kohler, who directs the Florida Sleep Institute in Spring Hill. \"But in the long run, the best methods for treating insomnia are behavioral techniques.\"\n\nKohler said cognitive behavioral therapy -- where people learn to change the thoughts and habits that affect their sleep quality -- is a proven way to manage insomnia. For most people, he said, medication should be a temporary treatment; behavior change is the long-term fix.\n\nBazil agreed: \"I look at most people with insomnia as someone who developed bad sleep habits.\"\n\nA drug, ideally used for a short time, may help encourage sleep and get people on the right track, Bazil said. \"But those bad sleep habits -- you've got to address them too,\" he added.\n\n\"The problem,\" Kohler noted, \"is that we don't want to make behavior changes. We want to pop a pill.\"\n\nLearn more about insomnia and good sleep habits from the National Sleep Foundation.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The following paragraph is a confusing, convoluted presentation of numbers:\n\u201cAt the outset, when patients spent eight hours in bed, they were typically asleep for 66 percent of that time.

However, few clinical trials have studied the supplement's effects.\n\nEmily Tarleton, MS, RD, CD, a graduate student in Clinical and Translational Science and the bionutrition research manager in the University of Vermont's Clinical Research Center, and colleagues conducted a clinical trial of over-the-counter oral magnesium tablets for mild-to-moderate depression. Their results showed that magnesium is safe and effective and comparable to prescription SSRI treatments in effectiveness.\n\nThe researchers at the University of Vermont's Larner College of Medicine conducted an open-label, blocked, randomized cross-over trial involving 126 adults in outpatient primary care clinics. The study participants, who were currently experiencing mild-to-moderate depression, had a mean age of 52, with 38 percent of them male. Participants in the active arm of the study received 248 milligrams of elemental magnesium per day over six weeks, while those in the control arm received no treatment. Depression symptom assessments were conducted on all participants on a bi-weekly basis.\n\nThe study team found that in 112 participants with analyzable data, consumption of magnesium chloride for six weeks resulted in a clinically significant improvement in measures of depression and anxiety symptoms. In addition, these positive effects were shown quickly, at two weeks, and the supplements were well tolerated and similarly effective regardless of age, sex, or use of antidepressants, among other factors.\n\n\"This is the first randomized clinical trial looking at the effect of magnesium supplementation on symptoms of depression in U.S. adults,\" says Tarleton. \"The results are very encouraging, given the great need for additional treatment options for depression, and our finding that magnesium supplementation provides a safe, fast and inexpensive approach to controlling depressive symptoms.\"\n\nTarleton and colleagues say the next step is to see if their promising results can be replicated in a larger, more diverse population.", "question": "Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "According to the news release, consuming magnesium chloride \u201cresulted in a clinically significant improvement in measures of depression and anxiety symptoms.\u201d But the release made no mention of what these measures were, or how the measurements were taken.\nThe published study notes that the primary outcome measure was a mental health questionnaire given by phone bi-weekly (the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, or PHQ-9).

As many as three balloons were placed over three months, and all of the balloons were removed after six months. The balloons made patients feel full, the researchers explained.\n\nIn addition to the balloons, patients followed a moderate diet and behavior modification program. Whether the weight loss will last over the long term isn't known, said lead researcher Dr. Aurora Pryor, director of the Bariatric and Metabolic Weight Loss Center at Stony Brook University in New York.\n\nThe study lasted a year, but \"we don't know what happens after that,\" Pryor said.\n\n\"If they are able to stick to their newfound lifestyle with their diet and exercise program, they could maintain their weight loss,\" she said. \"The long-term results are dependent on patients keeping their motivation to stay with their diet and exercise programs.\"\n\nThe balloon treatment will be available starting in January, but the cost hasn't been announced, Pryor said. The device, called the Obalon Balloon System, was approved in September by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nAn advantage of the balloons is that patients have no downtime and can go back to work the same day, the researchers said.\n\n\"There is no sedation or recovery time when the balloons are placed, but there is sedation when the balloons are removed, so you wouldn't want to go back to work after that,\" Pryor added.\n\nPryor believes balloons are a better option for patients who are candidates for weight loss surgery but don't want surgery. \"For people who want to lose some weight but don't feel they are heavy enough for surgery or they're afraid of surgery, this is a really good next step to help them jump start their weight loss,\" she suggested.\n\nThe findings were to be presented Friday at the annual meeting of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery and the Obesity Society in New Orleans.

All patients also had 25 minutes of lifestyle therapy every three weeks. After six months, patients with the Obalon balloons had them removed.\n\nDuring the time patients had the balloons, and for six months after, the researchers monitored their weight loss. The investigators also followed those who had not received the balloon therapy.\n\nPeople treated with the balloons lost an average of 7 percent of their weight, compared to less than 4 percent for those who received the sham device, the researchers found. Six months after the balloons were removed, nearly 90 percent maintained the weight loss they achieved during treatment, Pryor said.\n\nAs for side effects, one patient had a bleeding stomach ulcer while taking high doses of pain pills after a knee replacement. Most patients (91 percent) suffered from stomach cramps and nausea, which nearly 100 percent said were mild or moderate.\n\nThe results were also presented at a medical meeting in May.\n\nOne health and nutrition expert noted that a balloon does not equal a lifestyle change.\n\n\"A gastric balloon may help with weight loss, but will do nothing to improve diet quality and overall health,\" said Dr. David Katz.

Using this threshold in routine practice could potentially double the number of patients suitable for immediate discharge directly from the emergency department, say the authors.\n\n\"Until now there were no quick ways to rule out a heart attack within the emergency department,\" explains lead author Dr Anoop Shah from the University of Edinburgh in the UK. \"We have identified a cardiac troponin concentration (less than 5 nanograms per deciliter; <5 ng/L) below which patients are at very low risk of heart attack either during the admission or in the ensuing 30 days. These patients are therefore potentially suitable for immediate and safe discharge from the emergency department. These findings could dramatically reduce unnecessary hospital admissions and provide substantial cost savings for healthcare providers.\"[2]\n\nOne of the most common causes of hospitalisation worldwide is acute chest pain. In the UK alone, chest pain is responsible for around 1 million visits to the emergency department every year. International guidelines recommend that individuals presenting with chest pain are admitted to hospital for testing for very high levels of troponin (above the 99th percentile)--a sign that a heart attack has occurred. Current approaches for assessing patients with suspected heart attacks either require admission into hospital or lengthy stays in the emergency department for repeat testing. Until now, whether new high-sensitivity cardiac troponin tests could identify very low-risk patients who may be suitable for immediate and safe discharge from the emergency department was unknown.\n\nThe test used in this study is more sensitive than the standard version and can detect far lower levels of troponin in the blood. Using this test, troponin levels were measured in over 6000 patients with chest pain admitted to four hospitals in Scotland and the USA. Dr Shah and colleagues prospectively evaluated the negative predictive value (the probability that patients were not at risk) of heart attack or subsequent death from a heart condition after 30 days for a range of troponin concentrations.\n\nThe researchers found that a troponin threshold of <5 ng/L at presentation identified around two-thirds (61%) of patients at very low risk of heart attack and may have been eligible for early, safe discharge--with a high negative predictive value of 99.6%. This high negative predictive value persisted irrespective of age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, or prior cardiovascular disease. At one year, these patients had a three times lower risk of heart attack and cardiac death than those who had troponin levels 5 ng/L or higher.\n\nAccording to Dr Shah, \"Over the last two decades the number of hospital admissions due to chest pain has tripled. The overwhelming majority of these patients do not have a heart attack. This study shows that low plasma cardiac troponin concentrations at presentation identify up to two-thirds of patients who are at very low risk of heart attack and could be safely discharged from the Emergency Department. Use of this approach is likely to have major benefits for both patients and healthcare providers.\"[2]\n\nWriting in a linked Comment, Louise Cullen and William Parsonage from the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Queensland, Australia, and Martin Than from Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand, say, \"The ultimate validation for the safety and efficacy of discharging patients with cardiac troponin concentrations less than 5 ng/L will be the report of clinical outcomes after this threshold is implemented in routine clinical practice...Finally, what further assessment, if any, is needed for those patients identified as low risk and suitable for early discharge? Trials are needed to assess the safety and effectiveness of clinical pathways that involve no further testing for such patients.\"\n\nThis study was funded by the British Heart Foundation and Chief Scientists Office (Scotland).\n\n[1] A troponin test measures the level of troponin proteins in the blood. These proteins are released when the heart muscle has been damaged, like during a heart attack. The more damage there is to the heart, the greater the amount of troponin there will be in the blood. Even a slight increase in the troponin level will often mean there has been some damage to the heart. Very high levels of troponin are a sign that a heart attack has occurred.\n\n[2] Quotes direct from author and cannot be found in text of Article.", "question": "Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "This is a mixed bag.

Volunteers using the toothpaste were also required to log their usage in a journal.\n\nBoth groups reported a significant decrease in their symptoms, including Joyce, who was in the toothpaste group.\n\nAllerdent is not covered by insurance, meaning Joyce spends about $400 every three months but said the cost is worth it.\n\n\u201cI used to be so irritable because I was so uncomfortable,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cBut now I don\u2019t really feel allergy symptoms anymore.\u201d\n\nTo find a prescribing doctor for Allerdent in your area or to find more information, visit Allovate.com.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "There is no quantification of benefits in this story, period. \u00a0It states that both groups in the trial \u201creported a significant decrease in their symptoms,\u201d but offered no numbers to back that up.

Merck is expected to announce late-stage trial results of a similar drug, boceprevir, this year. And numerous other companies, from pharmaceutical giants to small start-ups, are in hot pursuit.\n\nBoth Vertex\u2019s telaprevir and Merck\u2019s boceprevir block an enzyme known as protease that is made by the virus. Most of the other new drugs also work by blocking viral enzymes. This direct antiviral approach has been used with great success in treating H.I.V. and AIDS.\n\nVertex itself says it expects results from two additional Phase 3 trials of telaprevir in the third quarter and will then apply to the Food and Drug Administration for approval of the drug.\n\nSome 2.7 million to 3.9 million Americans are estimated to have hepatitis C, and 12,000 die from it each year, according to a recent report by the Institute of Medicine.\n\nThe disease can cause cirrhosis, which is a scarring of the liver, as well as liver cancer. The virus is transmitted by blood, so most people who have hepatitis C either have injected illegal drugs or received blood transfusions or blood products before the early 1990s.\n\nThe existing treatment is a combination of alpha interferon, which is injected, and ribavirin, an oral drug. It is not quite clear how those drugs work.\n\nFor patients with the type of hepatitis most prevalent in the United States, which is called Genotype 1, the treatment lasts nearly a year and can cause side effects that include flulike symptoms, anemia and depression. It is so arduous that many patients opt not to get treated or drop out before completing the course.\n\nBut in Vertex\u2019s trial, about 70 percent of those who achieved an effective cure were able to do so in 24 weeks, or about six months. That shorter time line, plus a higher chance of success, could entice more people to be treated, experts say.\n\n\u201cIf you can promise them six months with a reasonable chance of a cure, that\u2019s a meaningful advance,\u201d said Dr. Scott L. Friedman, chief of the division of liver diseases at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.\n\nIf approved, telaprevir would have to be used initially with the existing drugs to prevent the virus from evolving resistance. But experts hope that eventually several of the pills now in development could be used together, much as AIDS is treated, doing away with the need for interferon.\n\nVertex\u2019s clinical trial enrolled 1,095 patients in the United States and abroad who had Genotype 1 hepatitis C and had not been treated previously. Patients got either 12 weeks or eight weeks of telaprevir or a placebo. The standard therapy of interferon and ribavirin was given for either 24 weeks or 48 weeks, depending on how the patients were faring after four weeks and 12 weeks.\n\nOf those who got 12 weeks of telaprevir, 75 percent had a sustained viral response, meaning the virus was not detectable in their blood 24 weeks after completing treatment. That is seen as essentially a cure. The rate was 69 percent for those who got eight weeks of telaprevir.\n\nThe drug can cause a nasty rash and increases the rate of anemia. About 7 percent of the patients getting telaprevir dropped out of the trial, about double the figure for the control group.\n\nLorren Sandt, chairwoman of the National Viral Hepatitis Roundtable, an advocacy group, called the trial results impressive. But she added, \u201cThe community hopes that if telaprevir is approved by the F.D.A. that it will be accessible and affordable to everyone.\u201d\n\nVertex, which is based in Cambridge, Mass., has not said what it would charge. But analysts expect the drug to cost tens of thousands of dollars for a course of treatment.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story talks\u00a0a lot about the benefits but doesn\u2019t really quantify them. Given that 1,095 patients were in the trial, let\u2019s assume that half were in the drug group and half in the placebo group. Of the drug group, let\u2019s assume half were in the 24 week group and half were in the eight week group. By our math, that means that about 154 people had better outcomes than those in the control group. Also, the story\u00a0does a pretty good job of walking people through the results, but the story is framed as a \"new era\" versus an old, torturous treatment. Only when you get to the end of the story do you realize that the new drug only works in combination with the old, torturous treatment. So the torture is not going away, it\u2019s just taking on a new layer of medication, and new costs.\nRelapses after completing therapy are common with standard therapy of IFN and ribavirin.\u00a0 In a recently published study in the NEJM\u00a0involving patients who had previously failed IFN and ribavirin, there was a 76% \"cure\" at the end of the treatment period, but only a 51% \"cure\" 24 weeks after the end of treatment.

She roamed from Chinatown to the Upper East Side, went sightseeing in Central Park and painted the town with her husband of 33 years, their two 20-something children and assorted friends.\n\nOne evening, they found themselves at Del Posto, a chic Italian restaurant. Glancing at her watch, over the sparkle of conversation, wine glasses and half-eaten dessert, Gilbert marveled at the time: just a few minutes to midnight.\n\n\"It was awfully late for me,\" she laughed as she told the story. \"It was just a great moment to know that I was holding up enough to be there, to feel great and make memories.\"\n\nLate-night hours, any hours, are especially precious to Gilbert, who could have been forgiven for feeling just a bit weary. For 15 years, she's been fighting breast cancer.\n\nAfter years of ups and downs, Gilbert is doing well and gives most of the credit to her most recent medicine: bevacizumab, better known by its brand name, Avastin. But gratitude is tinged with worry, because the Food and Drug Administration is considering the unusual step of revoking its approval of Avastin as a treatment for metastatic breast cancer.\n\n\"It's disheartening, and it's a scary thought,\" says Gilbert. \"Until just recently, I didn't know it was so precarious.\"\n\nAvastin, which works by cutting off a tumor's blood supply, was first approved as a cancer treatment in 2004 as a therapy for colon cancer. Since then, it has also been approved as a treatment for certain types of lung, kidney and brain cancer.\n\nIn 2008, the FDA granted Avastin what's known as accelerated approval as a therapy for metastatic breast cancer. The move was based on preliminary studies that found the drug increased the time that patients went without symptoms getting worse. As a condition of the approval, the company that makes Avastin -- Genentech -- agreed to conduct more extensive research.\n\nThe results of those two larger trials, known as RIBBON-1 and AVADO, were made public this year, and to some, they were disappointing. In RIBBON-1, time without symptoms getting worse, known as progression-free survival, or PFS, improved by less than three months.\n\nIn AVADO, it improved by just 24 days. In neither study did patients actually live longer, and there was a high rate of side effects, including high blood pressure and internal bleeding.\n\nIn July, an FDA advisory panel voted 12-1 to recommend revoking the preliminary approval. The FDA promises a final decision by September 17.\n\nGilbert had just passed her 40th birthday when she felt a lump in her breast. It was cancer.\n\nShe had it removed, went through a round of radiation and chemotherapy, and was symptom-free for the next nine years.\n\n\"I almost describe it as the little c,\" is how she tells it today. \"When I got the recurrence, it was the Big C. It was a real surprise when it came back again.\"\n\nThis time, the signal was pain underneath her armpit. Tests revealed several small tumors in the bone.\n\nDoctors told Gilbert she'd be lucky to be alive in five years, but with chemotherapy and radiation, she fought off the cancer, again. A year later, she watched her daughter Neely perform her senior dance recital, and not long after, walk across the stage to collect her high school diploma.\n\n\"All those things you take for granted,\" Gilbert says. \"I was just so blessed to see her graduate.\"\n\nBut chemotherapy took a toll. At one point, Gilbert was hospitalized several days with a low white blood cell count and high fevers.\n\nA few years later, she felt chest pains, and doctors thought she was having a heart attack. As it turned out, Gilbert had no heart damage, but there were days she was so exhausted she couldn't leave the house.\n\nLate last spring, tests at Duke University found signs of cancer in her liver. Dr. Kimberly Blackwell, a breast cancer specialist at Duke, put her on Avastin, along with Navelbine, another chemotherapy drug. Gilbert says the combination stopped her illness in its tracks.\n\nBecause Avastin is approved to treat other cancers, losing the breast cancer indication would not, technically, remove it from a doctor's toolkit. But here's the catch: Avastin costs more than $8,000 a month. At that price, insurance coverage is crucial, and patients and doctors fear that an FDA reversal will lead to most insurers no longer signing the checks.\n\nSusan Pisano, a spokeswoman for the Association of Health Insurance Plans, the largest trade group, said insurers would wait for guidance from the FDA, but adds, \"If the FDA pulls back its approval for this particular indication, it would trigger a review of plan policies. Policies get reviewed whenever there is additional information.\"\n\nThe issue has split advocates for breast cancer patients. Susan G. Komen For the Cure, the largest group, issued a statement in support of Avastin and has helped to circulate a petition asking that it still be made available. But Fran Visco of the National Breast Cancer Coalition says Avastin should not have been approved in the first place.\n\n\"There was a delay in progression of the tumor, but it had no effect on quality of life, or survival,\" Visco says. \"I favor a strong FDA. We need some oversight body to say whether something is effective. You can't rely on industry to do that, or individual physicians.\"\n\nVisco says the new studies on Avastin, AVADO and RIBBON-1, should settle the issue.\n\n\"It's got no impact on survival, and there are troubling side effects. We're supposed to be excited about a delay in tumor progression, for a month? That's sad.\"\n\nBut Blackwell, the Duke oncologist, says the medicine can be used safely as long as patients are carefully monitored. Marcia Gilbert has had no significant side effects since starting on Avastin. If it's not available, Blackwell says, \"I'm going to have to give older drugs with the exact same toxicity. And they've never been shown to improve overall survival, either.\"\n\nBlackwell says the FDA risks setting the bar too high. \"If the [Avastin] label is not upheld, it sets a new standard. We're not going to see another first-line drug for another 10 years, at least.\"\n\nAnother breast cancer specialist, Dr. Edith Perez, deputy director of the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center in Jacksonville, Florida, says many chemotherapy drugs, such as Gemzar -- which is substantially less expensive than Avastin -- have previously been approved without showing they can lengthen survival.\n\nThe issue has been taken up by critics of the health care overhaul signed into law last year. In late July, Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, wrote a letter to the FDA saying that there are no new safety concerns and that \"the [FDA advisory] committee's concerns appear to have been based on cost-effectiveness.\" Vitter went on to say that removing the breast cancer indication would be \"cost-rationing.\"\n\nThe FDA says it does not consider cost when evaluating the safety or effectiveness of a drug. But some physicians, including Perez, say the issue is getting harder to ignore. In cancer care, many drugs are used \"off-label,\" for therapies beyond those formally reviewed by the FDA.\n\n\"When they're less expensive, those drugs get approved by insurers,\" Perez says. When they cost more, \"I'm spending more and more time justifying even treatments that do have regulatory approval.\"\n\nIn some states, insurers may not have the last word. Gilbert has a policy from Blue Cross/Blue Shield of North Carolina. According to Dr. John Fong, the company's vice president and senior medical director, a state law requires that insurers pay for cancer treatment that is listed in certain catalogs of acceptable treatments, compiled by government agencies or professional organizations.\n\nOf course, given the debate over Avastin, those lists could become another source of controversy.\n\nAsked whether she has a Plan B, if insurance no longer pays for Avastin, Gilbert's voice gets a little quiet. \"I've learned with cancer to take it one day at a time, and not look too far ahead. I'm not going to think about it until I have to.\"\n\nThe morning after her midnight meal, Gilbert was on the pavement again, window-shopping with daughter Neely in Soho and Chinatown. Gilbert glows when she talks about the adventure.\n\n\"Years ago, on some of the different chemos, I wouldn't have had the energy to spend a weekend there. I just wouldn't have had the stamina.\"\n\nBy e-mail, she adds, \"How do you put a dollar value on that?\"", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "", "answer": 1}, {"article": "LONDON (Reuters) - Iranian scientists say they have developed a way of using a simple blood test to predict accurately when women will reach the menopause, offering the chance for women to plan for family and career far in advance.\n\nThe test, which measures levels of a hormone produced by cells in the ovaries, was able to predict the age at which women reached menopause to within an average of 4 months, according to data to be presented at the conference of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Rome on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe results ... could enable us to make a more realistic assessment of women\u2019s reproductive status many years before they reach menopause,\u201d said Ramezani Tehrani of the Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences in Tehran, who led the study.\n\nExperts commenting on the work agreed it was promising, but said its findings would need to be confirmed in larger trials.\n\n\u201cThe possibility of an accurate predictor for menopause is very exciting.

While some people improve with customized diets that avoid certain foods that trigger symptoms, this approach doesn\u2019t help everyone and some emerging research suggests that the condition may also be influenced by processes in the brain.\n\nFor the current analysis, researchers examined data from 53 trials that compared the effects of antidepressants or psychotherapy, either alone or in combination, versus placebo treatments or \u201cusual management\u201d in people with IBS.\n\nRates of \u201cno relief\u201d were highest with placebo treatments. People were 34 percent less likely to have no relief from antidepressants and 31 percent less likely to get no relief from psychotherapy, the study found.\n\n\u201cOne component of IBS is increased sensitivity to the functions of the bowels; simply summarized, this means either the nerves taking messages from the bowel to the brain are more sensitive or that the brain is more attentive or reacts in a more emotional manner to the normal messages arising in the bowel, or both,\u201d said Dr. Michael Camilleri, a researcher at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science in Rochester, Minnesota, who wasn\u2019t involved in the current study.\n\n\u201cSince there are really no medications to reduce the nerve sensitivity, some doctors give medications that modulate the function of the brain in the hope that this approach will reduce the ability to sense or emotionally react to the signals or messages arriving from the bowels,\u201d Camilleri said by email.\n\nPsychiatric conditions including depression, anxiety, and somatisation - physical symptoms thought to have psychological origins - are common among people with IBS, researchers note in the American Journal of Gastroenterology.\n\nAlthough the use of antidepressants is common among IBS patients, psychotherapy is not, the study authors note.\n\nOne limitation of the current study is that the smaller studies used in the analysis had a wide variety of designs and methods for testing the success of treatment, researchers note.

According to a network meta-analysis research article published in the May 1, 2018 issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (JAAOS), the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) naproxen was ranked most effective in individual knee OA treatment for improving both pain and function, and is considered a relatively safe and low-cost treatment method.\n\nNonsurgical treatments for knee OA supported by previous research evidence include strength training, low-impact aerobic exercises, NSAIDs, and weight loss in individuals with a body mass index over 25. This new research analyzed data from multiple trials to determine the relative effectiveness of various nonsurgical treatments for knee OA. The treatments that were compared and ranked included acetaminophen; ibuprofen; intra-articular (IA) or joint injections of cortisone; platelet-rich plasma (PRP); hyaluronic acid (HA); several NSAIDs, such as naproxen, celecoxib, and diclofenac; and both oral and IA placebo.\n\n\"This is the first comprehensive mixed-comparison analysis comparing best-evidence scientific research and excluding lower quality studies that can bias the outcomes,\" said lead author and orthopaedic surgeon David Jevsevar, MD, MBA. \"Using a statistical ranking technique, we worked to provide evidence regarding which of the most common NSAIDs are most likely to decrease pain and improve function, and we attempted to fill in the gaps in evidence for more inconclusive treatments such as HA, PRP, and corticosteroids.\"\n\nAuthors analyzed 53 randomized controlled trials that examined knee OA treatments for at least 28 days and included a minimum of 30 participants per study group. Knee OA treatments were ranked on a scale of one to five, with one being the most effective. They found the following:\n\u2022 For pain reduction, cortisone injections provided the greatest short-term (4 to 6 weeks) pain relief, followed by ibuprofen, PRP injections, naproxen, and celecoxib.\n\u2022 Naproxen ranked the highest for probability for improving function, followed by diclofenac, celecoxib, ibuprofen, and PRP injections.\n\u2022 Naproxen was ranked the most effective individual knee OA treatment for improving both pain and function followed by cortisone injections, PRP injections, ibuprofen and celecoxib.\n\u2022 HA injections did not achieve a rank in the top five treatments for pain, function, or combined pain and function. An analysis of 12 articles also found that results with HA are not significantly different from those with IA placebo for treatment of knee OA.\n\n\"Because knee OA has both a high disease burden and high treatment costs, additional prospective studies using similar outcomes, timelines, and measures of clinically important changes are needed,\" explained Dr. Jevsevar. \"While the information in this analysis is helpful to physicians, patients also can benefit from these findings and use it with their doctors to weigh all possible treatment options.\"\n\nAlthough the use of NSAIDs for arthritic conditions such as knee OA has potential risks, including heart attack and stroke, existing evidence indicates that naproxen has less potential for adverse cardiovascular events.\n\nMore information about the AAOS and JAAOS\n\nFollow the AAOS on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram \n\nFollow the conversation about JAAOS on Twitter\n\nFrom the Department of Orthopaedics, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH (Dr. Jevsevar), American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, Rosemont, IL (Mr. Shores, Mr. Mullen, Ms. Schulte, and Dr. Cummins), and Franciscan Orthopedic Associates, Tacoma, WA (Dr. Brown).

Is an app-based self-care program particularly attractive to young women? These questions addressed in a new study by researchers from Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, the results of which have been published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology*.\n\nApproximately 50 to 90 percent of young women experience pain during their periods. While this pain primarily manifests itself as lower abdominal cramping, other symptoms include headache, backache, nausea and diarrhea. Acupressure is a technique derived from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). In contrast to acupuncture, this technique can be used as a form of self-care and is suitable for use at home. Rather than using needles, this technique involves massage or pressure being applied to specific points on the body.\n\nThe researchers wanted to evaluate whether in a group of women suffering from severe menstrual pain, aged between 18 and 34, self-acupressure would be more effective at achieving a sustained reduction in menstrual pain than usual care alone (e.g. pain medication and hormonal contraceptives). A total of 221 participants were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups, both of which received a study app and short introduction. Acupressure-based features - with instructions on how to administer self-acupressure shortly before and during menstruation - were only made available to the intervention group. One advantage of an app-based intervention is its ability to provide visual descriptions of the pressure points users need to target in order to achieve the desired effect. It can also send regular reminders. Additionally, the app was used to collect all study-related data.\n\n\"Initially, we simply wanted to conduct a study on the use of self-care techniques for menstrual pain. However, the women who were involved during the planning stages, all of whom were affected by menstrual pain, wanted an app,\" reports the study's principal investigator, Prof. Dr. Claudia Witt of the Institute of Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics. The app helped participants to apply simple self-acupressure techniques to three different acupressure points.\n\nAfter three months, 37 percent of participants in the acupressure group reported a 50 percent reduction in pain intensity. After six months, this proportion had increased to more than half of the women in this group (58 percent). Only 25 percent of women in the control group reported a similar reduction in pain intensity at both the 3-month and 6-month marks. Women in the acupressure group also used less pain medication than women in the control group and reported lower levels of pain overall.\n\n\"We were surprised to see that, after six months, two thirds of participants continued to use self-acupressure. So far, research into the clinical effectiveness of apps has been limited, and only a few have been tested using randomized controlled trials,\" says Dr. Daniel Pach of the Institute of Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics. He adds: \"We were able to show that apps can be evaluated in a clinical trial setting.

In two scenarios, participants spent a night being sleep-deprived in a lab and then spent 45 minutes in dim or bright light before a driving test. For a third test, people got a good nights\u2019 sleep at home and then went to the lab for 45 minutes of bright light exposure before a driving test.\n\nAfter sleep deprivation in the lab, five people exposed to dim light therapy got in car accidents during the driving simulations.

Strategies like drinking coffee or soda, napping before a drive or blasting music or rolling down the windows in the car may help increase alertness behind the wheel, but none of these strategies is fool-proof.\n\nFor the current study, researchers wanted to see if bright light might help reduce driving impairments related to sleep deprivation.\n\nThey found participants had lower body temperatures after spending a sleep-deprived night in the lab, as well as longer reaction times and increased sleepiness.\n\nExposure to bright light didn\u2019t appear to improve reaction times or sleepiness.

We're simply providing a product to help people know what's in their food and guide their habits.\"\n\nGluten-free diners can place a sample of food into a capsule or \"test pod\" and then insert the capsule into a black, triangular device that basically acts like a mini chemistry test. In about two minutes, Sundvor said Nima can tell if the food sample has 20 parts per million or more of gluten. A smiley face means it's OK; a frowning face means it doesn't pass muster.\n\nAs a point of reference, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires manufacturers who choose to put a \"gluten free\" label on food packaging to meet the same 20 parts per million of gluten standard.\n\nGluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. People with celiac disease experience an immune reaction when they eat gluten that can lead to intestinal damage and impact the health of other organs if it's not managed well. It can cause stomach pain, a swollen belly, acid reflux, diarrhea, skin problems, and other symptoms.\n\nThe National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases estimates that about 1 in 141 Americans has celiac disease, but many people don't know they have the condition. Gluten-sensitive people experience similar symptoms to those with celiac disease and improve when they eliminate gluten from their diets.\n\nNima is triangular and relatively dainty, about three and a half inches tall by three inches wide, and a little less than an inch thick. \"Small enough to fit into your pocket along with your keys and mobile phone or a small clutch,\" said Sundvor.\n\nNima was first conceived when Sundvor and company co-founder Shireen Yates met about two years ago and realized they both had gluten intolerance and other food issues.\n\n\"We met at MIT through mutual friends. She was getting her MBA and I'd gotten my engineering degree from there. We had this shared experience; Shireen has several food allergies and I also have several food intolerances. We both just had these issues where we'd eat out and get sick or feel uncomfortable,\" Sundvor said. \"Shireen had the idea, 'Why can't I just test my food and figure out what's in it?' So we started talking about the idea and we researched the market and realized it's something we could make happen.\"\n\nIt costs $179 to pre-order a tester plus three one-time-use pods, and $47.95 for a refill pack of 12 pods; prices will increase later this month, according to the company's website.

Of the men who had a raised platelet count of the same value or higher six months after being diagnosed with thrombocytosis, 18.1% developed cancer, while for women the figure was 10.1%.\n\nWhile many different types of cancer were present in both groups, the team found that breast and prostate cancers were less common among those with thrombocytosis than in the general population, while lung and colorectal cancers were more common.\n\nFor about a third of cases of lung and colorectal cancer in patients with thrombocytosis, there had been no other symptoms that raised the suggestion of cancer. That, say the researchers, makes testing for raised platelet count a valuable tool, and could speed up cancer diagnosis by at least three months for thousands of patients a year.\n\nRichard Neal, professor of primary care oncology at the University of Leeds who was not involved in the research, welcomed the study.\n\n\u201cThis is an excellent study that demonstrates the potential for a commonly used blood test to identify some patients with cancer earlier,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis work should begin to change practice, so that GPs should be testing patients with raised platelet counts for cancer, especially those without other potential cancer symptoms,\u201d he added.\n\nDr Jasmine Just, Cancer Research UK\u2019s health information officer, said more research was need to confirm whether further tests following a high platelet count would save lives.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of possible reasons a person\u2019s platelet count might be high, and in most cases it won\u2019t be down to cancer,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cMeasuring platelet count in patients who don\u2019t otherwise warrant a blood test is not necessarily a good idea. But if a patient has a blood test for another reason and a high platelet count is found, then one of the possible diagnoses doctors should consider is cancer.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story\u2019s author did a good job of describing the numbers of patients whose data were\u00a0drawn from a national database, and the percentages across ages and genders who were identified with some form of cancer within a year of a high platelet count, compared to percentages of who were not diagnosed with cancer. It also noted the rate of cancer diagnosis in the general population overall as a comparative factor. There were also data given about the types of cancer most diagnosed and the potential impact for early diagnosis. The thoughtful reader will come away with the notion that even if platelet counts are utilized widely, they are not going to serve as markers for\u00a0most cancers that arise in adults.\nOne thing the story needed on this note was\u00a0better framing on how these results differed by age. Our\u00a0concern is there may be unnecessary anxiety for some people to pressure their doctor into performing a platelet count beginning at a young age that may not be necessary.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A glass of wine or two a week \u2014 and not more than one large glass on any occasion \u2014 may be safe during pregnancy, according to a large study just published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health. The British research found no negative effects of such light drinking on 5-year-olds whose mothers had imbibed while pregnant with them. Indeed, these kindergartners were slightly less likely to have behavioral problems and performed somewhat better on cognitive tests than children whose mothers had abstained. (More on Time.com: 5 Pregnancy Taboos Explained (or Debunked))\n\nBut this does *not* mean that light drinking in pregnancy is good for your baby. When researchers controlled for factors like maternal education and income, which tend to be higher in light drinkers, it significantly reduced the positive effects associated with alcohol. For example, before adjusting for these kinds of differences between the groups, the researchers found that light drinking was connected with 33% lower rates of overall behavior problems in boys \u2014 after the adjustment, that effect fell to 23%.\n\nThe study did find negative effects in children whose mothers drank moderately: this was defined as not having more than 3 to 6 British units of alcohol per week or more than 3 to 5 units on a single occasion. (One British unit of alcohol equals a small glass of wine.) Heavier drinking in pregnancy, not surprisingly, resulted in increased levels of behavior problems and lowered cognitive performance among children.\n\nThe research included 11,513 children participating in a large U.K. study. The authors had earlier published similar results looking at the data for children in the study when they were 3, finding those whose mothers who didn\u2019t drink had slightly more behavior problems and slightly poorer performance on mental tests than kids born to light drinkers; the results also showed increasingly negative effects of alcohol going from moderate to heavy drinking. Other research has repeatedly shown that heavy, binging patterns of consumption are most dangerous to the developing child. (More on Time.com: If I\u2019m Drunk, Then You Stepped On My Toes On Purpose)\n\nInterestingly, the new study parallels the effects of alcohol on health more generally; lighter drinkers tend to do better than teetotalers while the heaviest drinkers do worse. (But see here for coverage of a study that found even heavy drinkers beat abstainers when it comes to mortality in mid- to late life.)\n\nYet previous research in the area of maternal drinking has repeatedly found negative effects from even the lowest levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. This data is notoriously hard to interpret, however, in part because it is based on women\u2019s self-reports: the public health message against drinking during pregnancy has been so widely adopted that women who do drink may significantly underreport their consumption to researchers. If women who say they are drinking at \u201clight\u201d levels are actually drinking at moderately or heavily, that might make the data on light drinking look more dangerous than they are.\n\n\n\nWhatever the case, American health authorities remain united in their advice that no amount of alcohol is safe for the fetus during pregnancy \u2014 and anyone who is familiar with fetal alcohol syndrome knows why. But for those women who drink before finding out they\u2019re pregnant or who have an occasional glass of wine afterward, this study can provide reassurance that very low levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy are unlikely to cause serious problems.\n\nEven More Evidence for the Health Benefits of Drinking\n\nPhotos: What Booze Looks like Under a Microscope", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Unlike the other story reviewed, this story notes that the children of mothers who drank lightly\u00a0were \"slightly less likely to have behavioral problems and performed somewhat better on cognitive tests.\" This is a startling finding, to say the least, but then the story, importantly, adds that\u00a0\"this does *not* mean that light drinking in pregnancy is good for your baby.

Nevertheless, it raises hope that a simple, noninvasive intervention might go a long way towards countering the fatigue, poorer prognosis and impaired quality of life that can result from chemo-induced muscle mass loss.\n\n\"Fish oil may prevent loss of weight and muscle by interfering with some of the pathways that are altered in advanced cancer,\" study author Dr. Vera Mazurak, of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, said in a news release. \"This holds great promise, because currently there is no effective treatment for cancer-related malnutrition.\"\n\nMazurak and her colleagues report their observations in the Feb. 28 online edition of Cancer.\n\nTo explore the therapeutic potential of fish oil supplements, the authors offered 16 cancer patients undergoing an initial 10-week chemotherapy regimen a daily dose of 2.2 grams of a particular omega-3 fatty acid called eicosapentaenoic (EPA).\n\nWhile these patients took fish oil supplements throughout their chemotherapy treatment, a second group of 24 patients underwent the same regimen minus the fish oil.\n\nThe results: continual muscle and fat measurements revealed that the group that took no fish oil supplementation lost an average of just over 5 pounds; the supplement group lost no weight.\n\nWhat's more, blood analyses revealed that those in the fish oil group who had the biggest bump in bloodstream EPA concentrations also had the greatest muscle mass gains.\n\nSpecifically, nearly 70 percent of those in the fish oil group either kept their pre-chemo muscle mass or gained muscle. By comparison, less than 30 percent in the non-supplement group kept their original muscle mass.\n\nTotal fat tissue measurements were unaffected by fish oil supplementation, the team noted, and no side effects were observed.\n\nThe authors concluded that fish oil supplementation appears to be a safe and effective way to prevent malnutrition among cancer patients, and may ultimately prove to be of benefit for other groups of people, such as elderly patients who also face a significant ongoing risk for muscle loss.\n\nLona Sandon, a registered dietitian and assistant professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Dallas, reacted with cautious optimism to the findings.\n\n\"Malnutrition is a big concern with cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiation,\" she noted. \"Because first of all they do have wasting from the cancer itself, which is very metabolically active and eats up your energy stores. And then with chemotherapy, there is some inflammation that's detrimental to the heart and muscle, as it can cause muscle breakdown. And preservation of lean muscle tissue, we know, leads to better outcomes.\"\n\n\"So certainly this does seem to be promising,\" Sandon said. \"And other similar studies have looked at omega-3 and muscle preservation and have also suggested that fish oil can act to prevent inflammation caused by both disease and hardcore medications, like chemotherapy agents.\"\n\n\"But I would caution that the amount of pure concentrated fish oil supplement the people in this study were given is a lot,\" she added. \"Much much more than any recommended dietary allowance, along the lines of two to three servings of fish per week.\"\n\nBut, she said, \"I would say this is certainly worthy of continuing research and exploration. But meanwhile, people should definitely not go out and start consuming huge amounts of fish oil.\"\n\nFor more on chemotherapy, visit the American Cancer Society.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The weight loss figures for the two groups were given.\u00a0 But the muscle mass figures were given in percentages, which is clumsy.\u00a0 Rather than 70% in the fish oil group kept their pre-chemo muscle mass, why not say 11 out of 16.\u00a0 And rather than less than 30% in the standard care group, why not just say 7 of 24?

The company says this is a major step forward in treating PAD because, unlike stents, atherectomy \"leaves no metal behind.\"\n\nA stent is a tiny metal wire mesh tube that props open an artery and is left there permanently. But in leg arteries, the active flexing can cause a stent to break. Being able to clear the blockage just as well without stents reduces possible complications and gives greater flexibility to doctors later, said Brian Verrier, vice president and general manager of peripheral vascular for Covidien.\n\n\"This particular product plays very strongly into where we see the market going,\" he said. \"The potential is huge.\"\n\nAtherectomy is only used in about 15 to 20 percent of PAD cases, but Dr. Lawrence Garcia, a principal investigator in the study, said he expects that to change with these results.\n\n\"I think it has the potential to increase business for Covidien,\" Garcia, chief of interventional cardiology and vascular interventions at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Boston, said Thursday. He said he has no financial stake in the company.\n\nThe study is the largest to look at the effectiveness of atherectomy, Covidien said, and enrolled 800 patients at 47 centers in the U.S. and Europe. Doctors found that Covidien's SilverHawk and TurboHawk devices, which are snaked down through a small incision near the groin and basically shave away and remove the plaque, performed as well after 12 months as angioplasty and stenting.\n\nThe devices had been developed at EV3 Inc., a Plymouth med-tech company that Covidien acquired in 2010.\n\nThomas Gunderson, a senior analyst for Piper Jaffray & Co., said the Covidien study could lead to greater use of atherectomy and a bigger market.\n\n\"It's a good opportunity,\" Gunderson said. \"This will reawaken both the users and the nonusers to say, wait a second, now we have data.\"\n\nAlso of note, Garcia said, is that the procedure proved as effective at improving blood flow for patients with diabetes as those without diabetes. It's a key finding, because patients with diabetes usually suffer from more advanced PAD and the blood vessels re-clog faster than for those who do not.\n\nCovidien, based in Ireland, has its U.S. headquarters in Massachusetts.

(Vanda) (NASDAQ: VNDA) today announced that HETLIOZ\u00ae, a circadian regulator, demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful benefits in nighttime and daytime symptoms of jet lag disorder. HETLIOZ\u00ae is currently approved in the US and Europe for the treatment of Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder, a rare and chronic circadian rhythm sleep disorder.\n\nJet lag disorder is a common circadian disorder frequently observed in millions of travelers who cross multiple time zones. Jet lag disorder is characterized by nighttime sleep disruption, a decrease in daytime alertness and impairment to social and occupational functioning.\n\nThe clinical efficacy results reported today are from the JET8 Phase-III clinical study (3107) (the JET8 study). In the JET8 study, 318 healthy volunteers were admitted to a sleep unit and were subjected to a circadian challenge of an 8 hours advance to their usual bedtime. The JET8 study design induced the circadian challenge experienced by travelers who cross 8 times zones, which leads to jet lag disorder. This clinical design allowed for the study of HETLIOZ\u00ae without the confounding effects of sleep deprivation and variable light conditions.\n\nResults from the JET8 study showed significant and clinically meaningful effects of HETLIOZ\u00ae 20 mg on the primary endpoint of the study as well as multiple secondary endpoints. The pre-specified primary endpoint was the amount of sleep time in the first two thirds of the night. Secondary endpoints included measures of sleep parameters (TST, LPS, WASO) and next day alertness (KSS and VAS). (Table 1).\n\nThe results of the JET8 study shown above demonstrate the effectiveness of HETLIOZ\u00ae in treating jet lag disorder. The magnitude of the total sleep time benefit of 85 minutes improvement over placebo is significant and clinically meaningful. The demonstration of benefits in measurements of next day alertness on both KSS and VAS is meaningful and it underscores the ability of HETLIOZ\u00ae to address both nighttime and daytime symptoms of jet lag disorder.\n\nVanda previously reported on the JET5 study (3101) that examined the effects of HETLIOZ\u00ae in a circadian challenge of 5 hours advance of the subjects' usual bedtime. The results of that study were published in The Lancet in 2009.1 The observation that HETLIOZ\u00ae is effective in treating the symptoms caused by an abrupt advance of the circadian cycle of a magnitude of 5 or 8 hours suggests that HETLIOZ\u00ae will be an effective therapeutic tool in the treatment of individuals that experience symptoms of jet lag. HETLIOZ\u00ae will be potentially useful under circumstances of rapid eastward transmeridian travel experienced by frequent travelers, the rapid deployment of military troops and any circumstances that will necessitate the abrupt phase advance of the sleep wake cycle.\n\nJet lag disorder affects millions of individuals annually who cross multiple time zones during their travel. Jet lag disorder symptoms are more severe during eastward travel. It is reported that more than 30 million US residents make trips abroad each year to overseas destinations. Of these, 60% (approximately 20 million) travel to destinations in Europe, Middle East and Asia. It is also reported that 8% (approximately 1.6 million) travel in Business or First class.2\n\n\"We are extremely pleased with the outcome of this study which establishes the utility of HETLIOZ\u00ae in the treatment of jet lag disorder as HETLIOZ\u00ae was shown to overcome a significant circadian challenge of an 8 hour phase advance. This challenge is equivalent to eastward travel across 8 time zones as experienced for example on travel from Los Angeles to London, Washington DC to Moscow, Paris to Tokyo, or London to Singapore. HETLIOZ\u00ae improved both nighttime sleep and next day alertness potentially offering significant benefits to millions of travelers,\" said Mihael H. Polymeropoulos, MD, Vanda's President and CEO.\n\nVanda intends to seek marketing approval for the use of HETLIOZ\u00ae in the treatment of jet lag disorder. Vanda believes that if HETLIOZ\u00ae is approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of jet lag disorder it will potentially offer a therapeutic solution to many travelers and will likely represent an important commercial opportunity for the company.

This success in large animals holds considerable potential for a safe, effective and long-lasting new treatment in humans with the same bleeding disorder.\n\n\"Our finding has great clinical relevance for patients with factor VII deficiency,\" said study leader Paris Margaritis, D. Phil., a hematology researcher at the Raymond G. Perelman Center for Cellular and Molecular Therapeutics (CCMT) at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). \"These dogs have the type of mutation found in the majority of patients with this disorder, so this approach could lead to a sustained gene therapy in people.\"\n\nThe Margaritis team collaborated with University of North Carolina (UNC) scientists, led by Tim Nichols, M.D., professor of Medicine and Pathology at the UNC School of Medicine.\n\nFactor VII deficiency is rare, found in about one in 300,000 to one in 500,000 people. Because a gene mutation impairs normal production of a blood clotting factor, patients may suffer excessive bleeding in the central nervous system or GI tract, or after surgery or an injury. Female patients may suffer excessive menstrual bleeding.\n\nFactor VII (FVII) deficiency has a range of severity, with about 40 percent of patients having severe disease. They are most commonly treated with regular infusions of clotting factor. Unlike hemophilia, a better-known bleeding disorder that predominantly affects males, factor VII deficiency strikes males and females equally.\n\nGene therapy proposed for bleeding disorders involves introducing DNA carrying the code to produce the specific clotting factor lacking in patients. Researchers at CHOP and elsewhere have bioengineered an adeno-associated virus (AAV), which does not cause disease, as a vector to deliver DNA into cells where it can express enough factor to make the blood clot normally. Over the past 15 years, CHOP hematology researchers have performed clinical trials of gene therapy for hemophilia B that have helped define efficacy and dosing levels in humans.\n\nThe CCMT at CHOP houses a clinical-grade laboratory that manufactures gene therapy vectors, including the AAV vectors used in the current study. Margaritis, a member of the CHOP group long engaged in hemophilia research, currently leads a laboratory focused on factor VII deficiency as well as hemophilia.\n\n\"We developed a unique animal model of this disease after identifying dogs with naturally occurring factor VII deficiency,\" said Margaritis. \"Our investigations enabled us to design the corrective gene to insert into our virus vector in the current study.\"\n\nThe CHOP team collaborated with scientists at UNC who have a long-established colony of dogs for hematology research. Based on previous work by Margaritis, the UNC team identified dogs for this gene therapy study.\n\nNichols, the director of UNC's Francis Owens Blood Research Laboratory, characterized factor VII deficiency in four individual dogs. Using the AAV vectors supplied by Margaritis, Nichols injected the dogs with varying dosages and monitored their health outcomes and biological markers over several years.\n\nThe treated dogs had expressed levels of clotting factor VII that would be therapeutic in humans, with long-term stability. In one dog, the effects persisted nearly three years. Based on kidney function, liver function, and blood measurements in the dogs, the treatment was safe, and did not elicit unwanted immune responses.\n\nThe current study sets the stage for clinical trials in humans. This gene therapy may especially benefit young children with severe bleeding from factor VII deficiency, such as patients receiving care in CHOP's hematology program.\n\n\"This work is very exciting and promising,\" said Nichols, who added, \"The FVII-deficient dogs tolerated the initial gene therapy infusions very well and have had no adverse side effects over several years of follow up. In other related studies in dogs with hemophilia B, similar positive findings have translated to people with hemophilia B.\" Both Nichols and Margaritis agreed: \"The table is now set to propose clinical trials that would treat people who suffer from FVII deficiency.\"\n\nThe National Institutes of Health (grants HL064190 and HL63098), the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the Pennsylvania Department of Health supported this study.

That is a lot of excess deaths.\u201d\n\nCT scans give doctors a view inside the body, often eliminating the need for exploratory surgery. But CT scans involve much higher radiation dose than conventional X-rays. A chest CT scan exposes the patient to more than 100 times the radiation dose of a chest X-ray.\n\nAbout 70 million CT scans were done on Americans in 2007, up from 3 million in 1980. Amy Berrington de Gonzalez of the National Cancer Institute and colleagues developed a computer model to estimate the impact of so many scans.\n\nThey estimated the scans done in 2007 will cause 29,000 cancers. A third of the projected cancers will occur in people who were ages 35 to 54 when they got their CT, two-thirds will occur in women and 15 percent will arise from scans done in children or teens.\n\nThe researchers estimated there will be an extra 2,000 excess breast cancers just from CT scans done in 2007.\n\nRedberg, who wrote a commentary on the studies, said U.S. doctors\u2019 enthusiasm for the tests has led to an explosion in their use that is putting patients at risk.\n\n\u201cWhile certainly some of the scans are incredibly important and life saving, it is also certain that some of them were not necessary,\u201d Redberg said.\n\nIn a separate study, Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman of the University of California, San Francisco, and colleagues analyzed data from 1,119 patients undergoing the 11 most common types of diagnostic CT scans at four institutions in 2008.\n\nThey found radiation dosage varied widely between different types of CT studies, from a median or midpoint of 2 millisieverts for a routine head CT scan to 31 millisieverts for a scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which often involves taking multiple images of the same organ.\n\nBy comparison, the average American is exposed to about 3 millisieverts of radiation a year from ground radon or flying in an airplane \u2014 a level not considered a risk to health.\n\nThe researchers said efforts need to be taken to minimize CT radiation exposure, including reducing the number of unnecessary tests, cutting the dose per study, and standardizing the doses across facilities.\n\nImaging equipment makers such as GE Healthcare, Siemens, Philips and Toshiba Medical Systems are working to develop low-dose CT scanners.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Because the story focused on the cancer risk associated with radiation exposure from CT scanning, it would not be necessary for the story to also quantify the benefits of CT scanning.

But there's good news about the experimental treatment that he pioneered.\n\nIn study results to be presented next week at an annual meeting of cancer doctors, Hassenbusch's treatment \u2014 chemotherapy and a new vaccine \u2014 significantly prolonged survival of patients with glioblastoma, the most common and aggressive brain cancer.\n\nSen. Edward Kennedy was diagnosed with the disease last week.\n\n\"I'm biased, but this is some of the best data we've ever seen,\" said Dr. John Sampson, a Duke University neurosurgeon and the principal investigator of the study, conducted at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and Duke. \"It appears very promising for a cancer where there's been little hope.\"\n\nThe trial's big surprise was that the chemotherapy didn't stop the vaccine from prompting a strong immune response and instead enhanced it. Because chemotherapy kills patients' white blood cells, it is usually considered incompatible with vaccines or, as they're also known, immunotherapy.\n\nGlioblastoma kills nearly 10,000 Americans annually, a majority within the first 15 months after diagnosis, largely because of tentacle-like cells that creep into the brain from the main mass.\n\nHassenbusch, an M.D. Anderson professor of neurosurgery and a pain control expert who treated more than 500 brain cancer patients, was diagnosed with the disease in 2005. After surgery and follow-up radiation, he and his doctors decided to combine Temodar, the now-standard chemotherapy, and the vaccine, until then only used alone.\n\nHassenbusch became the first patient in the M.D. Anderson-Duke trial.\n\nIn all, the study enrolled 23 patients between 2005 and 2007. It was only open to those with a particular protein \u2014 present in one-third to two-thirds of glioblastomas \u2014 and those who were tumor free after surgery and radiation.\n\nKennedy's tumor is thought to be inoperable.\n\nThe study found the average time for recurrence of the tumor was 16.6 months, up from the previous six months. The time of survival was also up significantly from the previous average of 14 months, said Sampson, who declined to reveal the exact number until he presents the data June 2 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago.\n\nUnder the trial protocol, some patients received Temodar for the first five days of the month, and some received it for the first 21 days. On the 21st, all received the vaccine, which signals the immune system to destroy the cancer. Without the vaccine, the immune system doesn't recognize glioblastoma.\n\nAlmost all the patients mounted an immune response. The response was better with the highest dose of Temodar.\n\n\"I think Sam would be pretty excited about these results,\" said Dr. Mark Gilbert, an M.D. Anderson professor of neuro-oncology whose study of Temodar enrolled some 1,150 patients, the most ever in a brain cancer trial.\n\nGilbert cautioned that the study results are preliminary. He noted the impressive results could be the result of cherry-picking patients, accepting only those whose tumors had been excised by surgery and radiation.\n\nTo resolve that possibility, a new trial is under way at 20 cancer centers, including M.D. Anderson, dividing such patients into a group that gets just Temodor and a group that gets the combination therapy.\n\nAlso on tap is a trial adding a third drug \u2014 Avastin, a targeted therapy that starves tumors by stopping them from building blood vessels that supply them with nutrients \u2014 to the regimen.\n\nFor one patient in the study, the Temodar-vaccine combination by itself has worked fine.\n\n\"Doctors originally gave me six to eight months to live when I was diagnosed with glioblastoma,\" said Barbara Derenowski, 69, of Surprise, Ariz., a retirement community northwest of Phoenix. \"But two years later, I'm in good shape, living a normal life and still returning cancer-free scans every month, thanks to this trial. I hope it becomes available to more people.\"\n\nHassenbusch lived almost three years after his diagnosis. He appeared to be beating the cancer with the combination therapy.

In the new study, if even one cell was detected in the bloodstream, a woman had a greater chance of her cancer recurring and of dying.\n\n\"This may help with prognosis and staging of the cancer and, in the future, with targets for breast cancer treatments,\" said study lead author Dr. Anthony Lucci, a professor of surgery at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston.\n\nCommenting on the findings, Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said, \"We are moving into a state where we're looking at a person's individual tumor and this is another way to do that, potentially leading to treatment.\"\n\nWhether or not cancer has spread to the lymph nodes is currently the best way to predict survival in women with breast cancer. Even so, a substantial number of patients whose cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes will have a recurrence while some of those who do have lymph-node involvement won't relapse.\n\nBlood tests similar to the one investigated in this study have been found to be useful to gauge how well patients who already have metastatic cancer will do.\n\nFor this study, researchers counted circulating tumor cells in 302 breast cancer patients who were about to undergo surgery but who hadn't yet received chemotherapy.\n\nCirculating tumor cells were detectable in about one-quarter of the participants, the investigators found. Fifteen percent of these individuals had a relapse and 10 percent died during a five-year follow-up, compared with 3 percent and 2 percent, respectively, of patients who did not have circulating tumor cells.\n\nThe more tumor cells a woman had in her bloodstream, the higher the likelihood of relapsing or dying, according to the report.\n\nAlthough the test may not be far off in terms of clinical practice, \"we need additional studies,\" Lucci said.\n\nOne area for study is how well these circulating cells predict recurrence and death in patients who have already had chemotherapy.\n\nCurrently, the American Society of Clinical Oncology does not recommend that clinicians measure circulating tumor cells in patients.\n\nAnd in an accompanying comment article, Justin Stebbing, a professor in the department of surgery and cancer at Imperial College in London, said that \"despite increasing evidence supporting the use of [circulating tumor cells] as biomarkers, how this information can be integrated into present practice is uncertain.\"\n\nAccording to Bernik, though, \"it makes sense that women who have circulating tumor cells would potentially be at higher risk of distant disease at some later date.\"\n\nThe problem is that just having circulating tumor cells may not be enough information to foretell the future, she noted.\n\n\"The cells also need to have a propensity to grow elsewhere,\" she said. \"Not every cancer cell becomes a metastatic cancer cell. Hopefully, gaining the ability to tell which cells are more likely to spread potentially could guide therapy,\" Bernik added.\n\nAccording to Lucci, circulating tumor cells are also showing promise in predicting melanoma prognosis, so the method may be \"effective in several different tumor systems.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on breast cancer.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The writer makes it clear that while\u00a0lymph node status\u00a0\u201cis currently the best way to predict survival in women with breast cancer\u201d some women\u00a0with no cancer in their lymph nodes will eventually\u00a0experience a relapse of their cancer.\nBut then the story never discussed comparing this approach with current approaches to predict risk (including Oncotype, Adjuvant online, lymph node status etc).\nSo what is the comparative benefit?", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Dr. Neil M.

With this successful Phase 3 trial, insurers will now be more likely to pay for such off-label use.\n\nSome doctors criticized the organizers of the trial for testing Lucentis rather than another Genentech drug, Avastin, which works in the same way as Lucentis.\n\nAlthough it is a cancer drug, Avastin is often used off-label for eye diseases because it is far cheaper than Lucentis, costing only $20 to $100 a dose, compared with $2,000 for Lucentis.\n\nAvastin is undercutting sales of Lucentis, which totaled $1.1 billion in the United States last year.\n\nOrganizers of the trial conceded that a major reason Lucentis was chosen was that Genentech, which is now owned by Roche, agreed to provide the drug free of charge and to contribute $9 million in additional financing \u2014 but only if Lucentis were used.\n\n\u201cObviously you can\u2019t underplay $9 million,\u201d said Dr. Ferris of the eye institute, which is part of the part of the National Institutes of Health.

In macular edema, fluid from those damaged vessels leaks into the macula, the part of the retina that is responsible for the straight-ahead vision important for driving, recognizing faces and reading.\n\nLucentis, also known as ranibizumab, works by drying up leaky blood vessels and preventing the growth of new ones.\n\nJohn Bevan, who has diabetic macular edema, said that every two months or so he used to have an incident in which blood leaked into his eye, blurring his vision.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a paintball hits a plate-glass window \u2014 there\u2019s a big splat and it drips downward and takes three days to a week to dissipate,\u201d said Mr. Bevan, the school superintendent in north central Indiana.

Another got Lucentis, with laser therapy used only after six months and only if needed. The third group got laser therapy plus injections into the eye of triamcinolone, a steroid sold by Allergan under the name Trivaris. The fourth group got laser therapy plus a sham injection.\n\nAfter the first year, only 3 to 4 percent of the eyes treated with Lucentis suffered a visual loss of two or more lines compared to 13 percent that got only laser therapy.\n\nResearchers said the results seem to be holding up for the second year of the three-year trial.\n\nAbout 1 percent of those getting Lucentis injections suffered an inflammation of the eye from an infection.\n\nThe steroid treatment did not improve eyesight more than laser therapy alone and caused side effects.\n\nResults of the trial were published online on Tuesday by the journal Ophthalmology.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "\u00a0The story provided quantitative information about the possible impact on vision.

Both analyze multiple genes in a biopsy sample and give a score for aggressiveness, similar to tests used now for certain breast and colon cancers.\n\nDoctors say tests like these have the potential to curb a major problem in cancer care \u2014 overtreatment. Prostate tumors usually grow so slowly they will never threaten a man's life, but some prove fatal and there is no reliable way now to tell which ones will. Treatment with surgery, radiation or hormone blockers isn't needed in most cases and can cause impotence or incontinence, yet most men are afraid to skip it.\n\n\"We're not giving patients enough information to make their decision,\" said Dr. Peter Carroll, chairman of urology at the University of California, San Francisco. \"You can shop for a toaster\" better than for prostate treatment, he said.\n\nA study he led of the newest test \u2014 the Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score \u2014 is set for discussion Wednesday at an American Urological Association meeting in San Diego.\n\nThe results suggest the test could triple the number of men thought to be at such low risk for aggressive disease that monitoring is a clearly safe option. Conversely, the test also suggested some tumors were more aggressive than doctors had believed.\n\nIndependent experts say such a test is desperately needed but that it's unclear how much information this one adds or whether it will be enough to persuade men with low-risk tumors to forgo treatment, and treat it only if it gets worse. Only 10 percent who are candidates for monitoring choose it now.\n\n\"The question is, what's the magnitude of difference that would change the patient's mind?\" said Dr. Bruce Roth, a cancer specialist at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nOne man may view a 15 percent chance that his tumor is aggressive as low risk \"but someone else might say, 'Oh my God, let's set the surgery up tomorrow,'\" he said. \"I don't think it's a slam dunk.\"\n\nAlso unknown: Will insurers pay for the expensive test without evidence it leads to better care or saves lives?\n\nThe newest test was developed by Genomic Health Inc., which has sold a similar one for breast cancer since 2004. Doctors at first were leery of it until studies in more groups of women proved its value, and the same may happen with the prostate test, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, the American Cancer Society's deputy chief medical officer.\n\nThe company will charge $3,820 for the prostate test and says it can save money by avoiding costlier, unnecessary treatment. Another test for assessing prostate cancer risk that came out last summer \u2014 Prolaris by Myriad Genetics Inc. \u2014 sells for $3,400.\n\nBoth companies can sell the tests without Food and Drug Administration approval under separate rules that govern lab diagnostics. Myriad Genetics has published nine studies on Prolaris involving more than 3,000 patients. Genomic Health has not published any results on the prostate test, another thing that makes doctors wary. Yet it has a track record from its breast cancer test.\n\nAbout 240,000 men in the U.S. are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year, and about half are classified as low risk using current methods. Doctors now base risk estimates on factors such as a man's age and how aggressive cells look from biopsies that give 12 to 14 tissue samples. But tumors often are spread out and vary from one spot to the other.\n\n\"Unless you can be sure your biopsy has hit the most aggressive part that's in the prostate, you can't be sure\" how accurate your risk estimate is, explained Dr. Eric Klein, chief of urology at the Cleveland Clinic, who led early development of the Oncotype prostate cancer test.\n\nFor one study, researchers used prostates removed from 440 men. They measured the activity of hundreds of genes thought to be involved in whether the cancer spread beyond the prostate or proved fatal. A second study of biopsies from 167 patients narrowed it down to 81 genes, and researchers picked 17 that seemed to predict aggressiveness no matter the location in the tumor.\n\nA third study used single needle-biopsy samples from 395 UCSF patients scheduled to have their prostates removed. The gene test accurately predicted the aggressiveness of their cancer once doctors were able to see the whole prostate after surgery.\n\nUsing one current method, 37 of the 395 men would have been called very low risk and good candidates for monitoring. Adding the gene test put 100 men into that category, said another study leader, Dr. Matthew Cooperberg of UCSF. The gene test shifted about half of the men into either a lower or a higher risk category.\n\n\"It went both ways \u2014 that was the remarkable thing. In any category of risk it added independent information compared to the standard criteria we use today,\" Carroll said. \"More work needs to be done, but, in my opinion, this is a very good start.\"\n\nHowever, Dr. Kevin McVary, chairman of urology at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine and a spokesman for the Urological Association, said the test must be validated in more men before it can be widely used.\n\n\"It's not there yet,\" he said.\n\nUCSF just got a federal grant to see how men choose treatments and whether this test might sway them.\n\n\"We throw all these numbers at them. Are they really going to make a better decision?\" Cooperberg said.\n\nDean Smith, 60, a retired marketing executive from Mill Valley, Calif., is following his doctor's advice to monitor the cancer he was diagnosed with in March. He said a gene test may have made him more comfortable with that decision.\n\nAt least six of his friends suffered side effects ranging from urinary leakage to inability to have sex after having their prostates removed.\n\n\"I would suspect that having cancer and having to live with it would be very difficult for them,\" but it doesn't bother him, Smith said. \"I will die from something other than prostate cancer, I guarantee you.\"\n\nCopyright 2013 The Associated Press.

Even the IUD can't stay in place for more than 10 years.\n\nThe only once-and-be-done-with-it option for women has been tubal ligation (\"tying the tubes\") -- surgery that renders a woman sterile. Now a procedure called Essure, recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, gives women an alternative. The nonsurgical approach uses a hysteroscope -- a camera-tipped instrument -- to thread two small wires through the vagina, cervix and uterus and into the fallopian tubes. The wires, composed of polyester fibers and metals, cause inflammation and, over time, scar tissue that blocks the fallopian tubes, preventing sperm from reaching eggs. Women can undergo the procedure in 35 minutes in their doctor's office, under local anesthesia; they are advised to rest for 24 to 48 hours before resuming normal activity. Essure is 99.8 percent effective in preventing pregnancy -- a rate similar to that of tubal ligation, according to the manufacturer, Conceptus Inc. of Mountain View, Calif.\n\nPros and Cons Ellen Whitaker, a gynecologist at the Washington Hospital Center, says \"the biggest advantage\" of Essure is that it involves no incisions or general anesthesia, which both carry risks. By going through the vagina, she says, you \"avoid all the organs in the abdomen.\" In a tubal ligation, she says, \"there's always the possibility of bowel injury, bladder injury . . . which can be very serious.\"\n\nThe biggest drawback, Whitaker says, is the need for X-rays three months after the procedure to confirm the fallopian tubes are blocked. Until then, the patient must use another form of birth control.\n\nSide effects may include pain, cramps and mild bleeding or spotting. There is the risk of infection or a puncture of the vagina or uterus while inserting the hysteroscope. As with tubal ligation, there is also an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy -- a pregnancy that develops outside the uterus.\n\nOne for the Guys Men, too, have an option for a faster, less painful procedure than vasectomy to tie the vas deferens -- the tubes that carry sperm from the testicles to the penis. In the increasingly popular \"no-scalpel vasectomy,\" a doctor uses an instrument called a dissecting forceps to poke a very small hole in the skin of the testicles to reach the vas deferens. There is very little bleeding, and no stitches are needed to close the tiny openings (one on each side).

They collected data from the five participating medical centers for their observational study, and decisions about procedures depended on each center's clinical practices.\n\nThe teens, ages 15 to 18 when the study began, had a body mass index (BMI) between 34 and 88, with half over 51. Medical providers use BMI, the ratio of a person's weight to height, to estimate body fat. A BMI over 25 is considered overweight; over 30 is obese. The obesity classification with the highest risks of health problems is a BMI of 40 or higher.\n\nThe risk factors measured in the study included elevated blood pressure (above 120/80 mg/Hg), high cholesterol, high insulin levels in the blood and abnormally high levels of C-reactive protein, an indicator of inflammation in the body. The higher a person's insulin levels are, the more likely they are to have or develop insulin resistance, which can increase blood sugar levels and diabetes risk. High insulin levels may also contribute to increased blood pressure and increase the risk of atherosclerosis, when fat clogs the arteries.\n\nThree years after surgery, teens who underwent a gastric bypass had a 27 percent drop in their BMI, similar to the 26 percent drop in those who had the sleeve gastrectomy. Those with the gastric band had an 8 percent drop in BMI.\n\nBefore surgery, only 3 percent of the teens had no cardiac risk factors at all, but three years later, just over half of them (52 percent) had no risk factors. Just 5 percent had all four cardiac risk factors before their surgeries, but none had all of them three years later. In fact, the majority of the participants \u2014 83 percent \u2014 had only one or no risk factors three years after their surgeries. The proportion of participants with two or three risk factors also dropped substantially.\n\n\"One of the surprises was that almost all patients benefited as a result of the surgery,\" says M. James Lenhard, the medical director of Christiana Care Health System's Diabetes & Metabolic Diseases Center in Wilmington, Del., who was not involved in the study. The average BMI three years after surgery was 39, still considered very obese, he says. \"And yet they still had significant improvements in cardiovascular risk factors,\" Lenhard says. \"The results were impressive.\"\n\nThe study's biggest limitation is its very selective population. Most of the participants were female, most were white, and most received the gastric bypass. Children of color have the greatest risk of obesity, heart disease and Type 2 diabetes, but it's not clear whether they would see the same improvement with these procedures. Lenhard expects the \"odds are very good\" that they would, and Raghuveer \"would be cautiously optimistic\" that the findings would be similar regardless of sex or ethnicity.\n\nThe population also included only teens with the greatest obesity who were also unsuccessful trying other weight loss methods.\n\n\"Severe obesity is notoriously difficult to treat with anything other than surgery,\" Lenhard says. \"The results of this study suggest that performing surgery at a BMI even lower than 52 would provide even better outcomes.\"\n\nAn estimated 1,600 adolescents undergo metabolic or bariatric surgeries each year, the study notes, but families should only consider such procedures after exhausting other treatment options.\n\n\"This is not a procedure you would consider for any obese patient who walks through the door,\" Raghuveer says. \"It would be considered for the highly obese and those not responding to any behavioral modifications, physical activity or calorie restriction.\"\n\nBefore undergoing bariatric surgery, teens and their families receive extensive counseling, Michalsky says.\n\n\"Teens considering bariatric surgery should have a frank discussion with their family and primary care provider and seek detailed information from well-established bariatric surgery centers that are specifically dedicated to treating adolescents,\" he adds.\n\nAll three procedures carry the same risks as any surgical procedure, such as infections, blood clots and bleeding, Lenhard said, and a common risk of sleeve gastrectomy is bleeding where the stomach is reconnected. People who have a gastric bypass often have nutritional and vitamin deficiencies, Lenhard said. And gastric banding has low effectiveness and a risk of the band slipping down the stomach.\n\nGetting longer term data is important, too. Three years is a good follow-up time for this type of study, and it has many more participants than similar studies.\n\n\"However, three years is not a long time overall in the life of a child,\" Raghuveer says. \"I'd be curious what happens to these kids at 10 years, 15 years later.\"\n\nMichalsky says the study is ongoing, and they expect to continuing gathering information for years to come.\n\nIdeally, public health efforts should aim for better obesity prevention, including parent education and interventions when children are toddlers and preschoolers, according to Raghuveer. \"A generational divide\" has left fewer families knowing how to fix meals, she says, and more families need to learn to cook and avoid packaged foods and microwave dinners.\n\n\"The big question is, how do we prevent obese kids from getting to this point where they would need an invasive surgical procedure?\" Raghuveer says. \"The bigger message should be that we should get to a point in society where we are not managing obesity, but we are preventing obesity.\"\n\nTara Haelle is the co-author of The Informed Parent: A Science-Based Resource for Your Child's First Four Years.

This amount of zinc is equivalent to what biofortified crops like zinc rice and zinc wheat can add to the diet of vulnerable, nutrient deficient populations.\n\nThe study, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, was led by CHORI Senior Scientist Janet King, PhD. King and her team are the first to show that a modest increase in dietary zinc reduces oxidative stress and damage to DNA.\n\n\"We were pleasantly surprised to see that just a small increase in dietary zinc can have such a significant impact on how metabolism is carried out throughout the body,\" says King. \"These results present a new strategy for measuring the impact of zinc on health and reinforce the evidence that food-based interventions can improve micronutrient deficiencies worldwide.\"\n\nZinc is ubiquitous in our body and facilitates many functions that are essential for preserving life. It plays a vital role in maintaining optimal childhood growth, and in ensuring a healthy immune system. Zinc also helps limit inflammation and oxidative stress in our body, which are associated with the onset of chronic cardiovascular diseases and cancers.\n\nAround much of the world, many households eat polished white rice or highly refined wheat or maize flours, which provide energy but do not provide enough essential micronutrients such as zinc. Zinc is an essential part of nearly 3,000 different proteins, and it impacts how these proteins regulate every cell in our body. In the absence of sufficient zinc, our ability to repair everyday wear and tear on our DNA is compromised.\n\nIn the randomized, controlled, six-week study the scientists measured the impact of zinc on human metabolism by counting DNA strand breaks. They used the parameter of DNA damage to examine the influence of a moderate amount of zinc on healthy living. This was a novel approach, different from the commonly used method of looking at zinc in the blood or using stunting and morbidity for assessing zinc status.\n\nAccording to King, these results are relevant to the planning and evaluation of food-based solutions for mitigating the impact of hidden hunger and malnutrition. King believes that biofortification can be a sustainable, long-term solution to zinc deficiency.\n\nIn addition to King, the study's other authors are Sarah J Zyba, Swapna V Shenvi, David W Killilea, Tai C Holland, Elijah Kim, Adrian Moy, Barbara Sutherland, Virginia Gildengorin, and Mark K Shigenaga, conducting the research at CHORI's Nutrition and Metabolism Center.\n\nUCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland (formerly Children's Hospital & Research Center Oakland) is a premier, not-for-profit medical center for children in Northern California, and is the only hospital in the East Bay 100% devoted to pediatrics.

Results from the Phase 2 study, reported in the Journal of Neurosurgery on Dec. 18, 2015, demonstrated the safety of DBS in Alzheimer's patients.\n\nA neurosurgical procedure in which an implanted neurostimulator delivers electrical signals to specific areas of the brain to help regulate abnormal signals, DBS is currently only approved in the U.S. for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and essential tremor. However, its use is being researched for a number of conditions, including epilepsy, depression and bipolar disorder. Francisco Ponce, MD, Director of the Barrow Center for Neuromodulation, believes there are potential applications for Alzheimer's disease - the most common form of dementia - as well. Whereas in Parkinson's disease and essential tremor, the target for the electrodes are nodes within the motor circuits, the Alzheimer's study targeted the fornix, which is part of the memory pathway.\n\n\"There are more than five million Americans living with Alzheimer's, and yet there are few promising pharmacologic treatment options for this progressive disease,\" says Dr. Ponce. \"Previous pilot studies researching the use of DBS in Alzheimer's have indicated the potential to slow cognitive decline in some patients, and have even shown metabolic changes in the brain that may slow the progression of the disease.\" Barrow Neurological Institute is part of Dignity Health St. Joseph's Hospital in Phoenix.\n\nThe ADvance Trial, using a device from Functional Neuromodulation, Inc., is aimed at evaluating the safety, efficacy and tolerability of DBS in this patient population.

A large, randomized, prospective study currently being conducted by the Eastern Clinical Oncology Group should produce the most reliable data on the subject to date, he said.\n\nIn a Stage 4 case, cancer cells have left the breast, metastizing to bones or other organs, which presents a more dire and immediate threat to a woman's survival than the presence of the original tumor.

As other research has shown, African American women were over-represented among women who have Stage 4 breast cancer at the time they are first diagnosed.\n\nIn interviews, Schroeder and Thomas stressed that each decision about whether to have surgery is based on many factors that only a woman and her doctors can assess, in particular how far the cancer has spread and how sick she is.\n\nBut with better therapies to control the cancer systemically and improved imaging that finds ever-smaller deposits of cancer in other parts of the body, it may be time to see whether surgery also can help increase the length of survival times, they said.\n\n\"Aggressive local therapy may benefit select women, such as those with an already established potential for durable remission,\" they wrote in their paper.

Sometimes the situation is truly life-threatening. But often the problem is that labor simply isn't progressing. That was the case for Valerie Echo Duckett, 35, who lives in Columbus, Ohio. After receiving an epidural for pain, Duckett's contractions stopped. By late evening she was told she'd need a C-section to deliver her son, Avery. Duckett says she has vague memories of being wheeled into the operating room, strapped down and shaking from cold.\n\n\"They were covering me up with warm blankets,\"she says. \"I kind of slept in and out of it.\" Her only memory of meeting her newborn son for the first time was from some pictures her husband took.\n\nThis is the experience many women have. The cesarean section is the most common surgery in America \u2014 about 1 in 3 babies is delivered this way. But for many women, being told they need a C-section is unpleasant news. Duckett says she felt like she missed out on a pivotal moment in her pregnancy.\n\n\"It took me a long time even to be able to say that I gave birth to Avery,\" she says. \"I felt like I didn't earn the right to say I gave birth to him, like it was taken from me somehow, like I hadn't done what I was supposed to do.\"\n\nDuckett's reaction to her C-section is unfortunately a common one, says Betsey Snow, head of Family and Child Services at Anne Arundel Medical Center, a community hospital in Annapolis, Md.\n\n\"I hear a lot of moms say, 'I'm disappointed I had to have a C-section.' A lot of women felt like they failed because they couldn't do a vaginal delivery,\" says Snow.\n\nNow some hospitals are offering small but significant changes to the procedure to make it seem more like a birth than major surgery.\n\nIn a typical C-section, a closed curtain shields the sterile operating field. Mothers don't see the procedure and their babies are immediately whisked away for pediatric care \u2014 a separation that can last for close to half an hour. Kristen Caminiti, of Crofton, Md., knows this routine well. Her first two sons were born by traditional cesarean. She was happy with their births because, she says, it was all she knew. Then, just a few weeks into her third pregnancy, Caminiti, who is 33, saw a post on Facebook about family-centered cesarean techniques catching on in England.\n\n\"I clicked on the link and thought, 'I want that,' \" she says.\n\nThe techniques are relatively easy and the main goals simple: Let moms see their babies being born if they want and put newborns immediately on the mother's chest for skin-to-skin contact. This helps stimulate bonding and breast feeding. Caminiti asked her obstetrician, Dr. Marcus Penn, if he'd allow her to have this kind of birth. He said yes.\n\nWhen Caminiti told Penn what she wanted, his first thought was it wouldn't be that difficult to do. \"I didn't see anything that would be terribly out of the norm,\" he says. \"It would be different from the way we usually do it, but nothing terrible that anyone would say we shouldn't try that.\"\n\nFamily-centered cesareans are a relatively new idea in the U.S., and many doctors and hospitals have no experience with them. Penn and the staff at Anne Arundel Medical Center quickly realized the procedure would require some changes, including adding a nurse and bringing the neonatal team into the operating room.\n\nAnd there were a bunch of little adjustments, such as moving the EKG monitors from their usual location on top of the mother's chest to her side. This allows the delivery team to place the newborn baby immediately on the mother's chest. In addition, Penn says, the mother's hands were not strapped down and the intravenous line was put in her nondominant hand so she could hold the baby.\n\nAt the beginning of October, Caminiti underwent her C-section. She was alert, her head was up and the drape lowered so she could watch the delivery of her son, Connor. Caminiti's husband, Matt, recorded the event. After Connor was out, with umbilical cord still attached, he was placed right on Caminiti's chest.\n\n\"It was the most amazing and grace-filled experience to finally have that moment of having my baby be placed on my chest,\" Caminiti says. \"He was screaming and then I remember that when I started to talk to him he stopped. It was awesome.\"\n\nAnd the baby stayed with her for the rest of the procedure.\n\nChanges like this can make a big difference, says Dr. William Camann, the director of obstetric anesthesiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and one of the pioneers of the procedure in the U.S. At Brigham and Women's, their version of the family-centered cesarean is called the gentle cesarean. Moms who opt for it can view the birth through a clear plastic drape, and immediate skin-to-skin contact follows.\n\nCamann says the gentle C-section is not a replacement for a vaginal birth; it's just a way to improve the surgical experience. \"No one is trying to advocate for C-sections. We really don't want to increase the cesarean rate, we just want to make it better for those who have to have it,\" he says.\n\nSo why has the procedure been slow to catch on? Hospitals aren't charging more for it \u2014 so cost doesn't seem to be a major factor. What's lacking are clinical studies. Without hard scientific data on outcomes and other concerns like infection control, many hospitals may be wary of changing their routines. Betsey Snow of Anne Arundel Medical Center says the family-centered C-section represents a cultural shift, and her hospital is helping break new ground by adopting it.\n\n\"It is the first time we have really done anything innovative or creative with changing the C-section procedure in years,\" she says.\n\nKristen Caminiti says her hope is that these innovations become routine. She says she'd like nothing more than to know that other women having C-sections are able to have the same amazing experience she had.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The family-centered or gentle cesarean is put forth as a good alternative to traditional C-sections, since mothers play more of more of an active role during and after the birth of their children.

Three years after receiving two administrations of the bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine four weeks apart, all members of a group of adults with longstanding type 1 diabetes showed an improvement in HbA1c to near normal levels - improvement that persisted for the following five years. The study from a Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) research team - published in npj Vaccines - also reports that the effects of BCG vaccine on blood sugar control appear to depend on a totally novel metabolic mechanism that increases cellular consumption of glucose.\n\n\"This is clinical validation of the potential to stably lower blood sugars to near normal levels with a safe vaccine, even in patients with longstanding disease,\" says Denise Faustman, MD, PhD, director of the MGH Immunobiology Laboratory , principal investigator of BCG clinical trials at MGH and senior author of the npj Vaccines report. \"In addition to the clinical outcomes, we now have a clear understanding of the mechanisms through which limited BCG vaccine doses can make permanent, beneficial changes to the immune system and lower blood sugars in type 1 diabetes.\"\n\nFaustman will also present five-year follow-up results of a separate group of BCG clinical trial participants with longstanding type 1 diabetes on Saturday, June 23, at the 78th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association in Orlando.\n\nUsed for almost a century to prevent tuberculosis, BCG has been known for more than 30 years to boost production of a cytokine called tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which may be beneficial in autoimmune diseases both by eliminating the autoreactive T cells that attack an individual's tissues - in the case of type 1 diabetes, pancreatic islets - and by inducing production of regulatory T cells (Tregs) that could prevent an autoimmune reaction. Faustman's team first reported in 2001 that inducing TNF production could cure type 1 diabetes in mice, but since TNF dosing is toxic in humans, clinical trials have utilized BCG for its ability to elevate TNF levels safely.\n\nInitial clinical trial results, published in a 2012 PLOS One paper, reported that two doses of BCG spaced four weeks apart led to reductions in autoreactive T cells, an increase in Tregs and what turned out to be a transient increase in insulin production. But by the end of that short, 20-week trial, there was no reduction in HbA1c, the established measure of blood sugar levels over time. An extension and expansion of that trial with long term follow-up, the current results are based on data from 282 human study participants - 52 with type 1 diabetes who participated in the BCG clinical trials and 230 who contributed blood samples for mechanistic studies.\n\nRegular monitoring of clinical trial participants found that HbA1c levels of those receiving BCG had dropped by more than 10 percent at three years after treatment and by more than 18 percent at four years. That reduction was maintained over the next four years, with treated participants having an average HbA1c of 6.65, close to the 6.5 considered the threshold for diabetes diagnosis, and with no reports of severe hypoglycemia. Participants in the placebo group and in a comparison group of patients receiving no treatment experienced consistent HbA1c elevations over the same eight-year time period.\n\nIn investigating how BCG administration produces its beneficial effects, the research team identified a mechanism never previously seen in humans in response to treatment with any drug - a shifting of the process of glucose metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation, the most common pathway by which cells convert glucose into energy, to aerobic glycolysis, a process that involves significantly greater glucose consumption by cells. The researchers also found that BCG could reduce blood sugar elevations in mice that were caused by means other than autoimmune attack, raising the possibility that BCG vaccines could also be beneficial against type 2 diabetes.\n\nMihai G. Netea, PhD, professor in the Department of Internal Medicine at Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, says of this study, \"The clinical effects and the proposed mechanism demonstrated are exciting and add to the emerging consensus that the BCG vaccine can have a lasting and valuable impact on the immune system. We know, and this study shows, that BCG vaccination induces epigenetic reprogramming at the chromatin architecture level and functional alterations indicative of a permanent change in immunity. The MGH trials and other, larger prevention and intervention trials underway around the globe may lead to a major shift in the prevention and treatment of infections and autoimmunity.\" Netea was not involved in the current study.\n\nThe MGH team's findings set the stage for further testing of BCG administration, including the FDA-approved phase 2 study currently underway, testing multiple BCG doses in a large group of participants with longstanding type 1 diabetes. That trial is fully enrolled, and there are seven additional BCG clinical trial groups currently recruiting or enrolling at MGH, with a pediatric trial in the planning stages.

Veins contain valves that, when stretched, no longer keep blood moving back toward the heart efficiently. Risk factors include , age and standing still for prolonged periods.\n\nEighty-seven percent of people with varicose veins do not seek treatment, according to a 2008 survey of roughly 1,000 adults conducted nationwide by Vein Clinics of America and Opinion Research Corporation. But doctors say they should: these veins are not just a cosmetic problem, but can also lead to aches, pain, and heaviness from blood pooling in the legs.\n\nThe treatment known as sclerotherapy \u2014 an alternative to surgery \u2014 entails injecting a solution to irritate and collapse vein walls, so the vein eventually disappears. A series of sessions is usually required for a large area.\n\nVein specialists across the country often inject one of two drugs. One, sodium tetradecyl sulfate, or STS, has long been F.D.A. approved. The other, polidocanol, had not been legal, although some doctors used it, importing it from abroad or obtaining it from pharmacies that make drug compounds. \u201cYou have some legal exposure by doing so,\u201d said Dr. Morrison, a vein specialist in greater .\n\nThat said, polidocanol was the \u201csecond most commonly used sclerosing agent\u201d because, he said, \u201cmost physicians want to give their patients the best available treatment.\u201d\n\nF.D.A. approval of polidocanol should benefit patients several ways. Often the concentrations of polidocanol from compounding pharmacies were \u201cwrong\u201d and had \u201clots of contaminants\u201d that could damage the skin where injected, according to Dr. Robert A. Weiss, a dermatologist who directs the Laser, Skin and Vein Institute. By contrast, he said by e-mail, Asclera \u201cis very safe for skin.\u201d\n\nAn injector\u2019s experience matters, because if the injection misses the vein, (or open sores) can occur. In these rare, worst-case scenarios, Asclera is relatively forgiving and less likely to lead to ulceration.\n\nVein specialists must first figure out which patients would benefit from sclerotherapy alone, and which need inner varicose veins treated before injections. Using to map inner veins as well as visible ones is crucial for patients who complain of enlarged veins and symptoms like achy pain. \u201cThe underlying veins have to be addressed before you can even think of addressing the visible bulging veins,\u201d said Dr. Robert J. Min, radiologist in chief at . \u201cOtherwise they\u2019ll just come back.\u201d\n\nToday, sluggish underlying veins are best addressed with radio-frequency or laser treatment, said Dr. Min, who developed such a laser. Yet, he said both are \u201cvery safe and effective, and a heck of a lot better than surgery.\u201d (It entailed ripping out the groin-to-ankle vein with a wire via an incision.)\n\nFor Dianne Brought, who manages a clothing shop in , Md., each time Dr. Weiss injected her with STS, she felt only \u201ca little tiny pinch.\u201d But she cautioned that if \u201canybody hates needles they will mind it.\u201d Ms. Brought, 57, said her legs used to have \u201cvery nasty veins\u201d and her calves hurt. She is still due for treatments, so some veins remain visible, but they are no longer raised. She now wears sundresses instead of just selling them in her boardwalk shop.\n\nSome vein specialists use liquid irritants like STS or polidocanol to make an injectable foam that targets larger varicose veins. Why? A \u201csudsy foam will fill up the vein, come into full contact with the lining of the vein wall, whereas liquid works for very small veins only,\u201d said Dr. Nisha Bunke, a vein specialist. She said veins as large as a Sharpie marker can be tackled with foam sclerotherapy. But the F.D.A. considers a foam version of STS or polidocanol to be a different product from the liquid. So injecting it is an off-label use.\n\nDr. Min said in an e-mail message that foam sclerotherapy was \u201cvery safe,\u201d but that \u201cit is associated with higher risks than liquid sclerotherapy.\u201d Foam injections have been blamed as the cause of blood clots in leg veins, he wrote, adding that one known stroke \u201cmay have been caused by foam sclerotherapy.\u201d\n\nBut foam sclerotherapy has been a big relief for some patients. Judson Emerick, an art history professor at Pomona College in Claremont, Calif., had varicose veins so troublesome that he kept getting skin ulcers that failed to heal.

In new research that could suggest a road to cure, scientists at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Boston Children's Hospital have found that CML stem cells die in response to inhibition of a protein called Ezh2. Drugs that target the protein are currently being tested in clinical trials for other cancers.\n\nThe findings, reported online today by the journal Cancer Discovery, raise the prospect that Ezh2 blockers, in combination with Gleevec and similar drugs, could eradicate the disease in some patients in relatively rapid fashion or could be an effective therapy for those who become resistant to Gleevec-like agents, the authors state.\n\nIn a paper published simultaneously by Cancer Discovery, a team of Scottish scientists report similar findings using a different research approach.\n\n\"The vast majority of patients with CML do remarkably well on imatinib [Gleevec] and similar drugs: The disease is well controlled and side effects are tolerable,\" says Stuart Orkin, MD, the study's senior author and a pediatric hematologist/oncologist at Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center. \"In only 10-20 percent of patients, however, are the leukemia cells fully cleared from the body. The other 90 percent retain a reservoir of leukemic stem cells - which initiate the disease - and must stay on the drugs permanently.\"\n\nCML is a slowly progressing type of blood cancer that develops in the bone marrow. Primarily occurring in adults, it is rare in children.\n\nOver time, some patients develop resistance to Gleevec and other drugs that block BCR-ABL, the misbegotten \"fusion\" protein that drives CML growth. Although second- and third-line targeted therapies can often return the disease to remission, some patients don't benefit from these drugs or develop severe side effects.\n\nThe new study grew out of efforts to discover whether different types of cancer are susceptible to Ezh2 inhibitors. In laboratory experiments, the Dana-Farber/Boston Children's researchers found not only that Ezh2 is overabundant in leukemia stem cells but that it helps them survive and give rise to full-fledged CML cells. Follow-up studies in mice showed that inactivating Ezh2 through gene-editing techniques caused CML stem cells to die, halting the disease at its source.\n\n\"The stem cells' dependence on Ezh2 suggests they will be especially vulnerable to drugs that target the protein,\" Orkin remarks. \"Such drugs are already in clinical trials for other diseases, including lymphoma and some solid tumors.\"\n\nEpizyme, a biopharmaceutical company based in Cambridge, MA, recently opened a pediatric trial of an Ezh2 inhibitor for children with rhabdoid and other tumors. Dana-Farber/Boston Children's is a site in the multi-center Phase 1 trial.\n\nAlthough adding Ezh2-targeting agents to the standard drug regimen for CML has the potential to dramatically shorten the treatment period for many patients, ethical considerations may lead to the agents' first being tested in patients who don't respond to Gleevec and similar drugs, either initially or after drug resistance develops, Orkin remarks. \"Our findings suggest inhibition of Ezh2 should be considered as a way to eradicate CML when used in combination with current targeted therapies. It offers a promising approach to shortening the duration of therapy in order to achieve a cure.

But the researchers wanted to know if the drug, when combined with statin treatment, could also reduce the risk of heart disease in people with type 2 diabetes.

The international study found that it protects against HPV infection in women older than 26 years. Vaccination programs worldwide currently target routine vaccination of women 26 years and younger.\n\nThe study recruited women in 12 countries across four continents. Cosette Wheeler, PhD, at The University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, was the lead author of the report.\n\nWhyThe human papillomaviruses cause cancer of the cervix, anus, and middle throat. Five types of HPV account for about 85 percent of all invasive cervical cancer cases. HPV vaccines are expected to prevent most of these cancer cases.\n\nMany countries routinely vaccinate girls and boys 25 years and younger, although vaccination rates in the United States remain low. In the US, only about 40 percent of girls and 21 percent of boys receive the three-dose vaccination series. The earlier the vaccine is given, the more efficacious it can be.\n\nThis study focused on the benefit of vaccinating women 26 years and older. Infection with HPV can take place at any time throughout adulthood and women in this age group may have already been exposed to HPV. The study showed that women in this age group were still protected from HPV infections.\n\nThe scientists followed each woman for four to seven years. They found that the vaccine protected the women against HPV infections during the follow-up period and that the women were protected from many types of HPV across a broad age range. These study results are essential to new approaches in cancer prevention, particularly those that are investigating combined approaches of cervical screening and vaccination in adult women.\n\nWhoCosette Wheeler, PhD is a UNM Regents Professor in the Departments of Pathology and Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center.

So it\u2019s difficult to think about how a single shot might work against all the different HIV subtypes circulating around the world.\n\nBut scientists may be inching toward a vaccine that could tackle HIV\u2019s genetic diversity and prevent the virus from taking hold in people.\n\nResearchers from the National Institutes of Health and Johnson & Johnson at the International AIDS Society conference in Paris Monday morning presented data on a clinical trial of what\u2019s called the \u201cAd26-env mosaic vaccine.\u201d\n\nThe mosaic vaccine was developed using a computer algorithm to analyze HIV data from around the world and select a range of HIV sequences to include in a shot. It\u2019s called a \u201cmosaic\u201d because it involves taking pieces of different viruses and sticking them together to generate immune responses that can cover a broad range of HIV subtypes.\n\n\u201cOne of the great challenges for development of HIV vaccine is viral diversity,\u201d said Dan Barouch, a lead researcher on the vaccine and director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. \u201cThe mosaic strategy is one way to attempt to deal with the global virus diversity.\u201d\n\nA word of caution, though: We\u2019re only in the early phase of human testing, and the vaccine could ultimately fail to prevent the virus from spreading among people. But so far, the HIV community is carefully watching the Ad26 vaccine research because the approach seems quite promising.\n\nThe mosaic approach seems promising in very early clinical research\n\nIn the 35 years of the HIV epidemic, only four HIV vaccine concepts have been tested in humans. The mosaic strategy is the fifth concept, and one of only two HIV vaccines that\u2019s currently part of clinical trials of efficacy in humans. (The other is the HVTN 702 HIV vaccine candidate, now underway in Thailand.)\n\nIn the study of the Ad26 mosaic vaccine, called the APPROACH trial, 393 volunteers in the United States, Rwanda, Uganda, South Africa, and Thailand were randomly assigned to receive one of seven experimental vaccines or a placebo. The mosaic vaccine was the best tolerated and also capable of generating anti-HIV immune responses in all the people who received the shots.\n\nBefore this, studies of the mosaic vaccine in rhesus monkeys showed a 66 percent efficacy rate, meaning 66 percent of monkeys that got the shot were protected from the virus. (With HIV, 50 to 60 percent is about the efficacy range researchers hope for.) Interestingly, in the early human study, the immune response was comparable to the rhesus monkey one, which gave the researchers hope that the vaccine might be similarly effective in people.\n\nWe need more human studies of this HIV vaccine\n\nBut we still don\u2019t know if the vaccine will protect humans from the virus, since the studies so far have only looked at safety and immune responses, not efficacy. And many medicines that look promising in animals, and safe in humans, don\u2019t pan out in clinical trials focused on efficacy.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t use the word excited too much,\u201d said Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH\u2019s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \u201cIt\u2019s a step forward toward getting another candidate into trial that could have some promise.\u201d It\u2019s too soon to say if and when the mosaic vaccine might work to prevent the virus from spreading in humans, he added.\n\nAs for next steps, if the researchers continue to see promising data on the mosaic vaccine from another ongoing study, a larger human efficacy trial will move forward toward the end of the year in southern Africa, involving some 2,600 healthy, HIV-negative women.\n\nDeaths from AIDS have halved since 2005 \u2014 but there\u2019s still a ton of work to be done\n\nWe\u2019ve made remarkable progress against HIV around the world. In 1996, as HIV prevalence was peaking around the world, the United Nations established UNAIDS, the first global health body focused on a single disease. In 2000, the UN Security Council convened an unprecedented meeting to address the out-of-control AIDS crisis. This led to a massive concentration of resources into HIV/AIDS research, and triggered global and coordinated efforts to stem the disease.\n\nResearchers and doctors figured out how to get people tested and diagnosed quickly, and uncovered effective treatments that allowed those with HIV to live long, relatively healthy lives. Public health officials also waged awareness campaigns about prevention, reminding people to practice safe sex with condoms and get tested, and that early HIV treatment can save lives. Recently, researchers even discovered a pill to prevent HIV.\n\nDeaths from AIDS have halved to 1 million since 2005, and UNAIDS estimates almost 20 million people now have access to treatment. (Some of that access is now in jeopardy, however, given that President Donald Trump has proposed cutting $800 million from a key US government AIDS program called PEPFAR in the 2018 budget.)\n\nAn HIV vaccine has long been elusive. The other HIV vaccine in human testing, the HVTN 702 candidate, is a newer version of the only other HIV vaccine to show any efficacy in humans, called RV144. In a trial on the RV144, 31 percent of people who got the vaccine did not develop HIV \u2014 too small a number to be useful. But with the new HVTN trial, researchers hope some tweaks to the vaccine might boost the efficacy rate.\n\n\u201cA safe and effective HIV vaccine would be a powerful tool to reduce new HIV infections worldwide and help bring about a durable end to the HIV/AIDS pandemic,\u201d Fauci said in a statement. \u201cBy exploring multiple promising avenues of vaccine development research, we expand our opportunities to achieve these goals.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The APPROACH trial randomly assigned 393 volunteers from five countries to receive one of seven experimental vaccines or a placebo. \u00a0While the report notes that \u201cthe mosaic vaccine was the best tolerated and also capable of generating anti-HIV immune responses in all the people who received the shots,\u201d one is tempted to ask: Compared to what?

Among other things, breast milk contains natural sources of prebiotics: small, indigestible fiber molecules that promote the growth of good bacteria in the baby's gut. Yet for many families, breastfeeding is difficult or impossible. Fortunately, modern infant formulas are getting closer to the real thing with the help of University of Illinois researchers.\n\nIn a recent study from the Piglet Nutrition and Cognition Lab at U of I, scientists worked with piglets to show prebiotics included in infant formula can enhance memory and exploratory behavior.\n\n\"When we provide prebiotics in formula, our results confirm that we can not only benefit gut health, which is known, but we can also influence brain development,\" says Ryan Dilger, associate professor in the Department of Animal Sciences, Division of Nutritional Sciences, and Neuroscience Program at U of I. \"We can actually change the way piglets learn and remember by influencing bacteria in the colon.\"\n\nPiglets are widely considered a more informative model for human infants than mice and rats; their digestive systems, behavioral responses, and brain development are remarkably similar to human infants. Therefore, researchers are increasingly turning to piglets to test hypotheses in pre-clinical trials related to human health, especially in the context of gut microbes and brain development.\n\n\"There hasn't been a lot of work looking at the gut-brain axis in humans, but a lot of rodent work is showing those connections. This is taking it to an animal model that is a lot closer to human infants and asking if that connection still exists and if we can tease out possible mechanisms,\" says Stephen Fleming, lead author of the study and a doctoral student in the Neuroscience Program at U of I.\n\nIn early 2016, Dilger and his colleagues worked with piglets to show that a combination of innovative formula components, including prebiotics, may play a role in brain development and behavior. In their new study, the team concentrated solely on the effects of prebiotics.\n\nStarting on the second day of life, piglets were given a cow's milk-based infant formula supplemented with polydextrose (PDX), a synthetic carbohydrate with prebiotic activity, and galactooligosaccharide (GOS), a naturally occurring prebiotic. When the piglets were 25 days old, Fleming took them through several learning, memory, and stress tests. After 33 days, blood, brain, and intestinal tissues were collected for analysis.\n\nThe test for learning and memory gave piglets a chance to play with dog toys: one they'd seen before and one brand-new toy. If they spent more time with the new toy, that was an indication that the piglet recognized it as new and preferred it. This \"novel object recognition\" test improves on classic maze tests commonly used in rodent studies.\n\n\"If you're trying to test for memory, this test is closer to what we'd do with an infant. After all, we don't generally train infants on mazes,\" Fleming says. \"We know from previous research this test works for pigs, but this is the first published example of using it in a nutrition context.\"\n\nPigs fed PDX and GOS spent more time playing with new objects than pigs who didn't receive the prebiotic supplements. The preference for novel objects, an indication of natural curiosity, is a sign of healthy brain development and points towards positive development of learning and memory.\n\nWhen prebiotics are working the way they should, good bacteria increase in abundance. One way to tell is by looking at metabolic end-products - volatile fatty acids (VFAs) - excreted by bacteria during digestion of prebiotic fibers.\n\n\"Volatile fatty acids are a global indicator for whether prebiotics had an effect on the overall population of bacteria. For example, we might want to see an increase in Lactobacillus and other beneficial bacteria that produce butyrate,\" Dilger explains. Volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations in the colon, blood, and brain were changed in pigs receiving PDX and GOS compared with control pigs.\n\nRecent evidence suggests that bacterial VFAs could be getting into the blood and traveling to the brain, where they could potentially affect mood and behavior.\n\n\"We found that, yes, VFAs are absorbed in the blood of pigs that were fed PDX/GOS. And, yes, they do get into the brain,\" Fleming explains. \"But when we looked at the relationship between these VFAs and the results of our behavior tests, there did not appear to be a clear connection.\"\n\nAnother surprise was a decrease in serotonin in brains of pigs fed the prebiotic. \"When you hear less serotonin, there's an immediate reaction to say, 'Well, that's bad,'\" Fleming says. Not necessarily; those pigs didn't show greater anxiety than control pigs during a stress test or poorer performance when given a learning and memory test. The researchers hypothesize that the prebiotics may alter levels of tryptophan, serotonin's amino acid precursor, but it's too early to say.\n\nAlthough more work is needed to tackle remaining questions, the study adds to the growing body of research suggesting a strong and potentially modifiable link between the gut and the brain: a link that makers of infant formula should strongly consider.\n\n\"There are so many ways we can alter the composition of the microbiota and they can have very strong benefits. Promoting good 'gut health' remains a strong focus in the field of nutrition,\" Dilger says.\n\nThe article, \"Dietary polydextrose and galactooligosaccharide increase exploratory behavior, improve recognition memory, and alter neurochemistry in the young pig,\" is published in Nutritional Neuroscience.

Stay out of the sun, or utilize a proper sunscreen.\n\nBut a new study published Monday in Cancer suggests that at least one decision our parents make FOR us may have an impact on our predisposition to certain types of cancer.\n\nResearchers at the University of Washington School of Medicine and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center looked at the association between circumcision and the prevalence of prostate cancer. They concluded that circumcision before first sexual intercourse is associated with a 15% reduction in the relative risk of developing prostate cancer.\n\nIt's important to note, right off the bat, that this study is not purporting to establish a cause and effect relationship. As is often the case, there are many additional factors at play.\n\nFirst, a bit of background. It has long been established that men who are uncircumcised are more prone to contracting sexually transmitted infections. As the study's authors point out, \"The mechanism(s) by which circumcision reduced acquisition of an STI [sexually transmitted infection] is thought to be related to the microenvironment of the thin, lightly keratinized mucosal lining of the inner foreskin.\"\n\nThis tissue is subject to small tears that allow potential access of pathogens into the bloodstream. Furthermore, \"The moist environment under the preputial skin may help pathogens survive for extended periods prior to direct infection.\" Circumcision, of course, removes this protective environment.\n\nWhy is this important? Infections are reported to cause almost 20% of cancers worldwide, either directly by infection, or indirectly via inflammation. Several STIs \u2013 such as gonorrhea, Chlamydia, HPV & HIV \u2013 have been found in the prostate.\n\nParticipants in the study were asked about their family\u2019s medical history, which may increase a man\u2019s risk of developing prostate cancer, and their PSA screening history, which can lead to overdiagnosis of the condition. Men were also asked to self-report their circumcision status, number of sexual partners, and their history of STIs.\n\nCircumcision was reported in 68.8% of the cases and 71.5% of the controls. Caucasian men more commonly reported circumcision (69%) than African American men (43%). For 91% who reported circumcision, the procedure was performed shortly after birth.\n\nA few potential caveats to note include the reliance on self-reporting when it comes to a man's history of STIs, as well as his sexual partners. A cursory review of the data suggests, for example, that the number of male sexual partners is greatly underreported. Male-to-male sexual activity has been shown to lead to an increased rate in STIs, including HIV.\n\nThis gives pause to make one wonder what other facts were underreported, though the numbers of circumcised vs. not circumcised do fall in line with national survey results.\n\nThe bottom line from the American Cancer Society: While this is an interesting finding, it's not likely to spur any change in recommendations or medical practice.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The headline for this article \u2014 \u201c\u2018Cutting\u2019 your risk of prostate cancer\u201d \u2014 fails on two levels.

McEvoy, MD, MCR, and her co-authors report that at three months of age, the infants whose mothers took 500 mg of vitamin C in addition to their prenatal vitamin had significantly better forced expiratory flows (FEFs). FEFs measure how fast air can be exhaled from the lung and are an important measure of lung function because they can detect airway obstruction.\n\nThe researchers also discovered an association between the infant FEFs and a genetic variant some of the mothers possessed that appeared to amplify the negative impact of nicotine on the babies before they were born. Other studies have linked this genetic factor, specifically for the \u03b15 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, to increased risk of lung cancer and obstructive lung disease.\n\n\u201cSmoking during pregnancy reflects the highly addictive nature of nicotine that disproportionately affects the most vulnerable populations,\u201d said Dr. McEvoy, lead study author and professor of pediatrics at Oregon Health & Science University. \u201cFinding a way to help infants exposed to smoking and nicotine in utero recognizes the unique dangers posed by a highly advertised, addictive product and the lifetime effects on offspring who did not choose to be exposed.\u201d\n\nIn a previous study, the authors had shown that 72 hours after birth, babies of mothers who smoked had better lung function if their mothers were randomized to vitamin C (500 mg/day) during their pregnancies compared to those born to mothers who smoked and were randomized to placebo. That study used passive methods to measure lung function, and the authors note that FEFs provide a more direct assessment of airway function and are similar to methods used to diagnose lung disease in adults and older children.\n\nIn the current study, 251 pregnant women who smoked were randomly assigned at 13 to 23 weeks of gestation to either receive vitamin C (125 women) or a placebo (126 women). Smoking was defined as having had one or more cigarettes in the last week. All participants received smoking cessation counseling throughout the study, and about 10 percent of the women quit smoking during the study.\n\nThe researchers wrote that study results support the hypothesis that oxidative stress caused by cigarette smoking reduces the amount of ascorbic acid, a component of vitamin C, available to the body. At the time they enrolled in the study, the women had lower levels of ascorbic acid than have been reported among women who do not smoke. Those levels rose in study participants who received vitamin C to become comparable to women who do not smoke.\n\nInfants in this study will continue to be followed to track their lung function and respiratory outcomes. The authors believe that future trials of vitamin C supplementation in pregnant smokers should determine whether the benefits are greater if the supplementation starts earlier and continues postnatally in the babies themselves.\n\nSumming up the findings of the current study, Dr. McEvoy said that a relatively low dosage of vitamin C may present \u201ca safe and inexpensive intervention that has the potential to help lung health of millions of infants worldwide.\u201d\n\nHowever, she added, helping mothers quit smoking should remain the primary goal for health professionals and public health officials. \u201cAlthough vitamin C supplementation may protect to some extent the lungs of babies born to mothers who smoke during pregnancy, those children will still be at greater risk for obesity, behavioral disorders and other serious health issues,\u201d she said.\n\nThis study was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the Office of Dietary Supplements.\n\n\u201cFor mothers who smoke during pregnancy, vitamin C may reduce harm #smoking causes to their babies\u2019 #lungs, finds new study of #vitaminC supplementation. #Nosmokingduringpregnancy.\u201d\n\nAbout the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine\n\nThe AJRCCM is a peer-reviewed journal published by the American Thoracic Society.

Some say their patients don\u2019t have the patience to sit in front of a light for 30 to 45 minutes every morning.

They are alive, with no evidence of cancer, 18 months later. Fifteen other patients who got the same treatment died.\n\nThe report, published online by the journal Science, is the latest result of a three-decade effort by surgeon Steven A. Rosenberg to find ways to manipulate the human immune system to fight cancer.\n\nFour years ago, Rosenberg and his colleagues treated a group of melanoma patients with naturally occurring anti-cancer cells extracted from their tumors, and some of those patients also have had long-term disappearance of their cancers. The new report, however, is believed to be the first time that genetically engineered immune system cells -- specifically, T lymphocytes -- have produced the same effect.\n\nNeither Rosenberg nor others would describe the two patients as cured. At least five years would need to pass before such a declaration would be considered.

Plaque in these arteries is a red flag for a potential heart attack. (Agatston does not make any money from the coronary calcium scan.)\n\nThe other imaging test Agatston recommends is an ultrasound of the carotid artery, looking at plaque in the main blood vessel leading to the brain. Plaque in the carotid artery is a sign of increased risk for a heart attack and stroke.\n\nBoth tests are non-invasive and outpatient, although the calcium scan does expose the patient to the equivalent of several months of normal background radiation.\n\nOne large federally funded study found the coronary calcium score a better predictor of coronary events like a heart attack than the traditional Framingham Risk Score, which considers age, cigarette smoking, blood pressure, total cholesterol and HDL, the \"good\" cholesterol.\n\nAgatston thinks the coronary calcium scan should be routinely scheduled at age 50, like a colonoscopy, or earlier for people with family histories of heart disease.\n\nMost hospitals now offer the imaging tests, some at less than $100 for both, and they are often covered by insurance.\n\nCardiologists now generally use the calcium scan only for patients considered at intermediate risk for heart disease, determined by traditional measures such as cholesterol, blood pressure, lifestyle and family history.\n\nHigh-risk patients already receive such aggressive treatment as cholesterol-lowering statin medication, but many doctors don't think low-risk patients need to incur the expense or small dose of radiation that comes with a coronary calcium scan.\n\n\"There is a large group in the middle called intermediate risk, which may be as much as 50% of the population,\" said Dr. Erin Michos, a cardiologist at the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at Johns Hopkins University\n\nA good candidate for a coronary calcium scan, she says, would be a 50-year-old man with slightly elevated cholesterol and a father who had a heart attack.\n\n\"Do you put this 50-year-old who has this family history on a statin medication with potential expense (and) side effects for the next four decades of his life, or do you further refine how far at risk he is?\" she asked.\n\nA calcium score would answer that question, she says.\n\nThere's a third test Agatston likes: a $65 blood test that looks at a patient's LDL, or bad cholesterol. LDL particles come in different sizes, and patients with a lot of small-particle LDL are more likely to build up plaque in their blood vessels, Agatston says. Alternately, patients with large LDL particles do not tend to accumulate plaque.\n\n\"There are a lot of little old ladies in their 80s with very high cholesterol who have squeaky clean vessels. They have very large particles, and they don't get into the vessel wall,\" Agatston says.\n\nThese new tests give patients a chance to make major changes in their diet and lifestyle, and give doctors an opportunity to treat them with medication.\n\n\"One of the best-kept secrets in the country in medicine is the doctors who are practicing aggressive prevention are really seeing heart attacks and strokes disappear from their practices.

His wife had undergone a colonoscopy, the gold-standard exam that costs about $1,500, but Rowe's internist recommended an alternative that was less invasive and expensive: a virtual colonoscopy, which uses three-dimensional images from a CT scan to detect benign polyps or cancers.\n\n\"It sounded good to me,\" said Rowe, pleased that he could schedule the $800 procedure for 7:45 a.m. at a downtown medical building. Unlike standard colonoscopy, generally performed under anesthesia, in which a long, flexible scope is inserted into the rectum and snaked through the large intestine to find and snip out polyps, the new procedure doesn't require a ride home or a day off. Rowe planned to be at his desk an hour or so later.\n\nInvented 16 years ago by a radiologist who got the idea while playing video games on a flight simulator during advanced training at Johns Hopkins, virtual colonoscopy has become an increasingly popular alternative to standard, or optical, colonoscopy, which is typically performed by a gastroenterologist. Initially regarded as a high-tech novelty, the new procedure has in recent months received key endorsements as a first-line screening test from influential medical groups, notably the American Cancer Society, after several large studies found it to be effective at finding large polyps.\n\nLike other mass screening tests including mammography, the overarching question is whether the benefits of virtual colonoscopy outweigh the risks.\n\nIts supporters, many of them radiologists who read CT scans, tout virtual colonoscopy as a more palatable alternative that has the potential to boost low rates of screening. One of the most common and deadliest malignancies, colon cancer can be prevented -- or even cured -- if detected early. Currently about half of Americans over 50 are screened for the disease; some shun traditional colonoscopy, which is the only way to remove polyps, because of its invasive nature.\n\n\"This is a really good test that's going to find way more cancer than optical colonoscopy,\" said Mark Klein of Washington Radiology Associates, who has performed more than 1,200 virtual colonoscopies since 2002, Rowe's among them. \"Is it perfect? No. But no test is.\"\n\nThe prospects for significant expansion of the procedure, which is covered by a growing number of insurance companies, have collided with a large and unexpected roadblock. In February, officials at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced a preliminary decision not to cover the procedure as a mass screening test for Medicare recipients.\n\nCMS officials, who are scheduled to issue their final ruling May 12, cited reservations expressed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of health experts, and concluded that there is insufficient evidence that virtual colonoscopy would benefit Medicare recipients. CMS cited concerns about radiation exposure and the number of patients who would require follow-up colonoscopies to remove polyps, as well as the inability of CT scans to reliably detect small or flat growths.\n\nMedicare's decision has sparked a furious lobbying campaign. More than 40 members of Congress have signed letters urging federal officials to reconsider, and the dispute has split doctors in the same specialty: the American Gastroenterological Association favors Medicare coverage, while the American College of Gastroenterology does not.\n\nIn many ways, the debate mirrors some of the complexities inherent in overhauling health care, a top priority of the Obama administration. At issue is whether virtual colonoscopy will enhance quality or whether it is, in the words of one physician blogger, \"a proxy for high-tech excesses.\"\n\n\"CMS made the right decision,\" said John Petrini, a Santa Barbara, Calif., gastroenterologist who heads the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. Why, he asks, should patients undergo two tests when one is sufficient?\n\nKlein disagrees. \"They got it completely wrong,\" he said. \"Some people will die from that decision, completely unnecessarily,\" because they won't get a standard colonoscopy.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story does not adequately quantify the benefits of virtual colonoscopy.

Tissue plasminogen activator, known as tPA, can dramatically reverse stroke symptoms in those whose strokes are caused by blood clots and blockages, which account for an estimated 85 percent of all strokes.\n\nStrokes strike about 795,000 Americans each year, killing 137,000, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The condition is a leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States.\n\n\"A tool that can estimate the age of stroke would be of great value in cases of unknown stroke onset time,\" said lead researcher Dr. Catherine Oppenheim, professor of radiology at Universite Paris Descartes in France. \"This concerns as many as a quarter of all stroke patients who cannot be given tPA because they wake up with stroke symptoms or are unable to say when their stroke began.\"\n\nUnder current guidelines, patients who awaken with symptoms are arbitrarily excluded from tPA therapy, Oppenheim said, because the onset is considered to be the last time the patient was symptom-free, which might have been the night before.\n\nThe clot-busting drug is recommended for use only within 4.5 hours of stroke onset because it carries a risk of brain hemorrhage, a potentially fatal prospect, with the risk increasing as more time passes.\n\nThe study, reported online Nov. 2 and in the December issue of the journal Radiology, reinforces results from similar research, Oppenheim said. Her team reviewed MRI images from 130 patients treated for clot-caused strokes at Sainte-Anne Hospital in Paris between May 2006 and October 2008.\n\nOf those patients, whose average age was 64.7 years, 63 underwent MRI within three hours of stroke onset and 67 were imaged between three and 12 hours afterwards. With the MRI data, radiologists could predict with more than 90 percent accuracy which patients had experienced stroke symptoms for longer than three hours.\n\nHowever, the study did not compare patients with unknown stroke onset who received tPA to those who did not, Oppenheim said.\n\n\"Providing stroke neurologists with a reliable marker of stroke age will help to ensure that patients . . . are managed as urgently as those with known stroke onset time,\" she said. \"These results will be useful for centers that offer 24-hour access to acute stroke patients. The main limitation is the limited access to MRI in emergency rooms worldwide.\"\n\nOppenheim said the next step would be clinical trials to validate whether MRIs serve as a \"surrogate clock\" for stroke onset.\n\nSeveral doctors specializing in stroke care were encouraged by Oppenheim's study, though they cautioned further research would be necessary to determine if the results could be replicated.\n\n\"It's potentially helpful, and I don't know that it would take years to prove that,\" said Dr. Larry B. Goldstein, director of the Duke University Stroke Center in Durham, N.C.\n\nGoldstein noted that about 40 percent of stroke patients who arrive at his facility within two hours of symptom onset receive tPA. If they don't, \"the major reason . . . is that they get there too late,\" he said.\n\nDr. Wally Ghurabi, emergency department director at Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center, said a group of ongoing studies there include a similar focus on MRIs and stroke.\n\n\"Really pinpointing the time of onset is so crucial for us. This will definitely give us that edge,\" Ghurabi said. \"I've seen it with my own eyes -- a 60-year-old male or female patient comes into the ER and they're not able to move on one side or speak. A couple of hours later [after therapy], they can walk and talk. What more could we as doctors want?\"\n\nDr. David F. Kallmes, an interventional neuro-radiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., was also optimistic about Oppenheim's results.\n\nThe MRI is \"trying to act as a surrogate clock,\" said Kallmes, who edited Oppenheim's journal article. \"Like any imaging technique, it has a certain accuracy but it won't be perfect. It's certainly an innovative approach for patients with stroke-like symptoms.\"\n\nIn October 2008, the American Heart Association, the American Stroke Association and the European Stroke Association revised their guidelines to recommend that tPA be used up to 4.5 hours after the onset of an ischemic (clot-caused) stroke, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet revised its approved treatment window of 3 hours.\n\nA study in The Lancet Neurology also found that a slight increase in deaths and bleeding in an extended treatment group over a three-month follow-up period underlined the notion that treatment within 3 hours -- although not required -- is still optimal.\n\nReview the warning signs of stroke at the American Stroke Association.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story reported that the test was 90% accurate, but it could have provided more insight to readers about what this \u00a090% means.\nThis study is really just about predicting whether the stroke was in the past 3 hours or not.

But the image that viewers may find most shocking is that of a baby being cut out of a woman's abdomen via Caesarean. This, according to Lake, the executive producer of the film, and Abby Epstein, the film's director, is the right reaction: one of their messages is that C-sections should only be performed when needed to guarantee the well-being of the mother and infant, and should not be a first choice for healthy mothers. New research into the risks associated with elective Caesareans supports their view. In a study, published in October's British Medical Journal, of 97,000 deliveries in 410 Latin American hospitals, perinatal specialist Dr. Jose Villar found the risk of death for mothers who had Caesareans, while slight (.01 percent of the women who delivered vaginally died vs. .04 percent who had elective C-sections), was triple that of those who delivered vaginally. \"The C-section increases risk because it's major surgery,\" Villar says. Mothers who had undergone a Caesarean were also more likely to need blood transfusions and stay in the hospital more than a week after delivery. The risk of death for infants delivered via C-section\u2014who are more likely to have a low birth weight\u2014was double that of vaginal births, and C-section babies were more likely to have respiratory problems. According to a study published in the journal Birth, labor clears liquid from the infant's lungs, preparing the baby to breathe outside the womb. Caesareans impede this process. Yet the rate of Caesareans is spiking: in 2006, C-sections accounted for 31.1 percent of births nationwide, a 50 percent increase over the past 10 years. Natural birth\u2014without drugs or interventions\u2014whether at home or in a hospital, remains a rarity (despite the fact that home births don't have an appreciably higher risk rate than hospital births).\n\nAmid the controversy over what constitutes an ideal birth experience, doctors, researchers and natural-birth advocates agree: Caesareans save lives when medically necessary. But defining medical necessity is complicated. Natural-birth advocates cite a \"cascade of interventions\" caused by hospitals' practice of using the drug Pitocin to stimulate labor. The drug can cause painful contractions, which doctors treat with an epidural painkiller. The epidural can then retard contractions and lead to more drugs, fetal stress and the doctor's recommendation of a Caesarean. Natural-birth advocates say that hospitals, driven by profits and worried about malpractice, are too quick to intervene. \"I compare it to a restaurant. If you have customers who sit at a table and don't order anything, you're not making any money,\" says Jennifer Block, author of \"Pushed: The Painful Truth About Childbirth and Modern Maternity Care.\" Normal labor, Block says, isn't profitable (according to \"The Business of Being Born,\" a Caesarean can cost three times as much as a normal birth). If something does go wrong, in the eyes of the courts \"a normal birth is a risk. The courts reward action,\" Block says.\n\nSome doctors say the increased rate of Caesareans is partially attributable to maternal demand: busy mothers may want to schedule their deliveries. The phrase \"too posh to push\" predates Posh Spice, but reports that celebrities such as Posh (Victoria Beckham) and Britney Spears had Caesareans have popularized the procedure, some doctors say. And some women are scheduling them early. According to the March of Dimes, late preterm delivery (34 to 36 weeks) increased from 7.3 percent to 8.9 percent between 1990 and 2004 in the United States. \"No one knows how much of that is maternal choice,\" says Ann Stark, head of neonatology at Texas Children's Hospital. \"There are certainly women who want timed, elective delivery surgically.\" According to a recent study, attendance at Lamaze classes, which teach women how to manage labor pain without drugs, dropped 14 percent between 2000 and 2005.\n\nAlthough the United States has one the highest rates of Caesareans\u2014and of infant mortality\u2014Villar says the rest of the developed world is catching up. But opinion differs on how to respond. Doctors such as Stark say we need a better sense of what goes on while the baby is still in utero. \"One of the knowledge gaps is a clear understanding of the indications for C-sections,\" she says. (Known indications include breech position of the fetus, and pre-existing medical conditions such as extreme hypertension in the mother.) Naomi Wolf, author of \"Misconceptions: Truth, Lies, and the Unexpected on the Journey to Motherhood,\" blames insurance companies and hospitals, who she says deny women information about their choices. Wolf and other natural-birth advocates say we need a better idea of what normal birth looks like, as movies and TV usually depict the process as painful and bloody. \"We all have this idea that normal birth is a woman lying in a hospital bed screaming,\" says Block.

However, it can be considered a concrete option for patients showing aggressive MS who have not responded to approved treatments,\" said study co-author Dr. Riccardo Saccardi. He's from the cell therapy and transfusion medicine unit at Careggi University Hospital in Florence, Italy.\n\nUsing patients' own stem cells to reboot the immune system is a way to halt the advance of the disease. But the treatment can be risky because the patient's immune system has to be wiped out before the stem cells are transplanted, the researchers said.\n\nIn fact, nearly 3 percent of the patients died shortly after receiving the transplant, and those deaths were directly related to the transplant, the researchers reported.\n\nThose deaths are a major concern, one neurologist said, because MS is not in itself life-threatening.\n\nIn effect, those patients gambled with a treatment that could be fatal for a disease that isn't, said Dr. Michael Racke, a professor in the department of neurology at Ohio State University.\n\nRacke pointed out that stem cell transplants were first used to treat deadly diseases, such as leukemia, lymphoma and other cancers.\n\n\"There may be a population of MS patients that could be identified that might do well with transplant,\" he said. \"It's important to select patients in such a way that they actually get well with the transplant.\"\n\nA trial that compares stem cell transplants with other therapies to see whether stem cell transplants can become a treatment for patients who have progressive MS is about to start, added Racke, who co-authored an editorial that accompanied the study.\n\nMore than 2 million people in the world suffer from MS, in which the body attacks the central nervous system, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.\n\nMS can cause many symptoms, including blurred vision, loss of balance, poor coordination, slurred speech, tremors, numbness, extreme fatigue, problems with memory and concentration, paralysis and blindness.\n\nThese symptoms can come and go, or persist and worsen over time. Most people are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, although individuals as young as 2 and as old as 75 have developed the disease, the society says.\n\nMedications can slow the progression of MS and help patients manage symptoms, but there's no cure.\n\nTo see how patients did over the long term after stem cell transplants, Saccardi and colleagues followed 281 patients from 13 countries who received stem cell transplants between 1995 and 2006.\n\nThe researchers found that 46 percent of the patients experienced progression-free survival at five years after transplant.\n\nWithin 100 days of transplant, however, eight patients died (nearly 3 percent). Those deaths were related to the transplants, Saccardi said.\n\nThe researchers think these deaths were most likely due to the transplant technology used before 2006, which has since improved.\n\nThe report was published online Feb. 20 in the journal JAMA Neurology.\n\nDr. Paul Wright is chair of neurology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., and Long Island Jewish Medical Center, in New Hyde Park, N.Y.

This new study is important to raise our antennae and spur new research, but it wasn\u2019t designed to prove the effect of aspirin.\nOf course, the article\u2019s take-home message is the same one that many in the field (including the FDA) may derive from this study. The aspirin finding is most relevant to current practice, both for the use of ticagrelor globally now and perhaps soon in the US. It\u2019s also valuable for thinking about aspirin in this setting in general. However, we think the \u00a0context should not be boiled off from the message. \nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind the limitations of this reported benefit, as we discussed under Evaluate the Quality of Evidence. The details are statistical, such as the weakening of a study\u2019s power by repeatedly slicing and dicing the same data, which is beyond the scope of this article. But we think more of the big picture would have been appropriate.\u00a0For journalists, the big picture is a question of tone, of conveying the caution urged by the researchers, For doctors, the big picture is that only future randomized trials can investigate whether the pattern observed in this study with aspirin dose is a true effect, a red herring resulting from chance, or a surrogate marker of another factor that\u2019s more important to target.\nAdditionally, the benefit is quantified as a relative risk reduction.

That's important because many patients stop taking other drugs due to side effects or frequent dosing.\n\nWall Street sees denosumab as a potential blockbuster crucial to Amgen. But with many cheaper, heavily advertised treatments, doctors view its expected high cost as a drawback. Genetically engineered drugs, made by altering a cell's DNA or other genetic material, all cost more than $10,000 a year.\n\n\"It'll find a particular niche where it'll be used, but I don't see it as taking over the market,\" said Dr. Sundeep Khosla, a professor and osteoporosis researcher at the Mayo Clinic.\n\nStill, he called the drug a \"tour de force of modern molecular medicine\" because it is potent and was designed by making antibodies cloned over and over from cells in the lab to block one pathway involved in the how the body naturally breaks down bone cells.\n\nDenosumab would be the first osteoporosis treatment that is such a monoclonal antibody \u2014 a type of immune cell cloned from the same parent cell to bind to a specific substance. In this case, it targets a molecule in bones that drives formation of cells called osteoclasts that break down bone, a strategy that greatly reduces bone loss.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday released its review of denosumab, with staff citing concerns about increased rates of skin infections and some tumors. That report comes just ahead of a meeting Thursday when outside advisers will weigh the drug's safety and effectiveness and recommend whether to approve it.\n\nAmgen shares rose $1.57, or 2.6 percent, to close at $62.81.\n\nDenosumab, an injection just under the skin, would have to compete against eight major types of pills and injected medicines, including estrogen and generic and brand-name Fosamax pills, long the market leader.\n\nMost of those must be given more often, with pills swallowed once a day, week or month, a nasal spray inhaled daily, and one injection under the skin given daily. But another injection given intravenously is only needed once a year, and estrogen, while out of fashion due to its link to breast cancer, is available in skin patches changed once or twice a week.\n\nThose drugs' annual retail cost can range from $385 for generic Fosamax, to roughly $1,250 for most brand-name pills, to $11,100 for injected Forteo, which must be injected daily.\n\nGlobal sales of osteoporosis treatments, including hundreds of vitamin brands, hit nearly $8.4 billion last year, according to data from IMS Health.

Half got denosumab injections every six months for three years. They had 68 percent fewer spine fractures and 40 percent fewer hip fractures than the study participants who got dummy shots.\n\nThe second study included 1,468 men with prostate cancer at increased fracture risk due to cancer hormone therapy, although 556 dropped out for reasons from side effects and cancer progression to the study being extended from two to three years. Denosumab cut the risk of spine fractures 62 percent over three years compared to dummy shots. Spine bone density loss was far smaller for those given the drug.\n\nUntil recently, studies of osteoporosis drugs just measured changes in bone density, assumed to equate with lower fracture risk. Newer studies also measure fracture rates, but there are no head-to-head studies on that.\n\nHowever, based on some prior studies, independent experts say denosumab appears more effective at preventing spine fractures than three older pills \u2014 Fosamax, Actonel and Boniva \u2014 and calcitonin nasal sprays, which all use various pathways to slow down cells called osteoclasts that break down bone. Experts think denosumab prevents spine fractures about as well as Reclast, an intravenously injected drug that slows bone breakdown, and daily just below the skin injections of Forteo, the only drug that stimulates bone-building cells called osteoblasts. And denosumab appears to prevent fractures of the hip, forearm and ankle about the same as all those drugs.\n\nDr. Jacob Warman, an osteoporosis expert at Brooklyn Hospital Center, said denosumab might have potential as an add-on to existing drugs to boost results. He expects that would be covered by insurers, who pay for multiple medicines for other conditions.\n\nAmgen spokeswoman Kerry Beth Daly said the company has not yet set a price for the drug, but will try to keep it affordable.

In just five days, all 18 people fully recovered. This small but stunningly successful trial offers hope to address the growing problem of drug-resistant malaria.\n\nDetails of the cases are documented in the paper \"Artemisia annua dried leaf tablets treated malaria resistant to ACT and i.v. artesunate: case reports\" by an international team lead by Pamela Weathers, PhD, professor of biology and biotechnology at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), who has pioneered the use of dried leaves of Artemisia annua (DLA) as a malaria therapy.\n\n\"To our knowledge, this is the first report of dried-leaf Artemisia annua controlling ACT-resistant malaria in humans,\" the authors of the Phytomedicine paper note, adding that more comprehensive clinical trials on patients with drug-resistant malaria are warranted. \"Successful treatment of all 18 ACT-resistant cases suggests that DLA should be rapidly incorporated into the antimalarial regimen for Africa,\" they added, \"and possibly wherever else ACT resistance has emerged.\"\n\nWatch a video about research at WPI related to this study.\n\nThe report documents the experiences of 18 patients in the North Kivu province of the Democratic Republic of Congo who showed symptoms of malaria and were originally treated with the recommended medication: artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), which blends artemisinin, a chemical extract from Artemisia annua, with one or more other drugs that attack the malaria parasite in different ways.\n\nThe 18 patients, ranging in age from 14 months to 60 years, did not respond to the standard ACT treatment, and all lapsed into severe malaria, defined by symptoms that can include loss of consciousness, respiratory distress, convulsions, and pulmonary edema. One patient, a five-year-old child, became comatose. All were then treated with intravenously administered artesunate, the frontline medication for severe malaria, but again they showed no improvement.\n\nAs a last resort, doctors turned to dried-leaf Artemisia (DLA), a therapy developed and extensively studied by Weathers and her team at WPI. After five days of treatment with tablets made from only the dried and powered leaves of Artemisia (which has been prepared and analyzed using methods developed by Weathers and postdoctoral fellow Melissa Towler), all 18 patients fully recovered. Laboratory tests showed they had no parasites remaining in their blood. (Weathers noted more than 100 other drug-resistant patients also have been successfully treated with DLA tablets.)\n\n\"These 18 patients were dying,\" Weathers said. \"So to see 100 percent recover, even the child who had lapsed into a coma, was just amazing. It's a small study, but the results are powerful.\"\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 212 million people contracted malaria in 2015 and some 429,000 died, with young children and pregnant women being particularly vulnerable. Caused by a mosquito-borne parasite, the illness is reported in nearly 100 countries and threatens nearly half of the world's population. ACT, the current recommended therapy, is expensive to produce and is in short supply in areas hit hardest by the disease. In addition, while the combination therapy is designed to be less prone to the drug resistance that has rendered previous antimalarial agents ineffective, increasingly the malaria parasite is showing signs of resistance to ACT, particularly in Southeast Asia.\n\nWeathers began her research on artemisinin and Artemesia annua (also known as sweet wormwood) more than 25 years ago. In recent years, she has turned her attention to the use of DLA as an alternative to conventional antimalarial drugs. Noting that Artemisia annua, which is classified as a generally regarded as safe (GRAS) herb, has been consumed by humans and used as an herbal therapy for thousands of years, often in the form of a tea, she became intrigued by the potential for using the dried plant, rather than just a chemical extract, as a malaria treatment. A study she published in Photochemistry Reviews in 2011 was the first to demonstrate that dried leaves of the Artemisia annua plant delivers 40 times more artemisinin to the blood than does the drug based on the chemical extract of the plant.\n\nIn a paper published in PLOS ONE the following year, Weathers and her team showed that not only does DLA have antimalarial properties, it is more effective in knocking out the parasite and reduced the level of parasite infection more completely in mice. In a 2015 study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the WPI researchers, with colleagues at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, showed that dried Artemisia leaves cured rodents infected with malaria strains that were known to be resistant to artemisinin. And, in an experiment that accelerated the evolution of the malaria parasite by passing it through up to 49 generations of mice, the parasite showed no signs of resistance to DLA.\n\nWeathers says the superior performance of DLA in comparison to ACT, as well as its ability to kill drug-resistant parasites and avoid the resistance trap, itself, is likely due to the synergistic effects of a complex array of phytochemicals contained in the plant's leaves, several of which are also known to have antimalarial properties and others of which may act both to enhance the absorption of artemisinin into the bloodstream and bolster its effectiveness against malaria. In effect, the dried leaves constitute a robust natural combination therapy, one whose benefits far surpass those of ACT and other combination drugs.\n\n\"We have done a lot of work to understand the biochemistry of these compounds, which include a number of flavonoids and terpenes, so we can better understand the role they play in the pharmacological activity of the dried leaves,\" Weathers said. \"The more we learn, the more excited we become about the potential for DLA to be the medication of choice for combatting malaria worldwide. Artemisia annua is known to be efficacious against a range of other diseases, including other tropical maladies and certain cancers, so in our lab we are already at work investigating the effectiveness of DLA with other diseases.\"\n\nAnother advantage of DLA over conventional malaria treatments is its low cost and the relative simplicity of its manufacture, Weathers said. While the processes for manufacturing ACT is costlier and requires a higher degree of expertise, producing DLA tablets can be accomplished with simpler equipment and a modest amount of training. Growing Artemisia annua and producing and testing the tablets, Weathers noted, are ideal local business that can provide jobs in impoverished areas and greatly expand access to antimalarial therapy.\n\nIn fact, she has already established a supply chain in Africa that includes growing and harvesting high-producing cultivars in East Africa, along with GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) processing operations in Uganda where the leaves are dried, pulverized, and homogenized, where the powder is compacted into tablets, and where the tablets are tested to verify their dosage. This supply chain helped produce the tablets used to treat the 18 patients in the Democratic Republic of Congo. \"This simple technology can be owned, operated, and distributed by Africans for Africans,\" Weathers said.\n\nFounded in 1865 in Worcester, Mass., WPI is one of the nation's first engineering and technology universities.

They also were published online by the New England Journal of Medicine and will be in the April 12 issue.\n\nResearchers from Canada and the United States followed more than 2,200 patients who had symptoms of heart disease but were considered stable, reports CBS News medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook. Half of these low-risk patients received stents and medication. The other half were given only medication: drugs to lower cholesterol, control blood pressure and prevent clotting.\n\nTo the surprise of the researchers, both groups fared about the same: approximately 19 percent had a heart attack or died within seven years, adds LaPook.\n\nAngioplasty remains the top treatment for people having a heart attack or hospitalized with worsening symptoms. But most angioplasties are done on a non-emergency basis, to relieve chest pain caused by clogged arteries crimping the heart's blood supply.\n\nThose patients now should try drugs first, experts say. If that does not help, they can consider angioplasty or bypass surgery, which unlike angioplasty, does save lives, prevents heart attacks and gives lasting relief of chest pain.\n\nIn the study, only one-third of the people treated with drugs ultimately needed angioplasty or a bypass.\n\n\"You are not putting yourself at risk of death or heart attack if you defer,\" and considering the safety worries about heart stents used to keep arteries open after angioplasty, it may be wise to wait, said Dr. Steven Nissen, a Cleveland Clinic heart specialist and president of the College of Cardiology.\n\nWhy did angioplasty not help more?\n\nIt fixes only one blockage at a time whereas drugs affect all the arteries, experts said. Also, the clogs treated with angioplasty are not the really dangerous kind.\n\n\"Even though it goes against intuition, the blockages that are severe that cause chest pain are less likely to be the source of a heart attack than segments in the artery that are not severely blocked,\" said Dr. David Maron, a Vanderbilt University cardiologist who helped lead the new study.\n\nAbout 1.2 million angioplasties are done in the United States each year. Through a blood vessel in the groin, doctors snake a tube to a blocked heart artery. A tiny balloon is inflated to flatten the clog and a mesh scaffold stent is usually placed.\n\nThe procedure already has lost some popularity because of emerging evidence that popular drug-coated stents can raise the risk of blood clots months later. The new study shifts the argument from which type of stent to use to whether to do the procedure at all.\n\nAbout 40 percent of patients in the study had a prior heart attack more than three months previously.\n\n\"We deliberately chose to enroll a sicker, more symptomatic group\" to give angioplasty a good chance to prove itself, Boden said.\n\nAll were treated with medicines that improve chest pain and heart and artery health such as aspirin, cholesterol-lowering statins, nitrates, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers. All also were counseled on healthy lifestyles \u2014 diet, exercise and smoking cessation.\n\nHalf of the participants also were assigned to get angioplasty.\n\nAfter an average of 4\u00bd years, the groups had similar rates of death and heart attack: 211 in the angioplasty group and 202 in the medication group.\n\nNeither treatment proved better for any subgroups like smokers, diabetics, or older or sicker people.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story does give the rate of heart attack or death as 19% within 7 years for both the stent and the medication group.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. - Aug. 17, 2015 - Every year falls affect approximately one in three older adults living at home, with approximately one in 10 falls resulting in serious injury.

Then it fell out of favor.\n\nToday, the most common reason for the surgery is \"sleep disordered breathing,\" a broad diagnosis that includes sleep apnea and snoring. About 10 percent of elementary-school-age children snore.\n\nDoctors say snoring can cause bed-wetting, behavior problems, short stature and poor school performance. That's a far cry from the 1950s and '60s, when tonsillectomy was used to fight frequent sore throats.\n\nBack then, it was the most popular surgery in the United States. In the 1960s sitcom Leave It to Beaver, Beaver Cleaver was so impressed by his dad's tales of ice cream and pretty nurses that he schemed to have his tonsils out, even though he didn't need it.\n\nThe tonsils are two glands that sit at the base of the tongue and are part of the body's immune system. The premise of tonsillectomies, back in their heyday, was that tonsils get infected themselves and no longer help fend off germs.\n\nThen doctors started noticing that kids were still getting sore throats, even after having their tonsils taken out. But it wasn't until clinical trials were completed in the early 1980s that there was proof that tonsillectomy really only helped children with severe, recurrent throat infections.\n\n\"It was becoming unacceptable to just take tonsils out because they were there or you had a few infections,\" says Richard Rosenfeld, an ear, nose and throat doctor at SUNY Downstate in Brooklyn, N.Y. \"People were growing up with their tonsils.\"\n\nBut growing up with tonsils can create another problem: snoring. Lisa Moran of Takoma Park, Md., remembers what it sounded like when her son ,Tyler Scorza, now age 7, slept.\n\n\"It was loud,\" Moran says. \"You could hear him through he closed door, down the hall, snoring, and he would occasionally stop breathing.\"\n\nAt first, Tyler's pediatrician thought he'd outgrow the snoring. But he wasn't sleeping well and often didn't have any energy. The doctor recommended a head X-Ray, and the radiologist said that though Tyler's adenoids were enlarged, they weren't that bad.\n\nBy then, Tyler had been dealing with this for almost three years. He started getting frequent nasal infections. So his parents took him to an ear, nose and throat doctor. He said, sure, the adenoids are swollen.\n\n\"But the real problem is the tonsils!\" Moran recalls. \"He showed us on the X-ray that there was a tiny passage between the tonsils and the back of his throat \u2014 very small.\"\n\nEnlarged tonsils (and adenoids) are the most common cause of sleep-disordered breathing in children. So the doctor recommended tonsillectomy.\n\nBut Tyler's parents were worried about the surgery. It's usually done as an outpatient procedure now, but with general anesthesia. That's never without some risk.\n\n\"Your child is under,\" says Moran, \"completely under. This is not a local.\"\n\nOther complications include pain after surgery and the risk of bleeding; about 4 percent of people have complications that require readmission to the hospital.\n\nDespite hundreds of studies, there's still surprisingly little research on whether tonsillectomy really helps reduce the risk of sore throats. The operation continues to be controversial.\n\nNo less a personage than President Obama dissed tonsillectomy when he was stumping for health care overhaul in July 2009. In a prime time news conference, Obama said that doctors may think: \" 'You know what? I make a lot more money if I take this kid's tonsils out.' \"\n\nRosenfeld disputes Obama's claim, saying insurers usually pay a surgeon $200 to $300 for tonsil surgery.\n\nThe picture is further clouded because not all children with big tonsils have sleep-disordered breathing or frequent throat infections. Because of that, in 2002 the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that children have a sleep study before surgery is considered.\n\nAbout 530,000 tonsillectomies are performed in the United States each year. Obviously, parents could use some help in deciding whether surgery is needed. In January, the American Academy of Otolaryngology issued its first guidelines on tonsillectomy in children.\n\nWith sore throats, the ENTs recommend waiting (and treatment with antibiotics, if needed), unless a child has more than seven infections in a year. They'd recommend surgery if a child has five or more throat infections a year for two years, or three or more in three years.\n\nThere have been very few randomized studies on the effects of tonsillectomy for sleep-disordered breathing. Most of the researchers have asked parents or children whether they noticed improvements, and looked at a single measure, like behavior or quality of life. Still, the ENTs recommend tonsillectomy for sleep-disordered breathing, saying it reduces symptoms in most children.\n\nTyler's family decided to go ahead with the surgery; they went to the hospital at 5 a.m., and Tyler was home by noon. The doctors said he would be out of school for a week, but a throat infection kept him home a second week. His classmates sent him get-well cards.\n\nA year later, Tyler is feeling great. And his snoring is gone. \"Completely gone,\" his mom says. \"You can hear a pin-drop quiet when he sleeps.\"\n\nTyler still hears snoring at night, he says.

These are early results, but if replicated may mean that treatment of some mental health problems could benefit from the inclusion of dietary advice. This is presented at the ECNP Conference in Barcelona.\n\nBipolar Disorder (which used to be called 'manic depression') is characterised by episodes of mood swings, between being very up or very down with periods in between the two extremes. The fact that there are two opposite sets of symptoms means that finding an effective treatment is difficult. While current medications are useful, they are better at targeting mania symptoms (the 'up' phase), leaving a lack of effective treatment for people experiencing depressive episodes. Now a group of Australian, German and American scientists have shown those who have a high quality diet, a less inflammatory diet, and/or a low BMI (Body Mass Index) may respond better to an add-on nutraceutical treatment provided as part of a clinical trial.\n\n\"If we can confirm these results, then it's good news for people with Bipolar Disorder, as there is a great need for better treatments for the depressive phase of Bipolar Disorder\" said lead researcher Melanie Ashton of Deakin University in Australia.\n\nA total of 133 participants were randomly assigned to take a combination of nutraceuticals (compounds derived from foods such as vitamins or minerals that treat or prevent a disease or disorder) including the anti-inflammatory amino acid n-acetylcysteine (NAC), or NAC alone, or a placebo (a dummy pill) for 16 weeks. Participants received the study medication in addition to any stable treatments they were already receiving. Researchers measured BMI at the beginning of the study, and then measured depression and how a person is able to function in their day to day life. Researchers also rated whether a participant was improving and, if so, how much, over the next 20 weeks. Participants filled in a questionnaire about what they usually eat over the year and researchers calculated a diet quality score, where good diets included a healthy diet with lots of fruit and vegetables, whereas poorer-quality diets had more saturated fat, refined carbohydrates and alcohol. These types of diets were then categorised as either anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory based on foods that affect inflammation.\n\nMelanie Ashton continued, \"We found that people who had a better-quality diet, a diet with anti-inflammatory properties, or a lower BMI, showed better response to add-on nutraceutical treatment than did those who reported a low-quality diet, or a diet including foods that promote inflammation, or who were overweight.\n\nWhat this means, if these results can be repeated in a larger trial, is that treatment for Bipolar Disorder would need to take into account what a person eats and their weight.\n\nThere are some points we need to note about this study. This is a randomised, controlled trial, but what we found were exploratory outcomes; in other words, it wasn't the main result that we were testing. Our result is statistically significant, but because the study wasn't specifically designed to test the effect of diet quality,\n\ninflammatory diets and BMI on drug response in general, it is necessary to see the work replicated in a larger study before any firm conclusions can be formed\".\n\n\"This is interesting work, which holds out the possibility that patients with Bipolar Disorder may benefit from a balanced diet.

It's potentially huge.\"\n\n\"This is something we've been waiting to see,\" he continued.\n\n\"This directly interferes with the genetic mechanisms that promote cancer to stop the production of a particular protein,\" added Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. \"This is one step away from getting into the actual DNA.\"\n\nAs reported online March 21 in Nature, this is the first time the process, known as RNA interference (RNAi), has been shown to work in humans.\n\nThe process of RNA interference involves putting two strands of RNA together to form so-called \"small interfering RNAs\" (siRNAs) and inserting them into cells. Once there, these interlopers cut the messenger RNA (mRNA) that is ordinarily used to make specific proteins. This discovery won the Nobel Prize in 2006.\n\nBut the work that nabbed the prize was done in worms -- a far cry from humans.\n\nAnd there were other challenges, not the least of which was how to get the siRNAs into the appropriate cell and then make sure they did what they were supposed to do.\n\nThis team, from the California Institute of Technology (CalTech), devised a super-small nanoparticle system that, when injected into the body, would make its way to the tumor, deposit the siRNAs into the tumor cell and leave them to their assigned task.\n\nThis early-phase clinical trial involved actual patients with melanoma, a particularly virulent form of skin cancer.\n\nThe experiment proceeded just as planned, as biopsies later showed.\n\nThe researchers injected the cargo-laden nanoparticles into the patients, much as you would administer a flu or any other type of shot. They did not inject directly into the tumor as many other researchers have done.\n\nThe nanoparticles made their way smoothly to the target -- the tumor cell -- and cleaved the mRNA in just the right place, stopping production of the culprit protein.\n\nThe precision of the process is crucial to limiting side effects, the researchers said.\n\n\"Now you can go selectively at proteins involved in the disease and not have off-target effects,\" explained Mark E. Davis, lead author of the paper, and professor of chemical engineering at CalTech in Pasadena. \"Normally when you make drugs, it's hard to say 'attack only that protein.' In this particular case, I'm going to go in at the genetic level and eliminate that one protein I want to eliminate.\"\n\nAnd unlike conventional gene therapy -- where the offending gene is replaced by a new one or overridden -- this therapy is reversible, said Adams.\n\n\"This will run its course. Ultimately, it will restore itself,\" he said.\n\nThe authors believe the same system could provide a highly targeted, selective way to reach many different genes and affect tumors that have untll now eluded drug therapy.\n\nObviously, the process will have to be refined and optimized before it's actually used for treatment.\n\n\"This is the first qualitative 'yes, we can do it' publication and it really has to be kept in that perspective,\" Adams said.\n\nThere's more on RNA interference at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Didn\u2019t give readers any sense of how many samples were tested and what the results were.\u00a0 The Reuters story at least explained that the researchers reported on results in three tissue samples.

Gastric bypass patients cut an average of 111 pounds, while duodenal switch patients dropped about 162.\n\nBut those extra pounds came with nearly double the complication rate.\n\nOf the 29 duodenal switch patients, 62 percent had problems like abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea and intestinal obstruction. And several suffered long-term malnutrition \u2014 something not seen in the gastric bypass group.\n\nDuodenal switch is not a popular procedure. In a 2008 study, it accounted for just 1 percent of weight-loss, or bariatric, surgeries done in the U.S., and 5 percent in Europe.\n\nThe technique is often reserved for \u201csuperobese\u201d patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 50 or higher \u2014 though some surgeons perform it with less severely obese patients too, explained Dr. Torgeir T. Sovik of Oslo University in Norway, the lead researcher on the new study.\n\n\u201cAs duodenal switch can be associated with more adverse events, this procedure should only be performed in carefully selected patients by a dedicated bariatric team,\u201d Sovik told Reuters Health in an email. \u201cAnd a closer follow-up after surgery is required after such procedures.\u201d\n\nBut an expert not involved in the study went further.\n\n\u201cThis is an operation that should probably go away,\u201d said Dr. Edward H. Livingston, a professor and surgeon at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.\n\nThe average weight loss seen with either gastric bypass or duodenal switch will improve or reverse obesity-related ills like diabetes, sleep apnea and knee arthritis, according to Livingston, who wrote an editorial published with the study.\n\nSo for those medical conditions, it probably wouldn\u2019t matter if a person lost 100 pounds or 150 pounds over two years.\n\nBMI is a measure of weight relative to height. A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal weight, and above 30 is obese.\n\nThe patients in the current study were a fairly healthy group despite having a BMI of 50 or more.\n\nAfter two years, those who\u2019d had a duodenal switch showed a greater improvement in their cholesterol levels. But those levels were near-normal (in both groups) to begin with, Livingston noted.\n\nThat begs the question, he said, of whether the extra weight loss \u201cactually accomplished anything.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S., where about 220,000 people underwent weight-loss surgery in 2009, gastric bypass is the most common form chosen.\n\nDuring gastric bypass, the upper portion of the stomach is stapled off to create a smaller pouch that restricts the amount of food a person can eat at one time. The surgeon also creates a bypass around the rest of the stomach and a portion of the small intestine, which limits the body\u2019s absorption of food.\n\nDuodenal switch is more extensive. The surgeon removes part of the stomach, and the remaining \u201csleeve\u201d-like stomach is attached to the final section of the small intestine; that puts even greater limits on the body\u2019s absorption of calories and nutrients.\n\nBoth surgeries carry the long-term risk of nutritional deficiencies, and people need to take supplements and carefully monitor their diets for a lifetime afterward.\n\nBut the risks of nutrient deficiencies are greater with duodenal switch, and include some not seen with gastric bypass, Livingston pointed out.\n\nSome people, for instance, may have severe calcium and vitamin D loss leading to weak and fragile bones. Other problems include severe protein deficiency and night blindness caused by vitamin A deficiency (which is also reversible with extra vitamin A treatment).\n\nIn this study, three of the 29 duodenal switch patients developed protein malnutrition, two developed night blindness, and one had a severe iron deficiency that needed to be treated with iron infusions.\n\nLivingston said his advice to people considering weight-loss surgery is to avoid duodenal switch. \u201cIt\u2019s just not a good operation,\u201d he asserted.\n\nBut he also questioned the value of weight-loss surgery, in general, for severely obese people who do not have medical conditions that stand to improve or resolve after surgery.\n\nIn general, experts say that surgery could be an option for anyone with a BMI of 40 or higher; that translates, roughly, to a man who is at least 100 pounds overweight or a woman who is 80 pounds overweight.\n\nLivingston said he thinks more caution is in order when a very obese person is otherwise healthy.\n\nAlong with the risks of surgery, he said, there is still uncertainty about whether it actually lengthens people\u2019s lives. Some studies have suggested it might, but not all.\n\nIn a study recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Livingston and his colleagues found no survival advantage among severely obese patients who\u2019d undergone weight-loss surgery versus those who hadn\u2019t.\n\nThe study involved 850 U.S. veterans who underwent some form of weight-loss surgery, at an average age of about 50, and more than 41,000 vets who had only non-surgical care. There was no evidence that surgery improved longevity over the next seven years.\n\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t even know if there\u2019s a survival benefit,\u201d Livingston said.\n\nThat, he added, makes the risks of duodenal switch seem even less worthwhile.\n\nBut according to Sovik, duodenal switch might be appropriate for some superobese patients.\n\nIn the U.S., he said, about one in three weight-loss surgery candidates have a BMI of 50 or higher. And studies suggest that a sizable percentage of those people will still have a BMI higher than 40 after gastric bypass.\n\nIn this study, one-quarter of gastric bypass patients still had a BMI that high two years after surgery \u2014 versus none of the duodenal switch patients.\n\nMore extensive monitoring after duodenal switch, Sovik noted, can help detect and manage side effects.\n\nHe pointed out, though, that larger, longer-term studies are still needed to show whether the extra weight loss with duodenal switch ultimately improves severely obese patients\u2019 health and extends their lives.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story makes clear that the duodenal switch surgery, in comparison with the bariatric surgery, may give patients greater weight loss in pounds but the value of that reduction is not clear.

Some experts think women should start getting them at age 40. Other think women should discuss the pros and cons of the test at 40, decide on an individual basis and start screens routinely at 50. Otto's study only looked at women aged 49 and older.\n\nOtto tracked 755 patients who died from breast cancer from 1995 to 2003 and another 3,739 control patients matched by age and other measures.\n\nAmong the women with breast cancer, nearly 30 percent of tumors were found at screening and about 34 percent between screens. Nearly 36 percent of these women had never had a mammogram.\n\nAdvanced tumors were found in about 30 percent of the patients who had never been screened but in just over 5 percent of those who had mammograms.\n\nWomen who underwent screening reduced their risk of dying from breast cancer by 49 percent. Women aged 70 to 75 had the greatest risk reduction, reducing the risk of dying from breast cancer by 84 percent. The risk reduction in younger women, aged 50 to 69, was smaller, at 39 percent, but still considered substantial.\n\nThe greater risk reduction in women aged 70 to 75, Otto said, is probably a result of the long-term good effects of screening participation in the earlier target age group, 50 to 69, before the upper age limit for screening was extended in the Netherlands from 69 to 75.\n\nThe study findings ''add to the body of evidence supporting the fact that mammography matters in improving detection and survival,\" said Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"This study focuses on survival.\"\n\nThe study, however, has some limitations, Bernik noted. It's not clear, for instance, whether the women who died of cancer got less aggressive treatment or refused treatment. That could have affected survival, of course.\n\nMammography does lead to ''overtreatment\" in some cases, Bernik acknowledged. Some cancers that are found on mammography may not have proven to be an issue in a woman's lifetime. \"But there is no way to figure out which cancers will be a problem or not,\" she said.\n\nTo learn more about mammograms, visit the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "While making an attempt to quantify benefits, the author frames the information in confusing language that appears to indicate cause and effect: \u00a0\u201cwomen who underwent screening reduced the risk of dying from breast cancer by 49 percent.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Mammography is screening, not treatment, and does not prevent or cure breast cancer.

Of those, between one third and one half have a type of lazy eye known as anisometropia, which is caused by a difference in the degree of nearsightedness or farsightedness between the two eyes.\n\nStandard treatment for children involves eyeglasses or contact lens designed to correct focus issues. However, while this approach is often successful in younger children (between the ages of 3 and 7), it is successful among only about a third of older children (between the ages of 7 and 12).\n\nFor the latter group, doctors will often place a patch over the \"good\" eye temporarily in addition to eyeglasses, and treatment success is typically achieved in two-thirds of cases.\n\nChildren, however, often have trouble adhering to patch therapy, the treatment can bring emotional issues for some and a reverse form of lazy eye can also take root, the researchers said.\n\nStudy author Dr. Dennis S.C. Lam, from the department of ophthalmology and visual sciences and Institute of Chinese Medicine at the Joint Shantou International Eye Center of Shantou University and Chinese University of Hong Kong, and his colleagues report their observations in the December issue of the Archives of Ophthalmology.\n\nIn the search for a better option than patch therapy, Lam and his associates set out to explore the potential benefits of acupuncture, noting that it has been used to treat dry eye and myopia.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2009, Lam and his colleagues recruited 88 children between the ages of 7 and 12 who had been diagnosed with anisometropia.\n\nAbout half the children were treated five times a week with acupuncture, targeting five specific acupuncture needle insertion points (located at the top of the head and the eyebrow region, as well as the legs and hands). The other half were given two hours a day of patch therapy, combined with a minimum of one hour per day of near-vision exercises such as reading.\n\nAfter about four months of treatment, the research team found that overall visual acuity improved markedly more among the acupuncture group relative to the patch group. In fact, they noted that while lazy eye was successfully treated in nearly 42 percent of the acupuncture patients, that figure dropped to less than 17 percent among the patch patients.\n\nNeither treatment prompted significant side effects, the authors said.\n\nThe team nonetheless pointed out that their study's tracking period was relatively short, and that acupuncture is a complicated system that may lend itself to different success rates, depending on the skills of the particular acupuncturist.\n\nAnd while theorizing that the apparent success of this alternative approach may have something to do with stimulating blood flow, retinal nerve growth and visual cortex activity, the authors acknowledged that the exact mechanism by which it works remains poorly understood.\n\nDr. Richard Bensinger, a Seattle-based ophthalmologist and spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, said that the finding is \"certainly suggestive and worth following up.\"\n\n\"This is kind of cool,\" he said. \"But I will say that I don't know of any study looking at acupuncture and vision. There are studies based on symptomatic things such as pain, and I think there's pretty good evidence that it does have benefit in that respect. But for vision therapy this is the first I've heard of it, and I don't know that anyone has ever tried this before. So this is like a teaser.\"\n\n\"Of course people in those parts of the country, like where I live, where there's fairly wide acceptance of alternative medicine might receive this type of treatment better than others,\" Bensinger cautioned. \"And no question patients will gravitate towards treatments that are covered by their insurance even if it's not the best treatment. And as an alternative approach, this may not be covered.\"\n\n\"But if it works,\" he added, \"people will certainly be excited -- although it certainly needs further testing and further studies to decide if it's really beneficial or not.\"\n\nFor his part, Dr. Stanley Chang, chairman of the ophthalmology department at Columbia University in New York City, did not seem to hold out much promise for acupuncture's potential as an alternative lazy eye therapy.\n\n\"Acupuncture I think definitely works for pain amelioration, but I'm not sure it works for some of these other things,\" he cautioned. \"They've tried it for the treatment of myopia and glaucoma, without much success. And so although there haven't been any really good trials comparing acupuncture with conventional therapies, my guess is that it's probably not going to do much for the treatment of lazy eye.\"\n\n\"However, I think it's worth considering or trying,\" Chang added, \"because nothing else seems to work very well for patients of that age, including patch therapy. But what will need is a very carefully controlled study that accounts for all the variables that might have an impact on the outcome of this approach.\"\n\nFor more on amblyopia, visit the National Eye Institute.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The description of benefits in this story is not sufficiently detailed.

The research, conducted by scientists at Tohoku University in Japan, suggests that this type of therapy may also benefit humans.\n\nThe team, led by cardiologist Hiroaki Shimokawa, found that applying low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) to the whole brain of the mice improved blood vessel formation and nerve cell regeneration without having obvious side effects.\n\n\"The LIPUS therapy is a non-invasive physiotherapy that could apply to high-risk elderly patients without the need for surgery or anaesthesia, and could be used repeatedly,\" says Shimokawa.\n\nDementia affects about 50 million people worldwide, with 10 million new cases occurring every year. But there are currently no curative treatments available for vascular dementia or Alzheimer's disease, the most common causes of dementia. Also, the cells lining the brain's blood vessels are tightly packed, forming a blood-brain barrier that prevents large molecules from crossing into the brain tissue. This limits the types of drugs and cell therapies that could be made available to treat dementia.\n\nShimokawa and his team had conducted previous studies showing that LIPUS improved blood vessel formation in pigs with myocardial ischemia, a condition where there is reduced blood flow to the heart. Other studies have reported that LIPUS increases the production of proteins involved in nerve cell survival and growth, in addition to a role in promoting nerve regeneration. Focusing LIPUS treatment on a region in the brain called the hippocampus, which is involved in memory, has also been found to improve dementia in mice, but the details of how it does this need to be more fully investigated.\n\nThe Tohoku University team wanted to find out if whole-brain rather than focused LIPUS is effective in treating mouse models of dementia, and if it was, what was happening at the molecular levels to achieve this.\n\nThey found that cognitive impairment markedly improved in mice with conditions similar to vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease when LIPUS was applied to the whole brain three times a day for 20 minutes each time. The mice with vascular dementia received the treatment on the first, third and fifth days following a surgical procedure that limited the brain's blood supply. The mice with a condition simulating Alzheimer's disease in humans received 11 LIPUS treatments over a period of three months.\n\nAt the molecular level, genes related to the cells lining blood vessels were turned on. Also, there was increased expression of an enzyme involved in blood vessel formation and a protein involved in nerve cell survival and growth.\n\nThe researchers conclude that their study, recently published in the journal Brain Stimulation, provides the first experimental evidence that whole-brain LIPUS therapy markedly improves cognitive dysfunctions without serious side effects by enhancing specific cells related to dementia's pathology.\n\nThe first clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the LIPUS treatment are already underway.", "question": "Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "We are not given enough detail about the findings nor given any evidence that this treatment will be of benefit to humans.

The results of one new study may be less than hoped for, but the science is sound: The study concluded that injecting stem cells into the spinal cords of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is safe in most, though not all, cases. Unfortunately, the procedure provided no benefit to patients, though it caused substantial pain to two of the study participants.\n\nDr. Jonathan D. Glass, a professor of neurology and pathology at the Emory University School of Medicine and the director of the Emory ALS Center, specifically focused on human spinal cord-derived neural stem cells.\n\n\"We put them into the spinal cord, and they came from a human spinal cord. The idea was that they would find a familiar and supportive environment,\" explained Glass.\n\nIn previous studies , Glass and his colleagues had transplanted such stem cells into the spinal cords of rodents with ALS and discovered that the treatment delayed the disease and improved survival.\n\nNext, in a study of 12 patients , Glass tested the safety of injecting the stem cells into the spinal cords of humans. What he discovered during that experiment was that none of the patients suffered long-term effects (from either the surgical procedure or the implantation of stem cells), and no unusual acceleration of disease occurred. Importantly, one patient showed some improvement, though he and his colleagues noted that this outcome \"must be interpreted with caution\" since the study wasn't designed to measure effectiveness of the treatment.\n\nFor the new study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, Glass and his colleagues tested increasing amounts of stem cells injected into 15 patients who were not enrolled in his previous study.\n\nWhat ALS does to the body\n\nWhen someone gets ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, their motor network rapidly disintegrates. Nerve cells that communicate and control the voluntary muscles of the body (such as those in the arms, legs and face) degenerate or die. When communication between the brain and muscles ceases, the result is a gradual weakening and wasting away of muscles.\n\n\"My father was actually 69 when he was diagnosed. Someone can go for two years without being diagnosed properly, and that was the case with my father,\" Pharr said.\n\nNeither his primary care physician nor his neurologist could identify the cause of his deterioration. In fact, they first believed he had suffered a stroke. After all, ALS is rare, and in up to 90% of all cases, there is no family history and no known risk factors, as was the case with Pharr's father.\n\nALS affects men more often than women, usually between the ages of 40 and 70. Though more common between the ages of 60 and 69, this neurodegenerative disease can develop at any age, progressing rapidly. Most people with ALS die within three to five years after their symptoms begin, though about 10% survive for 10 years or longer. In Pharr's father's case, the progress of disease was rapid.\n\n\"He did not want to go on the ventilator,\" she said, adding that many people prefer a \"natural death.\" ALS often ends with respiratory failure since muscles in the diaphragm and chest walls eventually stop functioning. \"There's no cure, and we don't even have a treatment,\" she said.\n\nAccording to Goldstein, this isn't entirely a negative. \"One of the things ALS has going for it is, since it has no effective treatment or cure, you throw anything you can at it,\" he said. While for many other diseases, the researchers are focused on just one modality, ongoing ALS research uses each of the four key modes of medical treatment: small molecules, proteins and biologics, gene therapy and stem cells.\n\nWas this research necessary -- and ethical?\n\nThe ethics of human experimentation were thoroughly examined before the study began.\n\n\"Ethical review happens at several levels: at the NIH, at the Food and Drug Administration and most importantly at University Institutional Review Boards at each institution where a faculty member is participating in a trial,\" Glass explained.\n\nIn Pharr's opinion, this and other stem cell studies are certainly fair from a participant's perspective, since beforehand, \"patients are presented with all the risk factors involved so they can make an informed decision.\" Besides, she added, \"you automatically assume anyone with ALS can participate, but not everyone meets the criteria for a particular study.\"\n\nThe results of the study: Most participants fared well.

In addition, studies show that bystanders are often reluctant to perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on strangers, but are more likely to try rapid chest compression.\n\n\"We think that if we can double the number of bystanders who attempt CPR, we can save tens of thousands of lives every year,\" said Mary Fran Hazinski, a nurse at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and spokeswoman for the American Heart Association.\n\nSudden cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death in the United States. Every day, it claims 900 American lives. Only about 6 percent of victims whose hearts stop outside of a hospital survive.\n\nStudies show that either mouth-to-mouth or hands-only CPR may double the survival rate from cardiac arrest, but bystanders typically step in to provide the potentially life-saving intervention in only about one-third of cases. That hesitation is rooted not only in reluctance to lock lips with a stranger, but by anxiety over how to perform conventional CPR, in which the rescuer breathes into the victim twice after every 30 chest compressions.\n\n\"Many times people nearby don't help because they're afraid that they will hurt the victim and aren't real confident in what they're doing,\" said Michael Sayre, chairman of the Heart Association committee that rewrote the guidelines.\n\nIn fact, effective chest compression can break the victim's ribs about one-third of the time. That's a risk well worth taking when the odds of survival without CPR are so slim.\n\nThe Heart Association also stressed that three-quarters of sudden cardiac arrest cases outside the hospital occur in the home. The bystander who needs to provide those chest compressions is often a loved one of the victim.\n\nConventional CPR that combines both chest compression and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation has been taught in first aid classes since the 1960s. That method has been under review since 1997. Two years ago, after considering multiple studies, the Heart Association recommended hands-only CPR only in cases where people were unwilling or unable to provide the rescue breaths as well.\n\nThe latest revision stems from three major studies published last year that showed no advantage in using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation in cardiac cases.\n\nDr. Chris Barton, acting chief of the Emergency Department at San Francisco General Hospital, supports the new guidelines. He said the latest research on CPR supports the notion that in the critical minutes before an ambulance or defibrillation device arrives, it is very important to provide uninterrupted, deep chest compressions.\n\n\"You want the chest to go down about 2 inches. I weigh 160 pounds, and when I do this I put about half my weight into it,\" he said. The pressure should be applied to the center of the chest, between the two nipples of the victim.\n\nThe compressions also have to come in rapid succession - about 100 per minute. According to Hazinski, one easy way to remember the rhythm is that it is roughly equivalent to the beat of the 1977 Bee Gees' disco hit \"Stayin' Alive.\"\n\n\"If you are untrained, just remember to push hard and push fast,\" Hazinski said. \"Doing something is better than doing nothing.\"\n\nThese new guidelines are aimed at untrained bystanders, or to those who have been trained in CPR but are unsure they can perform it adequately. The message is, if there is any doubt, provide \"hands only\" CPR.\n\nAlthough survival rates for cardiac arrest hover around 10 percent with CPR, Hazinski noted that rates have been pushed as high as 30 percent in cities, such as Seattle, that combine high bystander participation with a strong system of professional emergency medical response.\n\nAt best, CPR is a desperate measure. Survival rates are highly dependent on prompt arrival of a defibrillator - the kind carried by ambulance crews and increasingly available in public venues such as airports and sports stadiums.\n\n\"If you have access to an AED (Automated External Defibrillator), you want to apply that as early as possible,\" advised San Francisco General's Barton. \"Early defibrillation is the most successful intervention you can do.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The article says that CPR in any form \"may double the rate of survival from cardiac rest.\" According to a spokesperson for the American Heart Association, this means that \u201cwe can save tens of thousands of lives.\u201d\u00a0 Later in the story the spokesperson is reported as saying that when more people use CPR in cities such as Seattle, survival rates have jumped to as high as 30%.

And this strategy \u2026 could potentially be used,\u201d said Dr. Jean-Michel Molina, head of infectious diseases at Saint-Louis Hospital in Paris and the lead author of the study.\n\nMolina insisted he would never support long-term use of antibiotics to prevent STIs, but said that the approach might be an effective short-term strategy when paired with other control approaches, like more frequent STI testing among high-risk populations.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want this strategy to be used widely in any person, clearly,\u201d Molina said. \u201cBut if you can select a group with a high incidence rate of syphilis or chlamydia, and you want to try to reduce the rate of syphilis quite quickly in this group of people, you may think that this strategy could be used for a couple of months.\u201d\n\nRates of syphilis in particular have risen steadily in recent years; the rate in 2015-2016 \u2014 8.7 cases per 100,000 people \u2014 was the highest since 1993, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. The rate of infection increased in every age group over the age of 15, in both men and women, and in all ethnic groups.\n\nMolina\u2019s study was recently published by the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was one of its funders.\n\nThe researchers randomly assigned 232 men to one of two groups. One of the groups was given antibiotics \u2014 the drug doxycycline \u2014 to take if they had unprotected sex. They were told to take two pills per encounter, and no more than six in a week, ideally within 24 hours and no later than 72 hours after the intercourse. In reality, the median use among the men was about 6.8 pills per month.\n\nThe men were tested regularly for STIs, and in the nine or so months they were followed, the rates of some sexually transmitted infections fell dramatically in the treatment group. The overall reduction of all STIs was 47 percent, but that average was dragged down by the fact that doxycycline doesn\u2019t cure gonorrhea.\n\nThere was, however, a 70 percent reduction in chlamydia infections and cases of syphilis decreased by 73 percent. The authors noted, however, that the study length was short and they can\u2019t tell if the strategy would work as well over the long term.\n\nThe results can\u2019t be taken in isolation, others experts warned. Using doxycycline this way could drive the bacteria that cause the infections to develop resistance to the drug, warned Dr. Brad Spellberg, an infectious diseases specialist and chief medical officer at the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center in Los Angeles.\n\nSpellberg also said people who used the drug this way would be exposing the bacteria they have in their gastro-intestinal tracts \u2014 their own gut flora \u2014 to regular doses of doxycycline. And those bacteria too could develop resistance to the drug, leading to a host of other health problems.\n\nThe full picture of the knock-on effects of exposing your gut flora to antibiotics is still coming into focus, said Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics, and Policy and a leading voice on the dangers of mounting antibiotic resistance. He noted a recent report in the journal Science revealed that some cancer immunotherapy drugs worked less well in people who had recently taken antibiotics.\n\nMolina noted that antibiotic resistance to doxycycline has not been seen in chlamydia or syphilis, despite the fact that the drug has been used to treat these infections for decades. Still, he said the possibility it could arise cannot be discounted.\n\nA commentary published with the study argued that reducing infection rates in men who have sex with men and who are highly sexually active might lower STI infection rates more generally in a community.\n\nAuthors Christopher Fairley and Eric Chow, of Australia\u2019s Melbourne Sexual Health Center at Monash University, said pressure from patients to be given doxycycline on a preventative basis might be substantial, given that the drug is also prescribed in six-month courses to treat acne. Like Molina and his co-authors, they said STI preventive use at this point is premature.\n\nLaxminarayan did not dismiss the notion of this type of use out of hand, however. \u201cI certainly think that for a small subset of the population, if this helps prevent syphilis, then it certainly is worth exploring further,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he said additional studies should be conducted first to try to get a better picture of the potential consequences of using doxycycline this way, including the risk of resistance developing, the potential that it might further erode condom use, and any other unintended consequences.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story gives some relative reductions, but doesn\u2019t provide enough comparative data to give readers the scope of the benefits.

Although it notes that the study participants were \u201cmen who had frequent unprotected sex with a number of male sex partners,\u201d the story does not make clear just how unusual the men in the study were. For example, while the story reports that syphilis rates for the general US population have risen to almost 9 per 100,000 during a year, the syphilis infection rate in the control group was 11 percent (that is, 11 per 100, not 100,000) over 9 months; a rate that is more than 1,000 times the rate in the general population.

Researchers have found that delivering a fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) in a pill\u2014a poop pill, basically\u2014is no worse than a similar procedure done with a colonoscopy.\n\nNeither option may sound particularly enticing, but FMTs are wildly effective at treating a very nasty infection called Clostridium difficile. One of the first controlled clinical trials for FMTs in 2013 ended early because the patients who received the treatment were doing so much better than patients who didn\u2019t. In the new study, almost 90 percent of adults treated with the capsules were cured.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely insane. We just don\u2019t see kind of efficacy with drugs,\u201d Dr. Dina Kao told Newsweek. Kao is one of the authors of the paper and a gastroenterologist at the University of Alberta. Kao and her colleagues published the findings in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Tuesday.\n\nC. difficile infections can set in after a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which can wipe out some of the bacterial populations normally found in people\u2019s gut. The transplants work by replacing those \u201chealthy\u201d bacteria. \u201cC. difficile is the single biggest cause of diarrhea in a health care setting,\u201d Kao said. \u201cIt is our public enemy No. 1 in hospitals.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, C. difficile infects half a million people in the United States per year and kills 15,000 people. But patients may be hesitant to accept this potentially life-saving treatment because there are feces involved. Previous research found that while every part of this treatment was unappealing to most people, being offered the treatment in a pill form made patients significantly more open to the idea. Other efforts to take the \u201cpoop\u201d out of the poop pills\u2014to just include the bacteria thought to be behind the benefits\u2014have failed.\n\nThe 116 patients used in this study may have been selected in part because they were ideal candidates for FMTs, Dr. Elizabeth Hohmann noted, but she said the paper is solid overall. (Hohmann, a researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital who has also done research on FMTs, was not involved in his research.) \u201cThe results are sort of a best-case scenario,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I like about this paper is that it validates the upper-GI route and demonstrates that you can get very good cure rates without doing a colonoscopy.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s important because colonoscopies and the anesthesia required for the procedure can put a lot of stress on a person\u2019s body and can be complicated for the people most at risk for C. difficile infections, Hohmann noted\n\nKao\u2019s study also showed that people found FMTs far less unpleasant when the poop came in a pill. Two-thirds of the 57 patients who got the pills said their experiences were \u201cnot at all unpleasant,\u201d while just 44 percent of the 59 patients who received the FMT via a colonoscopy could say the same.\n\nBut most importantly, the study found no difference in effectiveness between the two therapies. There was a significant difference in cost. Though the procedures were done in a Canadian hospital, the FMTs delivered by colonoscopy cost nearly $500 USD more than the capsules, which cost about $300.\n\nFMTs are not yet common practice, though Kao noted that it is becoming the standard of care for C. difficile infections. \u201cFor this group of patients, nothing else really works,\u201d she said. However, the same cannot be said yet for other conditions. While the FDA said in 2013 that doctors can try fecal transplants in patients with C. difficile infections, the agency noted doctors should only use FMT for other conditions in clinical trials. Over 100 clinical trials are ongoing for various FMT therapies, including ones to treat ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease in children. (New FDA guidelines have been in the works since 2016 but aren\u2019t finalized.)\n\nDespite the FDA\u2019s advice, some people have set up shop as FMT providers anyway. Buzzfeed reported in June that one clinic in Tampa was even providing FMTs as a treatment for autism.\n\nThough physicians think they know how FMTs work, it remains somewhat mysterious. One recent, small study found that even stool samples that are entirely free of bacteria can be effective, perhaps because there are non-bacterial organisms that also help.\n\n\u201cWe still don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on, and in these other conditions it\u2019s not as clear-cut that the disturbance in the bacterial composition is the cause,\u201d Kao said. \u201cStool is such a complex mixture.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "This was a close call.

And, when suspected trouble foods were reintroduced into the diet, two-thirds of the children experienced a relapse in symptoms.\n\n\"A strictly supervised restricted elimination diet is a valuable instrument to assess whether ADHD is induced by food,\" wrote the study authors. \"We think that dietary intervention should be considered in all children with ADHD, provided parents are willing to follow a diagnostic restricted elimination diet for a five-week period, and provided expert supervision is available,\" they concluded.\n\nResults of the study are published in the Feb. 5 issue of The Lancet.\n\nADHD is a common childhood disorder, according to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). Children with ADHD have trouble paying attention, focusing and can be hyperactive. Parents have long suspected that sugary foods might be a culprit in inducing symptoms, but there's not a lot of evidence to support this theory, according to the NIMH. However, food additives and preservatives have recently been singled out as possibly having an effect on children's behavior, though the evidence isn't yet conclusive.\n\nSince some children have negative physical reactions to certain foods -- such as eczema, asthma and gastrointestinal problems -- that affect different organ systems, it has been suggested that foods may also affect the brain in a way that results in adverse behavior, according to information in the study.\n\nTo test this theory, the researchers recruited 100 children from Belgium and the Netherlands. The children were between the ages of 4 and 8, and all had been diagnosed with ADHD. Most of the children were boys.\n\nThe children were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group was placed on the restrictive elimination diet, and the other group served as a control group and received advice on healthy eating.\n\nThe restrictive diet began with a diet called the \"few foods diet,\" which includes just rice, meat, vegetables, pears and water. The researchers then complemented this diet with certain foods, such as potatoes, fruits and wheat. The restrictive diet lasted for five weeks.\n\nDuring the next four weeks, kids in the restricted diet group received two food challenge diets, in which certain foods were reintroduced into the diet. The researchers selected foods that were considered both low- and high-IgG foods.\n\nIgG is an antibody made by the immune system that some alternative medicine practitioners believe is linked to food hypersensitivities; however, IgG testing is controversial among many mainstream physicians and even some naturopaths, according to background information in the study.\n\nSome complementary medicine practices test for IgG and recommend eliminating foods high in IgG, explained Dr. Jaswinder Ghuman, who wrote an accompanying editorial in the same issue of the journal.\n\nForty-one children completed the restrictive phase of the diet. Of those, 78 percent had a reduction in their ADHD symptoms, compared with no improvement in the controls. Nine children (22 percent) didn't respond to the diet. On an ADHD symptom scale that ranges from 0 to 72 points, with a higher score indicating more severe symptoms, the average reduction was 24 points, according to the study.\n\nThirty children who had shown a response on the restrictive diet went on to the challenge test. Nineteen of those children had a relapse in symptoms on the challenge test. What's more, it didn't appear to matter if the children with challenged with a low- or high-IgG food.\n\n\"Measuring IgG levels in kids doesn't seem helpful,\" Ghuman said, but it does look as if the elimination diet may help some children.\n\n\"If parents have noticed that a child's behavior seems to get worse with certain foods, it may be worth considering,\" said Ghuman, who is an associate professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at the University of Arizona in Tucson.\n\n\"But, for this diet to work, you have to be very consistent with it, and you have to pay attention to nutrition.

And, she added, that clinical practice shouldn't be changed based on the results of one study.\n\nDr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York in New Hyde Park, echoed Ghuman's concerns.\n\n\"Since none of the children stayed on the diet beyond five weeks, it is hard to know if this dietary intervention offers sustained benefit,\" he said, adding, \"Since it is more difficult to enforce restricted diets in older children, this approach may not be suitable for the majority of older children with ADHD.\"\n\nAdesman also pointed out that this study is only applicable to children with ADHD, not to children who had ADD without the hyperactivity component.\n\nLearn more about ADHD from the National Institute of Mental Health.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story provided the benefits in both relative and absolute terms, allowing readers to see that the numbers are actually quite small. \u201cForty-one children completed the restrictive phase of the diet.

HER2 has been established as a therapeutic target in breast cancer, and breast cancers in which the HER2 gene is not amplified do not, in general, respond to HER2-directed therapeutic approaches.\n\nA few years ago, when the research teams of Dr. Matthew Ellis and others carried out a molecular characterization of breast cancer tumors, they found a new mutation in HER2 that was different from gene amplification but also resulted in tyrosine kinase being constantly activated.\n\n\"In this particular activation mechanism, the cells develop a subtle mutation within the functional part of the HER2 gene that activates the enzyme,\" said Ellis, professor and director of the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center, part of the National Cancer Institute-designated Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center at Baylor College of Medicine. \"The mutation locks the enzyme into an 'on' position.\"\n\nEllis and his colleagues developed a preclinical model to study this new HER2 mutation and discovered that the enhanced enzymatic activity could trigger tumor formation. Furthermore, these tumor cells were sensitive to an experimental drug, neratinib. With this information in hand, the researchers took the next step.\n\n\"We launched a phase II clinical trial of neratinib in patients with metastatic breast cancer carrying a HER2 mutation,\" Ellis said. \"Finding patients that are positive for a HER2 mutation required a national collaboration because we had to screen hundreds of patients to identify the 2 to 3 percent that have a tumor driven by a HER2 mutation. The results of the clinical trial were encouraging in that about 30 percent of the 16 patients treated with neratinib had a meaningful clinical response showing significant disease stabilization or regression.

The researchers estimate that as many as 200,000 patients are likely to be living with metastatic breast cancer today in the United States. Based on the estimate that the new mutation is present in 2 to 3 percent of cases, the researchers calculated that approximately 4,000 to 6,000 patients with metastatic breast cancer carry a HER2 mutation and are therefore potential candidates for neratinib treatment.\n\nTo identify the patients in this study who carried the new HER2 mutation, the researchers required tissue from the tumor, a biopsy, from which they could extract and sequence the genetic material to determine the presence of the HER2 mutation. This task turned out to be a major challenge because for 20 to 30 percent of the patients the researchers did not have sufficient material to make the diagnosis.\n\n\"To assist in our ability to identify patients with HER2 mutation-positive tumors, we conducted circulating tumor DNA analysis,\" Ellis said. \"The tumor's DNA is released into the human bloodstream, and we were able to determine the presence of the mutation in blood samples from the patients.

For multiple sclerosis, specifically, increasing cholesterol synthesis gene expression in astrocytes of the spinal cord can be a pathway to repair nerves that affect walking.\n\nMultiple sclerosis is an autoimmune, neurodegenerative disease, characterized by distinct disabilities affecting walking, vision, and cognition, to name a few. MS patients differ markedly from each other regarding which disability affects them the most. Inflammation strips the myelin coating from nerve cell extensions, called axons, and connections at the ends of nerves, called synapses, are lost, together disrupting signaling and eventually causing permanent disability depending on where this occurs. UCLA researchers proposed that molecular mechanisms behind each disability may differ, and that neuroprotective treatments tailored for each disability may be more effective than nonspecific treatments aiming to reduce a composite of different disabilities. The team focused on astrocytes, a type of brain cell that becomes activated in MS and plays several important roles in disease, examining gene expression in astrocytes in different regions.\n\nWorking with a mouse model of MS, the research team assessed astrocytes in various regions of the brain and spinal cord known to be involved in walking, vision or cognition. They compared gene expression changes between regions that correspond to different disabilities. In the spinal cord - an area that's critical for walking -- they found a decrease in the expression of cholesterol synthesis genes. Cholesterol does not leave the blood and enter the brain, instead it is made in astrocytes and plays a role in making myelin, the nerve coating, and synapses, the nerve connections. They hypothesized that while inflammation causes loss of myelin and synapses, it is the decrease in cholesterol synthesis gene expression in astrocytes that explains why lesions do not repair in MS. They treated MS mice with a drug that increased expression in cholesterol synthesis genes - and this resulted in improved walking ability.\n\nThis disability-specific discovery approach represents a strategy for finding neuroprotective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases that are tailored to repair damage for each disability, one at a time, in contrast to a \"one size fits all\" treatment approach.\n\nIn addition to senior author Dr. Rhonda Voskuhl, who directs UCLA's Multiple Sclerosis Program and holds the Jack H.

The problem is that all too often, no one knows what is normal.\n\n\u201cA patient comes in because he\u2019s in pain,\u201d said Dr. Nelda Wray, a senior research scientist at the Methodist Institute for Technology in Houston. \u201cWe see something in a scan, and we assume causation. But we have no idea of the prevalence of the abnormality in routine populations.\u201d\n\nNow, as more and more people have scans for everything from headaches to foot aches, more are left in a medical lurch, or with unnecessary or sometimes even harmful treatments, including surgery.\n\n\u201cEvery time we get a new technology that provides insights into structures we didn\u2019t encounter before, we end up saying, \u2018Oh, my God, look at all those abnormalities.\u2019 They might be dangerous,\u201d said Dr. David Felson, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Boston University Medical School. \u201cSome are, some aren\u2019t, but it ends up leading to a lot of care that\u2019s unnecessary.\u201d\n\nThat was what almost happened with Mrs. Weinstein, an active, athletic 64-year-old who lives in New London, N.H. And it was her great fortune to finally visit a surgeon who told her so. He told her bluntly that her pain was caused by arthritis, not the torn cartilage.\n\nNo one had told her that before, Mrs. Weinstein said, and looking back on her quest to get a scan and get the cartilage fixed, she shook her head in dismay. There\u2019s no surgical procedure short of a knee replacement that will help, and she\u2019s not ready for a knee replacement.\n\n\u201cI feel that I have come full circle,\u201d she said. \u201cI will cope on my own with this knee.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Mrs. Weinstein was also lucky because her problem was with her knee. It\u2019s one of only two body parts \u2014 the other is the back \u2014 where there are good data on abnormalities that turn up in people who feel just fine, indicating that the abnormalities may not be so abnormal after all.\n\nBut even the data on knees comes from just one study, and researchers say the problem is far from fixed. It is difficult to conduct scans on people who feel fine \u2014 most do not want to spend time in an M.R.I. machine, and CT scans require that people be exposed to radiation. But that leaves patients and doctors in an untenable situation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a concern, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Jarvik, a professor of radiology and neurosurgery at the University of Washington. \u201cWe are trying to fix things that shouldn\u2019t be fixed.\u201d\n\nAs a rheumatologist, Dr. Felson saw patient after patient with knee pain, many of whom had already had scans. And he was becoming concerned about their findings.\n\nOften, a scan would show that a person with arthritis had a torn meniscus, cartilage that stabilizes the knee. And often the result was surgery \u2014 orthopedic surgeons do more meniscus surgery than any other operation. But, Dr. Felson wondered, was the torn cartilage an injury causing pain or was the arthritis causing pain and the tear a consequence of arthritis?\n\nThat led Dr. Felson and his colleagues to do the first and so far the only large study of knees, asking what is normal. It involved M.R.I. scans on 991 people ages 50 to 90. Some had knee pain, others did not.\n\nOn Sept. 11, Dr. Felson and his colleagues published their results in The New England Journal of Medicine: meniscal tears were just as common in people with knee arthritis who did not complain of pain as they were in people with knee arthritis who did have pain. They tended to occur along with arthritis and were a part of the disease process itself. And so repairing the tears would not eliminate the pain.\n\n\u201cThe rule is, as you get older, you will get a meniscal tear,\u201d Dr. Felson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a function of aging and disease. If you are a 60-year-old guy, the chance that you have a meniscal tear is 40 percent.\u201d\n\nIt is a result that paralleled what spine researchers found over the past decade in what is perhaps the best evidence on what shows up on scans of healthy people. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to look at a spine, you need to know what that spine might look like in a normal patient,\u201d said Dr. Michael Modic, chairman of the Neurological Institute at the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nAfter Dr. Modic and others scanned hundreds of asymptomatic people, they learned abnormalities were common.\n\n\u201cSomewhere between 20 and 25 percent of people who climb into a scanner will have a herniated disk,\u201d Dr. Modic said. As many as 60 percent of healthy adults with no back pain, he said, have degenerative changes in their spines.\n\nThose findings made Dr. Modic ask: Why do a scan in the first place? There are some who may benefit from surgery, but does it make sense to routinely do scans for nearly everyone with back pain? After all, one-third of herniated disks disappear on their own in six weeks, and two-thirds in six months.\n\nAnd surgeons use symptoms and a physical examination to identify patients who would be helped by operations. What extra medical help does a scan provide? So Dr. Modic did another study, this time with 250 patients. All had M.R.I. scans when they first arrived complaining of back pain or shooting pains down their leg, which can be caused by a herniated disc pressing on a nerve in the spine. And all had scans again six weeks later. Sixty percent had herniated disks, the scans showed.\n\nDr. Modic gave the results to only half of the patients and their doctors \u2014 the others had no idea what the M.R.I.\u2019s revealed. Dr. Modic knew, though.\n\nIn 13 percent of the patients, the second scan showed that the herniated disk had become bigger or a new herniated disk had appeared. In 15 percent, the herniated disk had disappeared. But there was no relationship between the scan findings at six weeks and patients\u2019 symptoms. Some continued to complain of pain even though their herniated disk had disappeared; others said they felt better even though their herniation had grown bigger.\n\nThe question, though, was whether it helped the patients and their doctors to know what the M.R.I.\u2019s had found. And the answer, Dr. Modic reported, is that it did not. The patients who knew recovered no faster than those who did not know. However, Dr. Modic said, there was one effect of being told \u2014 patients felt worse about themselves when they knew they had a bulging disk.\n\n\u201cIf I tell you that you have a degenerated disk, basically I\u2019m telling you you\u2019re ugly,\u201d Dr. Modic said.\n\nScans, he said, are presurgical tools, not screening tools. A scan can help a surgeon before he or she operates, but it does not help with a diagnosis.\n\n\u201cIf a patient has back or leg pain, they should be treated conservatively for at least eight weeks,\u201d Dr. Modic said, meaning that they take pain relievers and go about their normal lives. \u201cThen you should do imaging only if you are going to do surgery.\u201d\n\nThat message can be a hard sell, he acknowledged. \u201cA lot of people are driven by wanting to have imaging,\u201d Dr. Modic said. \u201cThey are miserable as hell, they can\u2019t work, they can\u2019t sit. We look at you and say, \u2018We think you have a herniated disk. We say the natural history is that you will get better. You should go through six to eight weeks of conservative management.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAt the Partners Healthcare System in Boston, spine experts have the same struggle to convince patients that an M.R.I. scan is not necessarily desirable, said Dr. Scott Gazelle, director of radiology there.\n\n\u201cThe consensus is that you are a surgical candidate or not based on your history and physical findings, not on imaging findings,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Gazelle had a chance last year to test his own convictions. He had the classic symptoms of a herniated disk \u2014 shooting pains down his left leg, a numb foot and difficulty walking.\n\nDr. Gazelle went to see his primary-care doctor but, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t get an M.R.I.\u201d That decision, he added, \u201cwas the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nAbout three months later, he had recovered on his own.\n\nIn 1998, two medical scientists, writing in The Lancet, proposed what sounded like a radical idea. Instead of simply providing patients and their doctors with the results of an X-ray or an M.R.I. scan, he said, radiologists should put the findings in context. For example, they wrote, if a scan showed advanced disk deterioration, the report should say, \u201cRoughly 40 percent of patients with this finding do not have back pain so the finding may be unrelated.\u201d\n\nIt is an idea that only would work for back pain, because that is the one area where radiologists have enough data. But it made eminent sense to Dr. Jarvik. \u201cIt gives referring physicians some sort of context,\u201d he said.\n\nSo, a few years ago, with some trepidation, his radiology group starting including epidemiological data in their reports. \u201cWe thought, \u2018What\u2019s going to be the reaction among referring physicians?\u2019 \u201d Dr. Jarvik said. Their fear was that doctors would start choosing other places for M.R.I.\u2019s and that Dr. Jarvik\u2019s group would lose business.\n\nBecause of the way the university\u2019s records are kept, it\u2019s hard to know whether the new reporting system had that effect, Dr. Jarvik said. But he was heartened by the responses of some doctors, like Dr. Sohail Mirza, who recently moved to Dartmouth Medical School.\n\n\u201cWe often see patients who have already had M.R.I. scans,\u201d Dr. Mirza said. \u201cThey are fixated on the abnormality and come to a surgeon to try to get the abnormality fixed. They\u2019ll come in with the report in hand.\u201d\n\nThe new sort of report, Dr. Mirza said, was \u201cvery helpful information to have when talking to patients and very helpful for patients to help them understand that the abnormalities were not catastrophic findings.\u201d\n\nOthers, like Dr. Modic, are hesitant about reporting epidemiology along with a patient\u2019s scan findings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting idea,\u201d he said. But, he added: \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t what happens after they get their imaging. It\u2019s that they get the imaging in the first place.\u201d\n\nThat was what happened with Mrs. Weinstein.\n\nWhen she started looking up her symptoms on the Internet, she decided she probably had a meniscus tear. \u201cI was very forceful in asking for an M.R.I.,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd when the scan showed that her meniscus was torn, she went to a surgeon expecting an operation.\n\nHe X-rayed her knee and told her she had arthritis. Then, Mrs. Weinstein said, the surgeon looked at her and said, \u201cLet me get this straight. Are you here for a knee replacement?\u201d\n\nShe said no, of course not. She skis, she does aerobics, she was nowhere near ready for something so drastic.\n\nThen the surgeon told her that there was no point in repairing her meniscus because that was not her problem. And if he repaired the cartilage, her arthritic bones would just grind it down again.\n\nFor now, Mrs. Weinstein says she is finished with her medical odyssey.\n\n\u201cI continue to live with this, whatever they call it, this arthritic knee,\u201d she said.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story does not say how many meniscal tears were found on MRI in the current study.

It is estimated that about one in every 100 people in the UK has ASD, with more boys diagnosed with the condition than girls.\n\nScientists said their research found a link between ASD and damage to proteins in blood plasma. They found the most reliable of the tests they developed was examining protein in blood plasma, which found children with ASD had higher levels of the oxidation marker dityrosine (DT) and certain sugar-modified compounds called advanced glycation end-products (AGEs).\n\nGenetic causes are thought to be responsible for about a third of cases of ASD, while the rest are believed to be caused by a combination of environmental factors, mutations, and rare genetic variants. However, researchers believe their new tests could reveal yet-to-be-identified causes of ASD.\n\nThey also confirmed the previously held belief that mutations of amino acid transporters are a genetic variant associated with ASD.\n\nThe Warwick team worked with collaborators at the University of Bologna in Italy, who recruited 38 children who had been diagnosed with ASD along with a control group of 31 other children between the ages of five and 12. Blood and urine samples were taken from the children for analysis.\n\nThe Warwick team discovered there were chemical differences between the two groups. Working with a further collaborator at the University of Birmingham, the changes in multiple compounds were combined using artificial intelligence algorithm techniques to develop a mathematical equation to distinguish between ASD and healthy controls. The outcome was a diagnostic test better than any existing method.\n\nThey said the next steps were to repeat the study with further groups of children to confirm the good diagnostic performance and to assess if the test could identify ASD at very early stages, indicate how the ASD is likely to develop further to more severe disease, and assess if treatments were working.\n\nThe research was led by Naila Rabbani, reader of experimental systems biology at the University of Warwick, who said: \u201cOur discovery could lead to earlier diagnosis and intervention. We hope the tests will also reveal new causative factors.\n\n\u201cWith further testing we may reveal specific plasma and urinary profiles \u2013 or \u2018fingerprints\u2019 \u2013 of compounds with damaging modifications. This may help us improve the diagnosis of ASD and point the way to new causes of ASD.\u201d\n\nThe research has been published in the journal Molecular Autism.\n\u2022 Note added 27 February 2018: The UK autism research charity, Autistica, provided the following comment to the Guardian: \u201cThis is a small, early-stage study which may explain one biological difference in autism. At this stage, the results presented are not strong enough to suggest that this method could be used for the diagnosis of autism.

(March 10, 2016) - Approximately 14 percent of men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point in their lifetimes, according to the National Institutes of Health. Radiation therapy traditionally has been a primary treatment for the cancer, but one-fourth of men have a recurrence of prostate cancer within five years after the therapy. Now, a University of Missouri School of Medicine researcher has found that a complex procedure to remove the prostate achieves excellent long-term survival for men after radiation therapy has failed.\n\n\"Prostate cancer, unfortunately, is a common cancer, and more than 27,000 men are estimated to have died from the disease in 2015,\" said Naveen Pokala, M.D., an assistant professor in the Division of Urology at the MU School of Medicine and lead author of the study. \"By studying a national database of prostate cancer cases, we found that a procedure known as salvage radical prostatectomy can greatly increase a man's chance of survival when traditional radiation therapy has failed to eradicate the cancer.\"\n\nUsing the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program database, Pokala and his research team studied 364 patients who underwent a salvage radical prostatectomy surgery after unsuccessful radiation treatments. Looking at survival rates, the researchers found that 88.6 percent of men were still alive 10 years later and 72.7 percent of men were still alive 20 years later.\n\nDuring a salvage radical prostatectomy, the prostate gland and surrounding tissue are surgically removed to keep the cancer from spreading. The procedure is challenging because tissue that surrounds the prostate is scarred during radiation treatment, making it difficult for the surgeon to identify and cut out tissue that needs to be removed. If the cancer is localized, a highly skilled surgeon can remove the gland and surrounding tissue using a robotic minimally invasive technique or through an open surgery.\n\n\"Because radical prostatectomy is a complex surgery, there can be a reluctance to undergo the procedure,\" Pokala said. \"However, this study shows that it is a viable treatment option. This can bring a renewed hope and peace of mind to men living with prostate cancer.\"\n\nThe study, \"Survival Outcomes in Men Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy after Primary Radiation Treatment for Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate,\" recently was published by Clinical Genitourinary Cancer, a peer-reviewed journal on the detection, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of genitourinary cancers.", "question": "Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The news release adequately quantifies the benefits with this statement:\n\u201cUsing the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program database, Pokala and his research team studied 364 patients who underwent a salvage radical prostatectomy surgery after unsuccessful radiation treatments.

The Food and Drug Administration approved Provenge this spring to treat advanced prostate cancer.\n\nBut now the study that led to FDA approval is finally out in this week's New England Journal of Medicine. And it's clear that experts are still scratching their heads about just how Provenge works.\n\nIt does work, sort of.\n\nIn the study, men with prostate cancer that no longer responds to hormone therapy (basically, chemical castration) lived about four months longer if they took Provenge than if they got placebo treatment. That's better than the only other approved treatment for such advanced cancers.\n\nBut, as the study's lead author Dr. Philip Kantoff acknowledges, \"It's not a home run; this is not going to cure prostate cancer.\"\n\nThe primary mystery is how Provenge extends life, since it doesn't shrink prostate tumors, as far as anyone can tell. \"Prolongation of survival without a measurable antitumor effect is surprising,\" writes Dr. Dan Longo of the National Institute on Aging in a NEJM editorial.\n\nDeep in the data is further mystery.\n\nProvenge is supposed to work by, in effect, vaccinating patients against their own cancers using a patient's own white blood cells.\n\nThe theory is that the custom-made vaccine incites patients' immune cells to attack the cancer. The study shows that patients who got Provenge were indeed more likely to mount immune-cell responses to a prostate cancer antigen in the test tube. But oddly, the patients who had these activated immune cells didn't survive any longer than those who didn't.\n\nThe other side of the immune system \u2013 the antibody arm -- showed a different picture. Patients who had a good antibody response to Provenge lived longer than those who didn't.\n\nNobody yet knows just how to explain these results. Longo, the NEJM editorialist, says he'd be more convinced if the placebo patients had received infusions of white blood cells that had been exposed just to the general immune-stimulating part of the Provenge treatment, without the prostate antigen part.\n\nThe way the study was done, he says, \"does not allow one to conclude\" that Provenge is working because it mobilizes the immune system specifically against prostate cancer.\n\nBut, after all, Provenge is just the first cancer immunotherapy on the market. So it's not surprising there's a lot to be learned, and that it's pretty pricey.\n\nOther immunotherapy approaches are in the pipeline, along with fancier versions of drugs to block the hormones that feed prostate cancer.\n\nMeanwhile, Dendreon, the Seattle-based company that makes Provenge, says there's a waiting list for the drug. The company estimates 100,000 American men have the kind of hormone-resistant, metastatic cancer the drug is approved to treat.

All children required daily inhaled treatments to manage their asthma. During the study, caregivers used either acetaminophen (commonly known as Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) whenever a child needed pain relief or had a fever. None of the study investigators, children, or caregivers knew which study drug each child was receiving.\n\nThe study did not detect any worsening of asthma in the children treated with acetaminophen compared with those receiving ibuprofen.

Both drugs cause tumors to shrink and prolong survival for patients with melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body, but neither is a cure.\n\n\"This is an unprecedented time of clinical options -- it is truly practice-changing,\" said Dr. Lynn Schuchter, who heads the Melanoma Center at the University of Pennsylvania and is not involved with the research.\n\nMayoClinic: Find out more about melanoma\n\nOne study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's (ASCO) conference on Sunday focused on the experimental drug vemurafenib.

Vemurafenib blocks the mutated gene, which kills the cancer cell and shrinks tumors.\n\nResearchers compared this new drug, which comes in pill form, to the only FDA-approved chemotherapy drug for melanoma, dacarbazine: It has been used to treat melanoma patients since 1975, but is only effective in about 10% of patients.\n\nNearly 90% benefited from this new targeted drug, Schuchter said.\n\nIn a large, phase 3 study involving 675 people worldwide, patients on vemurafenib did much better than those on chemotherapy. Forty-eight percent of patients on vemurafenib had substantial tumor shrinkage that lasted for more than a month, compared to 5.5% of patients in the chemotherapy group.\n\nThose taking vemurafenib had a 63% reduced risk of death compared to those on chemo.

Instead, it stimulates the patient's immune system to allow it to better fight the cancer. Patients with and without the BRAF mutation were eligible to participate.\n\nAmong 502 patients enrolled in this clinical trial, half were given Yervoy plus dacarbazine and the other half were given a placebo and chemotherapy.\n\n\"Twenty-one percent of (the Yervoy) population was alive after three years,\" lead study author Dr. Jedd Wolchok said, compared to 12% who got the placebo and chemo.

Another 45 children wore a patch over their normal eye for two hours daily, a typical regimen, and were also asked to do an hour of near-vision activity a day.\n\nAt 15 weeks, visual acuity with eyeglasses improved by about 1.8 lines on the vision chart in the patched eyes and 2.3 lines in those who had acupuncture. An improvement of two lines or more occurred in nearly 67% of those in the patching group but nearly 76% of those in the acupuncture group. Ambylopia was evaluated as resolved in nearly 17% of patched eyes but nearly 42% of the acupuncture group.

The drug, Addyi, or flibanserin , has been on the market since October.\n\n\"The data presented in this review suggests that the meaningful change caused by flibanserin is minimal,\" according to the team of Dutch researchers.\n\nThe researchers looked at eight studies on Addyi that together included nearly 6,000 women. They said for women using the drug, the number of additional \"satisfying sexual events\" averaged out to about 0.5 per month.\n\nThe agency asked Sprout Pharmaceuticals, which makes Addyi, to do more studies on the interaction between Addyi and alcohol.\n\nThe researchers said the drug had significant known side effects, such as dizziness, sleepiness, and nausea.\n\nSome doctors and patients who've been using Addyi say the drug has been helpful. There are no other FDA-approved treatments for women suffering from low sexual desire.\n\nDr. Lauren Streicher, medical director of the Center for Sexual Medicine at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, said the results cited in the Dutch study are averages, and while Addyi doesn't work for everyone, many of her patients have benefited from it.\n\nShe says she's written Addyi prescriptions for about 10 women, and three or four have emailed her back to say it's worked. \"They say, 'Oh my God, this has changed my life. Things are wonderful,'\" Streicher said.\n\nJodi Cole, a 33-year-old stay-at-home mother from Porter, Oklahoma, said before she started taking Addyi, she didn't want to have sex with her husband, Matt. \"I love my husband and I believe God created emotional and sexual intimacy as key components of marriage. So we had sex, usually a couple of times a week. And while I was willing, part of me dreaded it. Every time,\" Cole wrote in an email to CNN.\n\nCole said she started taking Addyi in November, and within six weeks felt a difference. \"I was amazed,\" she wrote. \"I actually enjoyed being intimate and for the first time in a long time felt that connection with Matt.\"\n\nShe said for her it wasn't about increasing the quantity of sex she was having, but rather the quality. \"What (Addyi) does is give just enough support so I can think about that part of our relationship with anticipation of pleasure rather than anxiety,\" she wrote.

When studies are published, they go through a peer review process to assess whether the study methodology is sound.\n\nOne of those studies used a dosage of the drug that was half as high as what the FDA approved.\n\nDr. Loes Jasper, one of the authors of the Dutch analysis, said she and her colleagues removed the results from that study and still found that Addyi's affects were minimal.\n\nShe said she and her colleagues included the results of the unpublished studies because sometimes negative studies of a drug don't get published.\n\n\"We included all published and unpublished studies to capture a complete overview of the benefits and risks of flibanserin, without bias,\" Jaspers wrote in an email to CNN.\n\nAccording to the FDA, which looked at three clinical trials of Addyi that included about 2,400 women, about 10% more patients treated with Addyi reported meaningful improvements in satisfying sexual events, sexual desire, or reduced distress compared to women taking a placebo.\n\nIn their editorial, Woloshine and Schwartz said Sprout and others put pressure on FDA to approve the drug.\n\n\"While it is unclear how strongly politics influenced the decision, it is clear that the science was weak,\" they wrote. \"We all need a drug approval process that delivers good decisions based on adequate evidence.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "This rating is borderline as the article noted: \u201cThey said for women using the drug, the number of additional \u2018satisfying sexual events\u2019 averaged out to about 0.5 per month.\u201d \u00a0What would give this increased meaning is what the baseline was.

The journal is published in partnership with Wolters Kluwer.\n\n\"In the absence of treatment alternatives, reverse total shoulder arthroplasty [RTSA] is a justifiable treatment for patients with a massive, irreparable rotator cuff tear before the age of 60,\" according to the report by Christian Gerber, MD, of the University of Zurich and colleagues. Despite a substantial risk of complications, most patients are satisfied with the outcomes of RTSA at follow-ups of a decade or longer.\n\nStable Long-Term Results of RTSA in Patients Younger than 60\n\nThe researchers analyzed the long-term outcomes of RTSA in 20 patients, average age 57 years. All had \"massive, irreparable\" tears of the rotator cuff muscles, causing shoulder \"pseudoparalysis,\"with little no ability to lift the arm.\n\nThis group of patients typically gets limited benefit from shoulder replacement with conventional implants, which rely on the rotator cuff muscles to provide shoulder movement. The RTSA technique--using an implant in which the natural locations of the shoulder \"ball and socket\" are reversed--uses other muscles to move the shoulder, providing an alternative when the rotator cuff is severely damaged or destroyed.\n\nWhen first introduced, RTSA was performed mainly in elderly patients who placed low demands on the shoulder. With refinements in technique and components in more recent years, the procedure has been used in younger, more active patients. But there are concerns about how well the results of RTSA will hold up over time in this group of patients.\n\nThe new study focused on long-term outcomes of RTSA in patients under age 60. The patients underwent follow-up examination between eight and 19 years after surgery (average 11.7 years). Three patients had RTSA in both shoulders, for a total of 23 procedures.\n\nCompared to their preoperative status, most patients had substantial long-term improvement after RTSA. The average Constant score--a standard assessment accounting for shoulder motion, strength, daily activities, and pain--at the time of final-follow-up improved from 24 to 59 (out of a possible 100).\n\nPatients' ratings of \"subjective shoulder value\" improved from 20 percent to 71 percent (compared to 100 percent for a normal shoulder). Shoulder movement and strength increased, while pain decreased. The improvement was similar for patients with and without prior shoulder surgery.\n\nHowever, complications occurred in 39 percent of the shoulders. Further surgery was required in six shoulders; in two cases, the RTSA procedure was considered a failure.\n\nWhen complications occurred, long-term shoulder functioning was not as good but even with the high complication rate, 72 percent of patients rated their satisfaction level as excellent or good.\n\nThe results alleviate concerns that the clinical benefits of RTSA might not hold up over time in younger, more active patients. Despite its high complication rate, Dr. Gerber and colleagues conclude that RTSA \"provides substantial and lasting improvement\" in shoulder function and pain, in a group of patients with limited treatment options.\n\nClick here to read \"Reverse Total Shoulder Arthroplasty for Massive, Irreparable Rotator Cuff Tears Before the Age of 60 Years: Long-Term Results.\"\n\nAbout The Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery\n\nThe Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery (JBJS) has been the most valued source of information for orthopaedic surgeons and researchers for over 125 years and is the gold standard in peer-reviewed scientific information in the field.

And, for unknown reasons, the U.S. rate of preterm delivery has been going up in recent years.\n\nThat's why it's a pretty big deal that the Food and Drug Administration has OK'd a drug, called 17-HP, that experts say could make a dent in the preemie problem.\n\nNot a huge dent, but a significant one. The March of Dimes calculates that if all the women eligible to get the newly approved drug actually did, there would be 10,000 fewer preemies a year \u2013 out of more than half-a-million born that way.\n\n\"Although that may seem like a small percent, it's really a very extraordinary ability to impact on what is really a major public health problem,\" Dr. Alan Fleischman, the March of Dimes medical director, told Shots.\n\nAccording to the best research, the drug reduces the risk of premature birth by one-third among women who are at high risk because they had a previous preterm birth.\n\nThe drug is not for women whose prior premature births were of twins or other multiple births, or who are carrying more than one fetus in their current pregnancy. Nor is it for women who have other conditions that raise their risk of preterm birth, such as high blood pressure or infection.\n\nAnd even for the 30,000 or so women who are eligible, 17-HP, which will be marketed as Makena, isn't a magic bullet. The study showed that 37 percent of women who got weekly injections of it delivered prematurely, compared to 55 percent of women who got injections of a placebo.\n\nInterestingly, the drug is not new \u2014 it's just taken a long and circuitous route to approval.\n\nIn 1956, the FDA approved 17-HP for the treatment of certain cancers and other hormonal disorders, under the brand name Delalutin. But its manufacturer withdrew it from the market in 2000 \"for reasons unrelated to safety,\" as the FDA puts it.\n\nIn fact, as a Federal Register posting last year chronicled, there have been questions raised about whether 17-HP caused birth defects of various kinds. In the 1970s, the FDA required warnings on drugs containing progesterone, as 17-HP does, because of an increased risk of birth defects. They later revoked them.\n\nThe FDA is apparently satisfied that 17-HP is safe, but it's requiring its sponsors KV Pharmaceuticals and TherRx to conduct further studies of women who have taken it and children exposed during pregnancy.\n\nEveryone in this field is mindful of the long-running tragedy of vaginal and other cancers and male urinary disorders that resulted from the last drug thought to prevent premature birth \u2013 a synthetic estrogen called diethylstilbesterol, or DES. In 1971 researchers realized children exposed to DES in utero had a higher incidence of vaginal and breast cancers, and males were subsequently found to have urinary-tract problems.\n\nFleischman, the March of Dimes official, says there's no such risk from 17-HP, partly because it's not used before the 16th week of pregnancy, when fetal organs have already formed.\n\n\"We have been very aggressively tracking all the data,\" Fleischman says, \"and we have no reason to believe that this drug will increase birth defects.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "As already noted, the story explained that the drug \u201cisn\u2019t a magic bullet.

Brenner, a professor of radiation oncology at Columbia University who co-authored the most recent of a series of reports in the past year warning about the potential risks of CT scans. \"On an individual basis there's probably not a big risk, but a small cancer risk applied to an increasingly large population spells trouble down the road. That's the concern.\"\n\nAlthough some prominent medical groups have issued warnings against overusing the exams -- especially for children -- some experts worry about frightening patients away from the invaluable tests.\n\n\"You don't want people to avoid getting a potentially lifesaving diagnosis or therapy because they are afraid to get a CT scan,\" said Arl Van Moore Jr., a Charlotte radiologist who chairs the American College of Radiology's board of chancellors. \"When a scan is done the right way for the right reasons, the benefits clearly outweigh the risks of doing it.\"\n\nCT (computed tomography), sometimes called CAT (computed axial tomography), is performed by computerized machines that scan patients with X-rays to create three-dimensional cross-sectional images of organs and other parts of the body, providing far greater detail than standard single X-rays.\n\nThe number of scans performed each year in the United States has increased sharply, rising from about 3 million in 1980 to at least 67 million in 2006. There are many reasons for the increase, including improvements in the technology that have speeded the procedure, a growing list of uses and a proliferation of the machines.\n\n\"CT has become ubiquitous,\" said Jason Launders, a senior project officer at the ECRI Institute, an independent nonprofit health-care research organization outside Philadelphia that released a report last year warning about the potential risks. \"Now if you go into an emergency room you can be scanned in a few minutes. You can't get that kind of information any other way. So physicians tend to use CT as sort of a first line in working out a diagnosis.\"\n\nThe use of CT scans is expected to continue to rise as possible new applications, such as for lung and colon cancer screening, become more widespread.\n\nWhile the value of CT scans for screening remains the focus of debate, no one questions the value of the tests for allowing doctors to quickly diagnose a wide variety of health problems, including head injuries, heart problems, cancer, appendicitis, fractures and gallstones.\n\n\"CT is probably the biggest advance in diagnostic radiology that has ever occurred,\" said Thomas Ohlhaber, deputy director of the Division of Mammography Quality and Radiation Programs at the Food and Drug Administration. \"Exploratory surgery that was common 10 or 15 years ago has virtually disappeared and all the risks associated with that have gone away because of CT. But nothing comes free of risks.\"\n\nThe concern comes from the fact that CT scans expose patients to much more radiation than standard X-rays. A CT chest scan, for example, exposes a patient to more than 150 times more radiation than a standard chest X-ray. That's more than twice as much as a typical person receives from the environment in an entire year. (See graphic.)\n\nThe upsurge in CT use has fueled a big jump in the annual amount of radiation that each American is receiving from medical procedures of all kinds. The average level of that exposure has increased about 600-fold since 1980, according to a federal report being published this year.\n\n\"At the moment, about half of medical radiation exposure is from CT scans,\" said Fred A. Mettler Jr., a radiation health expert at the University of New Mexico who helped prepare the report. CT scans represented just a few percent of the average American's exposure to radiation from medical tests in 1980, he noted.\n\nBecause it would take decades to follow a large number of patients who have undergone CT scans to determine the exact risks posed by the exams, there are no direct data demonstrating the danger. But researchers have estimated the risk based on what is considered the best information available about the health effects of radiation -- data collected from survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as exposure of nuclear plant and medical workers.\n\nUsing that information, experts have estimated that every 1,000 to 2,000 CT scans may produce one fatal cancer that would not have occurred otherwise.\n\nAlthough that overall risk is relatively small, the large number of scans being performed could translate into a significant number of cancers. Brenner and his colleagues estimate that CT scans may be responsible for perhaps 2 percent of all cancers in the United States. The ECRI Institute estimated the scans may be causing 6,000 extra cancers each year, half of them fatal.\n\n\"Twenty years from now we could see a huge bonus of cancer coming through because of indiscriminate use of CT today,\" Launders said. \"That's the real issue people are worried about.\"\n\nThe individual risk varies depending on the age of the patient and the type of scan. Younger people face more risk than older people because they have more time for a cancer to develop. Children are especially vulnerable because their rapidly developing bodies are at least four times as sensitive to the damaging effects of radiation. A child's risk may run as high as one case of cancer for every 500 scans, experts say.\n\nAmong adults, \"young women have the highest risk,\" said Andrew Einstein of Columbia University, who evaluated the risks from cardiac CT scans in a paper published in July in the Journal of the American Medical Association. A 20-year-old woman faced the greatest risk -- one additional cancer for every 143 scans, he reported.\n\nSome question the estimates, saying the risk of exposure from radiation from multiple CT scans may not be the same as from radiation from an atomic bomb.\n\n\"It's very difficult, in our opinion to equate the data from Hiroshima, where you had an instantaneous entire-body dose of radiation, compared to a cumulative dose for multiple CT scans,\" said Moore, the radiologist. \"It's apples and oranges. It's not really the same.\"\n\nEinstein, Mettler and others, however, disagree. \"Radiation is radiation. Those are X-rays that the folks at Hiroshima and Nagasaki got. These are X-rays from a CT scan. They're really the same thing,\" said Brenner, whose report was published in November in the New England Journal of Medicine. \"If the dose is the same, then the risk is going to be the same.\"\n\nAlthough the companies that make the CT machines have been developing new protocols designed to minimize radiation exposure, particularly for children, everyone agrees that the most prudent thing to do is to eliminate unnecessary use.\n\nWhile there are scant hard data about how often CT scans are done needlessly, several experts estimated that perhaps one-third could be eliminated. There are many reasons CTs may be overused. Some CTs are full-body \"virtual physicals\" performed on people who appear perfectly healthy -- a practice widely opposed by medical authorities.\n\nSome say part of the blame lies with physicians who have financial interests in imaging facilities. \"There is statistical evidence that indicates that more scans are ordered when a physician has a financial interest than when he doesn't,\" said Moore.\n\nDefensive medicine also plays a role, with some doctors ordering the tests to stave off accusations that they withheld the most cutting-edge technology from their patients.\n\nIn other cases, overuse results from worried patients and from parents demanding CT scans that may not be needed. Other times doctors may not realize how many tests involving radiation patients have already undergone -- information that could influence a doctor's decision -- or may order a CT scan when other tests that do not involve radiation, such as a blood test, an MRI or an ultrasound, would suffice. \"There are alternatives that are arguably just as good,\" Brenner said.\n\nAnd patients also can take more responsibility for reducing the number of unnecessary scans.\n\n\"If a patient walks in and says, 'Tell me what the dose is from this and tell me what the risk is,' they are going to make the doctor start thinking about it,\" Mettler said.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story may subtly oversell the benefits of treatment.\u00a0 It is not clear that the source articles provide good information about the number of surgeries avoided, difficult diagnoses made, or lives saved due to CT scanning.\u00a0 The story inaccurately states that \"no-one questions the value of the tests for allowing doctors to quickly diagnose\u2026problems.\"\u00a0 There are many problems, even those listed, that can be diagnosed with modalities other than CT that are\u00a0less invasive, costly or harmful.

Ten years after quitting, the risk of lung cancer drops by half, according to the CDC.\n\nTo see if Chantix, which is manufactured by Pfizer, could help smokers quit without going cold turkey, Ebbert and colleagues randomly assigned 1,510 people at 61 centers in 10 countries to receive either the drug or a placebo for 24 weeks.\n\nThey asked study participants to reduce cigarette use by 50 percent by the fourth week, and by 75 percent by the eight week, with the goal of quitting by week 12.\n\nBy the last ten weeks of treatment, weeks 15 to 24, the group taking the pill had significantly higher abstinence rates than the group on placebo.\n\nThis held true even after treatment stopped.

It is an autoimmune disorder, in which the immune system attacks the thyroid gland.\n\nCertain immune-system signaling molecules also target other tissues in the body, including in the eyes, which causes their bulging appearance, sometimes known as Graves\u2019 eyes. About 30 percent of people with Graves\u2019 disease develop mildly bulging eyes, and 2 to 5 percent develop severe bulge. This eye condition usually lasts one to two years and often improves on its own, according to NIDDK.\n\nTeprotumumab blocks one of these immune signaling molecules, so researchers wanted to see what effect it might have on the eyes of Graves\u2019 patients with moderate to severe bulge.\n\nThe study \u201cincluded some of the worst cases imaginable and we\u2019re now wondering whether the drug might find expanded utility in much-less-severe disease,\u201d Smith told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.\n\nBy week 24, the response rate was 69 percent with the drug and 20 percent with placebo. Among those who completed therapy, the rates were 79 percent and 22 percent, respectively.\n\nMore people who received the drug had sizeable reductions in disease activity and reductions of 3 mm or more in eye bulge compared to the placebo group, the researchers note.\n\nHowever, while only 10 percent of patients who received the drug had double vision before the study, that rose to 50 percent by 24 weeks.\n\nHigh blood sugar was also a key side effect in participants who already had diabetes, the study team notes, but adjusting diabetes medications solved that problem.\n\nThe typical treatment for Graves\u2019 eyes is glucocorticoids, which are not always effective and also have side effects, the study team notes.\n\nThe drug, also known as RV001 or R1507, has been developed by Genmab and Roche.

The rate rose steadily, with 4.5 percent of all patients who received breast cancer diagnoses in 2003 having the surgery, up from 1.8 percent in 1998.\n\nThe numbers were much higher among women who had the breast with cancer removed, rather than a lumpectomy. That group was much more likely to choose to have the healthy breast removed, as well. In that group, 11 percent chose a double mastectomy in 2003, up from 4.2 percent in 1998.

More women are undergoing genetic testing after a diagnosis of breast cancer, and improvements in both mastectomy and breast-reconstruction techniques have made the option of a double reconstruction less daunting.\n\nDoctors and patients\u2019 advocates urged women considering the procedure to go for counseling and take their time before making a decision, noting that other risk-reducing options were available, like tamoxifen therapy for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer and the use of more sensitive magnetic resonance imaging screening for earlier detection.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The focus of the story was the increase in bilateral mastectomies in women diagnosed with breast cancer in one breast.\u00a0 The story notes that the survival difference between lumpectomy and mastectomy is about the same; however, the story does not mention that radiation is given with lumpectomy in order to reduce the risk of recurrence. Lumpectomy is not comparable to mastectomy without radiation. The story might have benefited from listing these data comparing lumpectomy and radiation with mastectomy. The story appropriately notes that having a mastectomy does not reduce a recurrence risk to zero as some cancer cells may remain.

Getting enough calcium early in life can reduce the risk of fracture and the bone-weakening condition osteoporosis later on.\n\nCalcium supplements and vitamin D are regularly prescribed for bone health in post-menopausal women, who are at higher risk of osteoporosis as their estrogen levels decline.\n\nResearchers raised new questions earlier this year about the effectiveness of calcium supplements when a study found only modest results in increasing bone mass for older women who took the supplements.\n\nNow, says Senay, a study in the Archives of Internal Medicine shows calcium supplements do reduce the risk of fractures in elderly women, but only among those who take them regularly.\n\nResearchers studied the effect of 600-milligram calcium supplements twice a day on women over 70 and found that only those women who took 80 percent or more of their pills were less likely to experience fractures. These women showed about a 10 percent chance of fracture, compared with 15 percent.\n\nMore than half of the women took their pills as directed, but women who didn't take them regularly had the same risk of fracture as those who took a dummy pill.\n\nThe message here, Senay says, is that calcium supplements are useful for bone health \u2014 but you should only take them if you do so regularly, as directed by a doctor.\n\nThe study earlier this year also found that women who took supplements regularly reduced their chance of fracture more than those who didn't.\n\nCalcium recommendations vary according to age. The National Academy of Sciences says adults between 19 and 50 years old need 1,000 milligrams of calcium each day. Adults over 50 need 1,200 milligrams per day.\n\nFour hundred international units of vitamin D are also recommended each day to help the body absorb calcium. It's important to note that calcium intakes on food labels are based on adult requirements of 1,000 milligrams per day. Anyone over 50 will need an additional 200 milligrams. The maximum recommended intake of calcium is 2,500 milligrams.\n\nRemember, Senay urged: Most people can achieve the recommended calcium intake by eating three or four servings of dairy products and other foods that contain calcium per day. Supplements are an additional tool to be used when needed.\n\nOther ways women can protect their bones as they age include weight-bearing exercise, and osteoporosis drugs for women at high risk for fractures.

But here's something the medical world is just realizing: that the gastric bypass operation has other even more dramatic effects. It can force type 2 diabetes into almost instant remission and it appears to reduce the risk of cancer.\n\nSurgeons have been performing bariatric, or weight loss operations since the 1950s, but they're much safer than they used to be. They're typically done laparoscopically now, where doctors use tiny surgical tools and video cameras instead of making big, deep incisions.\n\nDespite the increase in obesity, only a small number of people have had the gastric bypass operation.\n\nmet some people who were once morbidly obese.\n\nThere was Tony Sideman, who underwent surgery in April 2007 and has lost 140 pounds; there was Janet Rovak, who lost 90 pounds in the eight months since her surgery; and there was Travis Goodbou, who lost 260 pounds in the seven months since he underwent the operation.\n\nDr. Neil Hutcher from Richmond, Va. has performed more than 3,000 bypass surgeries. Asked how many people gain the weight back, Dr. Hutcher tells Stahl, \"You know I think when you're dealing with an incurable disease that kills many people, if you have an 85 to 90 percent success rate, that's pretty darn good.\"\n\n\"Is that what you have?\" Stahl asks.\n\nThere's no diet, no exercise regimen, and no pill with a success rate like that. These patients lose a ton of weight and keep it off.\n\nHere's how Hutcher does the surgery: first, he sections off a small pouch of the upper part of the stomach, which is then attached to a lower part of the small intestine, bypassing most of the stomach, so that there's not a lot of room for food.\n\nIt used to be that roughly one in 100 people died from this operation. Hutcher says it's now about one in 1,000, which makes it less deadly than most major surgeries.\n\n\"It's less than gall bladder surgery. It's about one-tenth of cardiac surgery,\" he explains.\n\nIt's safer because of new surgical techniques which have also made it more effective. For instance, they can make the stomach pouch smaller than they used to.\n\n\"Even if I wanted to eat a whole cheesecake, my stomach is very tiny. It holds four ounces max, stretched to the max. And that's not even one piece of cheesecake,\" a female patient explained.\n\nA big reason the operation works is because it seems to suppress appetite. \"If you listen to your patients, they come back and they say, 'Doctor, you put the fire out,'\" Hutcher says.\n\n\"When you see a sign for fast food or\u2026she's already shaking her head at me,\" Stahl asked a patient.\n\n\"Don't want it,\" the female patient replied. \"I used to crave sweets all the time.

He owns a doughnut shop with his siblings, but he's able to resist the cravings. \"Before I'd have cravings for everything. Now I really don't,\" he told Stahl.\n\nFor most patients the cravings really do disappear. One theory is that's because the operation suppresses the levels of a stomach hormone called \"grelin\" that activates the sensation of hunger.\n\nYet most people who have this operation do not get skinny. Dr. David Cummings, an expert on appetite at the University of Washington, says as a rule these patients end up just one third lighter.\n\n\"Most people with severe obesity who undergo gastric bypass do not become fully normal, in terms of body weight. They go from severely obese to mildly obese, or from obese to overweight. But nevertheless it's an enormous change,\" Dr. Cummings explains.\n\nAnd not just in terms of weight loss.

They're on the rise in the United States and no one knows why.\n\nSome children are allergic to many foods, and it's impossible to know based on preventive testing whether someone will have a mild or severe reaction. And so far there's no cure.\n\nResearchers at Johns Hopkins University and Duke University are working on a treatment that may one day allow kids with allergies to safely eat the foods that cause them life-threatening reactions. It's still in the early stages, but Dr. Robert Wood of Johns Hopkins, who has been on the forefront of food allergy research, estimates the treatment could be brought to the public within six to eight years.\n\n \n\n In his new study, researchers explored a treatment for children with cow's milk allergies. The strategy is to desensitize the child by giving small amounts of the allergen (milk). Oral immunotherapy, swallowing small amounts of the allergen, has shown to be more effective than sublingual therapy, which involves putting even tinier quantities of milk under the person's tongue.\n\nWood and colleagues found promising results from this small experiment with 30 children ages 6 to 18. These kids were severely allergic to cow's milk. Wood presented the study, published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, at the 2012 Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology this weekend.\n\nThe results suggested that children who went through a year of sublingual therapy followed by one to two years of oral immunotherapy were less likely to have significant allergic reactions when undergoing the oral immunotherapy. Still, it did not eliminate all symptoms.\n\nThis is particularly important, because about 20% of the kids that Wood and colleagues work with have significant reactions during the treatment that make the therapy unfeasible, Wood said.\n\nSome participants have shown they can safely eat milk products up to a year after stopping the therapies, Wood said. But only one-third have longterm protection. Others need regular exposure to milk in order to maintain protection against allergic reactions.\n\n\"With milk that\u2019s not too hard,\" Wood says, because one could \"eat pizza a couple of times a week.\"\n\nIt's not known yet whether children respond better to this kind of treatment than adults, since there have been so few participants in this research. The big barrier to broadening the scope of the research is funding, Wood said.\n\nThis is the first time the sublingual therapy has been studied in terms of its benefit as a precursor to the oral immunotherapy, Wood said.\n\nOther research has shown that immunotherapy techniques may similarly work for children with peanut allergies. But tree nuts may be harder to treat, Wood said, because tree-nut allergic individuals often have multiple kinds of nuts they can't eat.\n\nResearchers are separately looking at a drug called omalizumab (Xolair), approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of severe asthma, to see if it could help people with food allergies, too.\n\nDo not try the immunotherapy technique at home; these experiments are conducted under medical supervision.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story reported benefits in this way:\nThe results suggested that children who went through a year of sublingual therapy followed by one to two years of oral immunotherapy were less likely to have significant allergic reactions when undergoing the oral immunotherapy.

Fatigue that stems from cancer or cancer treatments has been found to lower patients' quality of life even more than pain, and studies have shown that anywhere from 60 to 90 percent of patients receiving radiation therapy report this symptom. Furthermore, erectile dysfunction is reported in 21 to 85 percent of all prostate cancer patients, while urinary incontinence is reported in 24 percent of men with this disease.\n\nThe possible explanation for the benefits of yoga seen in the study stems from physiologic data demonstrating its ability to help reduce cancer- as well as treatment- related fatigue and to strengthen pelvic floor muscles and increase blood flow. These latter aspects may in turn improve erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence, said Vapiwala.\n\n\"There may also be a psychosocial benefit that derives from participation in a group fitness activity that incorporates meditation and promotes overall healthiness. And all of this ultimately improves general quality of life,\" she added.\n\nOther studies have demonstrated beneficial health and quality of life effects from yoga interventions in cancer patients. However, yoga has been predominantly evaluated for breast cancer, and research on its role in alleviating prostate cancer patients' side effects has been lacking, largely due to the perception that men would not be willing to participate in this form of holistic exercise.\n\nNational statistics indicate that 72 percent of those who practice yoga are female, and only 18 percent of practitioners are over the age of 55. The median age at diagnosis for cancer of the prostate is 66.\n\n\"Despite these figures, we found that a structured yoga intervention in the form of twice-weekly classes is feasible for patients during a six- to nine-week course of outpatient radiotherapy for prostate cancer,\" said Vapiwala. \"Our participation-rate finding alone is important because it is a caution against making assumptions about patients without proper evidence.\"\n\nSpecifically, between May 2013 and June 2014, 68 eligible prostate cancer patients were identified and offered study participation, of which 45 consented (66 percent) to attend twice-weekly yoga classes of 75 minutes each, taught by trained Eischens yoga instructors within the Abramson Cancer Center.\n\nAlthough 18 (40 percent) of these participants were voluntarily withdrawn early due to unavoidable and unanticipated conflicts between radiation treatment times and the yoga class schedule, the remainder were able to participate and the study's feasibility endpoint was met.\n\n\"Eischens yoga incorporates ideas from movement theory and kinesiology and is accessible to all body types and experience levels,\" said Tali Mazar Ben-Josef, DMD, a certified Eischens yoga instructor and researcher in the Abramson Cancer Center, who will present the results at the SOI meeting.\n\nMost yoga participants reported a sense of well-being at the end of each class, and upon finishing the yoga program and concluding their study involvement, many patients requested and received an at-home practice routine to fit their needs, Ben-Josef said.\n\nThe effect of yoga was measured by participants' responses to a series of questions that assess overall quality-of-life, cancer-related fatigue, and prevalence of sexual and erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence. The researchers chose these variables because they affect so many prostate cancer patients.\n\nSeverity of fatigue scores demonstrated significant variability over the time of treatment, with increases by week four as expected, but then improving over the course of treatment. Erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and general quality of life scores demonstrated steady trends.\n\nCurrently, the team is randomizing prostate cancer patients to participation vs. no participation in this structured yoga program in order to further characterize the potential benefits of yoga in this population.\n\nThis trial represents an expansion of the Abramson Cancer Center's integrative medicine and wellness services that are available to patients and survivors. In addition to yoga, patients can receive training in stress-reduction techniques, meditation, reiki therapy, acupuncture, and massage.\n\n\"We offer several ways to enhance quality of life, minimize or reduce side effects of cancer and cancer treatment, and promote healing and recovery,\" Vapiwala said. \"This study represents one of many research projects we are conducting in an effort to pinpoint the best, most effective practices to help patients with these needs.\"\n\nNearly 240,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year in the United States, according to the American Cancer Society, which funded the new study.\n\nThe full results from the feasibility study are expected to be published early 2016.", "question": "Does the news release adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Numbers might have helped the reader decide whether, in fact, the news release was really about how yoga may lessen the side effects associated with prostate cancer treatment, or whether it was about the feasibility of such a study.\nBut numbers were lacking. \u201cMost yoga participants reported a sense of well-being at the end of each class, and upon finishing the yoga program and concluding their study involvement, many patients requested and received an at-home practice routine to fit their needs,\u201d one researcher says.\nMost? 51%? 99%?\nMeasuring how someone feels is often subjective and can be difficult.

Most sleep aids, including Sanofi\u2019s Ambien or Sunovion Pharmaceuticals\u2019 Lunesta, act on a key neurotransmitter in the brain called GABA.\n\n\u201cThese treatments work by forcing the brain to go to sleep,\u201d said study leader Jason Uslaner of Merck in an interview on the website of Science Translational Medicine, which published the study.\n\nGABA receptors are important to many brain regions, including those important for cognition, which is likely why common sleep aids can cause memory loss and attention problems.\n\n\u201cWhen you hit those, you don\u2019t just hit the sleep system,\u201d John Renger, executive director and head of neruoscience basic research at Merck and one of the study\u2019s authors, said in a telephone interview.\n\nSuvorexant is part of a class of drugs called Dual Orexin Receptor Antagonists or DORAs, which work by blocking chemical messengers called orexins. Orexins are responsible for keeping people awake. Levels of this compound rise during the day and fall at night.\n\nOrexins originate in a specific region of the hypothalamus, so targeting them may have less impact on other brain functions, Renger said.\n\nFor this study, the team wanted to find out what would happen if someone is awakened on this drug and has a very high level of it in their system.\n\n\u201cHow impaired would they be?\u201d Renger said.\n\nTo test this, the researchers did a series of experiments on rhesus monkeys and rats. First, the team trained monkeys to perform a common attention test in which they needed to respond quickly to a blinking light on a screen and remember what they touched. Monkeys given GABA inhibitors were much slower in responding to the prompt, and in some cases, missed it altogether, while monkeys given a potent orexin blocker called DORA-22 did not show these attention issues, Renger said.\n\nThe team also saw differences in a simple memory test in rats. Rats were first exposed to a colored object, and then later exposed to it again. Typically, rats that recall an object show less interest in it when they are shown it again.\n\nIn the study, rats given GABA blockers were less likely to recall the objects than those given DORA-22.\n\nEmmanuel Mignot of Stanford University, who wrote a commentary on the study in the same journal, said the findings show promise.\n\n\u201cAre DORAs the perfect hypnotics? Only long-term use in large numbers of insomnia patients will reveal whether these drugs will be preferred to GABAergic hypnotics, and whether they produce rare complications, including narcolepsy-like symptoms in predisposed individuals,\u201d Mignot wrote.\n\nSo far, Merck has not seen any cases of narcolepsy, a sleep disorder marked by daytime sleepiness, in its late-stage clinical trials, Renger said.\n\nThe most common side effects from Suvorexant have been headache and sleepiness.

Not so in the United States, however, where officially it can be sold only for research purposes.\n\nPiracetam is well studied and is credited by its users with boosting their memory, sharpening their focus, heightening their immune system, even bettering their personalities. But it\u2019s only one of many formulations in the racetam drug family. Newer ones include aniracetam, phenylpiracetam and oxiracetam. All are available online, where their efficacy and safety are debated and reviewed on message boards and in podcasts.\n\nA number of companies now market nootropic \u201cstacks,\u201d or formulas, some of which include piracetam, herbal remedies, amino acids and citicoline, a naturally occurring brain chemical that can be taken orally as a supplement, intravenously or as a shot.\n\nBecause they are sold as nutritional supplements and natural products that refrain from making health claims, they avoid close government scrutiny.\n\nWhen Burke began ordering piracetam online five years ago, it arrived in baggies filled with white powder. \u201cIt was as if I was buying coke off the street,\u201d he recalls. These days, he buys his stack from Nootroo, a San Francisco company.\n\nBut self-experimenters such as Burke often don\u2019t restrict themselves to medication alone. Dedicated brain hackers, as they call themselves, are willing to exploit their own biology to try to sharpen their mind. Their methods include meditation, cold-water plunges, periodic fasting and high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets.\n\n\u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to maximize their cognitive ability? Who doesn\u2019t want to maximize their muscle mass?\u201d asks Murali Doraiswamy, who has led several trials of cognitive enhancers at Duke University Health System and has been an adviser to pharmaceutical and supplement manufacturers as well as the Food and Drug Administration. He attributes the demand to an increasingly knowledge-based society that values mental quickness and agility above all else.\n\nBut while some studies have found short-term benefits, Doraiswamy says there is no evidence that what are commonly known as smart drugs \u2014 of any type \u2014 improve thinking or productivity over the long run. \u201cThere\u2019s a sizable demand, but the hype around efficacy far exceeds available evidence,\u201d notes Doraiswamy, adding that, for healthy young people such as Silicon Valley go-getters, \u201cit\u2019s a zero-sum game. That\u2019s because when you up one circuit in the brain, you\u2019re probably impairing another system.\u201d\n\nEarly studies attributed a lot of short-term benefits to nootropics \u2014 so much so that in 1983, Russian scientists turned to phenylpiracetam to boost the physical and mental performance of cosmonauts during space flight.\n\nA 1999 study found that piracetam had beneficial effects on the hippocampal membranes of patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The hippocampus, an area of the brain that plays a key role in the formation of new memories, typically shows severe shrinkage with Alzheimer\u2019s. The idea that piracetam might reverse that effect was exciting.\n\nAlthough piracetam has a history of \u201crelatively few side effects,\u201d it has fallen far short of its initial promise for treating any of the illnesses associated with cognitive decline, according to Lon Schneider, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California. \u201cWe don\u2019t use it at all and never have.\u201d\n\nAs for newer nootropic drugs, there are unknown risks. \u201cPiracetam has been studied for decades,\u201d says cognitive neuroscientist Andrew Hill, the founder of a neurofeedback company in Los Angeles called Peak Brain Institute. But \u201csome of [the newer] compounds are things that some random editor found in a scientific article, copied the formula down and sent it to China and had a bulk powder developed three months later that they\u2019re selling. Please don\u2019t take it, people!\u201d\n\nFor Burke and other brain hackers, the evidence for nootropics is strong enough.\n\nBurke, who begins each morning with a Bulletproof coffee \u2014 a rich brew of caffeine with dollops of butter and coconut oil \u2014 has created a San Francisco meetup group called Peak Performance \u201cto teach all my friends in the tech space about life hacks so they can kick a--better every day.\u201d\n\nLast spring, 100 people showed up at a Peak Performance event where psychedelic psychologist James Fadiman said the key to unleashing the cognition-enhancing effects of LSD \u2014 which he listed as less anxiety, better focus, improved sleep, greater creativity \u2014 was all in the dosage. He recommended a tenth of a \u201cparty dose\u201d \u2014 enough to give you \u201cthe glow\u201d and enhance your cognitive powers without \u201cthe trip.\u201d\n\nBurke says he definitely got the glow. \u201cThe first time I took it, I was working on a business plan. I had to juggle multiple contingencies in my head, and for some reason a tree with branches jumped into my head. I was able to place each contingency on a branch, retract and go back to the trunk, and in this visual way I was able to juggle more information.\u201d\n\nNot all brain hacking involves taking a pill, though.\n\nNootrobox, a San Francisco company that markets a nootropic mix of vitamins, minerals and amino acids, promotes fasting as a way to energize brain and body.\n\n\u201cWe stumbled upon fasting as a way to optimize cognition and make yourself into a more efficient human being,\u201d says Manuel Lam, an internal medicine physician who advises Nootrobox on clinical issues. He and members of the company\u2019s executive team have implanted glucose monitors in their arms \u2014 not because they fear diabetes but because they wish to track the real-time effect of the foods they eat.\n\n\u201cFasting forces your body to deplete its glucose storage and trains it to look inside for fuel,\u201d Lam enthuses. \u201cIt\u2019s like being strapped to a solar panel. The sun is always shining on you.\u201d\n\nNootrobox employees are encouraged to fast every Tuesday, then meet for breakfast on Wednesday at a local diner. Founded by two Stanford University computer graduates, the company has initiated an international fasting group on Facebook; at last count, there were 3,500 members.\n\nResearch on animals has shown that intermittent fasting \u2014 limiting caloric intake at least two days a week \u2014 can help improve neural connections in the hippocampus and protect against the accumulation of plaque, a protein prevalent in the brains of people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Research has also shown that intermittent fasting helped reduce anxiety in mice.\n\nMark Mattson, chief of the Laboratory of Neurosciences at the National Institute on Aging, has overseen a lot of the animal studies on fasting and is impressed with the evidence \u2014 so much so that he has personally adopted a regimen of intermittent fasting.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s pretty conclusive evidence from animal studies that intermittent fasting is beneficial for brain function and resistance to aging from neurogenerative diseases,\u201d he says.\n\nFasting has been deployed since the ancient Greeks to fast-track learning. As Plato is said to have stated, \u201cI fast for greater physical and mental efficiency.\u201d The philosopher Pythagoras reportedly demanded that his students fast 40 days before attending his lectures.\n\nFar easier to take a pill.\n\nLooking for an edge\n\nVinh Ngo, a San Francisco family practice doctor who specializes in hormone therapy, has become familiar with piracetam and other nootropics through a changing patient base. His office is located in the heart of the city\u2019s tech boom and he is increasingly sought out by young, male tech workers who tell him they are interested in cognitive enhancement.\n\nNgo has experimented with piracetam himself (\u201cThe first time I tried it, I thought, \u2018Wow, this is pretty strong for a supplement.\u2019 I had a little bit of reflux, heartburn, but in general it was a cognitive enhancer. . . . I found it helpful\u201d) and the neurotransmitter DMEA (\u201cYou have an idea, it helps you finish the thought. It\u2019s for when people have difficulty finishing that last connection in the brain\u201d).\n\nBut he has also seen patients whose propensity for self-experimentation to improve cognition got out of hand. One chief executive he treated, Ngo said, developed an unhealthy predilection for albuterol, because he felt the asthma inhaler medicine kept him alert and productive long after others had quit working. Unfortunately, the drug ended up severely imbalancing his electrolytes, which can lead to dehydration, headaches, vision and cardiac problems, muscle contractions and, in extreme cases, seizures.\n\n\u201cThere is that culture here [in Silicon Valley] that relies on being smarter than your own self,\u201d Ngo says. \u201cPeople want to find an edge over their competitor \u2014 that\u2019s how they got their position in the first place. I\u2019m trying to give them a little more wiggle room \u2014 but in a safe way.\u201d\n\nHe says he screens his patients for addiction and cardiovascular problems and creates individual treatment plans based on their health histories and blood tests.\n\nThere\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach. \u201cI don\u2019t have a rubber stamp for everyone, and not everyone is a candidate\u201d for cognitive enhancement, says Ngo, who requires that his patients sign waivers acknowledging possible health risks in taking nootropics.\n\nIf, for example, someone decides to go on medication \u2014 be it Adderall, albuterol or piracetam \u2014 the patient must understand that there is a risk for high blood pressure and heart problems.\n\n\u201cI want to empower them,\u201d Ngo says, but \u201cthere\u2019s a fine line between empowering them to make their own health decisions and staying healthy.\u201d\n\nSmart drugs are here.

Several studies indicate that babies born prematurely receive too little DHA, and some studies have found that premature babies fed DHA after birth show better cognitive performance or visual coordination later on than preemies who aren\u2019t given DHA.\n\nBut the new study, which mainly assessed full-term babies, found no cognitive difference at 18 months whether mothers received DHA supplements or placebos. The lead researcher, Dr. Maria Makrides of the University of Adelaide in Australia, said this suggested that full-term babies already get enough DHA in the womb, and that \u201cthere\u2019s no extra boost\u201d from getting more.\n\nNonetheless, several experts said they would continue to support taking DHA in pregnancy, especially since it is safe and apparently has few downsides. They cited a smaller 2003 Norwegian study that found I.Q. increases at age 4, although no cognitive benefit was seen in infants or 7-year-olds.\n\nThat study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Ingrid Helland of Oslo University Hospital, said that perhaps the benefit shown at age 4 existed at 7 but was difficult to identify amid other developmental factors. She said babies in her study might have received more DHA than those in this study. Dr. Oken said the new study might have shown no benefit in 18-month-olds because effects in infants might be \u201chard to measure\u201d or \u201cit may be that the benefit of DHA is not as important as when you\u2019re 4.\u201d\n\nDr. Makrides\u2019s team plans assessments at 4 and 7.

Its effect in supplements for children and adults is being studied, as well as whether supplements offer the same benefit as DHA-rich fish, like salmon.\n\nSome studies, including the new report, suggest DHA supplementation in pregnancy reduces the likelihood of premature birth.

Dr. Scott Stuart, a University of Iowa psychiatry and psychology professor, said his pregnant patients with mild to moderate depression had improved when taking DHA while seeing a counselor.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no harm that we know of at all, in contrast to many antidepressants,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it might be of some help.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "On the \"smarter babies\"\u00a0issue, the story reported \"no cognitive difference at 18 months whether mothers received DHA supplements or placebos.\"\u00a0Perhaps that\u2019s sufficient on the one issue.\u00a0\nBut then it also reported \"the new study showed small reductions in postpartum depression in women with histories or high risk of depression.\"\u00a0 What does \"small reductions\" mean?\u00a0 Did it make much of a difference in women\u2019s lives? \u00a0\nAnd which issue mattered more to women \u2013\u00a0\"smarter babies\" or postpartum depression?\u00a0", "answer": 0}, {"article": "A new device worn like a visor can detect emergent large-vessel occlusion in patients with suspected stroke with 92 percent accuracy, report clinical investigators at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), Mount Sinai, the University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center and elsewhere in an article published online on March 6, 2018, in the Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery. Patients with large-vessel occlusions can then be routed to a Comprehensive Stroke Center with endovascular capabilities. In contrast, a standard physical examination achieved only 40 to 89 percent accuracy in identifying patients with large-vessel occlusion who could benefit from endovascular therapy.\n\nThe volumetric impedance phase shift spectroscopy (VIPS) device (Cerebrotech VisorTM, Cerebrotech Medical Systems, Pleasanton, CA) works by sending low-energy radio waves through the brain that change frequency when passing through fluids. Such waves are reflected back through the brain and then detected by the device. When a patient is having a severe stroke, the brain's fluids will change, producing an asymmetry in the radio waves detected by the VIPS device. The greater the asymmetry, the more severe the stroke.\n\nEndovascular therapy within 24 hours is the standard of care for emergent large-vessel occlusion, but the chance of achieving a good outcome decreases by approximately 20 percent for each hour that passes before treatment.\n\nThe researchers hope that the device will save valuable time -- especially important in stroke where time is brain -- when it is deployed with emergency medical personnel in the field. This is because the accuracy of the device simplifies the decision made by emergency personnel about where to take patients first, according to Raymond D. Turner, M.D., professor of neurosurgery and chief of the Neuroscience Integrated Center of Clinical Excellence at MUSC. Turner served as principal investigator for MUSC in the VIPS for the Non-Invasive Detection of Hemispheric Bioimpedance Asymmetry in Severe Brain Pathology (VITAL) study reported in the article.\n\n\"Transfer between hospitals takes a lot of time,\" said Turner. \"If we can give the information to emergency personnel out in the field that this is a large-vessel occlusion, that should change their thought process in triage as to which hospital they go to.\"\n\nIn the study, the VIPS device was deployed with emergency medical personnel in regions served by five Comprehensive Stroke Centers equipped with the endovascular capabilities to treat large-vessel occlusions that underlie severe stroke. Their goal was to use the device to accurately identify severe stroke and then compare the results to established physical examination methods practiced by emergency personnel such as the Prehospital Acute Stroke Severity Scale.\n\nBoth healthy participants and patients with suspected stroke were evaluated by emergency personnel using the VIPS device. Three readings were taken and averaged -- a process that takes about 30 seconds. Patients were also later evaluated by neurologists who provided definitive diagnoses using neuroimaging.\n\nCompared to the neurologists' diagnoses, the device displayed 92 percent specificity -- the ability to detect the difference between patients with severe stroke and those with other conditions such as mild stroke or healthy participants with no brain pathology. This places the VIPS device above standard physical examination tools used by emergency personnel that display specificity scores between 40 and 89 percent.\n\nThe VIPS device is made by Cerebrotech Medical Systems, which paid consultants to analyze the neuroimaging data independently. The neuroimaging data was needed to teach the VIPS device which radio waves were indicative of stroke. Yet the consultants did not have access to the VIPS radio wave data during their review of the images, thereby eliminating the potential of the consultants to choose data that might artificially inflate the device's accuracy. It is also not clear how the device would work for patients with cranial implants, as metal interferes with the device's operating radio frequencies.\n\nThe device's success may be found in its ability to give emergency personnel a clear answer as to whether a patient is experiencing a severe stroke. The VIPS device requires very little training to operate compared to that required to learn standard emergency examination skills, thereby reducing the possibility of human error during emergency diagnosis.\n\nIn their next steps, the researchers are undertaking the VITAL 2.0 study to determine if the VIPS device can use complex machine learning algorithms to teach itself how to discriminate between minor and severe stroke without the help of neurologists. If so, the VIPS device could have widespread clinical implications, helping emergency personnel decide whether to take a patient to a comprehensive stroke center or a primary stroke center for treatment.\n\nTurner likens the use of the VIPS device in detecting severe stroke to the use of electrocardiography (ECG) to definitively detect acute myocardial infarction. He predicts that the device has the potential to be used widely by emergency personnel but also to appear in other public spaces. \"This could potentially be something like a defibrillator,\" said Turner. \"You can find out if a patient is having a stroke, just like you can put a defibrillator on a patient to see if they're having a heart attack.\"\n\nThis study was funded by Cerebrotech Medical Systems.\n\nAbout MUSC Founded in 1824 in Charleston, The Medical University of South Carolina is the oldest medical school in the South.

It\u2019s also an easy-on-the joints form of exercise for seniors and others who suffer from arthritis, and a recent study shows it can speed recovery from stroke faster than using a traditional treadmill.\n\nIt\u2019s just an all-around good aerobic conditioner for athletes, too, sports medicine expert Dr. Naresh Rao, told CBS News. Rao is the Olympic Team USA Water Polo Physician for the 2016 Summer Games.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been using hydrotherapy to help decrease any sort of gravity that can affect joint function,\u201d said Rao, who is also with the department of family medicine at Plainview Hospital in Plainview, New York. \u201cI personally prescribe it for knee issues and low back issues.\u201d\n\nHydrotherapy uses a water-friendly treadmill that can be placed in a pool. Another method involves a specially designed treadmill tank.\n\nMatt Johnson, a physical therapist at St. Luke\u2019s Hospital in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, told CBS News that the tank is basically a freestanding tub, about six feet long by three feet wide, with a motorized belt. The water height can be adjusted to the patient\u2019s abilities. The buoyancy of the water helps someone who\u2019s been injured to walk and run a little sooner than they\u2019d be able to do on dry ground, he explained.\n\n\u201cIn water, we can teach them sooner. They can really work on their gait, walk without pain, do exercises in water that you wouldn\u2019t be able to do on land,\u201d said Johnson.\n\nHe uses a HydroTrack Underwater Treadmill System \u2013 professional sports teams including the New York Yankees and the Miami Dolphins, have used it, too. The nice thing about it, said Johnson, is that people can step right into the tank at ground level and then the water fills up around them. It works like a lock on a canal, he said. So, even older patients with limited mobility and balance don\u2019t have to negotiate getting down into a pool.\n\nJohnson starts off recuperating athletes and patients in water somewhere between waist and chest height. The treadmill speed can be set anywhere from 0.3 to 7.1 miles per hour depending on how much resistance a person can handle.\n\n\u201cAt waist height, it\u2019s at about 50 percent of body weight. At chest height, it\u2019s about 30 percent of body weight,\u201d Johnson said, noting, for example, that a person with an injured knee who weighs 100 pounds who is running in waist-high water would only feel like 50 pounds on the bad knee.\n\n\u201cTaking some of that pressure off the knee helps them tolerate that knee injury longer,\u201d said Johnson.\n\nA recent study in the American Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation showed that water workouts might benefit stroke survivors. Researchers asked 21 patients who\u2019d had a stroke within the past two months to undergo two treadmill exercise tests \u2013 one submerged in water and one on a regular treadmill. They gradually increased walking speed and slope over time until the patients couldn\u2019t go any further. Walking on the underwater treadmill produced better measures when it came to maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), a reflection of heart and lung function during exercise, and metabolic equivalents, a measure of energy use.\n\n\u201cThe study proposes a different, very innovative approach\u201d to rehabilitation after stroke, said Dr. Gisele Wolf-Klein, director of geriatric education at Northwell Health in Great Neck, New York.\n\nWolfe-Klein told CBS News she has tried water workouts and said you don\u2019t even feel like you break a sweat even if your heart rate is up. \u201cIt\u2019s a very pleasant way of achieving exactly what you\u2019re trying to do \u2013 allowing a cardio-respiratory response,\u201d Wolfe-Klein told CBS News.\n\nShe noted that medicine\u2019s veterinary counterparts have been using water therapy for years with injured racehorses.\n\nBudd Coates, training director at Runner\u2019s World magazine, said runners don\u2019t just plunge into water\u200b therapy when they\u2019re injured; it\u2019s a great conditioning method for healthy athletes, too. Some recreational swimming pools and homeowners with backyard pools have manual treadmills that are water-safe and can be plunked right in the water.\n\nAn alternative to a water treadmill: Some pool companies will install a water flow system you can work out against.\n\n\u201cIt creates a water force and helps keep you jogging in place,\u201d said Coates.\n\nFor those without access to a water treadmill, you can purchase a foam vest specifically designed for water jogging or use foam barbells to help keep you afloat. Some pools may loan them out, too.\n\nOr, Coates suggested, just try it freeform with waist- or chest-high water to start. If you have trouble getting in out of a recreational pool, look for one that has a slanting beach-style entry into the water, or one with a robotic chair lift. Ask a pool lifeguard or certified swim instructor to help you.\n\nIf running\u2019s not your thing, but the water looks inviting, Coates said there are also spin bikes that can be used underwater.\n\nCoates said the beauty of water running (or even walking) is that it\u2019s great for any age and any level of ability, from elderly stroke survivors to Olympic athletes.\n\nGalen Rupp, the 2016 Rio Olympics\u200b men\u2019s marathon bronze medalist, relies on it as part of his training.\n\n\u201cHe and some of the other guys on the Nike team, it\u2019s well known they take advantage of the anti-gravity treadmill and the aqua track,\u201d Coates said.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story focuses on multiple benefits, none of which are quantified.

And that early screening also means that colorectal cancer can be treated more effectively.\n\nBut all of this hasn't been enough to convince a lot of people make those appointments. Fear of doctors, the prospect of being poked and prodded in strange places, a lack of insurance to cover the costly test -- or a combination of all three -- are to blame for as many as half of the over-50 crowd putting off or avoiding the screening test altogether.\n\nThat's why the American Cancer Society, which estimates there will be about 108,000 new cases of colon cancer and 40,700 new cases of rectal cancer this year, added the stool DNA test to its screening guidelines this spring. It joins six other tests, including the traditional colonoscopy and the new CT colonography, or virtual colonoscopy.\n\nDr. Sanford Markowitz, a cancer genetics expert at the Ireland Cancer Center of University Hospitals Case Medical Center, has helped develop the technology behind the stool DNA test.\n\nFive years ago, Markowitz, who is also on the faculty at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, and his research team discovered a specific DNA change that takes place in colon cancers. They then created techniques for detecting the DNA change when it expelled from the body in feces.\n\nWith the discovery of the gene marker Vimentin comes a new way to significantly increase the rate of detection of colon cancer.\n\nWhile colonoscopy is still viewed as the best screening agent, it's not effective if it's not being used, he said.\n\n\"Clearly by itself, it is not reaching other people,\" said Markowitz, who sits on the medical advisory board of the National Colorectal Cancer Research Alliance.

That vaccine \u2014 dubbed ZPIV for purified inactivated Zika virus \u2014 uses a more traditional vaccine approach and depends on dead virus particles.\n\nTo develop the vaccine, researchers kill the virus with chemicals, leaving behind harmless proteins that the body can learn to recognize as foreign invaders. Using those proteins as targets, the immune system can then produce antibodies to latch onto live virus particles and destroy them. This kind of vaccine is much safer than ones that depend on live virus particles to foster immunity.\n\nRelated: Company Gets OK to Test New Zika Vaccine\n\nThe researchers gave 16 monkeys an initial dose of ZPIV and then a booster four weeks later.

[Brown University] -- New results from a clinical trial involving more than 900 military veterans at high risk for keratinocyte carcinoma skin cancer provides evidence that using the generic skin cream fluorouacil 5 percent for two to four weeks may reduce the risk of a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) needing surgery by 75 percent within a year.\n\nThe finding that less than one month's use of fluorouacil 5% (5-FU) appeared to prevent cancer for up to a year is encouraging, said lead author Dr. Martin A. Weinstock, a professor of dermatology in the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University and chief of dermatology at the Providence Veterans Affairs Medical Center.\n\nThe dose is the same as dermatologists currently employ to treat actinic keratosis. In a 2015 study, Weinstock and co-authors showed the up to four-week regimen of 5-FU had a multi-year preventive benefit in reducing the number of actinic keratosis (AK) and the need for treatment. Earlier this year, they also showed that the medicine prevents new AKs from emerging for two to three years.\n\nMeanwhile, current means for preventing new carcinomas in high-risk patients -- sunscreen or oral medications -- cease to work as soon as they are no longer used. But in the new study, 5-FU appeared to provide prolonged protection after discontinuation and could be combined with sunscreen, Weinstock said.\n\nIn the absence of such a long-lasting prevention option, he said, the typical approach to caring for patients with a history of prior carcinomas is to monitor for the next cancer and then remove it surgically -- an effective but imposing strategy often called \"wait and cut.\"\n\n\"People don't appreciate having stuff cut on their face a lot,\" said Weinstock, who led the trial funded by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and conducted at a dozen V.A. hospitals around the country. \"They do it if there is a cancer there, but we want to take a proactive approach where we can give them something to reduce their risk of getting new cancers.\"\n\nThe new results are published in JAMA Dermatology.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2013, the Veterans Affairs Keratinocyte Carcinoma Chemoprevention Trial randomly assigned 932 veterans who each had at least two prior basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) or SCCs to either receive the 5-FU cream or a cream just like it but without the active ingredient as an experimental control. All of the veterans were instructed to apply their cream twice a day to their face and ears for up to four weeks. They also received a 30 SPF sunscreen and received education about skin cancer, sunscreen and sun safety.\n\nThe two groups were both almost exclusively white and male, and they averaged 71 years of age. The experimental and control groups were very similar along all other measured characteristics, including their self- reported degree of prior sun exposure and sunburn. Veterans typically have spent a large amount of time in the sun during their years of service.\n\nBoth groups went to their V.A. center twice a year for two to four years for follow-up exams with a dermatologist. Neither the veterans nor the examining dermatologists knew who received 5-FU and who received the placebo.\n\nAfter the first year, 20 of the 464 veterans in the control group developed a squamous cell carcinoma that required surgery, but only five of the 468 veterans who got 5-FU did, a statistically significant 75 percent reduction in the risk, according to the study. For the subsequent three years, there was no longer a significant difference between the two groups in the number of patients who required surgical treatment for an SCC.\n\nFor BCCs, there was an 11 percent reduced risk after the first year among the group that received 5-FU, but that difference was not statistically significant. In the second year, BCC cases requiring surgery rose in the 5-FU group, but in years three and four, and by the end of the study, there was no significant overall difference in risk of developing a BCC requiring surgical treatment. After four years, 298 of all study the participants had developed at least one BCC, and 108 had developed at least one SCC.\n\nThe study did show a significant decrease in the risk of needing Mohs surgery to treat a BCC in the first year. Mohs surgery is more effective but also more elaborate and expensive than a conventional procedure, Weinstock said. In the study's first year, 36 BCCs were treated with Mohs surgery in 27 participants in the control group, but only 17 BCCs were treated with the procedure among 14 patients in the 5-FU group.\n\n\"This suggests that using the 5-FU can reduce the resources needed to treat these carcinomas,\" Weinstock said.\n\nThe cream does have common side effects including reddened, more sensitive and often crusty skin, effects that resolve when the application of the cream stops, Weinstock acknowledged. After the study's first six months, 21 percent of the 5-FU group rated the side effects as \"severe,\" and 40 percent rated them as \"moderate.\"\n\nBut after six months and again at the end of the four-year trial, 87 percent of participants in the 5-FU group said they'd be willing to repeat the treatment if it proved effective in reducing skin cancer.\n\nIn his clinical work, Weinstock said that for particularly high-risk patients, he has recommended 5-FU treatment. Based on the study results, it could be that patients need to renew their regimen with the cream every year.\n\n\"The most remarkable thing about this study is that now we have something to use that doesn't lose its effectiveness when you stop using it,\" Weinstock said. \"But this is the first study of its type.

Lungs are clogged with a thick mucus, which can lead to lung infections. The disease also affects the pancreas, making it difficult for the body to absorb food, which significantly stunts growth and often leads to early deaths.\n\nThe researchers studied cases of children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis going back to the 1990s who received an injection of human growth hormone every day for six months to a year.\n\nIn the 1950s, children with cystic fibrosis generally died before age 8. But with antibiotics and other medical advances, the median age for people with the disease increased to 37 by 2008.\n\n\"As the kids with cystic fibrosis are living longer and longer, a lot of these ancillary problems are become more apparent,\" said C. Michael White, director of the Evidence-based Practice Center and lead author of the study.\n\nIn the cases studied, the researchers found that human growth hormone added 1.25 inches in height and three pounds to the patients. That growth also resulted in larger internal organs, particularly the lungs, making breathing easier.\n\nHGH also appears to improve the mineral content in bones, making them stronger. There's not enough evidence that it prevents osteoporosis, a common result of cystic fibrosis, but White said the results are \"promising.\"\n\nFor those who received human growth hormone, White said, annual hospitalizations decreased by half, from about three per year to 1.5.\n\nHGH therapy can be expensive, but fewer hospitalizations should balance out the expense.\n\n\"Hopefully, this is going to encourage cystic fibrosis care providers to use it more frequently in patients at the lower end of weight and of short stature,\" Lapin said of the findings.\n\nA daily injection can be difficult for a child who is already taking several other medications, White said, but going to the hospital fewer times might make up for it.\n\n\"I could see that, for a lot of kids, the injections would become just part of the daily routine,\" he said. \"They would probably be a lot less scary than hospitalizations.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Cancer cells remain elusive and tough to locate, but a new crop of nuclear-imaging tests promises to lead to more accurate prognosis and treatment.\n\nThe tests use imaging agents that combine radioactive isotopes with targeted molecules that can spot cancer at the cellular level.

I met him recently at the musicians' union hall in downtown San Francisco.\n\nBut hitting those notes night after night in a cramped orchestra pit takes a toll on the musicians.\n\n\"The fact of having your arms up and carrying the weight of this instrument and pushing the instrument toward you and so you have this stress, this wall you're pushing against,\" says Rodriguez. \"And a well designed instrument will push back.\"\n\nHe's been a working trumpet player for four decades, and all that back-arching and shoulder-pinching has left him with chronic pain in his lower back. Research suggests an alternative therapy called Alexander Technique may be an effective way to treat back pain.\n\nRodriguez first tried massage, chiropractic, and powerful pain killers. But finding a remedy for back pain can be a lot like a guessing game.\n\nHe says it was only through Alexander Technique lessons that he trained his body to move in a way that eased his aching back. Alexander Technique is a series of posture lessons, devised by a 19th century Australian actor named F.M. Alexander who had troubles with chronic laryngitis whenever he performed.\n\n\"It's a feeling of working with yourself from the inside out,\" says Rodriguez. \"If you know you're twisting a certain way and using too much force, it's easy enough to know, Let that go.\"\n\nIn particular, Joe now holds himself differently during his solos because of Alexander Technique.\n\n\"I know that I can just sort of be on my sits bones, instead of a funny arch with my stomach pushed out or my back arched in some strange way,\" says Rodriguez\n\nJosephine Gray is Rodriguez's teacher and is a certified instructor in Alexander Technique. When I visited her, I was on my hands and knees next to her trying to re-learn how to stand up.\n\n\"Let the neck be free, the head go forward and up,\" Gray tells me.\n\nOnce I make it to my feet, feeling somewhat like a newborn giraffe, there's a beautiful view of the San Francisco Bay out of the studio window.\n\nGray teaches the technique and says low back pain is a common complaint of clients.\n\n\"We look at what you are doing that causes that problem in the first place, so how you sit at the computer or how you pick up your child or what you do when you're driving,\" says Gray. \"I look at ways of changing your postural habits so you don't get into pain.\"\n\nThese aren't static postures, though. Those who promote the technique say its more about how you move, and training yourself to release tension.\n\nThese are subtle \u2013 tiny, almost imperceptible shifts. And although the teacher will put her hand on your neck or shoulder, it's more to bring awareness than to make adjustments.\n\n\"The whole point is that you understand the process so that you can arrive there yourself,\" says Gray.\n\nGray and Rodriguez, the trumpet player, both say the lessons are no cure all. But there is evidence it can ease chronic low back pain over the long run.\n\nPaul Little is a primary care researcher at the University of Southampton in Britain. He led a study of some 460 patients who were given Alexander lessons, massage, or the usual care of pain killers and exercise.\n\nAfter a year, those who had massage were no better off. Those who had six Alexander lessons showed some improvement. And those who went the distance got the best results.\n\n\"The people who had 24 lessons had gone down from about 21 days of pain that the usual care group reported to about 3 days in pain,\" says Little. \"So a really dramatic difference there is reported days in pain.\"\n\nLittle's research was published in the British Medical Journal in 2008. But now he wants to figure out why it appears to work.\n\nHe's about to start a new study that involves giving chronic back pain sufferers lessons in the Alexander Technique and exercises, and then measuring how far their spines can twist and the size and strength of their deep lumbar muscles \u2013 which Little thinks might work poorly in people with chronic low back pain.\n\nHe cautions though that it may be something else entirely that accounts for the apparent success of the Alexander Technique.

The research was an early-stage study, conducted to test the side effects and best dosage of a potential new combined therapy, and the findings were published today in the journal Cancer Discovery.\n\nPembrolizumab, which is marketed under the brand name Keytruda, works by blocking a protein called PD-1, which interferes with immune system function. Blocking PD-1 with pembrolizumab enables the immune system cells to better attack the cancer. While pembrolizumab has been a significant advancement for treating people with a variety of advanced or metastatic cancers, a majority of metastatic melanoma tumors are still resistant to the drug.\n\n\"We have found that the reason patients with metastatic melanoma do not initially respond to immunotherapy with an anti-PD-1 is that their immune system was not ready,\" said Dr. Antoni Ribas, the study's lead author, a professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and director of the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center Tumor Immunology Program. \"So we thought, 'What if we change that by injecting the therapy drug into the metastatic lesions and change the microenvironment of the cancer?'\n\n\"It's like having a pile of wood but not having a match to light it. With this new approach, SD-101 is the match that starts the fire.\"\n\nThe researchers found that SD-101 not only directs T cells to cancer cells, but it also makes the microenvironment more hospitable for the T cells, so that they can better kill the cancer cells.\n\nAll 22 people in the study had an advanced stage of inoperable or metastatic melanoma. Nine were receiving an immunotherapy treatment for the first time as part of the study. Seven of those nine had a positive response to the drug combination, including two for whom the tumors disappeared completely.\n\nThe other 13 people in the study had previously received a type of immunotherapy before the study. Of them, two had a partial response, meaning parts of the tumors shrank, but the tumors did not go away completely. Five more showed some reduction in the tumors, but the other participants did respond to the therapy.\n\nThe results of the study suggest that the combination of pembrolizumab and SD-101 could provide an alternative treatment for people with melanoma whose tumors have not responded or would be unlikely to respond to other therapies.\n\n\"For all patients with advanced cancer, immunotherapy using PD-1 inhibitors has really changed the face of cancer treatment. Unfortunately, this therapy still only works in a subset of patients,\" said Dr. Deborah Wong, assistant clinical professor of medicine at the Geffen School of Medicine and an oncologist at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, who was also an author of the paper.\n\n\"This particular combination has been especially gratifying because not only does the SD-101 therapy drug induce tumor shrinkage at the actual site where it's injected, but it's working in conjunction with pembrolizumab to shrink tumors outside of the ones we're directly injecting.\"\n\nThe study highlights the need for more research into combination therapies like this one, because many people with cancer do not respond to immunotherapy or experience a reoccurrence of their tumors after treatment.\n\n\"We are really starting to understand the science of how immunotherapies work in patients,\" said Ribas, who is also the director of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy Center at UCLA. \"By understanding that, we can find more ways to make that therapy more active. One way is by combining the therapy with another agent that can overcome the resistance that some cancers have to these therapies.\"\n\nThe study was funded by Dynavax Technologies Corp., which provided SD-101.

Each patient's pain and disability were measured along two scales, with evaluations before and after the treatment.

All of these hormones are believed to play a role in brain health, and decreasing levels of these hormones are suspected to play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn a previous study, Baker and her colleagues demonstrated that treatment with GHRH provided a short-term boost in memory and concentration for healthy adults. In the current study, they wanted to see if GHRH could help restore some function in people who were showing signs of a condition known as mild cognitive impairment. People with this condition don't yet have Alzheimer's disease, but they do have problems with memory and focus, and they're at higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, according to the Alzheimer's Foundation.\n\nIn all, 137 adults, including 61 with mild cognitive impairment, completed the current study. The study volunteers were between 55 and 87 years old, with an average age of 68, according to the study.\n\nThe study participants were randomly assigned to receive a daily self-administered injection of growth hormone-releasing hormone or a placebo injection for 20 weeks. The study medications were supplied by the manufacturer of the growth hormone-releasing hormone.\n\nStudy funding was provided by grants from the U.S. National Institute on Aging and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nTests to measure mental prowess were given at the start of the study, and at 10, 20 and 30 weeks after treatment began.\n\nBaker said the researchers saw benefits in healthy adults and those with mild cognitive impairment who received GHRH. They saw improvement in \"planning, organizing, focusing and shifting from one task to another\" -- tasks collectively known as executive function. Baker said the researchers also saw a mild improvement in verbal memory in those treated with GHRH, but the results weren't as strong as for the executive function tasks.\n\nTreatment with GHRH boosted levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) by 117 percent, according to the study. \"IGF1 is a hormone we all have from birth that increases through development until it starts to decline in our early 50s. It promotes all kinds of growth in the body and brain, but if you have excess IGF1, it may put you at risk for cancer,\" said Baker, who added that people with Alzheimer's disease tend to have low levels of IGF1.\n\nBenefits from the treatment lasted as long as people stayed on the treatment. When treatment was stopped, the benefits gradually tapered off, Baker said.\n\nInsulin levels also spiked during treatment with GHRH, but only in the group already having memory problems. Baker said it wasn't clear why this happened, but she suspects the body may be trying to compensate for an insulin shortage in the brain in people with memory problems. Insulin helps glucose (sugar) enter cells to provide fuel for those cells.\n\nDr. Joel Zonszein, an endocrinologist from Montefiore Medical Center, in New York City, praised the study but said some questions still remain.\n\n\"This was an impressive study showing how GHRH can have a positive effect on cognitive function,\" Zonszein said. \"The question is, how can we use this in normal individuals? When GHRH goes down with aging, it's a physiological adaptation. And, we don't know what would happen if we gave it chronically.\"\n\nFor instance, \"would you alter the feedback mechanism that keeps IGF1 levels from increasing cancer risk? Would it start to lose some of its effect long term?\" he said.\n\n\"There may be both good and bad effects,\" Zonszein added.\n\nThe researchers said larger and longer trials are needed to assess the hormone's therapeutic potential.\n\nLearn more about mild cognitive impairment from the Alzheimer's Foundation.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "We were puzzled by the lack of clarity of the benefits.\u00a0 While benefits were not quantified, the impact of GHRH on IGF-1 was.\u00a0 We think that the statement in the Reuters story: \u201cIt\u2019s unclear how the test differences will translate into real life,\u201d provided a clear statement on benefit", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Research at Group Health points to bupropion (Wellbutrin) as first choice for overweight and obese patients with depression\n\nSEATTLE--Group Health researchers have found that bupropion (marketed as Wellbutrin) is the only antidepressant that tends to be linked to long-term modest weight loss.\n\nPreviously, Group Health researchers showed a two-way street between depression and body weight: People with depression are more likely to be overweight, and vice versa. These researchers also found that most antidepressant medications have been linked to weight gain.\n\nPrior research on antidepressants and weight change was limited to one year or shorter. But many people take antidepressants--the most commonly prescribed medications in the United States--for longer than a year. So for up to two years the new study followed more than 5,000 Group Health patients who started taking an antidepressant. The Journal of Clinical Medicine published it: \"Long-Term Weight Change after Initiating Second-Generation Antidepressants.\"\n\n\"Our study suggests that bupropion is the best initial choice of antidepressant for the vast majority of Americans who have depression and are overweight or obese,\" said study leader David Arterburn, MD, MPH. He's a senior investigator at Group Health Research Institute (GHRI), a Group Health physician, and an affiliate associate professor in the University of Washington (UW) School of Medicine's Department of Medicine. But in some cases, an overweight or obese patient has reasons why bupropion is not for them--like a history of seizure disorder--and it would be better for them to choose a different treatment option.\n\n\"We found that bupropion is the only antidepressant that tends to be linked to weight loss over two years,\" Dr. Arterburn said. \"All other antidepressants are linked to varying degrees of weight gain.\"\n\nAfter two years, nonsmokers lost an average of 2.4 pounds on bupropion--compared with gaining an average of 4.6 pounds on fluoxetine (Prozac). So those who took bupropion ended up weighing 7 pounds less than did those on fluoxetine.\n\nUnsurprisingly, that difference wasn't seen in people who smoked tobacco. Bupropion is often used to help patients stop smoking. So smokers who take bupropion are likely to be trying to quit--and coping with the weight gain that often accompanies attempts to quit smoking.\n\n\"A large body of evidence indicates no difference in how effectively the newer antidepressants improve people's moods,\" said Dr. Arterburn's coauthor Gregory Simon, MD, MPH, a Group Health psychiatrist, GHRI senior investigator, and research professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the UW School of Medicine. \"So it makes sense for doctors and patients to choose antidepressants on the basis of their side effects, costs, and patients' preferences--and, now, on whether patients are overweight or obese.\"\n\nBupropion should be considered the first-line drug of choice for people who are overweight or obese, Dr. Simon said. But patients should consult their doctor about which medication is right for them, before making any changes, including starting, switching, or stopping medication.\n\nGrant R01 MH083671 from the National Institute of Mental Health funded this research.\n\nDrs.

New research out of Oxford helps confirm this and then some: The researchers\u2019 meta-analysis on how commercially available antidepressants compare with a placebo showed that just one of the 14 antidepressants examined was significantly better than a placebo in treating depression in children and adolescents.\n\nThe only drug to pass the test was fluoxetine, sold in the U.S. under the trade name Prozac. It outperformed all other antidepressants in both efficacy and tolerability, a term that researchers use to mean how often patients had to quit the drug due to negative side effects.\n\nProzac is also the only antidepressant approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat depression in people under 18. That\u2019s because the FDA has deemed that Prozac has demonstrated benefits that outweigh one of the suspected downsides of antidepressants in kids and teens: disrupting brain development. Dr. Andrea Cipriani, psychiatrist and lead author on the study, says these are concerns that practicing psychiatrists confront daily. \u201cFrom a clinical point of view, we tend to be very cautious when prescribing medication to children and adolescents because of the unknown effects on the developing brain,\u201d he said.\n\nThere\u2019s good reason for this. Researchers have long worried about the effects of psychoactive drugs on people whose brains are still developing. Back in 2004, researchers at Harvard Medical School released a study that sought to answer questions about the safety of certain drugs and chemicals, including antidepressants, in adolescents. The study, which used rats in lieu of human children, found evidence that reward pathways are severely altered following exposure to drugs that affect the brain. Research on how antidepressants actually affect human children\u2019s brain development is extremely hard to come by, given the limited numbers of actual children on antidepressants and the complications of gaining consent to study them. But other research on antidepressants suggest they negatively affect brain plasticity and memory\u2014something that would be problematic while the brain is still developing.\n\nAnd there\u2019s another major problem with the use of many antidepressants in children: They may increase suicidal thoughts and behavior. Since 2004, the FDA has advised that antidepressants not be prescribed to individuals under 24 due to the increased risk in suicidality, especially during the early phases of treatment. Dr. Mina Fazel, child psychiatrist at the Oxford University Children\u2019s Hospital, says, \u201cIt\u2019s complicated, because you\u2019re giving antidepressants when you\u2019re very worried about that young person\u2019s mood.\u201d Essentially, the moment when it seems most necessary to prescribe the drugs may also be the moment when the patient is most at risk of suicide. Untangling this cause and effect has thus far eluded researchers, though there is some evidence to suggest that antidepressants spark a chemical reaction in the brain that does in fact increase the risk of suicide. So far, the FDA is erring on the side of caution.\n\nA comment attached to the Oxford paper, written by Dr. Jon Jureidini, a child psychiatrist at the Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital in Adelaide, Australia, goes even further in decrying the use of antidepressants in kids. \u201cOnly if the discounted benefit outweighs the boosted harm should the treatment be prescribed,\u201d he writes. \u201cFor antidepressants in adolescents, this equation will rarely favor prescribing; in younger children, almost never.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, Jureidini believes there is almost never a justification for prescribing antidepressants to children or adolescents. I called him to be sure. \u201cThey\u2019re not better than nothing,\u201d he said, \u201cand there\u2019s quite clear evidence that they\u2019re more dangerous than nothing.\u201d He arrived at this conclusion after applying the customary dose of skepticism doctors are taught to apply when translating research findings to clinical practice.\n\nHis wariness of antidepressants being prescribed for kids, Prozac included, is further bolstered by the theory that these drugs don\u2019t work well in children because they weren\u2019t designed for children. They were designed for adults, and adults have very different physiological states than adolescents.\n\nThe Oxford paper notes that 3 percent of children ages 6-12 and nearly 6 percent of teenagers ages 13-18 suffered from major depressive disorder, the psychiatric term for what is colloquially known as depression. Given the U.S. population, that works out to more than a million children and adolescents. The disease manifests differently in kids: Whereas adults might report feeling apathetic, unmotivated, unfocused, and just plain sad, children with this disorder tend to be irritable and aggressive and as a result have trouble navigating social situations with adults and peers. That means that one of the first battles in treating depression in kids is recognizing it in the first place. Of course, having an effective intervention once it is recognized would help.\n\nIf there\u2019s an upside to be found in how ineffective antidepressants likely are for kids, it\u2019s that pharmacological solutions are not the recommended first line of defense, anyway. Guidelines from the psychiatric associations in most countries recommend that doctors first try psychotherapy, or \u201ctalk therapy,\u201d which is has been shown to work, at least by participants\u2019 own assessment of their depression levels (it\u2019s very hard to test therapy against a placebo, for obvious reasons). Methods such as cognitive behavioral therapy, in which psychiatrists help patients overcome destructive behaviors and thought patterns, and interpersonal therapy, which focuses more on the effect depression has on relationships, seem to be equally effective in treating depression, particularly in adolescents. Of course, this is a high-cost intervention in terms of both dollars and time invested, and it may not always be readily available\u2014but the upside is that there is no reason to believe it is harmful.\n\nLike in nearly all areas of science, biomedical or otherwise, our understanding is limited, and further research is required to find out more about both potential treatment options. Adolescent depression is particularly difficult, since gaining consent to study interventions in children is more complicated than it is in adults. If we are to answer these big unknowns regarding the safety of antidepressants in young patients (critical, because therapy and medication are more effective together than in isolation), we need more data.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story explains that only one of 14 antidepressants examined in the study \u2014 fluoxetine \u2014 \u201cwas significantly better than a placebo in treating depressing in children and adolescents,\u201d and that it \u201coutperformed all other antidepressants in both efficacy and tolerability.\u201d\nYet, the story did not mention a really important caveat to that: It\u2019s not known if this finding is clinically meaningful, for a number of reasons the authors list in the study.

Before researchers try a compound on humans, it\u2019s tested at labs in petri dishes and on animals, such as mice and monkeys. More often than not, these studies produce mixed data that don\u2019t tell researchers much about whether it is safe and effective for humans.\n\nFor some time, scientists have been searching for ways to cut down on the cost and failure rate of drug testing. Researchers at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University have developed a beautiful solution: Organs-On-Chips.\n\nThe clear and flexible polymer microchips are lined with human cells. Each one represents a different human organ system, such as lungs, heart and intestines. The institute\u2019s goal is to create 10 different organ systems that can be joined together by blood vessel channels to simulate human physiology on a microscale and provide a cheaper, more reliable way to test new drugs.\n\nThe sophisticated architecture of these organs-on-chips\u2014which are about the size of a thumb drive\u2014has also earned the Wyss Institute recognition in the art world with a Design of the Year award from the Design Museum and placement in the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s permanent collection.\n\n\u201cThe real power of this approach is that you have a window to the inner workings of life,\u201d says Don Ingber, founding director of the Wyss Institute and a professor of Vascular Biology and of Bioengineering at Harvard University. \u201cAnything you can ask at the molecular level, we could do in our chips.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, the team built and tested its first \u201corganoid\u201d chip to mimic the mechanical function of human lungs. It contains tiny channels separated by a porous membrane to create two distinct, hollow passageways\u2014one lined with human lung cells and the other with capillary blood vessel cells. Air is suctioned through the side channels to emulate breathing. Ingber and his team introduced bacteria into the chip\u2019s lung channel and white blood cells into the capillary channel. They observed that the white blood cells permeated the membrane and attacked the bacteria in the lung cell channel\u2014exactly what would happen in human lungs fighting off an infection.\n\nIn another experiment, the team at Wyss filled a chip\u2019s lung cell channel with interleukin 2, a chemotherapy drug known to cause pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs. When air entered the lung cell channel, the channel filled with fluid and then blood clots\u2014exactly what happens in the lungs of patients who develop this life-threatening condition. This proved the chips could provide real world information to scientists studying the effects of new drug compounds.\n\nThe project has received support from the National Institutes of Health and the FDA. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency also recently awarded the institute a $37 million grant to create chips representing nearly all systems in the body. Ingber says some scientists are interested in using the chips to conduct research that would be unethical if performed on people, such as studying the effects of gamma radiation on the human body.\n\nOf course, the chips have limitations. \u201cWe can\u2019t mimic consciousness; we can\u2019t mimic compression on a joint,\u201d says Ingber.\n\nDanilo Tagle, associate director for special initiatives at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, a division of the NIH, is spearheading a similar organ-on-chip project. He suspects that in the beginning the chips will be used to \u201ccomplement and supplement\u201d animal studies, but will eventually become routine practice. The chips will also provide researchers with information on dosing at a much earlier stage in drug studies\u2014particularly helpful because animals metabolize chemical substances at a different rate than humans. \u201cYou can go forward with a candidate drug with greater assurance and confidence that it will have the desired effect on humans,\u201d says Tagle. \u201cBiology is very complex.\u201d\n\nIncorporating the chips into drug testing could save millions of dollars and years of time on research. Some companies are already trying out the concept. Janssen Pharmaceuticals Company, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, is using a version of the chips to understand how blood clots in the lungs. The information is essential to reduce the risk for this side effect of oncology drugs.\n\nThough there still aren\u2019t enough data to prove the chips are reliable enough to put rodents out of a job, Ingber says it\u2019s only a matter of time; they hope to have them tested and ready for market in two years. \u201cThe FDA has been very supportive,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve told us if they are as good as animals that they would consider accepting data provided by a drug company from one of these models rather than an animal model.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The article cites two experiments, in which the chip\u2019s lung channel behaved like human lungs.

Nevertheless, we think the language of the story is not measured enough. Human organs work with millions of other cells and are influenced by countless other genetic and environmental factors that cannot be duplicated in these early experiments. Human systems are variable and dynamic, and doctors often don\u2019t know ahead of time how patients would respond to a disease or treatment.

Herniation occurs where the jelly-like material in the center of the disk bulges through a tear in the disk's tough exterior layer and puts pressure on the roots of the nerves. Herniated disks are often the source of sciatica, or pain that radiates downward from the lower back into the leg.\n\nConservative treatment options for herniated disks range from over-the-counter pain medications to injections of corticosteroids directly into the affected area of the spine. Those who don't respond may require surgery. In some cases, the entire disk must be removed and the vertebra fused together for stability.\n\nAn alternative technique, CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency (pRF), applies energy through an electrode under CT guidance to the portion of the nerve responsible for sending pain signals.\n\n\"Pulsed radiofrequency creates a nerve modulation, significantly reducing inflammation and its associated symptoms,\" said study senior author Alessandro Napoli, M.D., Ph.D., professor of interventional radiology at Sapienza University of Rome in Italy.\n\nDr. Napoli and colleagues studied the approach in patients with back pain from lumbar disk herniation that had not responded to prolonged conservative treatment. In 128 patients, the pRF treatment was delivered directly under CT guidance to the root of the nerve. The treatment was applied for 10 minutes.\n\nFor comparison, a group of 120 patients received one to three sessions of CT-guided steroid injection on the same anatomical target with no pRF.\n\nThe one-year outcomes demonstrated that CT-guided pRF was superior to the injection-only strategy. Patients who received pRF saw greater overall improvement in pain and disability scores during the first year. Relief of leg pain was faster in patients assigned to pRF, and they also reported a faster rate of perceived recovery. The probability of perceived recovery after one year of follow-up was 95 percent in the pRF group, compared with 61 percent in the injection only group.\n\n\"Given our study results, we offer pulsed radiofrequency to patients with herniated disk and sciatic nerve compression whose symptoms do not benefit from conservative therapy,\" Dr. Napoli said.\n\nThe results of the study are superior to those typically reported for usual care strategies and injections and may help a substantial number of patients with sciatic disk compression to avoid surgery, Dr. Napoli added.\n\nThe use of pRF also could improve outcomes for patients set to receive corticosteroid injections.\n\n\"We learned that when pulsed radiofrequency is followed by steroid injection, the result is longer lasting and more efficacious than injection only,\" Dr. Napoli said. \"The effect of pulsed radiofrequency is fast and without adverse events.\"\n\nToday, therapy for spine disorders allows for definitive treatment of symptoms and conditions using different techniques and technologies.\n\n\"Of the different therapies available, pulsed radiofrequency is among the least invasive,\" Dr. Napoli said. \"Treatment lasts 10 minutes, and one session was enough in a large number of treated patients.\"\n\nNote: Copies of RSNA 2018 news releases and electronic images will be available online at RSNA.org/press18 beginning Monday, Nov. 26.\n\nRSNA is an association of over 54,000 radiologists, radiation oncologists, medical physicists and related scientists, promoting excellence in patient care and health care delivery through education, research and technologic innovation.

Sadler from Warwick's Department of Chemistry, researchers have developed a new line of attack against cancer: an organic-osmium compound, which is triggered using a non-toxic dose of sodium formate, a natural product found in many organisms, including nettles and ants.\n\nNamed JPC11, it targets a metabolic process which cancer cells rely on to survive and multiply. It does this by converting a key substance used by cancer cells to provide the energy they need for rapid division (pyruvate) into an unnatural lactate - leading to the cells' destruction.\n\nUniquely, this chemo-catalyst treatment can be recycled and reused within a cancer cell to attack it repeatedly.\n\nThis unprecedented functional ability to recycle and reuse the compound within cancer cells could lead to future anticancer drugs being administered in smaller, more effective, and potentially less toxic doses - decreasing the side-effects of chemotherapy.\n\nThe researchers have been focusing on the potential to use this compound on ovarian and prostate cancers.\n\nOvarian cancers are becoming increasingly resistant to existing chemotherapy drugs (such as the platinum drug, cisplatin). Since this new research functions in a totally new and unique way, it may overcome this acquired resistance and widen the spectrum of anticancer activity.\n\nImportantly, the development opens up a possibility for a more selective cancer treatment as JPC11 was observed to specifically target the biochemistry of cancer cells, leaving healthy cells largely untouched - another improvement compared to existing platinum-based drugs, which can also attack non-cancerous cells.\n\n\"This is a significant step in the fight against cancer. Manipulating and applying well-established chemistry in a biological context provides a highly selective strategy for killing cancer cells.\n\n\"We have discovered that chemo-catalyst JPC11 has a unique mechanism of action - and we hope that this will lead to more effective, selective and safer treatments in the future.\"\n\nProfessor Peter Sadler, a medicinal chemist at the University of Warwick commented:\n\n\"Platinum compounds are the most widely used drugs for cancer chemotherapy, but we urgently need to respond to the challenges of circumventing resistance and side-effects. Our lab is focussed on the discovery of truly novel anticancer drugs which can kill cells in totally new ways. Chemo-catalysts, especially those with immunogenic properties, might provide a breakthrough.\n\n\"It will take time to progress from the lab to the clinic, but we are fortunate to have a talented enthusiastic, international team working with colleagues in Warwick Cancer Research Centre across the borderlines of chemistry, cell and systems biology and cancer medicine who are determined to succeed.\"\n\nProfessor Martin Wills, catalyst specialist at the University of Warwick, commented:\n\n\"Although asymmetric catalytic hydrogenation processes are well developed in the materials industry, this research provides the first ever example of it being achieved inside cells using a synthetic catalyst.\"\n\nHandedness (molecular asymmetry) is critical to the function of bio-molecules in the body. Proteins, enzymes and our DNA, for example - are handed. Only the correct hand works, in the same way that a right hand does not fit a left-hand glove.\n\nIn this case, the osmium compound JPC11, with sodium formate, can selectively produce a molecule of a specific 'handedness' - thus manipulating how cancer cells grow.\n\n\"The 'handedness' of molecules is critical in the body. Our hands are near-identical, but are mirror images of each other. The same can be true of molecules, and in some cases, having the wrong handed molecule can have profound biological consequences.\n\n\"We believe that manipulation of the 'handedness' of molecules in cells could provide a new strategy for fighting diseases.\"\n\nThe research, 'Asymmetric transfer hydrogenation by synthetic catalysts in cancer cells', is published in Nature Chemistry.

Without intervention, 80 to 90 percent of infants who are born to mothers infected with hepatitis B develop a chronic infection. The current standard of care is to provide vaccine and immune globulin to reduce transmission rates.\n\n\u201cPreventing mother-to-child transmission is the most effective way to reduce the global burden of chronic hepatitis B infection and liver cancer,\u201d says Calvin Pan, MD, lead author of the study and a clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone. \u201cWe believe that these findings will not only save many lives, but could also help to eradicate hepatitis B nationally and abroad.\u201d\n\nThe study was conducted in five locations in China, where HBV infection is endemic. Pan and colleagues enrolled 200 pregnant women with a high \u201cviral load,\u201d defined as one million copies of the virus per milliliter in a blood sample. Participants were randomly assigned to either a control group that received no antiviral therapy, or to a second group that received a daily dose of 300 milligrams of tenofovir in pill form, beginning at 30 or 32 weeks of pregnancy and continuing until 4 weeks after delivery.\n\nTreatment effectively reduced the viral load of the pregnant women, says Pan. Before delivery, 68 percent of tenofovir-treated mothers had HBV loads below 1 million copies per milliliter, compared to 2 percent of nontreated mothers.\n\nIn terms of safety, researchers found that tenofovir was well tolerated; only one participant treated with tenofovir voluntarily withdrew from the study due to nausea. Among the children born during the study, Pan and his colleagues found no significant differences between the tenofovir-treated group and the control group with regard to fetal development and infant growth.\n\n\u201cThis study provides strong evidence on how best to care for women infected with hepatitis B during pregnancy and reduce the rate of disease transmission,\u201d says Mark Pochapin, MD, the Sholtz/Leeds Professor of Gastroenterology and director of the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at NYU Langone.\n\nBased on the findings, the investigators recommend that women be tested for HBV viral load at week 28 of pregnancy. Those with a high viral load should receive tenofovir treatment starting at gestational week 30 until delivery to reduce the risk of transmission to their infants. In addition, infants should receive hepatitis B vaccine and immune globulin.

Researchers are creating a skin patch that can test those droplets while people exercise and beam results to their smartphones, possibly a new way to track health and fitness.\n\nThe experimental gadget goes well beyond activity monitors like the Fitbit. A little larger than a quarter, it\u2019s almost like a tiny lab stuck to the skin \u2014 and a study published Wednesday found it worked on sweaty bicyclists, sticking even during a long-distance race in Arizona.\n\nIf you think of perspiration as just a drippy nuisance, think again.\n\n\u201cSweat has biochemical components within it that tell us a lot about physiological health,\u201d said John A.

But eventually with additional research, Rogers envisions more sophisticated use of such devices, such as real-time monitoring of how the body adjusts during military training, or even to screen people for diseases such as diabetes or cystic fibrosis.\n\nRogers, who did much of the research while at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, has long worked to develop electronic devices that can stretch and twist with the body. The skin-like sweat patch adds a capability called microfluidics, capturing and analyzing tiny amounts of body fluid.\n\nHow it works: Stick the patch on the skin and start moving. Tiny channels collect perspiration and route it to different compartments where it interacts with chemicals that change color to reflect sweat loss, the perspiration\u2019s acidity level, and concentrations of chloride, glucose and lactate.\n\nTogether, those measurements can indicate such things as hydration levels or electrolyte loss. Hold a smartphone over the patch, and an app takes a picture of the colors and interprets what they mean.\n\nIn two studies reported Wednesday, Rogers\u2019 team stuck patches to the arms and backs of 21 healthy volunteers. Nine rode exercise bikes in a gym to compare the sweat patches\u2019 performance with the decidedly lower-tech method of sweat-testing used today \u2014 taping on absorbent pads and carting the resulting wet samples to a laboratory.

The prostate is a walnut-shaped gland that produces semen and it is hard to get to.\n\nDigital rectal exams can tell a specialist that the prostate is getting bigger, but that happens with normal aging as well as with cancer. A blood test for prostate specific antigen or PSA shows when PSA rises, but PSA goes up with either cancer or just normal enlargement of the prostate \u2014 or even if the gland is inflamed, such as from an infection.\n\nBiopsies are difficult and painful to do and may take a portion of healthy prostate, missing any tumors entirely.\n\nAnd prostate tumors can grow slowly. A study last year estimated that more than 1 million men in the United States alone had been needlessly treated for prostate tumors that likely would never have killed them.\n\nThe Progensa test looks for a genetic material called PCA3.

It would have been helpful to point out that a 6% infection rate is lower than historical controls, but that the effectiveness needs to be studied in a controlled clinical trial to really see the benefit.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Heart researchers have long known that plaques in coronary arteries start out as pimplelike bumps but get waxy and hard and filled with calcium as time passes. Calcium shows up as white flecks in CT scans. The hard plaques are not the dangerous ones \u2014 it is the softer ones that rupture and cause a heart attack. But the amount of calcium in arteries can give a good idea of the presence or extent of coronary artery disease.\n\nDr. Krumholz and Dr. Khurram Nasir, a preventive cardiologist at Baptist Health South Florida, who conceived the new study, reasoned that research on heart scans had not been designed to help doctors make treatment decisions they face today.\n\nCurrent guidelines have vastly increased the number of people who are eligible to take statins. Many people, though, are reluctant to take them. So, the investigators asked, could a scan identify those whose actual risk is lower than what was calculated?\n\nThe study subjects were nearly 4,000 men and women ages 45 to 84 and included blacks, whites, Hispanics and Asians who were recruited in 2000 through 2002. According to today\u2019s guidelines, half had risk scores high enough that a statin would be recommended or should be considered. But guidelines then were more conservative, and in accordance with them, the subjects did not take the drugs. All had heart scans, and half had no calcium visible on the scans. The subjects were followed for 10 years.\n\nIt turned out that the actual incidence of heart attacks or disabling chest pain in those with zero calcium was half or less than what the risk calculator predicted.\n\nFor example, a person who, according to the current risk calculator, has a 12 percent risk of a heart attack in the next decade should take a statin, the guidelines say. But if that person has a calcium score of zero, the actual risk turned out to be 4 percent, below the 7.5 percent threshold for recommending a statin according to the guidelines and below the 5 percent risk for considering a statin.\n\nDr. Nasir said he has been using the study\u2019s findings in his clinic. First, he asks patients for whom statins are recommended according to the current guidelines if they would want to avoid taking the drugs if they turn out to have a calcium score of zero and an actual risk of less than 5 percent. Most tell him that they would. He then sends them for a scan.", "question": "Does the story adequately quantify the benefits of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story reports that among study participants, those with a zero calcium score on a heart CT scan had only half the expected number of heart attacks or disabling chest pain over a 10-year period. That\u2019s a relative comparison, which as we frequently note does not provide the full picture regarding benefit. But the story goes on to give readers a better sense of what these numbers mean in absolute terms. It\u00a0explains the example of a person with a 12 percent risk of a heart attack over a decade based on the risk calculator recommended by the American college of Cardiology and others. That person actually turned out to have only a 4 percent 10-year risk, below the widely-used 7.5 percent risk threshold for recommending a statin.\nThe story makes clear that the scan does not provide a direct health benefit, but it provides information to people who are trying to decide about whether to start taking cholesterol-reducing statins. To help with that decision, it would have been nice for the story to include some discussion of the benefits associated with statin use, especially the\u00a0numbers needed to treat (NNT) with a statin in order to save a life.\nThe story includes only one patient anecdote, a woman who was feeling depressed and had trouble getting out of bed when she took statins, and then decided to stop taking the drugs after having a CT scan that showed zero calcium. We often find fault with stories that introduce readers to only one patient, who claims to have greatly benefited; however, the placement of the anecdote low in the story and the preceding context that included limitations and expert cautions mean this single patient story doesn\u2019t overwhelm the other information.\nLink to online Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) Risk Estimator: http://tools.acc.org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator/", "answer": 1}, {"article": "HOUSTON, Feb. 23, 2017 - stroke patients receiving clot-busting medications before arriving at the hospital have a lower risk for disability afterward, according to research presented at the American Stroke Association's International Stroke Conference 2017.\n\nResearchers analyzed results from 658 stroke patients who were treated with tPA - a drug that dissolves blood clots. About half of the participants received the clot-busting drug at the hospital, and half received it while still in the ambulance.\n\nThis preliminary study showed that three months after stroke, 182 out of every 1,000 patients treated before arriving at hospital were less disabled, including 58 patients who had zero disability, compared to people who received treatment after reaching the hospital.\n\n\"Time is brain in acute stroke after vascular collaterals fail, and faster treatment yields better outcomes,\" said May Nour, M.D., Ph.D., lead researcher, interventional neurologist and director of UCLA's Mobile Stroke Rescue Program. \"Our study shows pre-hospital clot-busting is a promising, evolving approach to providing tPA stroke therapy. Its better outcomes could offset the increased costs of a mobile stroke unit.\"\n\nPast research showed the sooner that a clot-busting tPA drug is given after an ischemic stroke - one in which a clot is blocking blood flow - the better patients fare. But tPA is not indicated and could hurt a patient's chances if they are having a hemorrhagic stroke, in which a blood vessel ruptures. That is why patients need a CT scan to confirm the type of stroke before receiving tPA.\n\nEvery second counts, in the current standard of care, patients who experience stroke-like symptoms and call 9-1-1 arriving to the hospital by ambulance are assessed by clinical examination and imaging (CT or MRI scan) in the Emergency Department. This takes a certain amount of time from the patient's symptom onset which prompted the 9-1-1 call.\n\nIn a mobile stroke unit, a specialized ambulance is equipped with a CT scanner, a paramedic, a critical care nurse, a CT technologist and a neurologist in person or by telemedicine. The ambulance arrives, does the CT on-site, gives the clot-busting drug if indicated and then transports the patient to the hospital.\n\nNour's team used data from Berlin's PHANTOM-S study, which took place from 2011 to 2015 and included 427 participants (median age 72) which were compared to 505 patients who received conventional care with in-hospital clot busting. Researchers analyzed information about patients' disabilities to determine how many needed to be treated in the mobile stroke unit to yield a greater benefit in disability outcomes when compared to patients who received tPA at the hospital.\n\nThe findings bordered on statistical significance, suggesting that future clinical trials with a greater number of patients are needed to show similar benefits.\n\n\"People should know the warning signs of stroke and call 9-1-1 as soon as they observe stroke signs,\" said Nour. \"Treatment then needs to happen as quickly as possible, and a mobile stroke unit may allow that to happen.\"\n\nAuthor disclosures are on the abstract.\n\nThe study was funded by the Arline and Henry Gluck Foundation.\n\u2022 Any available downloadable video/audio interviews, B-roll, animation, graphics, and images related to this news release are on the right column of the release link http://newsroom. .\n\u2022 Video clips with researchers/authors of the studies will be added to the release link as available.\n\nStatements and conclusions of study authors that are presented at American Heart Association scientific meetings are solely those of the study authors and do not necessarily reflect association policy or position.

These imaging findings can help spur beneficial lifestyle changes in patients to reduce risk for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThe concept that cognitive decline can be identified early and prevented by applying quantitative brain imaging techniques is the focus of \"Hot Topics in Research: Preventive Neuroradiology in Brain Aging and Cognitive Decline,\" a review published online in American Journal of Neuroradiology (AJNR). Author Cyrus Raji, M.D., Ph.D., of UCLA and an international team suggest a framework in which neuroradiologists work as part of a team of clinical neuroscientists (neurologists, psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, etc.) to apply quantitative neuroradiology towards prevention of cognitive decline in populations at high risk for dementia -- namely those with lifestyle, genetic, and other associated risk factors.\n\n\"I believe neuroradiology, and especially quantitative MRI technology, will have a huge impact in the future of diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease, since there is compelling evidence for the baseline size of hippocampus as a key determinant of risk for future cognitive decline, and since many lifestyle factors can cause atrophy or expansion in the volume of this critical brain structure,\" says neurologist Majid Fotuhi, M.D., Ph.D., of Johns Hopkins University.\n\nSuch work is already happening at UCLA and other institutions that meld these approaches into novel ways to improve patient care. \"We are working closely with neuroradiologists to redefine how we can reduce risk for Alzheimer's with quantitative neuroimaging that helps us pinpoint symptom-relevant volume loss in the brain and subsequent targets for tracking our lifestyle-based interventions,\" says Dr. David Merrill, a geriatric psychiatrist at UCLA Medical Center.\n\n\"Recent advances have improved the ability to characterize imaging markers along the trajectory of Alzheimers disease, starting in the pre-clinical phase. These markers, including structural, functional, and molecular imaging are being used in the AD diagnositc criteria [AA/NIA], (1)\" says Howard Aizenstein, M.D., Ph.D., a psychiatrist at University of Pittsburgh.\n\nFotuhi sees imaging findings as a unique motivator for patients to make positive lifestyle changes. \"Patients seem to enjoy reviewing results of their imaging studies, more so than reading the results of their blood tests or other clinical evaluations. For example, they can see with their own eyes whether there are any strokes or atrophy in their brain. This can have a powerful impact on them and on their determination to make changes in their lifestyle in order to improve their brain health,\" he adds.\n\nAmong the lifestyle and risk factors that can be altered to potentially prevent cognitive declines are obesity, diet, sleep, hypertension, diabetes, depression, supplementation, smoking and physical activity. It is estimated that as many as 3 million cases of Alzheimer's dementia worldwide can be prevented with as little as a 10% reduction in the burden of preventable lifestyle.
