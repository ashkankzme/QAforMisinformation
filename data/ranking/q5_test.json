[{"article": "A study published late last month in The New England Journal of Medicine is raising provocative questions about how best to treat a torn anterior cruciate ligament. For the study, researchers from Lund University in Sweden recruited 121 young adults who had injured their A.C.L.\u2019s. The volunteers, between 18 and 35, were physically active, and many were competitive athletes. They agreed, rather bravely, to be randomly assigned to one of two groups and accept radically different treatments for their torn A.C.L.\u2019s. The first group began physical therapy and then underwent surgical reconstruction of the ligament, considered by many people to be the best option for injured athletes. The second group received only physical therapy, with the option to have the operation later. Twenty-three subjects of that group did eventually have the operation. (For those fortunate enough not to be personally familiar with A.C.L. surgery, reconstruction involves replacing the injured ligament with tissue from elsewhere in your own leg or from a cadaver.)\n\nOver two years, the injured knees were assessed using a comprehensive numerical score that rated pain, function during activity and other measures. At the time of the original injury, the knee also had been scored. At the end of the two years, both groups showed considerable improvement. The scores for the surgically repaired knees had risen by 39.2 points. The scores for the more conservatively treated knees also had risen, by 39.4 points. In other words, the outcomes were virtually identical. Despite a widespread belief that surgery leads to a stronger knee, the results showed that surgically reconstructing the A.C.L. as soon as possible after the tear \u201cwas not superior\u201d to more conservative treatment, the study\u2019s authors wrote. The findings suggest, the authors concluded, that \u201cmore than half the A.C.L. reconstructions\u201d currently being conducted on injured knees \u201ccould be avoided without adversely affecting outcomes.\u201d\n\nThis possibility should reverberate across playing fields nationwide, where, at the moment, preseason high school, collegiate and adult-league sports practices are under way, with a concomitant surge in A.C.L. tears. By one estimate, as many as 1 in every 556 fit, active people will tear an A.C.L. \u2014 particularly if they participate in sports that involve frequent pivoting and landing, like soccer, football, tennis, skiing and basketball. At the same time, the urge to treat the injury with surgery appears to be growing. The \u201cbelief among most surgeons and patients is that surgery is a \u2018must,\u2019 at least if you aim to go back into an active lifestyle,\u201d the Swedish authors of the study e-mailed in response to questions.\n\nPart of the reason for A.C.L. surgery\u2019s popularity is that by most measures, it works. In the current study, most of the group members who had reconstructive surgery reported that their injured knees felt healthy after two years and that they had returned to activity \u2014 not, in most cases, at the same level as before their injuries, but they were active. Significantly, their knees also were notably more \u201cstable\u201d than the joints that hadn\u2019t been surgically fixed. Stability is, in theory, desirable. A stable knee rarely gives way.\n\nBut in practice, the importance of stability after A.C.L. treatment is \u201ccontroversial,\u201d The New England Journal study\u2019s authors, Richard Frobell, Ph.D., and Stefan Lohmander, M.D., Ph.D., of Lund University, wrote in their e-mail. In an important 2009 study published in The British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers retrospectively compared outcomes after 10 years in competitive athletes who had surgery or had opted for conservative treatment of their torn A.C.L.\u2019s. The surgically repaired knees were notably more stable. But they weren\u2019t fundamentally healthier. The surgically reconstructed knees and the conservatively treated joints experienced similar (and high) levels of early onset knee arthritis, a common occurrence after an A.C.L. tear. The treatments were almost identical, too, in terms of whether the athletes could return to sports and whether they reported subsequent knee problems.\n\nWhy, then, undergo A.C.L. reconstruction, an operation that can be expensive and, like all surgical procedures, carries risks? Several top-flight orthopedic surgeons I contacted say that they remain convinced that surgery leads to a better long-term outcome for certain patients, particularly if they want to return to pivoting sports. \u201cThe reason to have the surgery is to preserve\u201d other parts of the knee from injury during activity, says Dr. Warren Dunn, an assistant professor of orthopedics and rehabilitation at Vanderbilt University who has extensively studied A.C.L. tears. He points out that in The New England Journal of Medicine study, only 8 percent of the patients in the first surgical group subsequently tore a meniscus, a fragile pillow of cartilage that can rip if a knee gives way. Twenty-five percent of those in the physical therapy group eventually tore their meniscuses.\n\nWhat these numbers mean for anyone who tears an A.C.L. or is the parent of a young athlete in that situation is that they should have a long, frank conversation with an orthopedic surgeon and possibly also a nonsurgical sports-medicine specialist about options. \u201cWe recommend surgery based on activity level and sports,\u201d Dr. Dunn says. \u201cMost subjects can do in-line activities\u201d like running or biking \u201cwithout an A.C.L.\u201d He adds, \u201cOn the other hand, we believe that A.C.L.-deficient subjects that do return\u201d to sports involving cutting, pivoting or planting the leg \u201ccan consequently injure the meniscus\u201d or other cartilage in the knee and would benefit from a replacement A.C.L.\n\nThe authors of the study are less sure. \u201cOn the basis of our study results, we\u2019d tell patients\u201d that \u201cthere is no apparent downside of starting a good rehab program and waiting with the surgery decision to see if it is needed or not,\u201d the authors wrote to me.\n\nThe ultimate lesson of The New England Journal study is almost certainly that more science on the subject is needed. \u201cWe definitely know only parts of the long-term outcome\u201d after different A.C.L. treatments, says Dr. Duncan Meuffels, an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam and lead author of The British Journal of Sports Medicine study.\n\nBut large-scale, randomized controlled studies, the gold standard of medical research, may be difficult to orchestrate, in part because people with shredded A.C.L.\u2019s can balk at being denied surgery. In The New England Journal study, some of those assigned to physical therapy wound up requesting surgery, although they weren\u2019t experiencing any knee problems. For them, it seems, \u201cthe desire to undergo surgery was based on expectations rather than symptoms,\u201d the authors told me. It may be years, unfortunately, before we know if such expectations are justified or if unreconstructed injured knees can be fine.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The paper was published last week in The Cochrane Library, a journal devoted to systematic reviews of health care interventions.

Over time, taste and smell abnormalities (TSA) can lead to a loss of appetite and anorexic behaviors, compromising patients' ability to recuperate from the disease.\n\nIn a new paper published in the journal Food & Function, Virginia Tech College of Agriculture and Life Sciences researchers Susan Duncan and Aili Wang investigated the feasibility of lactoferrin, a highly bioactive protein found in saliva and milk, as a treatment for TSA. Their findings could bring relief to millions of patients undergoing cancer treatment.\n\n\"The underlying molecular mechanisms of TSA are not well-understood,\" said Duncan, associate director of the Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station and a professor in the Department of Food Science and Technology. \"The prevailing symptom described by patients undergoing chemotherapy is a persistent metallic flavor or aftertaste, with or without food intake. This can last for hours, weeks, or even months after the completion of treatments.\"\n\nAs a consequence, cancer patients suffer poor appetite, weight loss, depression, and diminished nutrition, all of which are detrimental to recovery. Although TSA is widespread and a frequent complaint of cancer patients, until now, there have been no established therapies that reliably prevent or treat this problem.\n\n\"Our research shows that daily lactoferrin supplementation elicits changes in the salivary protein profiles in cancer patients - changes that may be influential in helping to protect taste buds and odor perception,\" said Duncan. \"By suggesting lactoferrin as a dietary supplement, we can reduce TSA for many patients, restoring their ability to enjoy foods during a time in which nutrition can play a key role in their recovery. This research could help us develop TSA-targeted biomarkers and strategies for improving quality of life during chemotherapy. Cancer patients and their supporting family and friends may again find comfort in enjoying a meal together. \"\n\nThe transdisciplinary team, including William Ray, Department of Biochemistry; Andrea Dietrich, of the Charles E. Via Jr. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering in the College of Engineering; and Glenn Lesser, from Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, previously identified the role of lactoferrin, a specific milk protein, in diminishing the metallic flavor stimulated by chemotherapy medications. The substance is well-known as a first-line defense, aiding the body's immune response, but little is known about its ability to impact salivary proteins. Their most recent study builds on the previous body of work through the application of lactoferrin supplements in treating taste and smell abnormalities.\n\nThe team's findings will make it possible for cancer patients to taste foods properly and to enjoy a healthier appetite, enabling more optimal nutrition during a critical period of recovery. Lactoferrin supplementation also enhances the expression of salivary immune proteins, which may help reduce oxidative stress and resulting side effects.

It may be psychologically harmful for some women and play a significant role in the development of postpartum depression,\u201d said Grace Lim, M.D., director of obstetric anesthesiology at Magee Women\u2019s Hospital of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and lead investigator on the study. \u201cWe found that certain women who experience good pain relief from epidural analgesia are less likely to exhibit depressive symptoms in the postpartum period.\u201d\n\nThe researchers controlled for factors already known to increase the risk for postpartum depression, including pre-existing depression and anxiety, as well as post-delivery pain caused by tissue trauma during childbirth. After accounting for these factors, the study found that in some women, labor pain was still a significant risk factor for postpartum depression symptoms. And, therefore, alleviating this pain might help reduce the risk for postpartum depression. In the study, researchers reviewed the medical records of 201 women who used epidural analgesia and had their pain assessed using a 0-10 scale during labor. They calculated the percent improvement in pain (PIP) throughout labor after the implementation of epidural analgesia. Depression risk was assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) six weeks after childbirth. Researchers found the higher the PIP scores, the lower the EPDS scores.\n\n\u201cAlthough we found an association between women who experience less pain during labor and lower risk for postpartum depression, we do not know if effective pain control with epidural analgesia will assure avoidance of the condition,\u201d said Dr. Lim. \u201cPostpartum depression can develop from a number of things including hormonal changes, psychological adjustment to motherhood, social support, and a history of psychiatric disorders.\u201d\n\nLabor pain may be more problematic for some women than others, the authors note.

The combination did lower cholesterol levels in the 12-week trial and, most importantly, did not cause the feared side effects on the heart and other organs that have plagued similar thyroid-based treatments.\n\n\"There was no doubt that eprotirome would lower LDL cholesterol. Thyroid hormone is nature's own statin,\" said Dr. Paul W. Ladenson, a professor of endocrinology and metabolism at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and lead author of a report on the trial, published in the March 11 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. \"But this is a demonstration of lipid-lowering effect without thyroid toxicity.\"\n\nDr. Bo Angelin, a professor of clinical metabolic research at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, where the drug was developed, said that the trial demonstrated that careful targeting of the drug's effect within the body could obtain the benefits of thyroid hormone on blood cholesterol levels, without causing damaging side effects. The trial was funded in part by Karo Bio, a small commercial spinoff of the institute.\n\n\"We knew that thyroid hormone could lower lipid [cholesterol] levels but would have side effects on the circulation and bones and cause diarrhea,\" Angelin said. \"Even if the lipid levels were OK, it would be overall negative for patients.\"\n\nHowever, he added, \"if we can get the thyroid effect in the liver [where cholesterol is metabolized] but not in other organs, we would be OK.\"\n\nFrequent monitoring showed no ill effects on the hearts and bones of those taking the drug, the report said.\n\nAnd though statins are widely used and most often successful, an alternative to them would be welcome, Ladenson said. Statins are not effective in up to a quarter of potential users because of unacceptable muscle pain or simple failure to lower cholesterol levels, he said.\n\n\"The first importance of the trial is that it shows hepatic [liver] targeting of hormonal action,\" Ladenson said. \"The second exciting part is its impact on lipids other than LDL cholesterol.\"\n\nThough statins lower LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol, they have no effect on other blood fats, such as lipoprotein A, which is believed to be equally damaging, Ladenson said. He said that significant reductions of blood levels of those fats were seen in the trial.\n\nLarger and longer studies are needed to determine whether eprotirome will have the hoped-for effect on blood fat levels without side effects and will ultimately reduce the risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular diseases, both Ladenson and Angelin said, adding that such trials now are in the planning stages.\n\nAt best, results would not be available for \"at least two to three years,\" Angelin said.\n\nIf eprotirome does pass all the anticipated tests successfully, its use at first probably would be in combination with a statin, Angelin said. Use as a single drug treatment for elevated cholesterol levels could follow, first in selected patients, then more widely, he said.\n\nIt's best to move cautiously, agreed Dr. Robert M. Califf, vice chancellor for clinical research at Duke University.\n\n\"The effects on LDL cholesterol and lipoproteins are pretty exciting,\" Califf said. \"But if there is one thing we've learned about drugs in this arena, it's that we need large trials to see how they measure up in terms of risk and benefit.\"\n\nThe trial's researchers were careful to list indications of possible harmful side effects, such as a reduction in levels of HDL (\"good\") cholesterol, Califf said.

Patients were ages 55-74 who had smoked for the equivalent of 30 years (one pack a day for 30 years, two packs a day for 15 years, etc.).\n\nThe researchers identified study participants in the CT-scan group whose initial screening was negative. They then compared those patients to other CT-scan recipients whose screenings detected an abnormality to assess any differences in lung cancer incidence and lung cancer-specific deaths.\n\nOf the initial 19,066 participants with a negative initial LDCT scan, 444 (2 percent) were diagnosed with lung cancer at the time of the last available follow-up. In the first year after a negative screen and before the scheduled first annual screen, 17 patients (0.09 percent of all initial negative LDCT participants) were diagnosed with lung cancer.\n\nAn additional 75 patients (0.4 percent of the initial negative group) were diagnosed with lung cancer between the first and second annual screening. The incidence of lung cancer at the first screen among those who were initially negative was 0.34 percent, compared to 1 percent of patients who were diagnosed during the baseline screening.\n\nThe researchers determined that eliminating the first annual screening after the initial negative test might have resulted in, at most, an additional 28 lung cancer deaths in the LDCT group (186 vs. 212 deaths per 100,000 per years) over the course of the study.\n\n\"Our analysis suggests that annual screens may not be warranted for patients who have had an initial negative scan, and future risk prediction and cost-effectiveness models could incorporate these data to improve screening guidelines,\" Patz said.\n\nHe added that improving the accuracy of LDCT screening for lung cancer would also significantly reduce the number of annual screens.

McEvoy, MD, MCR, and her co-authors report that at three months of age, the infants whose mothers took 500 mg of vitamin C in addition to their prenatal vitamin had significantly better forced expiratory flows (FEFs). FEFs measure how fast air can be exhaled from the lung and are an important measure of lung function because they can detect airway obstruction.\n\nThe researchers also discovered an association between the infant FEFs and a genetic variant some of the mothers possessed that appeared to amplify the negative impact of nicotine on the babies before they were born. Other studies have linked this genetic factor, specifically for the \u03b15 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, to increased risk of lung cancer and obstructive lung disease.\n\n\u201cSmoking during pregnancy reflects the highly addictive nature of nicotine that disproportionately affects the most vulnerable populations,\u201d said Dr. McEvoy, lead study author and professor of pediatrics at Oregon Health & Science University. \u201cFinding a way to help infants exposed to smoking and nicotine in utero recognizes the unique dangers posed by a highly advertised, addictive product and the lifetime effects on offspring who did not choose to be exposed.\u201d\n\nIn a previous study, the authors had shown that 72 hours after birth, babies of mothers who smoked had better lung function if their mothers were randomized to vitamin C (500 mg/day) during their pregnancies compared to those born to mothers who smoked and were randomized to placebo. That study used passive methods to measure lung function, and the authors note that FEFs provide a more direct assessment of airway function and are similar to methods used to diagnose lung disease in adults and older children.\n\nIn the current study, 251 pregnant women who smoked were randomly assigned at 13 to 23 weeks of gestation to either receive vitamin C (125 women) or a placebo (126 women). Smoking was defined as having had one or more cigarettes in the last week. All participants received smoking cessation counseling throughout the study, and about 10 percent of the women quit smoking during the study.\n\nThe researchers wrote that study results support the hypothesis that oxidative stress caused by cigarette smoking reduces the amount of ascorbic acid, a component of vitamin C, available to the body. At the time they enrolled in the study, the women had lower levels of ascorbic acid than have been reported among women who do not smoke. Those levels rose in study participants who received vitamin C to become comparable to women who do not smoke.\n\nInfants in this study will continue to be followed to track their lung function and respiratory outcomes. The authors believe that future trials of vitamin C supplementation in pregnant smokers should determine whether the benefits are greater if the supplementation starts earlier and continues postnatally in the babies themselves.\n\nSumming up the findings of the current study, Dr. McEvoy said that a relatively low dosage of vitamin C may present \u201ca safe and inexpensive intervention that has the potential to help lung health of millions of infants worldwide.\u201d\n\nHowever, she added, helping mothers quit smoking should remain the primary goal for health professionals and public health officials. \u201cAlthough vitamin C supplementation may protect to some extent the lungs of babies born to mothers who smoke during pregnancy, those children will still be at greater risk for obesity, behavioral disorders and other serious health issues,\u201d she said.\n\nThis study was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the Office of Dietary Supplements.\n\n\u201cFor mothers who smoke during pregnancy, vitamin C may reduce harm #smoking causes to their babies\u2019 #lungs, finds new study of #vitaminC supplementation. #Nosmokingduringpregnancy.\u201d\n\nAbout the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine\n\nThe AJRCCM is a peer-reviewed journal published by the American Thoracic Society.

In addition to exceptional cosmetic results, the technique is likely to improve clinical outcomes as evidenced by ongoing research that shows women who undergo this procedure experience less pain and a shorter recovery period.\n\n\u201cOver the past decade there have been dramatic improvements in breast reconstruction that utilize various types of surgical innovations, implants, and biologic tissue,\u201d notes Dr. Small. \u201cIt is very rewarding as a reconstructive surgeon to continuously refine these procedures for our patients.\u201d\n\nMs. Burt chose the Valley breast surgery team after carefully researching her treatment options for DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ), a diagnosis that is often debated among clinicians as to whether it should be classified as breast cancer at all. In DCIS, abnormal cells have not spread beyond the milk ducts into adjacent breast tissue or lymph nodes. After consulting with several breast surgeons and reconstructive surgeons, Ms. Burt opted for a nipple-sparing mastectomy performed by breast surgeon Tihesha Wilson, M.D., Assistant Medical Director of Valley\u2019s Breast Center. Immediately following in the operating room, Dr. Small performed the breast reconstruction. \u201cThis was a long journey,\u201d says Ms. Burt, a publicist for the San Francisco-based Fat Wreck Chords music company. \u201cDr. Wilson was more than patient with me as I first chose active surveillance for one year and then decided to undergo a double mastectomy when another area of DCIS was identified in November 2015. I am also grateful for Dr. Small\u2019s willingness to \u2018look outside the box\u2019 and for his determination to perform my reconstruction in a way that would give me the best results with the least amount of recovery time. I want to also commend the pathologists at Valley, who were exceptional in their diagnostic results.\u201d Dr. Wilson and Laura Klein, M.D., Medical Director of the Breast Center, have extensive experience in performing nipple-sparing mastectomy, a technically demanding surgery that is performed within aesthetically appealing minimally invasive incisions. With expertise in minimally invasive oncoplastic breast surgery, Dr. Wilson has also studied complementary medicine and provides her patients with a holistic, integrative approach to breast care. \u201cIt\u2019s important to listen to each woman\u2019s needs and then to decide together what is the best approach to treatment, so that in the end the cancer will be gone and the woman can move on with her life,\u201d says Dr. Wilson.\n\nThe Valley Breast Center provides comprehensive diagnostic, surgical, and support services using a multidisciplinary approach. The Breast Center is designated by the National Accreditation Program of Breast Centers, a program of the American Cancer Society.

The number of women taking them early in pregnancy is unknown but probably is small, the study suggests.\n\nACE inhibitors are the second-most commonly prescribed class of pharmaceuticals in the United States, with 149 million prescriptions dispensed last year. They came on the market 25 years ago.\n\n\"It would be important for a pregnant woman and her health-care provider to be aware of this, so they can identify an alternative medicine to treat her hypertension,\" said William O. Cooper, a pediatrician at Vanderbilt Children's Hospital who headed the study, published in today's New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nExposure to ACE inhibitors early in pregnancy nearly tripled the risk of birth defects, the study showed. \"We all believe that we want to see more data. But this is important enough and impressive enough to tell people about,\" said Robert Temple of the Food and Drug Administration, who spoke to reporters about the findings.\n\nThe agency will consider broadening the \"black box\" warning against taking ACE inhibitors late in pregnancy, he said. The message is that women trying to get pregnant should switch to a different blood-pressure drug, Temple said.\n\nOne-third of the defects involved the heart, one-quarter the limbs or face, and one-tenth the brain or spinal cord, the study found. Many defects, especially the heart problems, are curable with surgery or other treatment. Others, however, cause permanent disability or retardation.\n\nCooper and his colleagues looked at 29,507 births to women covered by Medicaid in Tennessee between 1985 and 2000.\n\nOf that group, 209 babies were born to women who took an ACE inhibitor, and 18 had birth defects. Among 202 babies born to mothers taking some other blood-pressure medication, four had defects. The fraction of babies with defects was 7.1 percent in the ACE-inhibitor group; 1.7 percent in the other anti-hypertensive group; and 2.6 percent in the group taking no blood-pressure medication.\n\nThat such an effect was first noticed a quarter-century after ACE inhibitors arrived on the market points up the lack of data about the effect of drugs in pregnancy.\n\nAll new drugs are tested on pregnant animals to see whether they cause malformations, but those tests can be misleading. It's considered unethical to include pregnant women in studies of new drugs unless the medication is intended to treat pregnancy-related conditions.\n\nAs a consequence, the labels on nearly all medications carry a statement saying their safety to fetuses has not been established.\n\n\"I think it is safe to say that not a lot is known about the options for women in pregnancy,\" said Sandra L. Kweder of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.\n\nStudies of large databases such as Medicare records or registries that enroll pregnant women already taking particular drugs are the chief ways to discover and measure possible risks to the fetus from prescription drugs.\n\nIncreasingly, the FDA is seeking such data. It paid for the ACE-inhibitor study with help from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The alternatives that clinicians might want to consider are diuretics, alpha-methyldopa, some beta-blockers, and the calcium-channel blocker nifedipine, according to the FDA officials and an editorial accompanying the study.\n\nBlood pressure often falls slightly in pregnancy, and women with mild hypertension may be able to go without medicines, experts say. Some pregnant women develop hypertension that can be life-threatening to them and their babies.\n\nACE inhibitors -- the acronym stands for angiotensin-converting enzyme -- have become more popular.

All of these hormones are believed to play a role in brain health, and decreasing levels of these hormones are suspected to play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn a previous study, Baker and her colleagues demonstrated that treatment with GHRH provided a short-term boost in memory and concentration for healthy adults. In the current study, they wanted to see if GHRH could help restore some function in people who were showing signs of a condition known as mild cognitive impairment. People with this condition don't yet have Alzheimer's disease, but they do have problems with memory and focus, and they're at higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, according to the Alzheimer's Foundation.\n\nIn all, 137 adults, including 61 with mild cognitive impairment, completed the current study. The study volunteers were between 55 and 87 years old, with an average age of 68, according to the study.\n\nThe study participants were randomly assigned to receive a daily self-administered injection of growth hormone-releasing hormone or a placebo injection for 20 weeks. The study medications were supplied by the manufacturer of the growth hormone-releasing hormone.\n\nStudy funding was provided by grants from the U.S. National Institute on Aging and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nTests to measure mental prowess were given at the start of the study, and at 10, 20 and 30 weeks after treatment began.\n\nBaker said the researchers saw benefits in healthy adults and those with mild cognitive impairment who received GHRH. They saw improvement in \"planning, organizing, focusing and shifting from one task to another\" -- tasks collectively known as executive function. Baker said the researchers also saw a mild improvement in verbal memory in those treated with GHRH, but the results weren't as strong as for the executive function tasks.\n\nTreatment with GHRH boosted levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) by 117 percent, according to the study. \"IGF1 is a hormone we all have from birth that increases through development until it starts to decline in our early 50s. It promotes all kinds of growth in the body and brain, but if you have excess IGF1, it may put you at risk for cancer,\" said Baker, who added that people with Alzheimer's disease tend to have low levels of IGF1.\n\nBenefits from the treatment lasted as long as people stayed on the treatment. When treatment was stopped, the benefits gradually tapered off, Baker said.\n\nInsulin levels also spiked during treatment with GHRH, but only in the group already having memory problems. Baker said it wasn't clear why this happened, but she suspects the body may be trying to compensate for an insulin shortage in the brain in people with memory problems. Insulin helps glucose (sugar) enter cells to provide fuel for those cells.\n\nDr. Joel Zonszein, an endocrinologist from Montefiore Medical Center, in New York City, praised the study but said some questions still remain.\n\n\"This was an impressive study showing how GHRH can have a positive effect on cognitive function,\" Zonszein said. \"The question is, how can we use this in normal individuals? When GHRH goes down with aging, it's a physiological adaptation. And, we don't know what would happen if we gave it chronically.\"\n\nFor instance, \"would you alter the feedback mechanism that keeps IGF1 levels from increasing cancer risk? Would it start to lose some of its effect long term?\" he said.\n\n\"There may be both good and bad effects,\" Zonszein added.\n\nThe researchers said larger and longer trials are needed to assess the hormone's therapeutic potential.\n\nLearn more about mild cognitive impairment from the Alzheimer's Foundation.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering at play here.\nBut, we were a bit troubled by the suggestion that people with mild cognitive impairment, \u201c\u2026don\u2019t yet have Alzheimer\u2019s disease\u2026\u201d\u00a0 While MCI is a precursor, not all people with it go on to develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\u00a0", "answer": 1}, {"article": "TUESDAY, Dec. 6 (HealthDay News)-- Women who get routine mammograms can lower their risk of dying from breast cancer by nearly half, a new Dutch study suggests.\n\n\"Our study adds further to the evidence that mammography screening unambiguously reduces breast cancer mortality,\" said Dr. Suzie Otto, a senior researcher in the department of public health at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.\n\nThe routine screening also lowered the chances of being diagnosed with an advanced cancer, she said.\n\nThe study appears online Dec. 6 in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention.\n\nMammography screening, including the best schedule and the best age to begin, is being hotly debated in the United States and elsewhere. Some experts think women should start getting them at age 40. Other think women should discuss the pros and cons of the test at 40, decide on an individual basis and start screens routinely at 50. Otto's study only looked at women aged 49 and older.\n\nOtto tracked 755 patients who died from breast cancer from 1995 to 2003 and another 3,739 control patients matched by age and other measures.\n\nAmong the women with breast cancer, nearly 30 percent of tumors were found at screening and about 34 percent between screens. Nearly 36 percent of these women had never had a mammogram.\n\nAdvanced tumors were found in about 30 percent of the patients who had never been screened but in just over 5 percent of those who had mammograms.\n\nWomen who underwent screening reduced their risk of dying from breast cancer by 49 percent. Women aged 70 to 75 had the greatest risk reduction, reducing the risk of dying from breast cancer by 84 percent. The risk reduction in younger women, aged 50 to 69, was smaller, at 39 percent, but still considered substantial.\n\nThe greater risk reduction in women aged 70 to 75, Otto said, is probably a result of the long-term good effects of screening participation in the earlier target age group, 50 to 69, before the upper age limit for screening was extended in the Netherlands from 69 to 75.\n\nThe study findings ''add to the body of evidence supporting the fact that mammography matters in improving detection and survival,\" said Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"This study focuses on survival.\"\n\nThe study, however, has some limitations, Bernik noted.

Nelson, M.D., Professor and Chair, Obstetrics and Gynecology at Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, Calif. \"Kyleena is highly effective at preventing pregnancy and may be an appropriate choice for women who want a low-dose, non-daily birth control method.\"\n\nKyleena is a small, flexible plastic T-shaped device containing 19.5 mg of a progestin hormone called levonorgestrel. Kyleena is placed by a healthcare provider during an in-office visit and prevents pregnancy for up to five years, but may be removed by a healthcare provider at any time.\n\n\"With the approval of Kyleena, women have an important new birth control option that provides pregnancy prevention for up to five years,\" said Dario Mirski, M.D., Senior Vice President and Head of Medical Affairs for the Americas, Bayer. \"Kyleena expands Bayer's IUD portfolio and is part of our commitment to provide women and their healthcare providers with a variety of contraceptive choices to meet their individual needs.\"\n\nThe use of long-acting reversible contraception (LARCs) has increased nearly five-fold in the last decade.3\n\nBecause Kyleena slowly releases levonorgestrel into a woman's uterus, only small amounts of the hormone enter the blood. For the first 3 to 6 months, a woman's period may become irregular and the number of bleeding days may increase. Women may also have frequent spotting or light bleeding. Some women have heavy bleeding during this time. After using Kyleena for a while, the number of bleeding and spotting days is likely to lessen. For some women, periods will stop altogether. When Kyleena is removed, menstrual periods should return.\n\nAbout the Clinical Trial for Kyleena1\n\nThe contraceptive efficacy of Kyleena was evaluated in a clinical trial that enrolled generally healthy women aged 18 to 35, of whom 1,452 received Kyleena. Of these, 40% (574) were nulliparous women, 870 (60%) women completed 3 years of the study, 707 (49%) elected to enroll in an extension phase up to a total of 5 years, and 550 (38%) completed 5 years of use. The trial was a multicenter, multi-national, randomized, open-label study conducted in 11 countries in Europe, Latin America, the U.S. and Canada. Women less than six weeks postpartum, with a history of ectopic pregnancy, with clinically significant ovarian cysts or with HIV or otherwise at high risk for sexually transmitted infections were excluded. A total of 563 (39%) were treated at U.S. sites and 889 (61%) were at non-U.S. sites. The racial demographics of enrolled women who received Kyleena was: Caucasian (80%), Black/African American (5.1%), Other (2.6%) and Asian (1.2%); 11% indicated Hispanic ethnicity. The clinical trial had no upper or lower weight or BMI limit. The weight range was 38 to 173 kg (mean weight: 68.7 kg) and mean BMI was 25.3 kg/m2 (range 15.2\u201357.6 kg/m2). Of Kyleena-treated women, 22% discontinued the study treatment due to an adverse reaction, 5.0% were lost to follow-up, 2.3% withdrew for unspecified reasons, 1.2% discontinued due to a protocol deviation, 0.9% discontinued due to pregnancy, and 20% discontinued due to other reasons.\n\nThe pregnancy rate calculated as the Pearl Index (PI) in women aged 18-35 years was the primary efficacy endpoint used to assess contraceptive reliability. The PI was calculated based on 28-day equivalent exposure cycles; evaluable cycles excluded those in which back-up contraception was used unless a pregnancy occurred in that cycle. The Year 1 PI was based on 2 pregnancies and the cumulative 5-year pregnancy rate was based on 13 pregnancies that occurred after the onset of treatment and within 7 days after Kyleena removal or expulsion.\n\nAbout 71% of 163 women who desired pregnancy after study discontinuation and provided follow-up information, conceived within 12 months after removal of Kyleena.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (occurring in \u2265 5% users) were vulvovaginitis (24%), ovarian cyst (22%), abdominal pain/pelvic pain (21%), headache/migraine (15%), acne/seborrhea (15%), dysmenorrhea/uterine spasm (10%), breast pain/breast discomfort (10%), and increased bleeding (8%). In the combined studies, 22% discontinued prematurely due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (> 1%) leading to discontinuation were increased bleeding (4.5%), abdominal pain/pelvic pain (4.2%), device expulsion (3.1%), acne/seborrhea (2.3%), and dysmenorrhea/uterine spasm (1.3%). In the clinical trials, serious adverse reactions occurring in more than a single subject included: ectopic pregnancy/ruptured ectopic pregnancy (10 subjects); pelvic inflammatory disease (6 subjects); missed abortion/incomplete spontaneous abortion/spontaneous abortion (4 subjects); ovarian cyst (3 subjects); abdominal pain (4 subjects); depression/affective disorder (4 subjects); and uterine perforation/embedded device (myometrial perforation) (3 subjects).\n\nIndication for Kyleena \n\nKyleena\u2122 (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system) is a hormone-releasing IUD that prevents pregnancy for up to 5 years.\n\u2022 If you have a pelvic infection, get infections easily, or have certain cancers, don't use Kyleena. Less than 1% of users get a serious pelvic infection called PID.\n\u2022 If you have persistent pelvic or stomach pain or if Kyleena comes out, tell your doctor. If Kyleena comes out, use back-up birth control. Kyleena may attach to or go through the uterus and cause other problems.\n\u2022 Pregnancy while using Kyleena is uncommon but can be life threatening and may result in loss of pregnancy or fertility.\n\u2022 Ovarian cysts may occur but usually disappear.\n\u2022 Bleeding and spotting may increase in the first 3 to 6 months and remain irregular. Periods over time usually become shorter, lighter, or may stop.\n\nKyleena does not protect against HIV or STDs.\n\nOnly you and your healthcare provider can decide if Kyleena is right for you.

That's an annual growth of 3 percent in number of biopsies, the researchers noted.\n\nMoreover, by 2008, 67 percent of these biopsies were being done through the skin with the help of CT scans, ultrasound and MRI, Kwan's group found.\n\n\"We also found that the use of imaging guidance increased over this time period, most likely because the technique enables more efficient and safe targeting of lesions,\" Kwan said in a news release.\n\nThis increase in less-invasive biopsies went along with a decrease in the number of more-invasive biopsies and through-the-skin biopsies where no imaging was used, the researchers found.\n\nThe only two areas where needle biopsies were not the majority of biopsies done were biopsies of lymph nodes and soft tissues. For these areas, open biopsies are easier to do and need less imaging guidance, Kwan's team noted.\n\nQuencer thinks the use of image-guided biopsies will continue to increase over time, even for lymph nodes and soft tissues. \"In time, I would expect 80 to 90 percent of biopsies will be image-guided biopsies,\" he said.\n\nFor more information on biopsies, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "Not applicable because no diseases were discussed in any detail.

In women agreeing to participate, this led to a 28 per cent reduction in hip fractures over five years.\n\nProfessor Neil Gittoes, of the University of Birmingham's Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, said: \"Our findings showed that screening led to a statistically significant decrease in hip fractures. \"Our data has the potential to influence national policies around prevention of hip fractures, which is particularly relevant in our ageing society. The consequences of hip fractures to older people can be devastating, including impaired mobility and loss of independence. \"While we have demonstrated clinical effectiveness of screening, we are also exploring cost-effectiveness of this approach; initial analyses also look promising in this respect.\"\n\nProfessor Lee Shepstone, from UEA's Norwich Medical School, said: \"Approximately one in three women and one in five men aged over 50 year will suffer a fragility fracture during their remaining lifetime. In the UK around 536,000 people suffer fragility fractures each year, including 79,000 hip fractures.\n\n\"A hip fracture can be devastating with a loss of independence and less than one third of patients make a full recovery. Mortality at one-year post-fracture is approximately 20 per cent.\"\n\n\"We wanted to find out whether screening, like screening for breast cancer, could help identify those at risk of suffering a fracture.\"\n\nThe team used a University of Sheffield developed tool called FRAX, which predicts the probability of a hip fracture or a major osteoporotic fracture (a hip, spine, upper arm or lower arm fracture), to identify older women at high risk.\n\nA total of 12,483 women aged 70-85 were recruited from 100 GP practices in seven regions -Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester, Norwich, Sheffield, Southampton, and York. Half of the women were screened to compare screening with routine care.\n\nAmong those screened, treatment was subsequently recommended for one in seven women deemed at high risk of hip fracture. This recommendation was acted upon by the women and their GPs so that over three quarters of the women at high risk were on osteoporosis medications within six months of screening.\n\nWhile screening did not reduce the incidence of all osteoporosis-related fractures, there was strong evidence for a reduction in hip fractures.\n\nIn the screening group, there were 54 fewer women who suffered one or more hip fractures compared to the routine care group.\n\nThe study suggests that one hip fracture could be prevented for every 111 women screened and early analysis suggests the approach is likely to be cost-effective.\n\nProfessor Shepstone added: \"This is the first trial to show that a community-screening approach based on the FRAX fracture risk tool is both feasible and effective. Given that the number of costly and debilitating hip fractures are expected to increase with an ageing population, the results of this study potentially have important public health implications.\"\n\nProfessor Eugene McCloskey, of the University of Sheffield, said: \"Low-cost screening with FRAX among the older population could result in effective, targeted intervention to reduce the human and socioeconomic burden of hip fractures.\n\n\"If the SCOOP screening strategy was taken up in exactly the same way as in the study in all UK women aged 70-85 years, we estimate that the strategy could prevent up to 8000 hip fractures per year in the UK. Even greater gains could be made if we could reach out to women similar to those who did not take part in the study.\"\n\nThe randomised controlled trial 'SCreening for Osteoporosis in Older women for the Prevention of fracture' (SCOOP) was funded by the Medical Research Council and Arthritis Research UK.\n\nDr Natalie Carter, head of research liaison and evaluation at Arthritis Research UK, said: \"Ten of thousands of people a year present with hip fractures in the UK. As well as significantly increasing mortality, a hip fracture can stop a person's ability to live independently, with 43% no longer being able to walk independently in the year after the fracture. \"We welcome this community based screening programme and any other research that reduces the likelihood of fractures.\"\n\nFor further information or interviews contact Emma McKinney, Press Office, University of Birmingham, at +44 (0)121 414 6681 or contact the Press Office out of hours on 44-0-7789-921165.\n\u2022 The University of Birmingham is ranked amongst the world's top 100 institutions.

Experts attribute the pelvic pain to prostaglandins, a hormone-like substance that contributes to the contraction and relaxation of muscles and blood vessels.\n\nVitamin D3 apparently helped hamper prostaglandin production in study participants, easing their pain, said Dr. Jill Rabin, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y. The vitamin is also known to have anti-inflammatory effects, Rabin added.\n\n\"The bottom line is, it looked like it worked,\" said Rabin, also head of urogynecology at the hospital. \"It was a very well-done study, but my comment is, it was one study. It asks more questions than it answers, which is the sign of a good trial.\"\n\nThe 300,000 IU dose of vitamin D3 given in the study also far exceeds the daily intake of 600 IUs recommended for American women of reproductive age, both Graham and Rabin said. And since the study period lasted only two months, there was no way to tell whether such a high dose produced any toxic long-term effects.\n\nCurrently used methods of controlling menstrual cramps include NSAIDs and -- among those with severe pain -- birth control pills. But both have potential risks: NSAID users can experience stomach or kidney troubles, for example, while birth control pills are linked to blood clots in certain women. The cost of vitamin D supplements would be roughly comparable with both of these remedies.\n\nVitamin D use has also been widely studied as a possible preventive for many other conditions, including heart disease, certain cancers and autoimmune disorders.\n\nThe Italian study participants all had blood levels of vitamin D measuring in the lowest 25 percent of normal at the study's outset, although the researchers didn't report the womens' blood levels afterward. Experts wondered if women with higher blood levels would experience such dramatic cramp relief as observed in the study.\n\nGraham and Rabin agreed that much larger trials should be done before they would recommend vitamin D3 use to any of their patients for cramp relief.\n\n\"From a symptomatic standpoint, it's something to be considered, but more studies are needed to see the risks and benefits,\" Graham said. \"Studies like this are starting to show that vitamin D is ubiquitous in receptors in our bodies . . . but it needs further explanation.\"\n\nTo find out more about painful menstrual periods, head to the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The lead in to the story hinges on disease-mongering with its \u201cbane of many women\u201d description, but we\u2019ll give the story the benefit of the doubt.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Researchers have developed a score that predicts an individual's risk of dying within 5 years for people aged between 40 and 70 years old in the UK, according to new research published in The Lancet.\n\nThe score, which uses measures that can be obtained by simple questionnaires without any need for physical examination, such as self-rated health and usual walking speed, could be used by individuals to improve awareness of their health status, and by doctors to identify high-risk individuals for further treatment, say the authors.\n\nIndividuals can calculate their personalised 5-year mortality risk and what the study authors call an 'Ubble age' [1]?the age where the average mortality risk in the population is most similar to the estimated risk of the individual?through an online questionnaire, using the dedicated interactive website [2]. The site was developed with Sense About Science [3], a UK charity that that equips people to make sense of scientific and medical claims in public discussion.\n\n\"The Ubble website allows anybody in the UK between forty and seventy years old to calculate their 'Ubble age' and their risk of dying within the next five years compared to the general population, using a simple set of a dozen or so questions,\" says study co-author Professor Erik Ingelsson from Uppsala University, Sweden. \"This is the first study of its kind which is based on a very large study sample, and is not limited to specific populations, single types of risk, or requiring laboratory testing.\" [4]\n\nTo create the score, Professor Ingelsson and Dr Andrea Ganna, from the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, analysed data collected between 2006 and 2010 from nearly half a million adults aged between 40 and 70 years from the UK Biobank [5]. They used a statistical survival model to assess the probability that 655 specific demographic, lifestyle, and health measurements could predict death from any cause and six specific causes, in men and women separately.\n\nThe results allow researchers to compare the predictive ability of a large number of health-related risk factors which were formerly studied separately and using different populations, although the predictive ability of risk factors does not necessarily imply they are causally related to the risk of dying.\n\nFor example, the research shows that self-reported information, such as usual walking pace and illness and injuries in the past 2 years, is generally a stronger predictor of death and survival than biological measurements, such as pulse rate and blood pressure. Surprisingly, self-reported walking pace is a stronger predictor of death risk in both men and women than smoking habits and other lifestyle measurements.\n\nSelf-rated overall health [6] emerged as the single most powerful predictor of death in men, and previous cancer diagnosis the strongest predictor in women (see figure 1 of the Article). When excluding individuals with serious diseases or disorders, smoking habits were the strongest predictors of mortality from any cause (figure 3).\n\nUsing these findings, the researchers then developed an easy-to-calculate risk score for an individual's risk of dying in the next 5 years, based on the most predictive self-reported information, including 13 questions for men and 11 for women. The performance of the score was validated in 35810 participants enrolled at two Scottish centres which were not used to develop the score, and was found to have around 80% accuracy in men and women (table 2). UK life tables and census information were used to calibrate the score for the overall UK population.\n\nAccording to study co-author Dr Ganna, \"The fact that the score can be measured online in a brief questionnaire, without any need for lab tests or physical examination, is an exciting development. We hope that our score might eventually enable doctors to quickly and easily identify their highest risk patients, although more research will be needed to determine whether it can be used in this way in a clinical setting. Of course, the score has a degree of uncertainty and shouldn't be seen as a deterministic prediction. For most people, a high risk of dying in the next five years can be reduced by increased physical activity, smoking cessation, and a healthy diet.\" [4]\n\nWriting in a linked Comment, Simon Thompson and Peter Willeit from the University of Cambridge in the UK say, \"One appealing aspect of the website is the representation of an individual's estimated 5 year mortality risk as what the authors call \"Ubble age\" (the age where the average risk in the population is most similar to the estimated risk of the individual); this concept is similar to that of heart age developed for communicating cardiovascular risk. Whether this will help individuals improve self-awareness of their health status, however, or only lead to so-called cyberchondria, is a moot point. Moreover, 5 year mortality is easier to predict than long-term morbidity, or quality of life and life expectancy, all of which are more important to individuals and to society.\"\n\nThis study was funded by Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation and the Swedish Research Council.\n\n[2] For preview login details for the Ubble website, please email daisy.barton@lancet.com.\n\n[3] See http://www. for more information.\n\n[4] Quotes direct from author and cannot be found in text of Article.\n\n[5] UK Biobank http://www. recruited half a million people aged between 40 and 69 years in 2006-10 from across the country.

Currently, guidelines reserve breast MRI screening for women who have a strong family history or other specific breast cancer risk factors. MRI screening has not been considered necessary for women at average risk, and there has been resistance to expansion of MRI into this population due, in part, to concern over higher costs.\n\nHowever, with breast cancer remaining a major cause of cancer death in women, there is good reason to pursue the search for improved screening methods, according to the study's lead author, Christiane Kuhl, M.D., chair of the Department of Radiology at RWTH Aachen University in Aachen, Germany.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2013, Dr. Kuhl and colleagues studied breast MRI's impact on 2,120 women, ages 40 to 70, with less than a 15 percent lifetime risk of breast cancer. The women had normal screening mammograms and, in the case of those with dense breast tissue, normal screening ultrasound. Breast MRI detected 60 additional breast cancers, including 40 invasive cancers, for an overall supplemental cancer detection rate of 15.5 per 1,000 women. Of the 60 cancers detected in the study group over the observation period (7,007 screening rounds), 59 were found only using MRI, one was found also by mammography, and none by mammography or ultrasound alone.\n\nAccording to Dr. Kuhl, the results suggest that MRI can serve as a useful supplemental screening tool for women at average risk, especially those with dense mammographic tissue, and that MRI is superior to supplemental ultrasound for this purpose.\n\nThe results also highlight the ability of MRI in the detection of more aggressive types of cancer.\n\n\"The faster a cancer grows and the better it is in seeding metastases, the better will it be picked up early by MRI,\" Dr. Kuhl said. \"In our cohort, cancers found by MRI alone exhibited features of rapid growth at pathology.\"\n\nThis ability is especially important in women with dense breast tissue in which aggressive cancers may be missed on mammography. Left undetected, these cancers will grow to become clinically palpable cancers, also known as interval cancers. The new study showed that, consistent with previous research, breast MRI can depict these rapidly growing cancers with high reliability.\n\nAccording to Dr. Kuhl, interval cancers exhibit an adverse biologic profile and are the main driver of breast cancer mortality. Additional cancers detected by MRI screening in the study had a skewed distribution towards a higher-than-normal prevalence or incidence of rapidly growing (grade 3) cancers.\n\n\"The interval cancer rate in our study was zero percent. Not a single cancer was undetected that became palpable,\" she said. \"This suggests that MRI finds breast cancers that also mammography would find, but MRI detects them earlier, and it finds the cancers which, if MRI had not been done, would have progressed to interval cancers.\"\n\n\"Supplemental Breast MR Imaging Screening of Women with Average Risk of Breast Cancer.\" Collaborating with Dr. Kuhl were Kevin Strobel, M.D., Heribert Bieling, M.Sc., Claudia Leutner, M.D., Hans H.

The prostate is a walnut-shaped gland that produces semen and it is hard to get to.\n\nDigital rectal exams can tell a specialist that the prostate is getting bigger, but that happens with normal aging as well as with cancer. A blood test for prostate specific antigen or PSA shows when PSA rises, but PSA goes up with either cancer or just normal enlargement of the prostate \u2014 or even if the gland is inflamed, such as from an infection.\n\nBiopsies are difficult and painful to do and may take a portion of healthy prostate, missing any tumors entirely.\n\nAnd prostate tumors can grow slowly. A study last year estimated that more than 1 million men in the United States alone had been needlessly treated for prostate tumors that likely would never have killed them.\n\nThe Progensa test looks for a genetic material called PCA3.

This is far less sensitive than PSA, which catches 87 percent of tumors, but if the two tests are used together they can help rule out the need for unnecessary surgery or radiation.\n\nAmong the 1,946 men studied, 42 percent turned out to have prostate cancer.\n\nThe test was approved for use in Europe in 2006 but is not yet approved in the United States.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "\u00a0The story did not engage in overt disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Deep sleep is critical to maintaining a robust memory, but both decline with age. A small new study published in suggests that one easy way for older adults to get deeper sleep and stronger memories is to listen to a certain soothing sound called \u201cpink noise\u201d\u2014a mix of high and low frequencies that sounds more balanced and natural than its better-known cousin, \u201cwhite noise.\u201d\n\nIt may sound strange, but previous studies have found that playing so-called pink noise during sleep improves the memory of younger adults. \u201cWe wanted to see if it would work in older people, too,\u201d says senior author Dr. Phyllis Zee, professor of neurology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Older people tend to get less slow-wave sleep and are at greater risk for memory impairment.\n\nZee and her fellow researchers had 13 adults ages 60 and older spend two nights in a sleep lab. On both nights, the participants took a memory test at night, went to sleep wearing headphones and an electrode cap, and repeated the memory test in the morning.\n\nOn one of those nights, headphone-clad participants were played a series of short bursts of pink noise during deep sleep, spaced out enough to prevent the brain from getting used to and ignoring them. \u201cThe noise is fairly pleasant; it kind of resembles a rush of water,\u201d says Zee. \u201cIt\u2019s just noticeable enough that the brain realizes it\u2019s there, but not enough to disturb sleep.\u201d The sounds were timed to match their slow-wave oscillations. No noise was played during the other night.\n\nAfter analyzing everyone\u2019s sleep waves, the team found that people\u2019s slow-wave oscillations increased on the nights punctuated by pink noise. Come morning, people who had listened to it performed three times better on memory tests than they had the other night. On the nights without the noise, memory recall did not improve as much.\n\nNorthwestern has a patent pending on the new technology, and one of the study authors has cofounded a company that plans to market it commercially. But first, says Zee, larger and longer studies are needed to confirm the findings and show that there are benefits to long-term use, rather than on just one night. The researchers hope to develop an affordable device that people can use at home.\n\nZee says that the effectiveness of pink noise is all in the timing. \u201cThe effect here, at least for memory, is quite related to the ability of the sound stimulus to enhance slow-wave sleep,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s very much tied to what part of the slow wave the stimulus is hitting on.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t benefits to other soothing background sounds.

As an outpatient treatment, GAE does not require open surgery or physical therapy, and takes 45-90 minutes to perform.\n\nThis prospective, multicenter clinical trial evaluated 13 patients with severe osteoarthritis pain. Each patient's pain and disability were measured along two scales, with evaluations before and after the treatment. The treatment was successfully completed in all 13 patients, with no adverse events. One month later, researchers followed the progress of eight patients and found that GAE significantly decreased pain (-58 mm on the Visual Analog Scale), reduced stiffness and increased physical function (-36.3 on the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index). Together the scales represent an 80 percent improvement in function compared with pre-procedure conditions.\n\n\"This procedure could have a significant impact in the treatment of osteoarthritis pain as a whole,\" said Bagla. \"The current mainstay of treatment in patients who have arthritis are pain medications, which come with significant side effects and risks. But GAE provides another option for patients struggling with pain and may even allow patients to avoid the painful recovery of knee surgery and the need for the kind of opioid pain medications associated with the dangerous epidemic in the United States.\"\n\nThis study builds on the growing international research around GAE and osteoarthritis. While preliminary data shows that the treatment does work and is feasible, it has only been used in a clinical trial setting. The study has completed enrollment of 20 patients and final results are expected in summer 2018. A second randomized controlled clinical trial began in February 2018 and will provide further data on what types of patients are the best candidates for this treatment and how it could move toward clinical practice.\n\nAbstract 210: Geniculate Artery Embolization (GAE) for Osteoarthritis (OA)-related Knee Pain: Interim Results from a Multicenter US Trial.

Dr. Vigneswaran is division director of thoracic surgery and a professor in the department of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery of Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine.\n\nMalignant pleural mesothelioma is caused by environmental factors such as exposure to asbestos as well as a genetic predisposition to the cancer. It develops in the pleura, the thin layer of tissue surrounding the lungs. As the tumor grows, it restricts the lungs, typically causing shortness of breath, fatigue, weight loss and/or chest discomfort and pain. In PD surgery, the pleura is removed. While the procedure cannot cure mesothelioma, it can help control the buildup of fluid, improve breathing and lessen cancer pain. Dr. Vigneswaran and colleagues administered a cancer quality-of-life survey known as the EORTC QLQ-C30 to 114 mesothelioma patients who underwent PD surgery. The median age was 70, with a range of 50 to 88. Prior to surgery, 31 percent of the patients had a performance status score of 0 (fully functional); 65 percent had a performance status score of 1 (able to do light house work or office work); and 4 percent had a performance status of 2 (ambulatory and capable of self-care, but unable to work). Following surgery, all patients were surveyed at 1 month, 4-5 months, 7-8 months and 10-11 months.\n\nThe quality of life survey measured overall functioning (physical, emotional, cognitive, etc.); general symptoms (fatigue, nausea/vomiting and pain); individual items (shortness of breath, diarrhea, insomnia, constipation and financial difficulties) and overall health.\n\nImproved quality of life was observed in the first month after surgery and was maintained at late follow-up in all patients. Quality of life was not adversely affected by surgery at any time in patients who, prior to surgery, had performance status of 1 or 2; a tumor volume greater than 600 ml. or a type of tumor cell called non-epithelioid.\n\n\u201cThe net benefit of pleurectomy and decortication justifies the procedure in the majority of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma,\u201d Dr. Vigneswaran concluded.\n\nThe study is titled \u201cQuality of Life in Patients Undergoing Pleurectomy and Decortication for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma.\u201d The surgeries were performed by Dr. Vigneswaran at University of Chicago Medicine, where he practiced before recently joining Loyola.", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There is no disease mongering in the news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Why should women bear the brunt of infertility testing?

For up to eight years, the researchers followed 165 infants who were born in the south west and who received cooling therapy at St Michael's Hospital, Bristol, part of University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust. The study examined how many babies were diagnosed with epilepsy and how many are on regular antiepileptic drug treatment at two and four to eight years of age.\n\nThe research found that babies, born after 2007, who received the cooling treatment, had much less epilepsy than before cooling treatment was introduced. At two years, seven per cent of the children had an epilepsy diagnosis, however, far fewer, only two per cent, were on regular antiepileptic drugs.\n\nThe study showed that more children had epilepsy when they reached the age of four to eight years with seven per cent on regular medication. However, these are very low numbers needing antiepileptic treatment compared to before cooling treatment was introduced as standard of care.\n\nBefore therapeutic hypothermia was introduced, poor outcome meaning death or moderate or severe disability was around 66 per cent (32 per cent death and 34 per cent surviving with disability).\n\nIn this cohort born after 2007, the number of children with poor outcome is lower at 34 per cent (11 per cent death and 23 per cent survived with disability). Also, the severity of cerebral palsy is milder and seven out of ten are able to walk. Even if a lesser severity of perinatal asphyxia is accounted for, cooling therapy has increased the number of healthy survivors and there are very few children with epilepsy needing drug treatment.\n\nProfessor Marianne Thoresen said: \"Even if we account for a lesser severity of perinatal asphyxia, our research has shown that therapeutic hypothermia reduces the number of children who develop epilepsy later in childhood. Cooling treatment also reduces the number and severity of cerebral palsy and increases the number of patients who survive normally.\"\n\nThe research was funded by Sparks UK; University of Bristol's Alumni Foundation; The Laerdal Foundation for Acute Medicine, Norway; University of Oslo, and a private donation.\n\n'Reduced infancy and childhood epilepsy following hypothermia-treated neonatal encephalopathy' by Xun Liu, Sally Jary, Frances Cowan and Marianne Thoresen in Epilepsia", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering here.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "MONDAY, Jan. 4, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Newer blood pressure drugs are as safe and effective as older medications, new research suggests.\n\nScientists at the NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City said their findings settle a longstanding debate about which of two types blood-pressure lowering medications studied are better.\n\nAn analysis of 106 randomized trials involving more than 250,000 patients examined the effects of newer angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and older angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Although ACE inhibitors were developed 10 years earlier, both types of drugs showed similar effects in the analysis, challenging previous findings that suggest ACE inhibitors have greater benefits.\n\nAccording to the new analysis, published online Jan. 4 in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings, the only difference between the medications is that ARBs are more easily tolerated.\n\n\"There has been debate for many years over the safety and efficacy of ACE inhibitors compared to ARBs, with many of them using an 'ACE inhibitor-first' approach, with ARBs regarded as less effective,\" study author Dr. Sripal Bangalore said in a medical center news release.\n\n\"We believe that our study ends the debate and gives physicians the option to prescribe either drug for their patients,\" added Bangalore, an associate professor in the division of cardiology, in the department of medicine at NYU Langone.\n\nBoth ARBs and ACE inhibitors interfere with the function of a hormone called angiotensin II, which regulates blood pressure, but they do this in different ways, the study authors said.\n\nAngiotensin II restricts blood flow through vessels, raising blood pressure. ACE inhibitors prevent the body from making angiotensin II, while ARBs prevent the hormone from doing its job by taking its place on the surface of blood vessels, the researchers explained.\n\nPrevious studies have suggested that older ACE inhibitors are more effective than ARBs. But, this latest analysis attributed that difference to changes in the standard of care over the decade between trials of the two types of drugs, greater emphasis on quitting smoking, and wider use of cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins.\n\nHowever, when trials were conducted at similar times, one drug was not more effective than the other, the findings showed.\n\n\"This is the first time that we have a clear and consistent message from the three buckets of trials of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, all of which show that there is no outcome difference between the two agents, except for better tolerability of ARBs,\" Bangalore said.\n\n\"The results of our analysis are especially important for patients, given that many ARBs are now also generic, which reduces their costs,\" he added.\n\nFor more about blood pressure drugs, visit the American Heart Association.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "This story does not appear to commit disease-mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "John Held, with a family history of type 2 diabetes, watched as his own blood-sugar levels crept over the normal range, identifying him as a prime candidate for the disease.\n\nThat was 10 years ago, when he joined the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study with the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health, one of 27 institutions participating in the research.\n\nAfter taking a daily pill for almost three years without results, Mr. Held learned he'd been on a placebo.\n\nBut those who did undergo lifestyle changes showed such notable results that Pitt offered to enroll all 159 participants, including Mr. Held, in a lifestyle modification program.\n\nAs a result, Mr. Held, 78, of Whitehall, lost 20 pounds to his current weight of 146 pounds. He walks about 50,000 steps a week, golfs, works out and tap dances and consumes about 1,800 daily calories.\n\nHis results do not surprise researchers.\n\nThe blood-sugar level for a healthy adult, measured as milligrams of glucose per deciliter, is generally 70 to 100 mg/dl. Mr. Held's blood-sugar levels remain at 101 -- the exact level he had 10 years ago.

For 10 years, researchers tracked 2,766 people nationwide with pre-diabetes -- a metabolic condition featuring slightly elevated blood-glucose levels that often serves as a precursor to type 2 diabetes.\n\nDPPOS proved that intensive lifestyle changes resulting in even modest weight loss reduced development of type 2 diabetes by 34 percent, compared with people at high risk for diabetes who only took a placebo and didn't alter lifestyle.\n\nThe study is published online today in the The Lancet, a medical journal.\n\nOverall results show that participants randomly assigned to make lifestyle changes had more favorable cardiovascular risk factors including lower blood pressure and triglyceride levels, despite taking fewer drugs to control heart disease risk.\n\nThe group that took metformin prevented the onset of type 2 by 18 percent, compared with the control group on a placebo. That means lifestyle changes were twice as effective as medicine in delaying or preventing diabetes.\n\nThe study also concluded that participants who underwent positive lifestyle changes delayed type 2 diabetes by about four years, compared with the control group. Benefits of intensive lifestyle changes were most pronounced in the elderly, with people 60 or older reducing the rate of developing type 2 diabetes by half.\n\nIntensive lifestyle changes include lowering fat and calories in the diet, learning behavior modification skills and increasing physical activity to 150 minutes per week.\n\nElizabeth M.

All had the drug regimen before surgery, with Taxol (paclitaxel), a standard chemotherapy, added after six weeks. After 12 more weeks of treatment, the women had surgery.\n\nAt that point, researchers evaluated who had better responses. The women continued the treatments for one more year, allowing researchers to follow them and see how the approaches affected survival.\n\nBaselga stressed that the study looked only at women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancers, and that the drug Tykerb is approved now only for advanced breast cancers.\n\nThe study is well done and important, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society. The two drugs, he said, \"affect the same pathway but do it in a different way.\"\n\nWhile the combination showed a better response rate, \"there is also an increased level of side effects,\" he noted.\n\nWhile no major heart problems occurred, those on Tykerb alone or the two-drug combination had more diarrhea. Liver-enzyme alterations were also more frequent when Tykerb was used.\n\nGlaxoSmithKline notes that liver toxicity with the drug may be severe and that deaths have been reported, although the cause of the deaths has not been determined.\n\nThe important question, however, has not been answered yet, Lichtenfeld said. That's the effect on overall survival in using the two-drug approach. The researchers are continuing to evaluate that.\n\nCost is another consideration: Tykerb runs about $4,000 a month wholesale, and retail prices could be higher.\n\nIn another study, published online Jan. 17 in The Lancet Oncology, researchers from Germany reported that Tykerb is less beneficial than Herceptin as a single-drug therapy.\n\nThey assigned 620 women with HER2-positive breast cancer to get standard chemotherapy plus Herceptin or Tykerb.\n\nThey looked to see which drug was better at eliminating invasive cancer in the breast and metastatic cells in the lymph nodes.

Neither had a painful bone-marrow transplant nor an experimental treatment. Her careworn father cried in the shower to hide his anguish. Her mother couldn\u2019t help but wonder, \u201cWhy is this happening to our child?\u201d\n\nBut Ava was fortunate in one respect. Discoveries in the burgeoning field of immunotherapy are offering lifelines to desperate patients who previously had none. \u201cFive years ago,\u201d said her mother, Bethany Christianson, \u201cour doctor would have just had to tell us to go home.\u201d\n\nInstead, in a five-minute procedure at the NIH Clinical Center in late July, the freckle-face girl got another chance to beat the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that has stalked her since age 4. She was infused with 30 million of her own T cells, a key part of the immune system, that had been genetically modified to track down and kill her cancer like a pack of crazed dogs.\n\nAva\u2019s treatment, called CAR T-cell therapy, is one of the new immunotherapies that attempt to rally the body\u2019s own defenses to fight malignancies. Unlike other cancer advances, it is being tested widely in children because of its stunning effectiveness in ALL, the most common pediatric cancer. In early-stage trials, many patients who had repeatedly relapsed saw their leukemia disappear. Some remain cancer-free.\n\nYet big questions surround the therapy, and many scientists are urging caution. \u201cThere\u2019s very real promise with this approach, but the immune system is complicated,\u201d said Terry Fry, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) scientist who is running Ava\u2019s trial. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that still needs to be worked out.\u201d\n\n[Here\u2019s what you need to know about immunotherapy]\n\nComplications can be lethal; one clinical trial was briefly halted in July after three young adults died of brain swelling. It is also far from clear that such a personalized approach \u2014 possibly costing hundreds of thousands of dollars \u2014 is economically viable on a large scale or will produce the lasting remissions that everyone hopes to see.\n\nU.S. researchers running CAR T-cell trials for children and adults with leukemia and lymphoma have reported remission rates up to 90 percent in some cases. That\u2019s a major achievement in a group whose cancer is emboldened by every treatment failure. But rates in other trials are considerably lower, and many patients eventually relapse.\n\n\u201cThe treatment is great about getting people into remission but not at keeping everyone in remission,\u201d said Rebecca Gardner, a pediatric oncologist at Seattle Children\u2019s hospital. She ran an early-stage trial using CAR T-cell therapy in which 39 of 42 patients went into complete remission. By a year, about half had relapsed, either because their T cells had inexplicably disappeared or their cancer had changed so that the T cells could no longer recognize it. \u201cLeukemia is really smart,\u201d she said.\n\nAva\u2019s family understands that better than most. She underwent her first CAR T-cell procedure in Minnesota last year, but her leukemia returned within six months. Her treatment at NIH involved a next-generation version, developed by NCI, that used a different target for her marauding T cells. In this first-in-humans trial, she is Patient No. 18.\n\nIn late August, the Christiansons learned that Ava had gone into remission. She and her mother, who were still at the Clinical Center in Bethesda, Md., gleefully rushed home to Wisconsin so Ava could start third grade.\n\nHer parents, so frequently disappointed, remain guardedly optimistic. \u201cHope is all you have,\u201d said her father, Jay Christianson.\n\nHer mother added, \u201cWe just need this to work and to stay working.\u201d\n\nNCI\u2019s Fry is careful not to make any promises about an extended remission. \u201cI can\u2019t say that\u2019s going to be the case,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause we just don\u2019t know. It\u2019s too soon.\u201d\n\nScientists have wanted for decades to marshal the immune system to vanquish cancer, but their attempts have mostly been frustrated. In the past few years, however, breakthroughs have led to the development of two types of immunotherapy \u2014 checkpoint inhibitors and CAR T cells \u2014 that are generating enormous excitement.\n\nCheckpoint inhibitors are off-the-shelf therapies aimed at unleashing the immune system\u2019s power to see and attack the disease. Used mostly in adults, to date, they are producing impressive results, albeit in a minority of cases. The most prominent: Jimmy Carter. The former president became the poster patient when he was successfully treated last year with a checkpoint inhibitor called Keytruda, along with surgery and radiation, for his advanced melanoma.\n\nMuch of the earliest research for customized CAR T-cell therapy was conducted at NCI, the University of Pennsylvania, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Seattle Children\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThe technology of CAR T cells is really a breakthrough, especially for children,\u201d said Michael Jensen, director of the Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research at Seattle Children\u2019s Research Institute.\n\nAlmost all the initial work focused on CD19, a protein found on the surface of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Scientists figured out ways to use a chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, to reprogram T cells to recognize the protein and kill the cancer.\n\n[Immunotherapy is showing benefits in an increasing number of cancers]\n\nZane Esposito, a 13-year-old from Plano, Tex., calls himself the \u201cT-Cell Explorer.\u201d He was diagnosed with ALL in June 2010. \u201cI just thought my back hurt,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t walk up the steps very well.\u201d Almost three years of treatment, including punishing chemotherapy, provided a couple of years of remission. His leukemia returned in January, and this time it did not respond to treatment.\n\nSoon after Zane relapsed, he and his father bumped into friends in a local doughnut shop who told them about a TV segment on CAR T-cell therapy. Paul Esposito searched online and found Gardner\u2019s clinical trial in Seattle. Zane signed on, got the treatment, went back into full remission and gained 25 pounds.\n\nHis Texas doctors have talked about a bone-marrow transplant to increase the chance of a true cure, but the Espositos have resisted. The Seattle doctors say it is not clear yet whether that is necessary or whether there would be still other options should Zane\u2019s cancer recur.\n\nZane is moving on, with dreams of competing on \u201cChopped Junior\u201d to show off his homemade pasta and pizza. On July 27, the day that Ava got her T cells, he celebrated his 13th birthday.\n\nAva was 4 when she started having leg pains, then trouble standing up. Her mother suspected Lyme disease. \u201cYou never think of cancer with a child,\u201d she said, eyes filling as she recalled her daughter\u2019s cancer diagnosis in November 2012. The doctors assured the family that it was typical leukemia \u2014 and curable.\n\nLike most children, Ava quickly went into remission after starting the prescribed 30 months of chemotherapy. But at home in Prescott, a small Wisconsin city at the confluence of the Mississippi and St. Croix rivers, things did not get easier for the Christiansons. In early 2013, Ava was hospitalized in Minneapolis for a lung infection. About the same time, the couple\u2019s second daughter, Audrey, was born 13 weeks premature and hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit in St. Paul. Bethany, who manages occupational therapists for a nursing-home chain, and Jay, a rural mail carrier, shuttled between the Twin Cities visiting their daughters.\n\n\u201cI would be with Ava during the day, and then when Jay got home, he would stay with Ava, and I would spend time with Audrey,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter what you do, you feel like a bad mom.\u201d\n\nA year or so after treatment began, Ava relapsed. Now she was in a much more dangerous category: children whose leukemia no longer responds to chemo. Her doctors arranged for a bone-marrow transplant, with her baby sister as the donor.\n\nThe transplant made her sick and the whole family miserable. Ava spent months in the hospital and then a year at home. Because of fears of infection, she couldn\u2019t go out much. She missed all of first grade. But her parents had hope that the transplant would keep her cancer at bay.\n\n[Brain cancer now the leading cause of cancer deaths in children]\n\nAt a six-month checkup, tests showed that the leukemia was back again. There were no more conventional treatments to try. But because of her two relapses, Ava was now eligible for a CAR T-cell trial at the University of Minnesota Masonic Children\u2019s Hospital. Her T cells would be genetically altered to go after CD19.The number of cells then would be vastly increased and reinfused.\n\nIt sounded like science fiction, but Bethany Christianson found comfort in talking to the father of Emily Whitehead. In 2012, the 6-year-old Pennsylvania girl became the first child to be treated with reprogrammed T cells for leukemia. She has been in remission ever since.\n\nAva got her treatment in April 2015 \u2014 after her cells were extracted via a tube inserted into her neck \u2014 and five days later had a massive immune reaction with a high fever and intense pain. While that is typical, some patients become dangerously ill. Yet Ava recovered fast, went into remission and attended summer school, where she learned how to make pigs-in-a-blanket and wrote her own cookbook.\n\nBy then, her parents had gotten used to living in the midst of remissions and relapses. \u201cWhen she felt better, we would do everything we could,\u201d Bethany said. They visited Robot World, a scientifically themed attraction a few hours from Prescott. \u201cYou don\u2019t put things off, because you are always thinking, \u2018What if?\u2019 \u201d\n\nLast fall, doctors delivered the bad news. Ava\u2019s cancer had changed. It was no longer producing the CD19 protein, which meant her modified T cells could no longer recognize the disease. But the leukemia was still producing another common protein, called CD22, and that offered an opportunity.\n\nAs it happened, Fry, head of the blood-cancer section in NCI\u2019s pediatric oncology branch, had already launched the world\u2019s first trial using CAR T-cell therapy to focus on CD22. It seemed an equally promising target that could broaden the therapy\u2019s impact, researchers thought. At the time, they did not realize that a significant percentage of patients in the other trials might relapse because of changes in their cancer.\n\nFry insisted as he designed the study that children be included, despite ever-present concerns about exposing them to safety risks. He wanted to avoid a delay in testing what could be a lifesaving pediatric treatment. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to take two to three years on adults, and then go back and do children,\u201d he said.\n\n[For a 6-year-old with cancer, a future staked on medicine\u2019s hottest field]\n\nThe clinical trial already has treated nearly two dozen leukemia and lymphoma patients through age 30. The majority have gone into remission, although some have had their cancer return. While it is far too early to know long-term outcomes, Fry said he is convinced the CD22 treatment holds much potential. He is planning another trial next year with the Stanford University School of Medicine. It will target both proteins \u2014 CD19 and CD22 \u2014 simultaneously.\n\nOnce Ava relapsed after the Minnesota trial, Fry\u2019s study at the NIH Clinical Center appeared to be the only option.

But some doctors believe even if that's the explanation for acupuncture's effectiveness, there's no reason not to offer it if it makes people feel better.\n\nThe new analysis examined 29 studies involving almost 18,000 adults. The researchers concluded that the needle remedy worked better than usual pain treatment and slightly better than fake acupuncture. That kind of analysis is not the strongest type of research, but the authors took extra steps including examining raw data from the original studies.\n\nThe results \"provide the most robust evidence to date that acupuncture is a reasonable referral option,\" wrote the authors, who include researchers with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and several universities in England and Germany.\n\nTheir study isn't proof, but it adds to evidence that acupuncture may benefit a range of conditions.\n\nThe new analysis was published online Monday in Archives of Internal Medicine. The federal government's National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine paid for most of the study, along with a small grant from the Samueli Institute, a non-profit group that supports research on alternative healing.\n\nAcupuncture's use has become more mainstream. The military has used it to help treat pain from war wounds, and California recently passed legislation that would include acupuncture among treatments recommended for coverage under provisions of the nation's new health care law. That law requires insurance plans to cover certain categories of benefits starting in 2014. Deciding specifics is being left up to the states.\n\nSome private insurance plans already cover acupuncture; Medicare does not.\n\nIn traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture involves inserting long, very thin needles just beneath the skin's surface at specific points on the body to control pain or stress. Several weekly sessions are usually involved, typically costing about $60 to $100 per session. Fake acupuncture studied in research sometimes also uses needles, but on different areas of the body.\n\nScientists aren't sure what biological mechanism could explain how acupuncture might relieve pain, but the authors of the new study say the results suggest there's more involved than just a placebo effect.\n\nAcupuncture skeptic Dr. Stephen Barrett said the study results are dubious. The retired psychiatrist runs Quackwatch, a Web site on medical scams, and says studies of acupuncture often involve strict research conditions that don't mirror how the procedure is used in the real world.\n\nThe new analysis combined results from studies of patients with common types of chronic pain -- recurring headaches, arthritis or back, neck and shoulder. The studies had randomly assigned patients to acupuncture and either fake acupuncture or standard pain treatment including medication or physical therapy.\n\nThe authors explained their statistical findings by using a pain scale of 0 to 100: The patients' average baseline pain measured 60; it dropped to 30 on average in those who got acupuncture, 35 in those who got fake acupuncture, and 43 in the usual treatment group.\n\nWhile the difference in results for real versus fake acupuncture was small, it suggests acupuncture could have more than a psychological effect, said lead author Andrew Vickers, a cancer researcher at Memorial Sloan-Kettering. The center offers acupuncture and other alternative therapies for cancer patients with hard-to-treat pain.\n\nThe analysis was more rigorous than most research based on pooling previous studies' results, because the authors obtained original data from each study. That makes the conclusion more robust, said Dr. Andrew Avins, author of an Archives commentary and a physician and researcher with the University of California at San Francisco and Kaiser-Permanente.\n\nAcupuncture is relatively safe and uncertainty over how it works shouldn't stop doctors from offering it as an option for patients struggling with pain, Avins said.\n\n\"Perhaps a more productive strategy at this point would be to provide whatever benefits we can for our patients, while we continue to explore more carefully all mechanisms of healing,\" he wrote.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No mongering of diseases here.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Dr. Bernat added that brain imaging promised to improve the diagnosis of unconscious states in certain patients, but that the prospect of imaging could also raise false hopes in cases like that of Terri Schiavo, the Florida woman who was removed from life support and died last year after a bitter national debate over patients\u2019 rights.\n\nMs. Schiavo suffered far more profound brain damage than the woman in the study and was unresponsive for some 15 years, according to neurologists who examined her.\n\nThe journal that published the new paper, Science, promoted the finding in a news release, but added a \u201cspecial note\u201d citing the Schiavo case and warning that the finding \u201cshould not be used to generalize about all other patients in a vegetative state, particularly since each case may involve a different type of injury.\u201d\n\nThe brain researchers, led by Adrian Owen at the Medical Research Council Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit in Cambridge, England, performed scans on the patient\u2019s brain five months after her accident. The imaging technique, called functional M.R.I., reveals changes in activity in specific brain regions. When the researchers spoke sentences to the patient, language areas in her brain spiked in the same way healthy volunteers\u2019 did.\n\nWhen presented with sentences containing ambiguous words, like \u201cThe creak came from a beam in the ceiling,\u201d additional language processing areas also became active, as in normal brains. And when the researchers asked the woman to imagine playing tennis or walking through her house, they saw peaks of activity in the premotor cortex and other areas of her brain that mimicked those of healthy volunteers.\n\n\u201cIf you put her scans together with the other 12 volunteers tested, you cannot tell which is the patient\u2019s,\u201d Dr. Owen said in an interview. Doctors from the University of Cambridge and the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium collaborated on the research.\n\nDr. Nicholas Schiff, a neuroscientist at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said that the study provided \u201cknock-down, drag-out\u201d evidence for mental awareness, but that it was not clear \u201cwhether we\u2019ll see this in one out of 100 vegetative patients, or one out of 1,000, or ever again.\u201d\n\nIn a more recent exam, more than 11 months after her injury, the patient exhibited a sign of responsiveness: she tracked with her eyes a small mirror, as it was moved slowly to her right, and could fixate on objects for more than five seconds, said Dr. Steven Laureys, a neurologist at the University of Li\u00e8ge and an author of the study. This means by definition that the young woman has transitioned from an unresponsive, vegetative state to a sometimes responsive condition known as a minimally conscious state, Dr. Laureys said in an interview. An estimated 100,000 Americans exist in this state of partial consciousness, and some of them eventually regain full awareness.\n\nThe chances that an unresponsive, brain-damaged patient will eventually emerge depend on the type of injury suffered, and on the length of time he or she has been unresponsive. Traumatic injuries to the head, often from car accidents, tend to sever brain cell connections and leave many neurons intact. About 50 percent of people with such injuries recover some awareness in the first year after the injury, studies find; very few do so afterward. By contrast, brains starved of oxygen \u2014 like that of Ms. Schiavo, whose heart stopped temporarily \u2014 often suffer a massive loss of neurons, leaving virtually nothing unharmed. Only 15 percent of people who suffer brain damage from oxygen deprivation recover some awareness within the first three months. Very few do after that, and a 1994 review of more than 700 vegetative patients found that none had done so after two years.\n\nThe imaging techniques used in the new study could help identify which patients are most likely to emerge \u2014 once the tests are studied in larger numbers of unconscious people, said Dr. Joseph Fins, chief of the medical ethics division of New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center.\n\nWithout this context, Dr. Fins said, the imaging tests could create some confusion, because like any medical tests they may occasionally go wrong, misidentifying patients as exhibiting consciousness or lacking it. \u201cFor now I think what this study does is to create another shade of gray in the understanding of gray matter,\u201d he said.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "By accurately describing the woman\u2019s mental state, the story avoids disease mongering.

Uslaner is director of In Vivo Pharmacology at Merck & Co., which funded the study.\n\nMerck already has one such drug, suvorexant, under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nMore than 30 million Americans struggle to get a good night's sleep, and about one-third of these use drugs to help the process, the study authors pointed out.\n\nBut widely prescribed sleep medications such as Ambien (zolpidem) and Lunesta (eszopiclone) can leave people feeling hung over and inattentive the next day. So much so that the FDA recently cut recommended doses of Ambien and other drugs that contain zolpidem for fear that their use, even the night before, might impair driving or other activities the next day.\n\nLunesta and Ambien affect GABA receptors, which are found throughout the brain and are associated with side effects, including thinking disturbances, and deficits in attention and memory, explained Uslaner.\n\nAbout 15 years ago, scientists discovered chemical messengers known as orexins, which are released by a relatively small brain region known as the lateral hypothalamus. This area of the brain releases orexins during the day to keep us awake and lowers levels at night so we can sleep.\n\nThe appeal of orexin antagonists, said Dr. Michael Thorpy, director of the Sleep-Wake Disorders Center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, is that they \"target a system that's more specific for sleep.\"\n\nThat means, theoretically, fewer side effects and perhaps less of a tendency to be habit forming, Thorpy explained.\n\nUslaner and his colleagues investigated a compound called DORA-22, which has the same mechanism of action as suvorexant, to see how it fared alongside not only Ambien and Lunesta but also diazepam (Valium) in rats and rhesus monkeys.\n\nDORA-22 did not lead to the same mental impairments as the other three drugs. Rhesus monkeys and rats performed just as well on memory and attention tasks shortly after being administered DORA-22 as they did on an inactive placebo.\n\nIn each case, the minimum dose to achieve sleep was compared with the minimum dose that altered memory and thinking. DORA-22 promoted sleep at lower doses than those that impaired mental skills when compared with the \"control\" drugs.\n\nThis is the first time in years that scientists have targeted a totally different receptor in the quest to combat insomnia, said Dr. Alexandre Abreu, co-director of the UHealth Sleep Center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.\n\nBut many questions remain: Do the drugs truly have fewer side effects? Will they be habit forming? And will they change the quality of sleep in any way?\n\nThose questions will only be answered with more testing and use in humans, he said.\n\nExperts note that findings from animal studies do not always hold up in human trials.\n\nThe U.S. National Institutes of Health has more on insomnia.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No overt disease mongering is seen.

In 2013, about 2.8 million TBI-related emergency department visits, hospitalizations and deaths occurred in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of these are what are called mild traumatic brain injuries, or mTBIs \u2014 head injuries that don't cause a coma. People with an mTBI typically get better within a few weeks, but for as many as 20 percent, problems can linger for months or years.\n\nMany of these patients find themselves stuck with depression, cognitive problems, headaches, fatigue and other symptoms. Known as post-concussion syndrome, this phenomenon is often difficult to treat. Antidepressants can lift moods, painkillers can ease headaches and physical therapy may ease dizziness, but most researchers agree that these remedies don't heal the injury within the brain.\n\nCould oxygen do the trick? A growing group of scientists and physicians say that hyperbaric treatment, which exposes patients to pure oxygen at higher-than-normal air pressure, may work.\n\n\"These patients don't have enough oxygen to heal the injured parts of their brains,\" said Shai Efrati, a researcher and physician at Tel Aviv University in Israel and a leading hyperbaric scientist. \"Hyperbaric treatment massively increases the amount of oxygen available to the brain.\"\n\nBut other researchers believe that the treatment has no merit and should not be recommended.\n\n\"People want to believe that hyperbaric can fix [brain injuries], and it can't,\" said David Cifu, a researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, who has spent much of his career treating veterans with brain injuries.\n\nCompressed air has been used by doctors since the 17th century. In 1917, two German inventors first used pressurized pure oxygen to treat decompression sickness, which occurs when undersea divers return to the surface too quickly. For the past 50 years, hyperbaric therapy has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for non-healing wounds, carbon monoxide poisoning, burns and decompression sickness. Over the past decade, doctors in the United States and internationally have begun using it to treat mTBIs.\n\nMTBIs include sports-related concussions and head injuries caused by traffic accidents. Also, between 2000 and 2017, 308,853 American service members suffered mild traumatic brain injuries, according to the Department of Defense.\n\nPatients with an mTBI typically experience symptoms that include headache, dizziness, fatigue, depression, anxiety and cognitive impairment. Known as post-concussion syndrome (PCS), this phenomenon is difficult to treat. Doctors use antidepressants, pain medications, biofeedback and physical therapy, but these strategies do not always work.\n\nThe nature of the human brain makes it particularly susceptible to chronic injury. The organ requires large amounts of energy under normal circumstances, and even more to heal when injured. And often, the initial trauma damages blood vessels that supply the brain with oxygen. So, just as the brain needs extra resources, it faces an energy crisis. Often, Efrati and others say, injured brain cells don't die, but may persist for years or decades, alive but hobbled. Hyperbaric therapy, he said, can return them to full function, even years after the injury.\n\n\"Oxygen is different, because it has a direct biological effect on brain tissue,\" said Paul G. Harch, a physician in New Orleans who over the past three decades has used hyperbaric oxygen to treat hundreds of people with chronic brain injury as well as stroke.\n\nPatients typically receive between 40 and 60 hour-long hyperbaric treatments spread over two to three months. During each treatment, they sit or lie inside a hyperbaric chamber, which varies in size from a person-size tube to a large room that can hold several patients. While in the chamber, patients breathe in pure oxygen, typically pressurized to about twice the density of sea-level air; in this environment, the lungs take in about 10 times as much oxygen as under normal conditions.\n\nResearchers say it remains unclear how hyperbaric oxygen affects injured brains. Efrati and others argue that it probably works through several biological pathways. The extra oxygen appears to trigger the healing of brain cells, and switches on genes specifically related to brain repair. It increases the number of stem cells that migrate to sites of brain injury, promotes the growth of new blood vessels in the brain, and boosts the activity of mitochondria, which provide energy to cells throughout the body. Scientists have linked increased mitochondrial activity to healing in many kinds of tissue.\n\nEfrati said the brain is no different from any other part of the body. Pressurized oxygen has the power to repair many kinds of tissue damage. \"A non-healing wound in the leg and a non-healing wound in the brain,\" he said, \"they are the same basic thing.\"\n\nEfrati came to the field accidentally. Eight years ago, as director of research at Assaf Harofeh Medical Center in Tel Aviv, he was asked to oversee the hospital's small hyperbaric chamber. He knew little about hyperbaric medicine and wasn't especially interested in it. But he soon noticed that pressurized oxygen seemed to have an unexpected effect. A patient had come for treatment of foot wounds that wouldn't heal \u2014 a common symptom in diabetes. The man had also suffered a traumatic brain injury several years earlier, which left him unable to speak more than a few words. The hyperbaric treatment healed his feet \u2014 and also revived his ability to speak. Other patients with wounds and brain injuries had similar surprising results. He began to examine how hyperbaric treatment affects the brain, and this work has become his focus. In 2008. Efrati founded and now directs the Sagol Center for Hyperbaric Medicine and Research at Tel Aviv University and Assaf Harofeh, where he oversees and collaborates with a range of scientists and manages a large hyperbaric treatment facility.\n\nAs the use of hyperbaric therapy for brain injury has grown, it has become increasingly controversial. Critics argue that it remains unproven and that desperate patients are wasting thousands of dollars \u2014 the treatment typically costs between $200 and $400 per session and is rarely covered by insurance \u2014 on a technique that rarely if ever helps. Between 2009 and 2015, Cifu oversaw three studies for the Department of Veterans Affairs \u2014 reportedly at a taxpayer cost of about $70 million \u2014 of about 60 active-duty service members with post-concussion syndrome. The studies found that hyperbaric treatment had little effect on their symptoms.\n\nOverall, there is relatively little research on hyperbaric treatment for brain injury, in part because pressurized oxygen can't be patented, which limits its potential profitability. \"It's very difficult to get funding for studies on this topic,\" Harch said.\n\nA few studies besides Cifu's have looked at humans. In a paper published in October, Efrati and colleagues examined 15 post-concussion syndrome patients who had received hyperbaric treatment. Using brain imaging, the scientists found that after treatment, the subjects had increased cerebral blood flow as well as more activity in brain areas that had previously been dormant. They say that this indicates that hyperbaric treatment triggered regeneration of nerve fibers and blood vessels in the brain. In addition, tests showed that the subjects had improved memory and processing speed. In another study, published in 2015, researchers gave hyperbaric oxygen to 56 patients with prolonged post-concussion syndrome. They found that many patients showed significant improvements in cognitive function and overall quality of life.\n\nWhile the research remains inconclusive, some American doctors are using oxygen to treat chronic brain injuries.\n\nZiad Mirza is one of them. For most of his career, he dispensed hyperbaric treatment for hospitals around Baltimore. Two years ago, he became chief medical officer for Hyperheal Hyperbarics, a company with three clinics in the Baltimore area. Since then, he said, he has treated about a half-dozen brain-injury patients, with mostly positive results.\n\nOne of these patients is Parisa Cook, 29, who in 2016 was found to have a tennis ball-size tumor in her brain. Surgeons removed it, but the operation was not a complete success. Cook, who lives in Baltimore, began to suffer from debilitating symptoms: She had problems with her short-term memory; she had constant headaches and couldn't concentrate; her vision became blurry and dark; and her hearing was altered, so that all sounds were jumbled and very loud. Specialists told her the operation probably had caused collateral brain trauma.\n\nOver the course of a year, she went to eight doctors and tried more than a dozen medications and a variety of other treatments. Nothing helped. A policy analyst for the Maryland Department of Health, she worried that she would have to quit her job. She began to consider suicide. \"I felt completely hopeless,\" she said.\n\nThen Cook read about hyperbaric oxygen treatment. She got in touch with Mirza and began treatments. After a single session, she said, her vision was no longer wobbly; after 20 sessions over a month, she felt \"perfect.\" \"It was a complete 180,\" she said. \"This treatment saved my life.\"\n\nCook's primary-care doctor, Sujay Pathak, an internist in Baltimore, first saw her in February. \"Her life was totally interrupted by this. She couldn't function,\" Pathak said.\n\nBut a few weeks after starting hyperbaric therapy in September, she \"got suddenly and rather miraculously better,\" Pathak said.\n\nOf course, such anecdotes are not the same as rigorous scientific research. Efrati agreed that hyperbaric treatment requires more research. \"Definitely, we need more science,\" he said. \"We have a lot to learn. But we are seeing the results with our patients. It works, again and again and again.\"\n\nHyperbaric wound treatment, often for diabetics, is booming.

Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and post-concussion syndrome (PCS) are both widely accepted and researched medical conditions.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force on Sunday issued new guidance for the use of cholesterol-busting statin drugs. The report greatly expands the universe of people who should be screened to see if they need the medication to everyone over age 40 regardless of whether they have a history of cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe recommendations also support the position of the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association, which in 2013 radically shifted their advice from suggesting that doctors focus on the level of a patient\u2019s low-density lipoproteins (LDL) or \u201cbad cholesterol\u201d to looking at a more comprehensive picture of risk based on things such as weight and blood pressure, as well as lifestyle factors.\n\n\u201cPeople with no signs, symptoms, or history of cardiovascular disease can still be at risk for having a heart attack or stroke,\u201d said Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, who chairs the task force.\n\n[Could these new cholesterol drugs save many people from heart attacks?]\n\nThe task force, which is made up of independent experts but commissioned by the government, concurred after a comprehensive review of the evidence on the topic determined that a broader evaluation of risk is needed. But it puts a greater emphasis on age than the ACC and AHA did in determining who might benefit from the medication in preventing heart attack or stroke. It is also slightly more conservative when it comes to determining the benefits of taking the medications, which include Lipitor, Crestor and Zocor.\n\nThe new guidelines, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, suggests that people ages 40 to 75 who have one or more risk factors \u2014 such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes or smoking that put them at a 10 percent or greater risk of having a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years \u2014 should be on statins. The group also said that people with a 7.5 percent to 10 percent risk \u201cmay also benefit\u201d but did not definitively recommend they take them. \u201cPeople in this group should make an individual decision with their doctor about whether to start taking statins,\u201d the task force advised.\n\nIn contrast, the ACC and AHA recommend that people with a 7.5 percent or greater risk take the drugs.\n\n[Who should take statins? A vicious debate over cholesterol drugs.]\n\nAnother important difference between the groups is that the task force withheld a recommendation about starting statins in adults who are 76 and older, saying that \u201cthe current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms.\u201d In a commentary accompanying the recommendations, Philip Greenland and Robert Bonow note that there is \u201cuncertainty and hesitation\u201d in the guidelines regarding older people but said it appears that it is not necessary to stop taking statins at age 76 if you are already on them.\n\nThe task force and AHA groups carry tremendous influence in medical practice and in what insurance companies will cover. Medicare typically follows USPSTF guidelines in determining coverage and the Affordable Care Act specifies that USPSTF recommendations rated at the strongest levels must be used as a floor for coverage for private insurers. In the case of statins, this would apply to the use of the drug by those who are 40 to 75 years old with one or more risk factors for cardiovascular disease and who have a 10 percent or greater risk \u2014 but not those with 7.5 to 10 percent risk.\n\nIndividual doctors are free to take the advice or leave it, and in recent months there has been a lot of debate about what the scientific evidence really shows regarding the therapy.\n\nThere is a consensus among experts that people at substantial risk for heart disease benefit from statins but considerable disagreement about those at lower risk. Last month, National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins wrote in the journal Lancet that \u201cit\u2019s a force for good.\u201d But Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California at San Francisco and editor of JAMA Internal Medicine, and others have been vocal about their belief that the drugs are overprescribed and that the side effects \u2014 which range from muscle pain and cataracts to possibly an increased risk for diabetes in women \u2014 should be taken more seriously.\n\nIn an opinion piece Sunday, Redberg and Mitchell Katz, deputy editor of JAMA Internal Medicine, advised everyone to take \u201ca step back\u201d and ask \u201cwhy this debate is so contentious.\u201d They suggest that the estimates of the benefits of statins may be inflated, that the drugs as an intervention are \u201cweak,\u201d and that the reports of adverse events are incomplete.\n\n\u201cIn deciding on any therapy, it is important to understand the risks and benefits, particularly for healthy people,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe two U.S. guidelines are notably more aggressive in recommending drugs than reports issued by their counterparts in other parts of the world, including the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (which recommends statins in men 40 and older but only after age 50 in women, and the U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which recommends discussing lifestyle modification before offering statin therapy). The European Society of Cardiology focuses more on managing LDL.\n\nStatins are among the best-selling drugs in the United States, with a 2011 study showing at least 32 million Americans were taking them. The 2013 ACC and AHA guidelines recommend an estimated 24 million more people should be on them.\n\nThe task force\u2019s recommendations come on the heels of an important new study, published Saturday, that shows that people who use statins survive heart attacks better than those who do not.

The reduction is real and ranges from 30 to 70 percent.\"\n\nThe researchers thought metformin's possible cancer-lowering properties suggested the need for clinical trials to investigate whether the drug might help prevent tumors in smokers at high risk of developing cancer. Others believed that the finding might influence the choice of drugs in people with diabetes.\n\n\"All other things being equal, many diabetics face a choice of oral agents, and early evidence that metformin may have an effect on the oncology side may increasingly play a role in decision-making,\" said Dr. Michael Pollack, professor of medicine and oncology at McGill University in Montreal. \"We can't ignore this, but we can't say we have FDA [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] approval for metformin for cancer indications.\"\n\nMetformin was developed from the French lilac plant, known in the Middle Ages to control excess urination, a symptom of uncontrolled diabetes.

There are at least six distinct HCV genotypes, or strains, which are genetically distinct groups of the virus. Knowing the genotype helps inform treatment recommendations and the duration of treatment. Approximately 75 percent of Americans with HCV have genotype 1; 20-25 percent have genotypes 2 or 3; and a small numbers of patients are infected with genotypes 4, 5 or 6. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, HCV infection becomes chronic in approximately 75 to 85 percent of cases. Patients who suffer from chronic HCV infection over many years may have complications, such as bleeding, jaundice (yellowish eyes or skin), fluid accumulation in the abdomen, infections, liver cancer and death.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Epclusa for 12 weeks was evaluated in three Phase III clinical trials of 1,558 subjects without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis (mild cirrhosis). Results demonstrated that 95\u201399 percent of patients who received Epclusa had no virus detected in the blood 12 weeks after finishing treatment, suggesting the patients\u2019 infections had been cured. The safety and efficacy of Epclusa was also evaluated in a clinical trial of 267 subjects with decompensated cirrhosis (moderate to severe cirrhosis), of whom 87 subjects received Epclusa in combination with ribavirin for 12 weeks, and 94 percent of these patients had no virus detected in the blood 12 weeks after finishing treatment.\n\nThe most common side effects of Epclusa include headache and fatigue. Epclusa and ribavirin combination regimens are contraindicated for patients for whom ribavirin is contraindicated.\n\nEpclusa carries a warning for patients and health care providers that serious slowing of the heart rate (symptomatic bradycardia) and cases requiring pacemaker intervention have been reported when amiodarone is used with sofosbuvir in combination with another HCV direct-acting antiviral. Co-administration of amiodarone with Epclusa is not recommended. Epclusa also carries a warning not to use with certain drugs that may reduce the amount of Epclusa in the blood which could lead to reduced efficacy of Epclusa.\n\nEpclusa was reviewed under the FDA\u2019s priority review program, which provides for an expedited review of drugs that treat serious conditions and, if approved, would provide significant improvement in safety or effectiveness.\n\nEpclusa is manufactured and marketed by Gilead Sciences, Inc., of Foster City, California.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

Now, 22 years later, a drug that tries to compensate for the genetic defect might be nearing the market.\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals announced Wednesday morning that the drug, VX-770, improved lung function in people with cystic fibrosis in a late-stage clinical trial. The drug also reduced the frequency of disease exacerbations that required treatment with antibiotics.\n\nThe caveat is that VX-770 is designed to counter one specific genetic mutation that accounts for about 4 percent of cases of cystic fibrosis. Vertex is working on another drug for the most common mutation, but that one is further behind in development.\n\nStill, the news is expected to be greeted favorably by doctors and patients and by Wall Street.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing clinical trials for 30 years in C.F. and these are amazing results,\u2019\u2019 Dr. Bonnie W. Ramsey, a lead investigator in the trial, said in an interview.\n\nDr. Ramsey, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington, was briefed on the results by Vertex.\n\nThe results were announced by a press release and have not been peer reviewed by experts.\n\nAbout 30,000 Americans and 70,000 people worldwide have cystic fibrosis, a disease caused by defects in a gene responsible for the transport of chloride ions across cell membranes. People with the disease tend to have very thick mucus in their lungs, which leads to infections and lung damage. Many do not live past age 40.\n\nTwo inhaled antibiotics and one drug that loosens mucus are approved to treat cystic fibrosis, but nothing that directly improves chloride ion transport.\n\n \n\n In the trial, those who received VX-770 gained 10.6 percentage points more on a lung function test after 24 weeks than those getting a placebo, a difference that statistically was highly significant. Patients continued to take either drug or placebo for another 24 weeks and the improvement was sustained. Lung function, the primary endpoint of the trial, was measured by how much a person could exhale in one second, a standard test.\n\nInvestors had been expecting around a 5 percentage point improvement. In a note to clients Tuesday evening, before the results were known, an analyst at ISI Group, Mark Schoenebaum, said that an improvement of 10 percent would be a \u201chome run\u2019\u2019 that could lead to $600 million in annual sales for the drug.\n\nDr. Ramsey, who has received research grants from Vertex, said that some patients could perceive a 10 percentage point change in lung function. She said other results of the trial were encouraging.\n\nThese included fewer exacerbations of the disease in those who got the drug, fewer self-reported respiratory symptoms, and a gain in weight, which is good for people with cystic fibrosis, who often have digestive problems. The saltiness of their sweat \u2014 a measure used to diagnose the disease \u2014 was markedly reduced, suggesting that the drug was having an effect on chloride ion transport.\n\nThe trial involved 161 people age 12 and older, all with at least one copy of the particular mutation, known as G551D. The main side effects, Vertex said, were headache, upper respiratory tract infections, nasal congestion, rash and dizziness.\n\nVertex said it hoped to apply in the second half of the year for approval of VX-770 in the United States and Europe. The company is awaiting results of a second trial of the drug, this one in younger children.\n\nVertex has not said how much it will charge for VX-770. But since there are only about 1,200 Americans who are candidates for the drug, the price is likely to be tens of thousands of dollars a year.\n\nVertex, based in Cambridge, Mass., was founded in 1989, coincidentally the same year the cystic fibrosis gene was discovered. It has not yet had a big commercial success and had a $2.5 billion net loss in the last five years.\n\nThe company is hoping that by late May it will win approval to sell a new type of drug for hepatitis C, which analysts expect will be a blockbuster.\n\nThe long time needed to develop a drug for cystic fibrosis is a lesson for those expecting a quick payout from the sequencing of the human genome, which was completed a decade ago. It is not enough to know the gene behind a disease. It can take years of research to determine how a mutation actually causes a disease and then to design a drug that corrects the problem.\n\nVertex received $75 million in financial support from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, one of the first nonprofit disease groups to give money to companies.\n\n\u201cThese results are highly encouraging,\u2019\u2019 Robert J.

Insulin is the hormone that manages glucose, the blood sugar that reaches unhealthy levels in diabetes.\n\nOf course, there's a catch.\n\n\"You probably have to eat a lot of cocoa, and you probably don't want it to have a lot of sugar in it,\" said study author Jeffery Tessem, assistant professor of nutrition, dietetics and food science at BYU. \"It's the compound in cocoa you're after.\"\n\nWhen a person has diabetes, their body either doesn't produce enough insulin or doesn't process blood sugar properly. At the root of that is the failure of beta cells, whose job it is to produce insulin. The new study, published in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, finds beta cells work better and remain stronger with an increased presence of epicatechin monomers, compounds found naturally in cocoa.\n\nTo discover this, collaborators at Virginia Tech first fed the cocoa compound to animals on a high-fat diet. They found that by adding it to the high-fat diet, the compound would decrease the level of obesity in the animals and would increase their ability to deal with increased blood glucose levels.\n\nThe BYU team, comprised of graduate and undergraduate students in Tessem's lab and the labs of Ben Bikman and Jason Hansen (BYU professors of physiology and developmental biology), then dove in and dissected what was happening on the cellular level -- specifically, the beta cell level. That's when they learned cocoa compounds named epicatechin monomers enhanced beta cells' ability to secrete insulin.\n\n\"What happens is it's protecting the cells, it's increasing their ability to deal with oxidative stress,\" Tessem said. \"The epicatechin monomers are making the mitochondria in the beta cells stronger, which produces more ATP (a cell's energy source), which then results in more insulin being released.\"\n\nWhile there has been a lot of research on similar compounds over the past decade, no one has been able to pinpoint which ones are the most beneficial or how exactly they bring about any benefit -- until now. This research shows the epicatechin monomers, the smallest of the compounds, are the most effective.\n\n\"These results will help us get closer to using these compounds more effectively in foods or supplements to maintain normal blood glucose control and potentially even delay or prevent the onset of type-2 diabetes,\" said study co-author Andrew Neilson, assistant professor of food science at Virginia Tech.\n\nBut rather than stocking up on the sugar-rich chocolate bars at the checkout line, researchers believe the starting point is to look for ways to take the compound out of cocoa, make more of it and then use it as a potential treatment for current diabetes patients.

A new study, 'Fresh Pear Consumption is Associated with Better Nutrient Intake, Diet Quality, and Weight Parameters in Adults: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001-2010,' published in Nutrition and Food Science, revealed new information regarding the health benefits of pear consumption.1 Of particular interest given the high rates of obesity in the United States, the study found that adult pear consumers had a lower body weight than non-pear consumers and they were 35 percent less likely to be obese.\n\nThe epidemiologic study, led by Carol O'Neil of the Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, used a nationally representative analytic sample to examine the association of fresh pear consumption with nutrient intake, nutrient adequacy, diet quality, and cardiovascular risk factors in adults.\n\n\"The association between pears and lower body weight is very exciting,\" said Dr. Carol O'Neil. \"We believe fiber intake may have driven the lower body weights that were seen in this study because there was no difference in energy intake or level of physical activity found between the fresh pear consumers and non-consumers.\"\n\nIn addition to discovering a correlation between fresh pear consumers and lower body weight, the study found that pear consumption was associated with higher diet quality (as defined by the Healthy Eating Index). Moreover, the consumption of one medium fresh pear per day had a positive effect on nutrient intake since consumers had higher usual intakes of dietary fiber, vitamin C, magnesium, copper, and potassium, and higher mean intakes of total sugars; consumers of fresh pears also had lower intakes of total, monounsaturated fatty acids, saturated fatty acids, and added sugars.\n\nPears are an excellent source of fiber and a good source of vitamin C. One medium pear provides about 24 percent of daily fiber needs for only 100 calories. They are sodium-free, cholesterol-free, fat-free and contain 190 mg of potassium. The USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans state that people who eat more fruit as part of an overall healthy diet are likely to reduce their risk of some chronic diseases, although little is published on the health outcomes associated with individual fruits, including pears.\n\nThe USA Pear Bureau continues to collaborate with researchers to commission additional studies that show the relationship between pears and positive health outcomes. Visit http://www. for additional pear research, nutrition resources and recipes.\n\nThe Pear Bureau Northwest was established in 1931 as a nonprofit marketing organization to promote the fresh pears grown in Oregon and Washington. Today, the United States is the third largest pear-producing country in the world, and Oregon and Washington comprise the nation's largest pear growing region with 1,600 growers producing 84% of all fresh pears grown in the United States. Pears grown in these two Pacific Northwest states are distributed under the \"USA Pears\" brand. Pears are an excellent source of fiber (24% DV) and a good source of vitamin C (10% DV) for only 100 calories per medium sized pear.

Surgery, radiation, or some combination of both may lead to miserable side effects such incontinence, impotence and rectal damage. Doctors usually can\u2019t predict whether a man will suffer all or none of those side effects. While some risk factors are well-known -- including age, diabetes and poor cardiovascular health -- whether a man suffers harsh side-effects is often chalked up to random luck.\n\nSo what if it were possible to know before treatment which men might be more likely to suffer complications?\n\nNew research, published Thursday in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology, discovered a set of genetic markers that appear to indicate a significantly greater risk of collateral damage from radiation treatment for prostate cancer. Knowing a man\u2019s susceptibility to fallout from radiation may steer a doctor toward surgery instead of other potentially damaging therapy.\n\n\u201cMore often than not, it\u2019s not clear-cut which way to go,\u201d explained Barry Rosenstein, professor of radiation oncology at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. \u201cIf you see a surgeon, he\u2019s likely to say surgery is best. If you see a radiation oncologist he\u2019ll say oncology.\u201d\n\nDetermining what type of treatment a man should receive is only part of the dilemma of prostate cancer. The debate whether to even test for it is ongoing. This early-stage study represents a big step toward doctors and their patients making that decision.\n\nThe researchers started with a pool of 841 men treated with radiation for prostate cancer. Patients were assessed every three to six months for signs of sexual dysfunction for up to five years. The number of men studied was eventually winnowed down to 260 patients with erectile dysfunction and 205 controls.\n\nThe scientists then performed DNA analyses on the men, looking for genetic variations called single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs (pronounced snips), slight differences in the \u201cspelling\u201d of our DNA. After sifting through hundreds of thousands of SNPs, they settled on 12 suspect genetic variations.\n\nIt turned out that when the SNPs were combined to create a score that could be used to measure individual risk of treatment complications, having just one of the 12 SNPs more than doubled the risk. The more of the 12 a man had, the greater his chances of radiation therapy complications.\n\n\u201cIt is cumulative,\u201d Rosenstein explained. \u201cIf a man has five or six, it increases his chances quite a bit.\u201d\n\nThe research is still in the early stages, so doctors aren\u2019t likely to be using the genetic markers to determine treatment any time soon. \u201cThis is still not nearly good enough, yet\u201d he said.\n\nBut he\u2019s part of an international consortium that is trying to make that very scenario a practical reality. The next step, he said, is for group members to validate the predictive power of the markers his team found.\n\nIf they can, then doctors really will be \u201cable to assign patients to treatments and see if we maintain the same level of control of cancer and lower the incidence of complications,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if we can do that, then there\u2019ll be enough confidence to put it into use in the clinic.\u201d\n\nEven better, he suggested, it may one day be possible to use drugs to target the SNiPs, or the biological processes they influence, as a way to prevent damage from therapy.\n\nThat hope is evident to other researchers, such as Dr. Ithaar Derweesh, a urologic oncologist and associate professor of surgery at the University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center.\n\n\"This is a study that in certain ways is groundbreaking and also elegantly performed,\" Derweesh said.\n\nWhile Derweesh agreed with Rosenstein that such a technique will take time to validate, and be used to steer patients toward a particular therapy -- something he called the \"holy grail\" -- he suggested that in the nearer term, such markers might be used as a trigger to pre-emptively begin erectile rehabilitation or to take measures that might lessen the potential damage.\n\nThis kind of work is important not just for prostate cancer, but all cancers. While there has been greater success in treating cancer, survivors may live many years with side effects after treatment. If Rosenstein\u2019s hopes are fulfilled, it may one day be possible to prevent some of the damage before it\u2019s done, and still effectively treat the cancer.\n\nBrian Alexander (www.BrianRAlexander.com) is co-author, with Larry Young Ph.D., of \"The Chemistry Between Us: Love, Sex and the Science of Attraction,\" (www.TheChemistryBetweenUs.com), now on sale.\n\u2022 Pregnant women with cancer on the rise.

These three drugs share a common property: They block the action of a pro-inflammatory substance called tumor necrosis factor. Secreted by various immune cells, TNF stimulates the immune response and accompanying inflammation.\n\nHowever, despite the availability of TNF inhibitors, \u201conly about half of psoriatic arthritis patients who are given TNF inhibitors get better,\u201d said Genovese.\n\nAlthough the ultimate cause of the disease remains unknown, there was a good clinical rationale for hoping it might be responsive to ixekizumab. For the last decade or so, Genovese said, another pro-inflammatory substance called IL-17 has been drawing the attention of immunologists focusing on psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.\n\nIxekizumab works by blocking IL-17. The drug, an injectable monoclonal antibody, is already commercially available for the treatment of psoriasis, for which it has been remarkably effective, said Genovese. And in an earlier Lilly-sponsored phase-3 trial, ixekizumab was shown to be effective for psoriatic arthritis patients who had not yet been treated with biologic drugs such as TNF inhibitors. (Another approved monoclonal-antibody that targets IL-17, secukinumab, was approved in 2016 for psoriatic arthritis.)\n\nOver the 24-week duration of the latest trial, 109 participants received ixekizumab every two weeks; 94 received placebo injections every two weeks; and 111 alternated every two weeks between getting injections of ixekizumab and the placebo.

Although it's not a comprehensive evaluation and could give some consumers a false sense of security, the test does provide a starting point while drawing attention to male infertility as a legitimate health concern.\n\n\"It may provide (an opportunity for) both physicians and couples to take a closer look at ways for men to step up to the plate and optimize their reproductive potential,\" said Dr. Robert Brannigan, urologist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. \"I think anything that highlights the fact that men can have issues, that men do play a role in infertility, is important.\"\n\nApproximately 15 percent of U.S. couples of reproductive age who are trying to conceive face infertility issues, said Brannigan, an expert in male fertility.\n\nMale infertility contributes to 50 percent of those cases, he said. Male infertility alone is the cause 30 percent of the time; a combination of male and female factors account for the other 20 percent.\n\nSpermCheck Fertility is designed to help couples determine more quickly whether male infertility might be a problem for them, said Ray Lopez, CEO of SpermCheck, based in Charlottesville, Va. Many men put off having a semen analysis because they don't want to provide a sample in a doctor's office or lab, he said.\n\n\"No one wants to go through the embarrassment of jumping in that room and looking at dirty magazines,\" Lopez said.\n\nGiving men the opportunity to take a test in the privacy of their home helps get the process moving, he said.\n\nMen tend to think they're perfectly healthy, especially when it comes to their sexuality, APA's Imler said. This test, which is noninvasive, could be wake-up call for some.\n\n\"If there is a problem with him, it's identified a little quicker,\" Imler said. \"We love the idea of avoiding that heartache of that month to month struggle of trying to conceive without success.\"\n\nSpermCheck Fertility is the only FDA-approved home sperm test currently on the market and available in retail stores, Lopez said. The test costs about $40; the average cost of a semen analysis in a doctor's office is about $100.\n\nAt-home sperm tests are a fairly new idea, Imler said, but SpermCheck Fertility is not the first one. Four years ago an FDA-approved home test called Fertell, which is no longer for sale, offered an evaluation of both male and female fertility.\n\nThere are also several at-home sperm analysis kits available online. They each include a microscope and cost at least $80.\n\nAlthough it's not the first ever at-home test, SpermCheck Fertility is the first one to use the lateral flow assay method, Lopez said. When the semen sample is applied to the test strip, the liquid works its way up the paper until it reaches the results window.\n\n\"It's very, very similar to a pregnancy test,\" Lopez said. \"The concept behind our test is to keep it simple, user friendly.\"\n\nFor Brittany Scott, a Cortland resident whose husband took the SpermCheck Fertility test, however, it seemed a little more complicated than a pregnancy test. Scott said she was surprised by the number of steps involved, although none were very difficult.\n\nScott, a \"mommy blogger\" who requested and received a free test to review, said she wanted her husband to take the test to see if a recent vasectomy had worked. The result showed that the father of four's sperm count was below the test's threshold.\n\n\"It was blatantly negative. I was really glad that the test was not ambiguous at all,\" she said. \"There was no line I could mistake.\"\n\nScott said she wished the test had been available when the couple was struggling to conceive their first child. After about 11 months of trying, she had pushed her husband to get a semen analysis from a doctor.\n\n\"If this test had been around back then, he would have definitely been more willing to do it\" than the semen analysis, she said.\n\nSpermCheck Fertility tests were created after a scientist at the University of Virginia discovered a specific protein found only in the head of sperm, Lopez said. By detecting that protein, the test indicates whether or not a semen sample contains 20 million sperm per milliliter.\n\nAbout 90 percent of fertile men have sperm counts above that concentration, according to the SpermCheck Fertility instructions.\n\nBut there is not a strict cutoff point between normal or abnormal, Brannigan said. Some men might be considered in the infertile range and have no problem impregnating a woman. And others have sperm counts that seem fine, but they have difficulty.\n\n\"If his sperm concentration is indeed greater than 20 million, that's very encouraging,\" Brannigan said. \"But it's by no means a definitive marker of proven fertility because there is a significant overlap between fertile and infertile men.\"\n\nAs stated in the SpermCheck Fertility instructions, sperm count is not the only factor that contributes to male fertility. The test is not intended to be a complete semen analysis or an overall indicator of a man's fertility, Lopez said.\n\nThe male reproductive system should not be oversimplified, Brannigan said. There are several characteristics of sperm alone \u2014 at least three that aren't addressed by SpermCheck \u2014 that affect male fertility. In addition, hormones and the delivery of the sperm play a part.\n\n\"There are a number of components that lead to a man having normal fertility potential,\" Brannigan said. \"It's a complicated picture.\"", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There is no disease mongering in the story.

The study, in the Annals of Internal Medicine, argues that current medical guidelines haven't adequately considered the risks from these widely used drugs.\n\n\"Some harms are mentioned, but it's entirely unclear how they were considered when coming up with the recommendations,\" says Milo Puhan, a physician and epidemiologist at the University of Zurich and senior author of the new study. \"In our approach we very explicitly considered the harms.\"\n\nIt's important to note that statin drugs are generally safe, and harms are uncommon. On the other hand, the benefits aren't that great, either. Anywhere from 50 to 200 healthy people need to take a statin daily to prevent a single heart attack for five years, so even small harms may outweigh the potential benefits, the Swiss scientists say.\n\nThe most common side effect of these drugs is muscle pain, which usually goes away if patients stop taking the medicines. People taking statins are also at a higher risk of developing diabetes, which is harder to reverse.\n\nPuhan also found that some statins were more effective than others, with atorvastatin (the generic name for Lipitor) being the best of the bunch. He notes that physician guidelines don't generally compare the relative value of these drugs, which are all available as inexpensive generics.\n\nHe also finds that benefits fade compared with harms as people get older. \"The elderly do not benefit as much as previous studies might have thought,\" he says.\n\n\"One size doesn't fit it all,\" he concludes. \"That's a very important message.\"\n\nPuhan says, based on his assessment, perhaps 15 to 20 percent of older adults should be taking statins \u2013 far less than the 30 or 40 percent suggested by current medical guidelines.\n\n\"I think for me, as a physician,\" says Ilana Richman, an internist at the Yale School of Medicine, \"this kind of data suggests that if we give more weight to the potential for adverse events, then maybe it's reasonable to hold off for lower-risk patients.\"\n\nShe co-wrote an editorial about the paper and came away from it thinking that doctors need to spend more time talking about the plusses and minuses of statin treatment, personalizing their recommendations more than they do now. She says it's a challenge to convey these sophisticated concepts in the short amount of time doctors have to spend with their patients.\n\nYet that kind of dialog is increasingly the expectation. In mid-November, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology published new guidelines calling for more nuanced conversations around who would most benefit from statins.\n\nScott Grundy, a physician at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center who chaired the guidelines committee, says the new recommendations urge people in this gray area to get a special kind of CT scan that looks for calcium deposits in heart arteries, a signal for clogs that could cause trouble.\n\n\"If you have no coronary calcium, then your chances of having a heart attack over the next 10 years are very low,\" he says.\n\nAnd it turns out that perhaps 40 percent of people who are identified as candidates based on their risk factors such as cholesterol levels and age actually have clear heart arteries, Grundy says. \"That means a lot of people are going to be treated unnecessarily if they don't have the calcium scan.\"\n\nBut that test, which Grundy says is available for about $100, is controversial among some physicians. They worry that it will trigger overtreatment of conditions that the scan will pick up, but which don't require urgent attention.\n\nAnd it is only useful as a screening test for people who haven't had heart disease. Statins are routinely prescribed for people who have already had a heart attack or stroke. For those patients (who weren't included in the Swiss analysis), the benefits are so clear \"it's almost mandatory to be on a statin drug,\" Grundy says.\n\nHe disagrees with a lot of the particulars in the Swiss study. So does cardiologist Roger Blumenthal, who heads the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at Johns Hopkins. \"The harms [analyzed in the paper] can be dealt with by a smart clinician,\" he says.\n\nYet both the new guidelines and the latest study agree on an important point: Doctors and patients should spend more time reviewing the benefits and risks of statins, with attention paid to each person's particular circumstances.\n\nYou can contact NPR science correspondent Richard Harris at rharris@npr.org.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There is no disease-mongering here.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "As Alzheimer\u2019s disease progresses, cognitive impairment can take an ever greater toll on communication and relationships. A new study identifies patterns of communication that can help couples affected by Alzheimer\u2019s maintain a sense of connection, which could improve quality of life for both partners.\n\nPrevious research on communication in couples affected by Alzheimer\u2019s has tended to focus on deficits, said study author Christine Williams, professor and director of the PhD in Nursing program at Florida Atlantic University\u2019s Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing. Identifying patterns that help couples maintain their bond could make it easier for caregiving spouses to find meaning and improve satisfaction with their marriage.\n\n\u201cNo one is looking at it from the perspective of what these couples are doing right, what is helping,\u201d said Williams, whose findings were published in the International Journal for Human Caring. \u201cSome past research has involved a caregiver giving directions and seeing if his or her spouse [with Alzheimer\u2019s] can follow. A relationship is obviously so much more than that.\u201d\n\nMembers of Williams\u2019s research team visited 15 couples in their home once a week for 10 weeks. The couples, who were recruited from a day program for people with memory disorders and their spouses, were receiving coaching in communication, with caregivers learning to listen, to avoid arguing, to not treat their spouse like a child. Twice during the 10 weeks, the couples were asked to discuss a topic of their choosing while the researcher left the room. A total of thirty 10-minute conversations were recorded.\n\nIn analyzing the recordings, Williams identified 10 communication patterns that caregiving spouses used to connect with their partners and show affection. These patterns showed the caregivers applying what they\u2019d learned through coaching in creative ways, she said. They included sharing news about friends or relatives or plans for the day as a way to involve their spouse in day-to-day events; waiting patiently and keeping eye contact while spouses searched for words; and finding alternate ways to communicate \u2014 for example, singing songs together when attempts to engage the spouse in certain topics failed.\n\nThe caregiving spouses seemed to value their partners\u2019 efforts to communicate as much as or more than the actual content of their conversations. They were willing to listen to stories they had heard before, and resisted correcting their partners\u2019 versions of past events. This showed that they \u201cvalue the relationship more than being right,\u201d Williams said.\n\nSome of the caregivers did voice frustration or tried to teach their partners information they had forgotten. Future research might focus on interventions that could help diffuse these frustrations, the paper noted. Yet Williams hopes that the more supportive and positive communication patterns that many of the caregivers showed will help nurses coach spouses and family members affected by Alzheimer\u2019s. Previous research has found that communication decline among people with dementia is a significant source of stress to caregivers, and most say they need education about communication.\n\n\u201cThe reality is, a person with dementia isn\u2019t going to have a dramatic breakthrough and remember things forgotten,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAt the same time, people with Alzheimer\u2019s do have moments of clarity or show affection when it\u2019s unexpected.

Among children taking cannabidiol, the decrease in the frequency of convulsive seizures -- which involve a loss of consciousness, stiffened muscles and jerking movements -- was 23 percentage points greater than the decrease in seizures among children taking a placebo.\n\nThe study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human trial, which is considered the gold standard test for any new medicine.\n\nGW Pharmaceuticals, a company that is developing cannabidiol medicines, helped subsidize the study.\n\n\"After 3,800 years of cannabis use for epilepsy ... we finally have solid evidence,\" said Dr. Orrin Devinsky, lead author of the study and director of NYU Langone's Comprehensive Epilepsy Center. His own previous research indicates that cannabis was used as early as 1800 B.C. in Sumeria to treat epilepsy; neurologists of the Victorian period used Indian hemp, which is rich in cannabidiol, for the same purpose.\n\nDespite the generally positive results, most study participants reported side effects that included vomiting, fatigue, diarrhea and some liver issues.\n\nA total of 120 patients with Dravet syndrome, ranging in age from nearly 2 to 18 years old, were randomly assigned to receive either an oral solution of cannabidiol or a placebo for a 14-week period.\n\n\"Dravet syndrome is a severe childhood-onset epilepsy that causes multiple kinds of seizures, developmental delays, speech and language problems, behavioral issues and movement and balance problems,\" said Brandy Fureman, vice president of research and new therapies at the Epilepsy Foundation. She was not involved in the new study.\n\nEpilepsy is a neurological disorder that disrupts electrical communication between neurons in the brain. Considered a spectrum disorder, different epilepsy syndromes are defined by clusters of symptoms or features and treated accordingly.\n\nExisting epilepsy medications usually don't work for patients with Dravet, so \"up to 20% of these children die from seizures before age 20 years,\" Devinsky explained.\n\nWithin the study, individual participants experienced convulsive seizures at a rate ranging from four per month, on average, to 1,717 per month.\n\nDuring the 14-week study, frequency of convulsive seizures decreased from an average of 12.4 to 5.9 per month in the cannabidiol group, compared with 14.9 to 14.1 in the placebo group. On average, the change in seizure frequency amounted to a 39% decrease for the cannabidiol group patients, compared with a roughly 13% decrease among the placebo group.\n\nFive percent of the children became entirely seizure-free during the 14-week study. Overall, parents in the cannabidiol group felt that they witnessed \"significantly greater\" positive changes in their children than parents in the placebo group.\n\nHowever, there was a downside. Most (93%) of the cannabidiol patients reported side effects, though three-quarters of the placebo group patients did as well. Nine out of 61 cannabidiol group patients dropped out of the study, eight of them because of side effects, compared with just three of the 59 placebo group patients.\n\n\"Tiredness (somnolence or fatigue) was most common; others were decreased appetite, diarrhea and vomiting,\" Devinsky explained.\n\nBased on the overall results, Devinsky believes CBD should be evaluated for epilepsy types beyond Dravet syndrome, which is caused by a genetic mutation and affects about one in 20,000 to 40,000 children in the United States.\n\n\"No one study decides an issue; the sample size is still relatively small (because this is a rare syndrome and so hard to study large numbers of cases) and the duration of treatment so far has been relatively short,\" Hall, who was not involved in the research, wrote in an email.\n\nStill, Hall said the research, which carefully measured safety and efficacy for a \"substantial\" number of children, showed \"clear evidence of benefits in reducing seizure frequency and severity over the duration of the trial.\"\n\n\"Interestingly, it looks similar to our other seizure medications in terms of efficacy and tolerability,\" Porter said. \"So, sadly, not a home run for most patients but another tool in our treatment regimen.\"\n\nThe marijuana plant is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. Scientific researchers studying cannabidiol must meet federal security requirements and follow federal practices. Some scientists have said these federal requirements have slowed research supporting medicinal benefits of the plant.\n\nPorter believes the study may open the door to having \"more thoughtful discussions with our patients about the efficacy and the side effects\" of cannabidiol. \"Hopefully, the FDA will see this as a sign it should be moved off of Schedule I. If it stays on Schedule I, we will have trouble getting it to our patients when it does become available.\"\n\nChanging the schedule of a drug falls to the Drug Enforcement Administration or the Department of Health and Human Services. An interested party, such as a drug company, may also petition for the process to begin. The Food and Drug Administration and the National Institute of Drug Abuse provide guidance to the DEA when reviewing scientific evidence on which to base a schedule change.\n\nHe noted that generating more evidence of effective use is \"a good thing.\"\n\nThe University of Queensland's Hall believes that boundaries between medical use of cannabinoids and the recreational use of cannabis by adults should not be blurred. \"If future clinical trials confirm these promising results, then appropriate regulation will enable the drug to be safely used for medical purposes,\" he said.\n\nThe Epilepsy Foundation's Fureman said, \"before publication of this trial, much of the clinical evidence about CBD's effects on people's seizures was uncontrolled and anecdotal.\" She added that the new study is \"critically important\" for the epilepsy community, which believes a CBD-based medical product would be a first-in-class therapeutic option.\n\nOn the need for more scientific research, all these experts agree.\n\nAs Devinsky said, \"natural substances are not necessarily safe and effective.

A pharmaceutical company is unlikely to fund a study that doesn\u2019t involve a drug, and in any event, the research requires a large group of volunteers tracked over a very long time.\n\nThe subjects must provide health measurements at the outset, learn the proper poses, continue to do them regularly for years and be regularly evaluated.\n\nNo one knows these challenges better than Dr. Loren M. Fishman, a physiatrist at Columbia University who specializes in rehabilitative medicine. For years, he has been gathering evidence on yoga and bone health, hoping to determine whether yoga might be an effective therapy for osteoporosis.\n\nThe idea is not widely accepted in the medical community, but then, researchers know comparatively little about complementary medicine in general. So in 2005, Dr. Fishman began a small pilot study of yoga moves that turned up some encouraging results. Eleven practitioners had increased bone density in their spine and hips, he reported in 2009, compared with seven controls who did not practice yoga.\n\nKnowing that more than 700,000 spinal fractures and more than 300,000 hip fractures occur annually in the United States, Dr. Fishman hoped that similar findings from a much larger study might convince doctors that this low-cost and less dangerous alternative to bone-loss drugs is worth pursuing.\n\nThose medications can produce adverse side effects like gastrointestinal distress and fractures of the femur. Indeed, a recent study published in Clinical Interventions in Aging found that among 126,188 women found to have osteoporosis, all of whom had Medicare Part D drug coverage, only 28 percent started bone drug therapy within a year of diagnosis.\n\nMany of those who avoided drugs were trying to avoid gastrointestinal problems.\n\nOn the other hand, yoga\u2019s \u201cside effects,\u201d Dr. Fishman and colleagues wrote recently, \u201cinclude better posture, improved balance, enhanced coordination, greater range of motion, higher strength, reduced levels of anxiety and better gait.\u201d\n\nWeight-bearing activity is often recommended to patients with bone loss, and Dr. Fishman argues that certain yoga positions fit the bill.\n\n\u201cYoga puts more pressure on bone than gravity does,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cBy opposing one group of muscles against another, it stimulates osteocytes, the bone-making cells.\u201d\n\nMost experts argue that it\u2019s difficult, perhaps impossible, for adults to gain significant bone mass. Undeterred, Dr. Fishman invested a chunk of his own money and with three collaborators \u2014 Yi-Hsueh Lu of The Rockefeller University, Bernard Rosner of Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, and Dr. Gregory Chang of New York University \u2014 solicited volunteers worldwide via the Internet for a follow-up to his small pilot study.\n\nOf the 741 people who joined his experiment from 2005 to 2015, 227 (202 of them women) followed through with doing the 12 assigned yoga poses daily or at least every other day. The average age of the 227 participants upon joining the study was 68, and 83 percent had osteoporosis or its precursor, osteopenia.\n\nThe 12 poses, by their English names, were tree, triangle, warrior II, side-angle, twisted triangle, locust, bridge, supine hand-to-foot I, supine hand-to-foot II, straight-legged twist, bent-knee twist and corpse pose. Each pose was held for 30 seconds. The daily regimen, once learned, took 12 minutes to complete.\n\nThe researchers collected data at the start of the study on the participants\u2019 bone density measurements, blood and urine chemistry and X-rays of their spines and hips. They were each given a DVD of the 12 yoga poses used in the pilot study and an online program in which to record what they did and how often.\n\nA decade after the start of the study, bone density measurements were again taken and emailed to the researchers; many participants also had repeat X-rays done. The findings, as reported last month in Topics of Geriatric Rehabilitation, showed improved bone density in the spine and femur of the 227 participants who were moderately or fully compliant with the assigned yoga exercises.\n\nImprovements were seen in bone density in the hip as well, but they were not statistically significant.\n\nBefore the study, the participants had had 109 fractures, reported by them or found on X-rays.\n\nAt the time the study was submitted for publication, \u201cwith more than 90,000 hours of yoga practiced largely by people with osteoporosis or osteopenia, there have been no reported or X-ray detected fractures or serious injuries of any kind related to the practice of yoga in any of the 741 participants,\u201d Dr. Fishman and his colleagues wrote.\n\n\u201cYoga looks like it\u2019s safe, even for people who have suffered significant bone loss,\u201d Dr. Fishman said in an interview.\n\nFurthermore, a special study of bone quality done on 18 of the participants showed that they had \u201cbetter internal support of their bones, which is not measured by a bone density scan but is important to resisting fractures,\u201d Dr. Fishman said.\n\nThe study has many limitations, including the use of self-selected volunteers and the lack of a control group. But all told, the team concluded, the results may lend support to Dr. Fishman\u2019s long-held belief that yoga can help reverse bone loss.\n\nEven if bone density did not increase, improvements in posture and balance that can accrue from the practice of yoga can be protective, Dr. Fishman said.\n\n\u201cSpinal fractures can result from poor posture, and there\u2019s no medication for that, but yoga is helpful,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition, \u201cYoga is good for range of motion, strength, coordination and reduced anxiety,\u201d he said, \u201call of which contribute to the ability to stay upright and not fall.

Along with obesity, high levels of blood fats can lead to heart disease and other health problems, including diabetes.\n\nThe U.S. government currently recommends screening for high cholesterol in children with a family history of heart disease or high cholesterol (with at least one parent or grandparent who has suffered a premature heart event such as heart attack or stroke, or at least one parent with total cholesterol levels above 240 mg/dL). The guidelines also recommend that youngsters whose parents are not aware of their family history of heart disease be screened.\n\nIn the new study, led by Dr. William Neal of West Virginia University, scientists observed a group of more than 20,000 fifth-graders in West Virginia and found that 71% were eligible for cholesterol screening based on national criteria. Experts believe using family history is a good way to identify children who may be at greatest risk of high cholesterol \u0097 and therefore of future heart disease. Based on the results of the screen, doctors may then advise families to change their children's diet or exercise routines or prescribe medication to lower their cholesterol.\n\nBut because West Virginia has one of the nation's highest rates of death from heart disease, since 2000, the state has offered free, universal cholesterol screening to all fifth-graders enrolled in public schools. That allowed Neal and his team to determine how many children who actually had high cholesterol would have been missed if they had been screened based on federal guidelines.\n\nAmong the 5,798 children who would not have been screened, nearly 10% had elevated LDL cholesterol levels (above 130 mg/dL), according to the study, published in the August issue of Pediatrics. And 1.7% had levels high enough (above 160 mg/dL) to warrant cholesterol-lowering medications. Indeed, of all the children in the study whose LDL levels were above 160, one-third were in the group who would not have been screened.\n\nThe current guidelines were put in place in the 1990s, and at the time, experts predicted that high cholesterol would be missed in as many as 25% of children, says Neal. But doctors assumed that in most cases, these children would have only slightly elevated cholesterol levels that would eventually be detected when they became adults and would be lowered with diet and exercise.\n\nNeal's data show that may not be the case. Further, Neal says, the findings apply not only to heart-disease risk but also to the risk of diabetes, since high cholesterol at a young age is a strong predictor of prediabetes and diabetes. \"We worry about that because if these children don't change their ways, then they are going to have Type 2 diabetes,\" he says. \"It's something we would become more aware of if more children were screened.\"\n\nNot everyone agrees that universal screening is the answer. Rather than calling for all youngsters to have their cholesterol tested, which would entail considerable expense on the national level, Dr. Ralph Sacco, president of the American Heart Association (AHA), suggests looking more critically at current screening guidelines. \"Maybe the way we are doing family screening, with a very simplistic questionnaire about any parent having early heart disease or having high blood cholesterol, is not effective,\" he says. \"I think we need more effective screening tools. We need to assess these options before jumping to possible universal screening.\"\n\nSacco notes that both the AHA and the American Academy of Pediatrics now recommend cholesterol screening in children with risk factors for heart disease other than family history, such as obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes. \"The weight of the child, his waist circumference and whether he has siblings who are overweight would help to select a group that is at greater risk of having high cholesterol,\" he says. \"Now that we have this data, it does call into question these original guidelines from the government.\" The next update of the recommendations is expected in spring 2011.\n\nSee TIME's Pictures of the Week.\n\nSee the Cartoons of the Week.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "1clip_filelist.xml\" rel=\"File-List\"/>\n\n\n\n \nThe lead of the story focuses on the number of children with elevated cholesterol who might be missed based on current national guidelines and does not jump to the conclusion that these children would necessarily benefit from treatment. The story also reports that less than two percent of the children tested had cholesterol levels high enough that doctors might consider drug treatment. Oddly, the lead sentence says current guidelines \u201cmay miss nearly 10% of those who have high levels of LDL, or bad cholesterol,\u201d but the researchers put the figure at closer to a third.

He's a professor of medicine at Duke University School of Medicine, in Durham, N.C.\n\nWhile other research has found that weight-loss surgery is the most effective treatment for obese patients, there is less data on long-lasting effects. The new study is notable because of the decade-long follow-up, said Maciejewski, who is also a research career scientist at Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center.\n\nIn the two-part study, Maciejewski's team first looked at the results of about 1,800 men and women who had gastric bypass surgery. The investigators compared weight changes in gastric bypass surgery patients to weight changes in more than 5,300 obese veterans who had no weight-loss surgery or formal weight-loss treatment.\n\nGastric bypass surgery involves making the stomach smaller, and attaching the lower part of the small intestine directly to the stomach, so much of the small intestine is bypassed. After surgery, people feel much fuller, faster. The surgery also appears to alter gut hormones, gut bacteria and metabolism, according to the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).\n\nAt the study's one-year mark, those who had the bypass had lost 31 percent of their starting weight, but the non-surgical patients had lost just 1 percent.\n\nAt 10 years, the researchers had weight information on 564 of the nearly 1,800 patients who had the gastric bypass. Only 19 of them had regained so much weight that they were nearly back to their starting weight; the rest kept off the weight.\n\nCompared to the non-surgical group, the bypass group weighed 21 percent less than at the start of the study.\n\nNext, the researchers compared three types of weight-loss surgeries: gastric bypass; sleeve gastrectomy; and adjustable gastric banding. In gastric banding, a band is placed at the top of the stomach to create a small pouch that reduces the size of the stomach. In sleeve gastrectomy, most of the stomach is removed, leaving a banana-shaped sleeve. As with gastric bypass surgery, both of these procedures leave people feeling full faster, according to NIDDK.\n\nAfter four years, those who had gastric bypass lost nearly 28 percent of their starting weight. People who had sleeve gastrectomy lost about 18 percent and those with gastric banding lost about 11 percent, the researchers found.\n\nThe average age of the men and women studied was about 52, and three-quarters were men. Most were white.\n\nThe study was published online Aug. 31 in JAMA Surgery.\n\nThe study helps address a knowledge gap about long-term outcomes of bariatric surgery, said Dr. Jon Gould, chief of general surgery at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee.\n\nThe study \"shows that the gastric bypass procedure compared to sleeve gastrectomy or adjustable gastric banding produces more weight loss and it was sustained over the long term,\" Gould said. He wrote a commentary to accompany the study in the same issue of the journal.\n\nBased on the new study findings, Gould said, \"I think a patient who is young and who has a long way to go may want to think about these results, and all other things being equal, might pick a gastric bypass for the long-term weight loss.\"\n\nThe new finding, he added, validates his belief that the gastric bypass could be a \"durable procedure.\"\n\nMaciejewski acknowledged that the study has limitations.

Abroms and her team wanted to find out if a more intensive mobile phone program called Quit4baby would be more effective. To find out, the team recruited nearly 500 pregnant women, who smoked an average of 7 cigarettes per day and wanted more help to quit.\n\nQuit4baby is targeted to smoking cessation and sends more text messages--between 1 and 8 per day aimed at bolstering a pregnant woman's resolve to quit. The messages help educate the women about the health risks associated with smoking and they are interactive--allowing a woman to text back for more help if she is experiencing a craving or goes back to smoking.\n\nAfter three months, 16 percent of the women who were enrolled in both Text4baby and Quit4baby had quit compared with just 11 percent of women getting just Text4baby. However, the difference between the two groups did not reach statistical significance, the authors say.\n\nThe more intensive intervention did seem to help two subgroups quit smoking at least in the short run, Abroms says. The combo of Text4baby and Quit4baby helped women age 26 and older and those in the second and third trimester of pregnancy quit through the delivery date and in some cases beyond. However, the researchers found that the resolve to quit seemed to disappear postpartum as many of these women started smoking again.\n\nVery little help is provided to pregnant smokers who want to quit so the study's findings are important, especially if the strategy can be adjusted to be more effective, Abroms says. Despite the health risks, about 10 percent of women smoke throughout their pregnancy in the United States.\n\nAdditional studies must be done to find out if Quit4baby can be paired with other smoking cessation tools in order to provide long-term help for pregnant women who want to kick their smoking habit for good, she says.\n\nThe study, \"A Randomized Trial of Text Messaging for Smoking Cessation in Pregnant Women,\" was published October 2 in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.\n\n*The headline of this release was edited for clarity to match the content in the body of the release.\n\nThe research was supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the National Institutes of Health.

But what helped save his brain \u2014 and left him remarkably undamaged \u2014 was a simple procedure in the ER: chilling his body. It's called induced hypothermia. The idea is that cooling a comatose patient after a heart attack prevents brain damage.\n\n\"Anytime you can take someone who comes into the hospital after having cardiac arrest, who may not ever wake up, and you can potentially change that to someone who can wake up and become back the person they were the day before, it's an amazing thing,\" says Dr. David Likosky, a neurologist.\n\nResearch has shown it can improve the survival rate by 14 percent.\n\n\"We know how to use it but we really don't know how it works,\" says cardiologist Mark Vossler. \"We know that people's neurologic outcomes are likely to be better if they get it but we don't completely understand what's happening in the brain for sure when the body is cooled.\"\n\nSays Likosky: \"If you cool the brain down, it may be that it uses less energy and (is) less likely to damage itself over that first 24 hours.\"\n\nIce packs can do the job, but new devices make it easier to reduce and regulate temperature. Pads are placed on the chest and legs, and cold water circulates through the pathways.\n\n\"The cooling pads are applied, and we bring their body temperature down to 91 to 93 degrees. We keep them at that temperature for the first 24 hours, at which time we re-warm them,\" Likosky explains.\n\nThe American Heart Association recommended more than a year ago using induced hypothermia for cardiac arrest patients who are stable. But most hospitals don't. It requires training and a lot of coordination.\n\n\"It should be more widely used. In medicine, in general, we have many very expensive treatments that may make a marginal difference \u2014 treatments that are potentially painful, that cost a lot,\" Likosky says. \"This is ice, and it's a treatment that's very simple, and it's a treatment that makes a big difference: the difference between waking up and not.\"\n\nChilling the body may work miracles, but only if the patient survives to reach the hospital.

The Food and Drug Administration approved Provenge this spring to treat advanced prostate cancer.\n\nBut now the study that led to FDA approval is finally out in this week's New England Journal of Medicine. And it's clear that experts are still scratching their heads about just how Provenge works.\n\nIt does work, sort of.\n\nIn the study, men with prostate cancer that no longer responds to hormone therapy (basically, chemical castration) lived about four months longer if they took Provenge than if they got placebo treatment. That's better than the only other approved treatment for such advanced cancers.\n\nBut, as the study's lead author Dr. Philip Kantoff acknowledges, \"It's not a home run; this is not going to cure prostate cancer.\"\n\nThe primary mystery is how Provenge extends life, since it doesn't shrink prostate tumors, as far as anyone can tell. \"Prolongation of survival without a measurable antitumor effect is surprising,\" writes Dr. Dan Longo of the National Institute on Aging in a NEJM editorial.\n\nDeep in the data is further mystery.\n\nProvenge is supposed to work by, in effect, vaccinating patients against their own cancers using a patient's own white blood cells.\n\nThe theory is that the custom-made vaccine incites patients' immune cells to attack the cancer. The study shows that patients who got Provenge were indeed more likely to mount immune-cell responses to a prostate cancer antigen in the test tube. But oddly, the patients who had these activated immune cells didn't survive any longer than those who didn't.\n\nThe other side of the immune system \u2013 the antibody arm -- showed a different picture. Patients who had a good antibody response to Provenge lived longer than those who didn't.\n\nNobody yet knows just how to explain these results. Longo, the NEJM editorialist, says he'd be more convinced if the placebo patients had received infusions of white blood cells that had been exposed just to the general immune-stimulating part of the Provenge treatment, without the prostate antigen part.\n\nThe way the study was done, he says, \"does not allow one to conclude\" that Provenge is working because it mobilizes the immune system specifically against prostate cancer.\n\nBut, after all, Provenge is just the first cancer immunotherapy on the market. So it's not surprising there's a lot to be learned, and that it's pretty pricey.\n\nOther immunotherapy approaches are in the pipeline, along with fancier versions of drugs to block the hormones that feed prostate cancer.\n\nMeanwhile, Dendreon, the Seattle-based company that makes Provenge, says there's a waiting list for the drug. The company estimates 100,000 American men have the kind of hormone-resistant, metastatic cancer the drug is approved to treat. But the company can only make enough at this point for 2,000 patients in the first year.\n\nSo does the waiting list contain thousands of men?

It is then inflated with saline during the procedure that lasts about 45 minutes. Patients are treated in office and are kept under mild to moderate sedation. The balloon remains in the patient\u2019s stomach for six months and is then removed the same way it was inserted, through the mouth.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of the procedure is that it is a nonsurgical procedure,\u201d Chattoo said.

Chattoo also offers patients a nutritionist and trainer with the procedure. The hope is that patients can train their body to eat in a much healthier fashion without feeling overly hungry.\n\nMarie Brown chose to undergo the procedure and credits Orbera for helping her lose over 20 pounds in three and a half months.

So it cannot be completely ruled out that XL184 somehow stopped bone growth without killing the cancer. However, Dr. Smith said he doubted that was the case because there were signs the drug also controlled tumors outside the bones.\n\nDrugs now used to treat advanced prostate cancer, like Taxotere, do not have much affect on bone scans, Dr. Smith said. Bone drugs like Zometa from Novartis and denosumab from Amgen can protect cancerous bones from fractures, but have not been shown to fight the cancer itself.\n\nAnother investigator in the trial, Dr. David C. Smith of the University of Michigan, said he could not believe it when the bone scan of one patient, who previously had widespread cancer in his bones, came back completely clean.\n\n\u201cI thought they had scanned the wrong person,\u201d said Dr. Smith, who is not related to the doctor in Massachusetts. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this.\u201d\n\nExelixis will now add many prostate cancer patients to the midstage clinical trial from which the results were drawn, said Michael M.

He realized that reimbursement by regional Medicare contractors was inconsistent, so he decided the agency should have a uniform national policy.\n\nThe Medicare Coverage Advisory Committee, which met in Baltimore, did not discuss the cost of Provenge or make a coverage recommendation. It reviewed the clinical trial data and then rated the strength of the data on a scale of 1 to 5.\n\nThe 10 voting members, mainly doctors and health policy experts, averaged 3.6 on the question of how much confidence they had that there was adequate evidence to conclude that Provenge significantly prolongs survival.\n\nThat is between 3, which is intermediate confidence and 5, which is high confidence. But some analysts said that should be enough for reimbursement. Trading in Dendreon shares, halted during regular market hours, rose 6 percent after hours.\n\nHowever, the panel gave very low scores to evidence that the drug would help prostate cancer patients other than the type who participated in the clinical trial, which were men with advanced cancer, but no or minimal symptoms. That could give Medicare grounds for denying payment when the drug is used off-label, as cancer drugs often are.\n\nMedicare is scheduled to put a proposed decision out for comment by March 30, with a final decision around the end of June.\n\nProvenge has stirred passions since the F.D.A. initially declined to approve it in 2007.

The findings suggest that many of our expectations about the inevitability of physical decline with advancing years may be incorrect and that how we age is, to a large degree, up to us.\n\nAging remains a surprisingly mysterious process. A wealth of past scientific research has shown that many bodily and cellular processes change in undesirable ways as we grow older. But science has not been able to establish definitively whether such changes result primarily from the passage of time \u2014 in which case they are inevitable for anyone with birthdays \u2014 or result at least in part from lifestyle, meaning that they are mutable.\n\nThis conundrum is particularly true in terms of inactivity. Older people tend to be quite sedentary nowadays, and being sedentary affects health, making it difficult to separate the effects of not moving from those of getting older.\n\nIn the new study, which was published this week in The Journal of Physiology, scientists at King\u2019s College London and the University of Birmingham in England decided to use a different approach.\n\nThey removed inactivity as a factor in their study of aging by looking at the health of older people who move quite a bit.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to understand what happens to the functioning of our bodies as we get older if we take the best-case scenario,\u201d said Stephen Harridge, senior author of the study and director of the Centre of Human and Aerospace Physiological Sciences at King\u2019s College London.\n\nTo accomplish that goal, the scientists recruited 85 men and 41 women aged between 55 and 79 who bicycle regularly. The volunteers were all serious recreational riders but not competitive athletes. The men had to be able to ride at least 62 miles in six and a half hours and the women 37 miles in five and a half hours, benchmarks typical of a high degree of fitness in older people.\n\nThe scientists then ran each volunteer through a large array of physical and cognitive tests. The scientists determined each cyclist\u2019s endurance capacity, muscular mass and strength, pedaling power, metabolic health, balance, memory function, bone density and reflexes. They also had the volunteers complete the so-called Timed Up and Go test, during which someone stands up from a chair without using his or her arms, briskly walks about 10 feet, turns, walks back and sits down again.\n\nThe researchers compared the results of cyclists in the study against each other and also against standard benchmarks of supposedly normal aging. If a particular test\u2019s numbers were similar among the cyclists of all ages, the researchers considered, then that measure would seem to be more dependent on activity than on age.\n\nAs it turned out, the cyclists did not show their age. On almost all measures, their physical functioning remained fairly stable across the decades and was much closer to that of young adults than of people their age. As a group, even the oldest cyclists had younger people\u2019s levels of balance, reflexes, metabolic health and memory ability.\n\nAnd their Timed Up and Go results were exemplary. Many older people require at least 7 seconds to complete the task, with those requiring 9 or 10 seconds considered to be on the cusp of frailty, Dr. Harridge said. But even the oldest cyclists in this study averaged barely 5 seconds for the walk, which is \u201cwell within the norm reported for healthy young adults,\u201d the study authors write.\n\nSome aspects of aging did, however, prove to be ineluctable. The oldest cyclists had less muscular power and mass than those in their 50s and early 60s and considerably lower overall aerobic capacities. Age does seem to reduce our endurance and strength to some extent, Dr. Harridge said, even if we exercise.\n\nBut even so, both of those measures were higher among the oldest cyclists than would be considered average among people aged 70 or above.\n\nAll in all, the numbers suggest that aging is simply different in the active.\n\n\u201cIf you gave this dataset to a clinician and asked him to predict the age\u201d of one of the cyclists based on his or her test results, Dr. Harridge said, \u201cit would be impossible.\u201d On paper, they all look young.\n\nOf course, this study is based on a single snapshot of an unusual group of older adults, Dr. Harridge said. He and his colleagues plan to retest their volunteers in five and 10 years, which will provide better information about the ongoing effects of exercise on aging.\n\nBut even in advance of those results, said Dr. Harridge, himself almost 50 and an avid cyclist, this study shows that \u201cbeing physically active makes your body function on the inside more like a young person\u2019s.\u201d", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story implies that this study gives us a new way to see aging itself, but escapes the trap of making aging appear as if is a disease to be cured.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Switching to AstraZeneca PLC's breast-cancer drug Arimidex after treatment with older drug tamoxifen not only helps women live longer, but also increases their chances of staying cancer-free after initial therapy for breast cancer, according to a study in the online edition of the Lancet Oncology medical journal.\n\nThe data, which come from more than 4,000 patients in three clinical trials, have shown that switching treatment from tamoxifen to Arimidex reduces the risk of dying by 29%.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story does not engage is disease mongering.

Such fasting already shows benefits after only six weeks. This is according to a study by Kyoung-Han Kim and Yun Hye Kim in the journal Cell Research which is published by Springer Nature. Intermittent fasting in mice helped to kick-start the animals' metabolism and to burn fat by generating body heat. The research team was led by Hoon-Ki Sung of The Hospital for Sick Children in Ontario, Canada.\n\nResearch has shown that our unhealthy eating habits and sedentary lifestyles are playing a major role in the development of lifestyle-related metabolic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and obesity. For this reason, dietary interventions like intermittent fasting are gaining popularity to treat conditions such as obesity.\n\nThe research team in this study wanted to better understand the reactions that interventions such as fasting trigger on a molecular level in the body. They exposed groups of mice to sixteen weeks of intermittent fasting. The recurring regimen saw the animals being fed for two days, followed by one day without anything to eat. Their calorie intake was not adjusted otherwise. Four months later the mice in the fasting group weighed less than those in the control group who continued to eat the same volume of food. The lower body weight of the mice in the fasting group was not the only effect. The fasting regime helped lower fat build-up in the white fat by increasing the brown-like fat (involved in burning energy and producing body heat) of mice on the high fat diet. Their glucose and insulin systems also remained more stable. In a further experiment, similar benefits were already seen after only six weeks of intermittent fasting.\n\nThrough an analysis into the underlying biology involved, the researchers found that such intermittent fasting tempers an immune reaction in fat cells. There are changes in certain gene pathways involved in the immune system and the body's reaction to inflammation. A type of white blood cell known to play a role in fighting inflammation is triggered. Known as anti-inflammatory macrophages, these cells stimulate the fat cells to burn stored fats or lipids by generating heat. This happens during periods of intermittent fasting because there is an increase in vascular growth factor (VEGF) that help form blood vessels and activate anti-inflammatory macrophage.\n\n\"Intermittent fasting without a reduction in calorie intake can be a preventative and therapeutic approach against obesity and metabolic disorders,\" says Kyoung-Han Kim.\n\n\"Strikingly, these fasting-stimulated changes in the growth of vascular cells and subsequent immune alterations occur even after a single cycle of 24-hour fasting, and are completely reversed when mice start eating again,\" adds Yun Hye Kim.\n\nReference: Kim, K-H. et al (2017).

And this strategy \u2026 could potentially be used,\u201d said Dr. Jean-Michel Molina, head of infectious diseases at Saint-Louis Hospital in Paris and the lead author of the study.\n\nMolina insisted he would never support long-term use of antibiotics to prevent STIs, but said that the approach might be an effective short-term strategy when paired with other control approaches, like more frequent STI testing among high-risk populations.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want this strategy to be used widely in any person, clearly,\u201d Molina said. \u201cBut if you can select a group with a high incidence rate of syphilis or chlamydia, and you want to try to reduce the rate of syphilis quite quickly in this group of people, you may think that this strategy could be used for a couple of months.\u201d\n\nRates of syphilis in particular have risen steadily in recent years; the rate in 2015-2016 \u2014 8.7 cases per 100,000 people \u2014 was the highest since 1993, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. The rate of infection increased in every age group over the age of 15, in both men and women, and in all ethnic groups.\n\nMolina\u2019s study was recently published by the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was one of its funders.\n\nThe researchers randomly assigned 232 men to one of two groups. One of the groups was given antibiotics \u2014 the drug doxycycline \u2014 to take if they had unprotected sex. They were told to take two pills per encounter, and no more than six in a week, ideally within 24 hours and no later than 72 hours after the intercourse. In reality, the median use among the men was about 6.8 pills per month.\n\nThe men were tested regularly for STIs, and in the nine or so months they were followed, the rates of some sexually transmitted infections fell dramatically in the treatment group. The overall reduction of all STIs was 47 percent, but that average was dragged down by the fact that doxycycline doesn\u2019t cure gonorrhea.\n\nThere was, however, a 70 percent reduction in chlamydia infections and cases of syphilis decreased by 73 percent. The authors noted, however, that the study length was short and they can\u2019t tell if the strategy would work as well over the long term.\n\nThe results can\u2019t be taken in isolation, others experts warned. Using doxycycline this way could drive the bacteria that cause the infections to develop resistance to the drug, warned Dr. Brad Spellberg, an infectious diseases specialist and chief medical officer at the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center in Los Angeles.\n\nSpellberg also said people who used the drug this way would be exposing the bacteria they have in their gastro-intestinal tracts \u2014 their own gut flora \u2014 to regular doses of doxycycline. And those bacteria too could develop resistance to the drug, leading to a host of other health problems.\n\nThe full picture of the knock-on effects of exposing your gut flora to antibiotics is still coming into focus, said Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics, and Policy and a leading voice on the dangers of mounting antibiotic resistance. He noted a recent report in the journal Science revealed that some cancer immunotherapy drugs worked less well in people who had recently taken antibiotics.\n\nMolina noted that antibiotic resistance to doxycycline has not been seen in chlamydia or syphilis, despite the fact that the drug has been used to treat these infections for decades. Still, he said the possibility it could arise cannot be discounted.\n\nA commentary published with the study argued that reducing infection rates in men who have sex with men and who are highly sexually active might lower STI infection rates more generally in a community.\n\nAuthors Christopher Fairley and Eric Chow, of Australia\u2019s Melbourne Sexual Health Center at Monash University, said pressure from patients to be given doxycycline on a preventative basis might be substantial, given that the drug is also prescribed in six-month courses to treat acne. Like Molina and his co-authors, they said STI preventive use at this point is premature.\n\nLaxminarayan did not dismiss the notion of this type of use out of hand, however. \u201cI certainly think that for a small subset of the population, if this helps prevent syphilis, then it certainly is worth exploring further,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he said additional studies should be conducted first to try to get a better picture of the potential consequences of using doxycycline this way, including the risk of resistance developing, the potential that it might further erode condom use, and any other unintended consequences.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story includes several comments from the researchers and others warning that this sort of strategy should be considered only for short-term use in special circumstances.

This study -- which is the first to suggest that the reduction in risk occurs for low-dose aspirin -- was proposed by City of Hope's Leslie Bernstein, Ph.D., professor and director of the Division of Biomarkers of Early Detection and Prevention, and published online in the journal, Breast Cancer Research.\n\nBernstein and her colleagues saw an overall 16 percent lower risk of breast cancer in women who reported using low-dose aspirin at least three times per week. Such regular use of low-dose aspirin reduced the risk by 20 percent of estrogen or progesterone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer, which is the most common breast cancer subtype.\n\n\"The study found an interesting protective association between low-dose aspirin and breast cancer,\" said lead author Christina A. Clarke, Ph.D., M.P.H., from the Cancer Prevention Institute of California. \"We did not by and large find associations with the other pain medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. We also did not find associations with regular aspirin since this type of medication is taken sporadically for headaches or other pain, and not daily for prevention of cardiovascular disease.\"\n\nThis study differed from other studies that have looked at aspirin and cancer risk because it focused on the dose levels of the aspirin women had taken and tracked the frequency of the use of low-dose aspirin as opposed to regular aspirin. It was also able to look in detail at subtypes of breast cancer.\n\n\"We already knew that aspirin is a weak aromatase inhibitor and we treat women with breast cancer with stronger aromatase inhibitors since they reduce the amount of estrogen postmenopausal women have circulating in their blood,\" said Bernstein. \"We thought that if aspirin can inhibit aromatase, it ought to reduce the likelihood that breast cancer would develop and it could also be an effective way to improve breast cancer patients' prognosis once they no longer take the more potent aromatase inhibitors.\" Bernstein added, \"Aspirin also reduces inflammation, which may be another mechanism by which aspirin taken regularly can lower risk of breast cancer developing or recurring.\"\n\nAs part of the study, researchers analyzed data recorded in questionnaires submitted by 57,164 women in the California's Teacher's Study. In 2005, participants answered questions regarding family history of cancer and other conditions, use of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), menstrual and reproductive history, use of hormones, weight and height, living environment, diet, alcohol use and physical activity. In the ensuing years before 2013, 1,457 of these participants developed invasive breast cancer.\n\nThe team of researchers chose to focus on low-dose \"baby\" aspirin, because not only is it inexpensive and readily available as potential means of prevention, but because there are already a lot of people already taking it for prevention of other diseases such as heart disease and even colon cancer.\n\nNow that we have some data separating low-dose from higher-dose aspirin, more detailed research can be undertaken to understand the full value of low-dose aspirin for breast cancer prevention,\" said Clarke.\"\n\nOther collaborating authors include Alison J.

Noctiva is the first FDA-approved treatment for this condition.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s approval provides adults who overproduce urine at night with the first FDA-approved therapeutic option to help reduce the number of times a night they wake up to urinate,\u201d said Hylton V. Joffe, M.D., M.M.Sc., director of the Division of Bone, Reproductive, and Urologic Products in the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \u201cIt is important to know that Noctiva is not approved for all causes of night-time urination, so patients should discuss their symptoms with their health care provider who can determine the underlying cause of the night-time urination and whether Noctiva is right for them.\u201d\n\nNocturia (wakening at night to urinate) is a symptom that can be caused by a wide variety of conditions, such as congestive heart failure, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, medications, or diseases of the bladder or prostate. Before considering Noctiva, health care providers should evaluate each patient for possible causes for the nocturia, and optimize the treatment of underlying conditions that may be contributing to the night-time urination. Because Noctiva is approved only for adults with nocturia caused by nocturnal polyuria, health care providers should confirm overproduction of urine at night with a 24-hour urine collection, if one has not been obtained previously. Health care providers should also be mindful of underlying conditions that can cause nocturia, but that make treatment with Noctiva unsafe, such as excessive drinking of fluids or symptomatic congestive heart failure.\n\nNoctiva is taken daily, approximately 30 minutes before going to bed. It works by increasing the absorption of water through the kidneys, which leads to less urine production.\n\nNoctiva\u2019s efficacy was established in two 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in 1,045 patients 50 years of age and older with nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria. Although these trials showed a small reduction in the average number of night-time urinations with Noctiva compared to placebo, more patients treated with Noctiva were able to at least halve their number of night-time urinations, and patients treated with Noctiva had more nights with one or fewer night-time urinations.\n\nNoctiva is being approved with a boxed warning and a Medication Guide because it can cause low sodium levels in the blood (hyponatremia). Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest or death. Health care providers should make sure the patient\u2019s sodium level is normal before starting Noctiva, and should check sodium levels within one week and approximately one month after starting treatment and periodically thereafter. The lower Noctiva dose is recommended as the starting dose for those who may be at risk for hyponatremia, such as the elderly. Noctiva should not be used in patients at increased risk of severe hyponatremia, such as those with excessive fluid intake, those who have illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances, certain patients with kidney damage, and in those using certain medicines, known as loop diuretics or glucocorticoids.\n\nNoctiva should also not be used in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension because fluid retention can worsen these underlying conditions. Use of Noctiva should be discontinued temporarily in patients with certain nasal conditions such as colds or allergies until those conditions have resolved.\n\nNoctiva is also not recommended for the treatment of nocturia in pregnant women. Nocturia is usually related to normal changes in pregnancy that do not require treatment with Noctiva. Noctiva should not be used in children.\n\nThe most common side effects of Noctiva in clinical trials included nasal discomfort, cold symptoms (nasopharyngitis), nasal congestion, sneezing, high or increased blood pressure, back pain, nose bleeds, bronchitis and dizziness.\n\nAlthough there are other FDA-approved medications that also contain desmopressin, none of those medications are approved to treat nocturia.\n\nNoctiva is manufactured by Renaissance Lakewood, LLC for Milford, Pennsylvania-based Serenity Pharmaceuticals, LLC.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

Smoking cigarettes causes 480,000 premature deaths each year due mainly to a two-fold risk of cardiovascular disease and a 20-fold risk of lung cancer. In a commentary published in the current issue of the American Journal of Medicine, researchers from the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine at Florida Atlantic University reassure clinicians and their patients that varenicline, whose brand name is Chantix, is a safe and effective way to achieve smoking cessation and that failure to use this drug has caused preventable heart attacks and deaths from cardiovascular disease.\n\nIn 2006, varenicline was approved as a safe and effective means to quit smoking and achieved permanent quit rates of approximately 25 percent. In 2009, however, varenicline received a black box warning by the FDA based on their adverse event reports of neuropsychiatric symptoms like depression and thoughts of suicide.\n\nThere were plausible alternative explanations including that nearly half of the subjects had psychiatric histories, 42 percent were taking psychotropic drugs and about 42 percent were suffering from depression. Nonetheless, since then, there has been a 76 percent decline in the number of prescriptions dispensed from a peak of about 2 million in the last quarter of 2007 to about 531,000 in the first quarter of 2014.\n\nIn their commentary, the FAU researchers emphasize that, until recently, the totality of randomized evidence on varenicline had been restricted to eight small trials, which did not demonstrate a hazard. The researchers caution that the reliable detection of small to moderate risks and benefits of drug therapies requires cogent data from large-scale randomized trials designed a priori to test the hypothesis.\n\nSuch a large randomized trial was recently completed that included both apparently healthy individuals as well as those with severe mental illness. The trial was conducted for 12 weeks on about 8,000 long-term smokers and included equal subgroups of those without as well as with psychiatric disorders. In subjects without psychiatric disorders, those treated with varenicline had less neuropsychiatric symptoms and in subjects without psychiatric disorders there were no increases in these symptoms. Both groups of participants assigned at random to varenicline achieved significantly higher abstinence rates at 12 weeks than those assigned to placebo, nicotine patch or bupropion. Just a few months ago, the FDA removed the black box warning from varenicline.\n\nThe commentary was coauthored by Dianna Gaballa, a fourth-year medical student; Joanna Drowos, D.O., M.P.H., an associate professor of integrated medical science and associate chair of the Department of Integrated Medical Science; and Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., Dr.P.H., the first Sir Richard Doll Professor and senior academic advisor to the dean, all in FAU's Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine.\n\n\"The existing totality of evidence suggests an urgent need to increase the use of varenicline in the general population as well as in those with serious mental illness who on average die about 20 years earlier than the general population, in part, because their smoking rates may be as high as 75 percent,\" said Hennekens.\n\nQuitting smoking significantly reduces risks of cardiovascular disease beginning within a matter of months and reaching the non-smoker status within a few years, even among older adults. For lung and other cancers, however, reductions do not even begin to emerge for years after quitting and, even after 10 years, quitters achieve death rates only about midway between the continuing smoker and non-smoker.\n\n\"For reducing risks of cardiovascular disease it's never too late to quit, but to reduce risks of cancer, it's never too early,\" said Hennekens.\n\nThe authors speculate that if use of varenicline had not plummeted by 76 percent following the black box warning in 2009, perhaps 17,000 premature deaths from cardiovascular disease may have been avoided each year during the last few years. Public health efforts and effective cessation treatments including behavioral counseling and medication have resulted in a 14 percent decrease in smoking in the U.S. while the rates are markedly increasing in developing countries.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heart disease is the leading killer among men and women causing approximately 600,000 deaths each year.\n\nAmong the numerous honors and recognitions Hennekens has received include the Ochsner Award for reducing premature deaths from cigarettes in 2014. From 1995 to 2005, Science Watch ranked him as the third most widely cited medical researcher in the world and five of the top 20 were his former trainees and/or fellows. In 2012, Science Heroes ranked Hennekens No. 81 in the history of the world for having saved more than 1.1 million lives. In 2016, he was ranked the No. 14 \"Top Scientist in the World\" with an H-index of 173.\n\nAbout the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine:\n\nFAU's Charles E.

Chan School of Public Health.\n\nThe study will be published online February 1, 2016 in Pediatrics.\n\n\"Previous studies of fiber intake and breast cancer have almost all been non-significant, and none of them examined diet during adolescence or early adulthood, a period when breast cancer risk factors appear to be particularly important,\" said Maryam Farvid, visiting scientist at Harvard Chan School and lead author of the study. \"This work on the role of nutrition in early life and breast cancer incidence suggests one of the very few potentially modifiable risk factors for premenopausal breast cancer.\"\n\nThe researchers looked at a group of 90,534 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II, a large long-running investigation of factors that influence women's health. In 1991, the women--ages 27-44 at the time--filled out questionnaires about their food intake, and did so every four years after that. They also completed a questionnaire in 1998 about their diet during high school. The researchers analyzed the women's fiber intake while adjusting for a number of other factors, such as race, family history of breast cancer, body mass index, weight change over time, menstruation history, alcohol use, and other dietary factors.\n\nBreast cancer risk was 12%-19% lower among women who ate more dietary fiber in early adulthood, depending on how much more they ate. High intake of fiber during adolescence was also associated with 16% lower risk of overall breast cancer and 24% lower risk of breast cancer before menopause. Among all the women, there was a strong inverse association between fiber intake and breast cancer incidence. For each additional 10 grams of fiber intake daily--for example, about one apple and two slices of whole wheat bread, or about half a cup each of cooked kidney beans and cooked cauliflower or squash--during early adulthood, breast cancer risk dropped by 13%. The greatest apparent benefit came from fruit and vegetable fiber.\n\nThe authors speculated that eating more fiber-rich foods may lessen breast cancer risk partly by helping to reduce high estrogen levels in the blood, which are strongly linked with breast cancer development.\n\n\"From many other studies we know that breast tissue is particularly influenced by carcinogens and anticarcinogens during childhood and adolescence,\" said Walter Willett, Fredrick John Stare Professor of Epidemiology and Nutrition at Harvard Chan School and senior author of the study. \"We now have evidence that what we feed our children during this period of life is also an important factor in future cancer risk.\"\n\nOther Harvard Chan School researchers involved in the study included Heather Eliassen, associate professor in the Department of Epidemiology, and Xiaomei Liao, research scientist in the Departments of Epidemiology and Biostatistics.\n\nThe study was supported by National Institutes of Health grants R01 CA050385 and UM1 CA176726 and a grant from The Breast Cancer Research Foundation.

They were asked to write the people, places and things that gave them support into the circles, with the circles closest to the center being the most important.\n\nSixty percent of the people who considered pets to be a part of their social networks placed them in the central, most important circle \u2014 the same place many people put close family and social workers. 20 percent placed pets in the second circle.\n\nThe interviews with participants are poignant, and reveal the struggle and isolation that can come with mental illness.\n\n\"I think it's really hard when you haven't had a mental illness to know what the actual experience is [like],\" said one participant. \"There's like a chasm, deep chasm between us ... [Other people are] on one side of it, and we're on the other side of it. We're sending smoke signals to each other to try and understand each other but we don't always \u2014 we don't always understand.\"\n\nPeople with mental illnesses often see their social groups shrink and find themselves alienated from their friends. For many of these people, says Brooks, animals can break through the isolation. They give affection without needing to understand the disorder.\n\n\"[Pets] don't look at the scars on your arms,\" one participant said. \"They don't question where you've been.\"\n\nThe pets provided more than just emotional support and companionship, participants said. The animals also could distract them from their illness, even from severe psychosis.\n\nOne study participant placed birds in his closest social circle. When he was hearing voices, he said that they \"help me in the sense, you know, I'm not thinking about the voices, I'm just thinking of when I hear the birds singing.\"\n\nAnother participant said that merely seeing a hamster climbing the bars on the cage and acting cute helped with some difficult situations.\n\nAnd having to take care of pets keeps people from withdrawing from the world. \"They force me, the cats force me to sort of still be involved,\" said one participant.\n\nAnother said that walking the dog helped them get out of the house and with people. \"That surprised me, you know, the amount of people that stop and talk to him, and that, yeah, it cheers me up with him. I haven't got much in my life, but he's quite good, yeah.\"\n\n\"The routine these pets provide is really important for people,\" says Brooks. \"Getting up in the morning to feed them and groom them and walk them, giving them structure and a sense of purpose that they won't otherwise have.\"\n\nMany of the study participants are unemployed because of their illness, she notes. Having a pet that was well taken care of was a source of pride for them.\n\nMark Longsjo, the program director of adult services at McLean Southeast, an inpatient mental facility in Middleborough, Mass., says that the interviews in the study reflect his professional experiences. \"We have so many patients come through, and we always ask them about their support system. Sometimes its family members, sometimes its friends, but it's very common to hear about pets.\"\n\nWhen he does patient intake surveys, Longsjo says that he includes pets in their risk assessments. Patients with pets often say the animals help keep them from following through on suicidal thinking, because they know their pets depend on them.\n\nThe social workers at McLean also incorporate pets into their aftercare planning, encouraging patients to make walking and grooming their pets a part of their routine. \"I think there's significant value in considering the common everyday pet to be as important as the relationships one has with one's family in the course of their treatment,\" says Longsjo. He feels this study is important because, although there's a lot of work looking at the benefits of trained therapy animals, they can be expensive and out of the reach of many patients.\n\nBrooks hopes that more health workers will consider incorporating pets into care plans for people with mental illness. Many of her participants said that sometimes it felt like their pets could sense when they needed help the most, and were able to provide it \u2014 just like the owners took care of them.\n\nAs one person in the study said, \"When he comes up and sits beside you on a night, it's different, you know.

The drug, from a company called Rigel, is R788 or fostamatinib disodium. The oral drug targets an enzyme called Syk. Nobody is exactly sure of the role Syk plays in rheumatoid arthritis. But there's an overabundance of Syk in the fluid of arthritic joints, and the enzyme is part of the runaway immune machinery that increases joint inflammation.\n\nIn a pilot study, the drug appeared to reduce symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Now Harvard researcher Michael E. Weinblatt, MD, reports results from a phase II clinical trial in which 457 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate treatment received R788 or placebo for six months. For patients treated with the more active twice-daily dose of 100 milligrams of R788:\n\u2022 67% had at least 20% fewer arthritis symptoms, compared to 35% of patients getting a placebo.\n\u2022 43% had at least 50% fewer arthritis symptoms, compared to 19% getting a placebo.\n\u2022 28% had at least 70% fewer arthritis symptoms, compared to 10% getting a placebo.\n\nThe drug does have side effects. Among patients getting the twice-daily 100 milligram dose:\n\u2022 19% had diarrhea, compared to 3% getting a placebo.\n\u2022 14% had upper respiratory infections, compared to 7% getting a placebo.\n\u2022 6% had low white blood cell counts, compared to 1% getting a placebo.\n\u2022 23% had to start or increase blood pressure medication, compared to 7% getting a placebo. There's at least one theoretical concern about R788. Normally, the Syk enzyme helps suppress tumors. Women with breast tumors have low levels of Syk. It's not clear whether long-term use of R788 will increase cancer risk; longer-term clinical trials will have to evaluate this risk. For now, R788 looks very promising, the researchers report. \"Inhibition of the Syk pathway offers a new drug target for rheumatoid arthritis,\" Weinblatt and colleagues conclude.

An already approved drug could be quickly available and would then be the first breast cancer prevention drug.\n\nAbout one in eight women will develop invasive breast cancer over the course of her lifetime. Causes can be the use of synthetic sex hormones and other environmental factors, but also gene mutations like in the BRCA1 gene (BReast CAncer). US actress Angelina Jolie who underwent a preventive double mastectomy is the most famous carrier of a \u201efaulty\u201c BRCA1 gene. On average, women with this mutation have an up to 87% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. Tumors usually develop early in life. Until now, prophylactic surgery is the only procedure which significantly reduces the breast cancer risk, but which is also often associated with postoperative complications.\n\nIn 2010, Josef Penninger, the scientific director of IMBA in Vienna and his team have shown that sex hormones can trigger breast cancer (Schramek et al., Nature) through proteins called RANKL and its receptor RANK, which are key factors in bone metabolism. RANKL and RANK also link sex hormones to breast cells by providing signals telling the breast cells to grow. This occurs normally in every woman during pregnancy and the menstruation cycle. However, if deregulated, mammary cells start to divide and multiply and fail to die when they should, ultimately resulting in breast cancer.\n\nA multinational research effort now made the discovery that RANKL is also the main driver of BRCA1 mutation-driven breast cancer. In the current study, Verena Sigl, graduate student from Penninger's research group, showed that blocking the RANKL/RANK system in BRCA1 mutant mice led to largely normal mammary glands whereas invasive carcinomas could be found in the control group. To determine the relevance of their results for humans, scientists in Vienna and Toronto isolated breast tissue cells from women who had undergone preventive mastectomy because of their BRCA1 mutation. In the human cell culture, too, RANKL inhibition led to a significant reduction of growth and spreading of breast tissue cells. Moreover, the scientists \u2013 together with colleagues in Barcelona and from the CIMBA* consortium mapping more than 23,000 women \u2013 showed that genetic variants in the RANK gene are associated with a higher risk of developing breast cancer in women who carry BRCA1 and also BRCA2 mutations.\n\n\"Our finding is so exciting because there is already an approved drug against RANKL called \u201eDenosumab\u201d. It is an antibody with very few side effects, which binds tightly to RANKL, thereby inhibiting its ability to act. Based on our discovery, the already approved drug Denosumab or other future drugs that will block RANKL/RANK, could be used for breast cancer prevention in BRCA mutation carriers,\" explains Verena Sigl.\n\nScientists at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore have already tried the preventive use of a RANKL blocking drug in mice. Animals carrying BRCA1 mutations were divided into two groups. In the control group multiple early breast cancer lesions developed. The second group received RANKL blockade treatment for prevention with the result that virtually no malignant changes in breast tissue could be observed even over a longer period of observation.\n\nCareful phase III clinical trials are now needed to confirm the efficacy in humans. Thereafter, any woman who has been tested positive for a BRCA1 mutation could take RANKL blockade as prevention measure to reduce her dramatically increased breast cancer risk. Josef Penninger adds: \u201cThis work is a great example of an international collaboration of many scientists with one grand vision: Prevention of breast cancer. Cancer prevention is one of the key issues we face in medicine today, a world where much fewer women will get breast cancer in the first place. We have also shown that RANKL/RANK are critically involved in sex hormone-driven breast cancer. If the uncovered mechanism indeed works in the prevention of breast cancer in high risk patients, this could possibly be used to prevent breast cancer in general. One door for breast cancer prevention has now been opened and this can be tested very fast.\u201d\n\nThe present work is the result of international collaboration. Scientists from Austria (IMBA, AKH Wien) participated as well as researchers from the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore and the University of Maryland-Baltimore County, Baltimore, USA; Toronto, Canada and Barcelona, Spain.

But now the Food and Drug Administration has evaluated the safety of the second generation of silicone implants and the results are mixed.\n\nAn FDA report, released in late June, says silicone implants are generally safe. But complications from implants are frequent \u2014 things like hardening of the skin around the implant; ruptured, wrinkled, or lopsided implants; scarring, pain and infection.\n\nAs many as half of patients will need to have additional surgeries or have the implants removed in the first decade.\n\nIt also turns out that the longer a woman has the implants, the more likely she is to experience these complications.\n\nTake Kate Marion. She had silicone implants for breast augmentation in her late 20s. Just shy of two decades later she noticed something unusual.\n\n\"When I was crossing my left arm across my body \u2014 for instance, to put lotion on my right arm \u2014 I would make a little noise from my armpit, the way little boys do when they stick their hand in their armpit and pump their arm up and down,\" Marion says. \"A little tooty noise.\"\n\nAn MRI showed both her implants had burst. Her doctor immediately recommended removing them, which she did. Marion hasn't suffered any apparent harm from her ruptured implants, and she even confesses to having an occasional twinge of regret that she didn't have them replaced when she had the old ones removed. But ultimately she decided she didn't want to go through more surgery.\n\n\"Well, how long would these next ones last? I would be in my 60s when I had to do this again, and who wants to have surgery unnecessarily when you are 60 something?\" says Marion.\n\nAlthough the long-term effects of silicone in the body are still uncertain, many plastic surgeons don't see the leaking of modern implants as a health concern.\n\n\"The actual silicone that's within the implants is inert. So if the silicone gel leaks, it doesn't travel through the body, it doesn't cause systemic problems. So the MRI is really detecting a cosmetic concern,\" says New York City plastic surgeon Matthew Schulman.\n\nBut there have been more serious outcomes. Annette Knecht got silicone implants in 1991 following a double mastectomy. For years afterward she felt ill, suffered multiple bouts of pneumonia, had trouble breathing and pain in her chest. Doctors reassured her it wasn't her implants.\n\n\"We had a CT scan done, and it showed OK \u2014 everything looked fine, so we didn't worry about it,\" says Knecht.\n\nBut no one ever told her to get an MRI \u2014 something the FDA now recommends that women with silicone implants get every few years. As it turned out, Knecht's implants had leaked; a biopsy found silicone in her lymph nodes and in her lungs. She is currently disabled and awaiting a lung transplant \u2014 all, she says, for vanity.\n\n\"We're about four generations removed from those implants,\" says Schulman, the plastic surgeon. He explains that implants have undergone big changes since the early 1990s, when Knecht received hers. Back then they contained a runny liquid silicone.\n\n\"The silicone implants of today are what we call a cohesive gel \u2014 it's essentially like a jelly. So the jelly may ooze a little bit, but it will not run out like an oil,\" says Schulman.\n\nSid Wolf of the nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen is among critics who point out that the data in the FDA report sample just a fraction of the nearly 400,000 women who receive breast implants each year. Moreover, that data are limited to just the last two or three years \u2014 not enough, Wolf says, to make any real claims about the long-term safety of the implants.\n\n\"There is a huge deficiency of long-term data at a time when we know that the longer these devices are in, the more problems ... occur,\" says Wolf.\n\nStill, there are plenty of satisfied customers among the nearly 400,000 women who receive breast implants each year. Not only have the number of women choosing breast implants for augmentation risen by nearly 40 percent in the last decade, Schulman says that in his practice, 80 percent of them are choosing silicone over saline. What's more, he says few of them follow the recommendations to get routine MRIs to screen for leaks.\n\nSchulman says that the rates of complications for silicone implants are roughly the same as for saline \u2014 though he feels these complications can be minimized by choosing an experienced surgeon. Still, he warns his patients that no procedure is without risks \u2014 and additional surgeries are a very real possibility.\n\n\"Your young breast implants don't last forever,\" says Schulman. \"They may leak, they may rupture, you may decide you want a different size. So you have to at least expect that sometime in your life, you are going to need a reoperation. And if you are 100 percent against having another surgery related to these implants, then it's something you should reconsider.\"", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "It would be difficult to oversell the caveats in this story; the article presented dramatic, significant concerns.\n", "answer": 1}, {"article": "This is one of very few studies that looks at olive oil intake and risk for neurologic diseases, including stroke, Nikolaos Scarmeas, MD, of Columbia University in New York City, says in an email. \u201cMaybe olive oil improves vascular risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, heart disease, obesity, which may in turn reduce stroke risk, or it may be that olive oil is anti-inflammatory or an antioxidant.\u201d Scarmeas writes an accompanying editorial.\n\n\u201cWe do not know for sure, and we do not know which particular aspect of olive oil is the most relevant to stroke,\u201d he says. \u201cFollowing a 'healthy diet' emerges as an important strategy for prevention of neurological disease, but remains to be proved.\u201d\n\nCathy A.

Chang, M.D., professor, Radiation Oncology and the study's corresponding author.\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women in the U.S. According to the American Cancer Society, more than 222,500 people will be diagnosed and 155,870 will die from the disease in 2017, with the majority of patients still being diagnosed when the disease is in an advanced stage.\n\n\"Advanced lung cancer patients with inoperable disease traditionally have been treated with concurrent chemotherapy and conventional photon radiation therapy. However, the therapy can be very difficult for patients due to associated toxicities and because many patients are also dealing with comorbidities,\" explained Chang.\n\nProton therapy is an advanced type of radiation treatment that uses a beam of protons to deliver radiation directly to the tumor, destroying cancer cells while sparing healthy tissues. Protons enter the body with a low radiation dose and stop at the tumor, matching its shape and volume or depth. They deposit the bulk of their cancer-fighting energy right at the tumor, thereby reducing the dose to cardiopulmonary structures, which impacts the toxicity, functional status, quality of life and even survival for patients, explained Chang.\n\n\"With our study, we hypothesized that proton therapy would offer a survival benefit to patients and reduce treatment-associated toxicities, which can be very serious,\" he said.\n\nThe study opened at MD Anderson in 2006; in this research, Chang and his colleague report on the study's five-year results.\n\nFor the prospective Phase II trial, 64 patients with inoperable, Stage III non-small-cell lung cancer were enrolled. The study's primary endpoint was OS. The researchers hypothesized that the median OS would increase from historical data of 16 months on standard therapy to 24 months. Secondary endpoints included distant metastasis and local and regional recurrence rates. Toxic effects of treatment in both the acute and late settings also were analyzed.\n\nMedian follow up was 27.3 months for all patients, and 79.6 months for alive patients. At five years, the median OS was 26.5 months, and the corresponding five-year OS was 29 percent. Median progression-free survival was 12.9 months, with a five-year progression-free survival of 22 percent.\n\nIn sum, 39 patients experienced a relapse, with distant sites representing 62 percent of all recurrences. Local and regional recurrence rates were low, 16 percent and 14 percent, respectively.\n\nAmong the acute and late toxic effects diagnosed in patients were: esophagitis, pneumonitis and cardiac arrhythmia. Of note, said Chang, no patients developed the most severe, or grade five, toxicities, as seen in patients who receive standard of care.\n\nChang noted his study is not without limitations. Of greatest significance: the study was designed more than a decade ago. While the study's survival, recurrence rates and toxic effects are still favorable when compared to rates associated with the most advanced traditional photon radiation therapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), technology to diagnose and stage the disease, as well all treatment modalities have significantly improved.\n\n\"When the study opened, PET imaging had just been approved for lung cancer staging. The image quality was poor and didn't include a CT component in most facilities across the country,\" said Chang. \"Obviously, the technology has improved dramatically over the last decade and has made a significant impact on diagnosis and staging. Also, delivery of both the conventional intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and proton therapy (IMPT), have improved, thereby reducing side effects for both treatment modalities.\"\n\nFor example, MD Anderson proton therapy patients with advanced lung cancer now can receive IMPT. The technique uses an intricate network of magnets to aim a narrow proton beam at a tumor and \"paint\" the radiation dose onto it layer by layer. Healthy tissue surrounding the tumor is spared, and side effects are even more reduced than earlier proton delivery, said Chang.\n\nChang also noted the advancements in cancer biology and immunotherapy and that both are important areas of research focus in combination with proton therapy.\n\nIn addition to Chang, other authors on the all-MD Anderson study include: Stephen Hahn, M.D., Ritsuko Komaki, M.D., Pamela K.

Francesco Cappuccio, head of the World Health Organization\u2019s collaborating center for nutrition at Warwick University, said it was \u201ca surprisingly poor piece of work.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis study does not change the priorities outlined worldwide for a population reduction in salt intake to prevent heart attacks and strokes, the greatest killers in the world,\u201d he said in an emailed comment.\n\nSimon Capewell, a professor of Clinical Epidemiology at Liverpool University, said the review was \u201cdisappointing and inconclusive\u201d and did not change public health consensus that dietary salt raises blood pressure.\n\nMost experts are agreed that consuming too much salt is not good for you and that cutting salt intake can reduce hypertension in people with normal and high blood pressure.\n\nMany developed nations have government-sanctioned guidelines calling on people to cut their salt or sodium intake for the sake of their longer-term health. The World Health Organization (WHO) lists reducing salt intake among its top 10 \u201cbest buys\u201d for reducing rates of chronic disease.\n\nIn Britain, the National Institute of Health and Clinical Guidance (NICE) has called for an acceleration of the reduction in salt in the general population from a maximum intake of 6 grams(g) a day for adults by 2015 to 3 g by 2025.\n\nU.S. guidelines recommend Americans consume less than 2.3 g of salt daily, or 1.5 g for certain people who are more at risk for high blood pressure or heart disease.\n\nWhile previous trials have found there is a blood pressure benefit from cutting salt, research has yet to show if that translates into better overall heart health in the wider population. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases \u2014 the leading causes of death worldwide.\n\nTaylor said he thought it did not find any evidence of big benefits because the numbers of people studied and the salt intake reductions were relatively small.\n\n\u201cThe people in the trials we analyzed only reduced their salt intake by a moderate amount, so the effect on blood pressure and heart disease was not large,\u201d he said.\n\nFor this review, Taylor\u2019s team found seven studies that together included 6,489 participants. This gave the researchers enough data to be able to start drawing conclusions, they said. But even so, the scientists think they would need to have data from at least 18,000 people before they could expect to identify any clear health benefits.\n\nElaine Rush, a professor of nutrition at Auckland University of Technology in Australia, said that putting a spotlight on single trials and generalizing dietary advice for a single nutrient such as salt was \u201cnot helpful.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is helpful is for the food industry to reformulate products to reduce sodium and increase the nutrient quality of foods by using real ingredients,\u201d she said in an emailed comment.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "This story did not engage in overt disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Heart scans for patients with chest pains could save thousands of lives in the UK, research suggests.\n\nThe life-saving scans helped to spot those with heart disease so they could be given treatments to prevent heart attacks.\n\nResearchers say current guidelines should be updated to incorporate the scans into routine care.\n\nThe SCOT-HEART study tracked more than 4000 patients who were referred to a hospital clinic with symptoms of angina - a condition that restricts the blood supply to the heart.\n\nHalf of the patients were given a scan called a computed tomography angiogram, or CTA, in addition to standard diagnostic tests.\n\nAfter receiving the scan, the number of patients suffering a heart attack within five years dropped by 40 per cent, the study found.\n\nThe number of patients undergoing additional procedures increased within the first year but had levelled out by the end of the five-year period.

It is a painful infection of a single sensory nerve on one side of the body that can occur almost anywhere but most commonly involves the torso or face. Initial symptoms of tingling or burning pain within days develop into a red bumpy rash and very painful blisters.\n\nThe blisters heal in a week or two to form crusty scabs that eventually fall off. But for about 15 percent of people, shingles does not end there. Instead, it leaves them with deep, searing nerve pain \u2014 a condition called postherpetic neuralgia, or PHN \u2014 that can last for months or years and has no treatment or cure. More than half the cases of PHN affect people over 60.\n\nOther possible complications of shingles include pneumonia, hearing problems, blindness and encephalitis.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. Although most people get shingles only once, it can happen again, especially if you have a weakened immune system, which most everyone does with advancing age.\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky you may detect the onset of shingles before the rash appears. Years ago when I went to bed with what had been a daylong gnawing irritation on one side of my back, I awakened in the middle of the night with the thought, \u201cI have shingles.\u201d First thing in the morning I got a prescription for the antiviral drug acyclovir, which halted progress of the disease.\n\nNot willing to trust my luck a second time, I got the new vaccine.

According to the C.D.C., Shingrix can protect 97 percent of people in their 50s and 60s and 91 percent of those in their 70s and 80s. It also reduces the risk of PHN by 86 percent, and it appears to be longer lasting than Zostavax, which starts to lose its protection after three years.\n\nWhat makes Shingrix so much better is the inclusion of a substance called an adjuvant that boosts the body\u2019s immune response to the vaccine. Another difference is that Zostavax contains a live, weakened virus, making it unsuitable for people with poor immunity, whereas Shingrix contains a nonliving virus particle and may eventually be approved for those with compromised immunity, who are especially susceptible to a severe case of shingles.\n\nI should tell you that the new vaccine is not exactly a walk in the park. The shot itself is painful and can cause a sore arm for a day or two.

In Japan, \u201cfood and health care companies have found cosmetic applications for their ingredients, so they are creating skin care brands.\u201d\n\nFor example, Frutarom, a flavor-ingredient house based in Israel, makes Alguard, a purified polysaccharide shield from a red microalgae that it says protects skin from daily assaults and reduces roughness as well as the look of fine lines.\n\nThere are more than 100 algae-derived ingredients used in cosmetics worldwide, Mrs. Lewis said.

This testing also demonstrated that alguronic acid provided protection against cell damage induced by ultraviolet rays, and inhibited the enzymes that break down elastin.\n\nAfter reviewing press materials and Solazyme\u2019s 84-page patent application, Dr. David McDaniel, a dermatologist and the director of the Institute of Anti-Aging Research in Virginia Beach, Va., said he was impressed by the in-vitro testing of alguronic acid. \u201cIn the petri dish, their data seems to show some substantial benefits to their active ingredient,\u201d he said.

And for some women, those injections could even be downright dangerous.\n\nAlthough IVF is still considered the gold standard, there\u2019s an infertility treatment available that is offering hope \u2014 in vitro maturation (IVM). IVM has the potential to improve the chances for women to have babies without a long course of hormones.\n\nWhat is IVM?\n\n IVM is an experimental fertility treatment that collects and matures a woman\u2019s eggs in a lab. Although the treatment is used in conjunction with IVF, the initial process isn\u2019t the same.\n\nWith IVF, a woman must undergo between 8 to 11 nights of ovary-stimulating hormone injections before her eggs can be retrieved. With IVM, women undergo a shorter course\u2014 between 3 and 6 days\u2014 of hormones known as a \u201cpriming phase.\u201d\n\nOnce the eggs are retrieved, they\u2019re matured in a laboratory for approximately three days, fertilized and then implanted. They can also be frozen as eggs or embryos to be implanted later.\n\nClinics that specialize in IVM require a doctor who has expertise in retrieving small eggs and a lab with embryologists who have the skills to look for them, said Dr. Janelle Luk, medical director of Neway Fertility in New York City.\n\nWho is IVM helpful for?\n\nAlthough IVF is considered the standard of care, experts say some women may benefit from IVM.\n\nFor starters, since there is less time involved with IVM, women who are undergoing chemotherapy, radiation or plan to have surgery may be good candidates.\n\nIVM may also help women who have a contraindication to the increased levels of estradiol, a form of estrogen, which elevates as the follicles develop and mature. These would include women with an estrogen-sensitive cancer or a history of blood clots.\n\nIVM can also help women who are adverse to injections or who have failed IVF, Luk said.\n\nWomen with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or who are at increased risk for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\u2014 which affects between 3 and 6 percent of women who go through IVF\u2014 may also benefit from IVM. OHSS can usually be managed on an outpatient basis but severe OHSS may lead to blood clots, even death, said Dr. Shefali Shastri, a board-certified reproductive endocrinologist and OB/GYN at Reproductive Medicine Associates of New Jersey in Somerset and Short Hills.\n\nWhat are the limitations of IVM? \n\nA study in the journal Facts, Views and Vision found that IVM achieved up to a 35 percent clinical pregnancy rate in young women, which is comparable to IVF.\n\nYet most studies have found that IVF is superior to IVM.\n\nAlthough there are different protocols for IVF, and there aren\u2019t any randomized controlled trials that have compared IVF and IVM side by side, studies that look at standard IVF cycles show a significantly higher pregnancy rate than IVM, Shastri said.\n\nPlus, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) committee opinion on IVM states that implantation rates for IVM\u2014between 5.5 and 21.6 percent\u2014 are a more reliable indicator of IVM success and are lower than expected for women of the same age who use IVF. They also note that the technology hasn\u2019t been widely used and that there are no studies looking at the outcomes of birth defects or developmental delays.\n\nSince IVM results in lower fertilization rates, protocols that use IVM are more likely to also use intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), in which one sperm is injected into one egg. Although ICSI is safe and effective, the bigger concern is if a patient going through IVM doesn\u2019t use ICSI, Shastri said.\n\nWhile IVM is cheaper initially because there are fewer hormones to take, it may be more costly if several rounds are required.\n\nAlthough IVM may eventually become more common, IVF still remains the standard of care and the most effective way for women to get pregnant.\n\n\u201cWith medicine, you always want to optimize a patient\u2019s outcome,\u201d Shastri said. \u201cUltimately, you want to do the best for the patient so my preference would not be IVM.\u201d", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The article does a pretty good job of noting who is and is not a candidate for IVM.

Writing in the January 6, 2015 issue of the journal Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Disease, a team of scientists and physicians from the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, with counterparts at University of California, Los Angeles, describe a novel imaging technique that measurably improves upon current prostate imaging \u2013 and may have significant implications for how patients with prostate cancer are ultimately treated.\n\n\u201cThis new approach is a more reliable imaging technique for localizing tumors. It provides a better target for biopsies, especially for smaller tumors,\u201d said Rebecca Rakow-Penner, MD, PhD, a research resident in the Department of Radiology and the study\u2019s first author.\n\nThe technique is also valuable in surgical planning and image staging, said David S. Karow, MD, PhD, assistant professor of radiology at UC San Diego and the study\u2019s corresponding author. \u201cDoctors at UC San Diego and UCLA now have a non-invasive imaging method to more accurately assess the local extent of the tumor and possibly predict the grade of the tumor, which can help them more precisely and effectively determine appropriate treatment.\u201d\n\nThe current standard of care for detecting and diagnosing prostate cancer is contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which involves intravenously injecting patients with a contrast agent to highlight blood flow. Greater blood flow is often a requirement of growing cancer cells. When compared to surrounding healthy tissues, it\u2019s hoped that contrast enhanced MRIs will reveal the shape and nature of any tumors present.\n\nBut many tumors do not significantly differ from surrounding healthy tissues with contrast enhanced MRI and so evade easy detection. An imaging technique called diffusion MRI measures the diffusion of water and has been a standard imaging technique in the brain and an emerging technique in the prostate. Cancer tissues are denser than healthy tissues and typically limit the amount and mobility of water within them. But diffusion MRI suffers from magnetic field artifacts that can distort the actual location of tumors by as much as 1.2 centimeters or roughly half an inch \u2013 a significant distance when surgeons are attempting, for example, to assess whether a tumor extends beyond the prostate and into adjacent nerve bundles.\n\nThe new approach described in today\u2019s published paper is called restriction spectrum imaging-MRI or RSI-MRI. It corrects for magnetic field distortions and focuses upon water diffusion within tumor cells. By doing both, the ability of imaging to accurately plot a tumor\u2019s location is increased and there is a more refined sense of the tumor\u2019s extent, said Nathan White, PhD, assistant project scientist at UC San Diego, study co-author and co-inventor of the RSI-MRI technique.\n\nIn a related paper to be published in the journal Frontiers in Oncology, the same team of researchers reported that RSI-MRI appears to predict tumor grade. Higher grade tumors correlate with higher restricted water volume in the cancer cells\u2019 large nuclei.\n\n\u201cProstate cancer can often be an indolent disease, where a patient may only require surveillance rather than aggressive surgery,\u201d noted co-author Christopher J.

It is known that monounsaturated fats can help lower levels of bad cholesterol, reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\nFor their study, Kris-Etherton and colleagues set out to assess how avocado consumption - by replacing saturated fatty acids, or \"bad\" fats - affected risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases.\n\nThe team recruited 45 healthy participants aged 21-70 years who were either obese or overweight.\n\nEvery participant was required to follow each of three cholesterol-lowering diets for 5 weeks. The diets consisted of a lower-fat diet without avocado, a moderate-fat diet without avocado or a moderate-fat diet with one Hass avocado a day.\n\nPrior to starting each diet, subjects ate what the researchers deem an \"average American diet,\" which was made up of 34% of calories from fat, 16% from protein, while around half of calories were from carbohydrates.\n\nFrom both of the moderate-fat diets, participants gained 34% of calories from fat, of which 17% were from monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). The lower-fat diet provided participants with 24% of calories from fat, of which 11% was from MUFAs.\n\nModerate-fat diet with one avocado a day lowered 'bad' cholesterol by 13.5 mg/dL\n\nThe researchers found that participants' levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) - referred to as the \"bad\" cholesterol - were an average of 8.3 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) lower after following the lower-fat diet without an avocado and 7.4 mg/dL lower after following the moderate-fat diet without an avocado, compared with their baseline average.\n\nHowever, after participants followed the moderate-fat diet with one avocado a day, their LDL levels were found to be an average of 13.5 mg/dL lower than their baseline average.\n\nWhat is more, the team found that a number of additional blood measurements - such as total cholesterol, small dense LDL, triglycerides and non-HDL (high-density lipoprotein) - were better after participants followed the moderate-fat diet with one avocado a day, compared with the other two diets.\n\nAlthough these findings demonstrate that an avocado a day alongside a moderate-fat diet has the potential to reduce bad cholesterol, the team notes that their research was a controlled feeding study. \"That is not the real-world,\" says Kris-Etherton, \"so it is a proof-of-concept investigation.\"\n\nStill, the team believes their findings indicate that people should consider replacing saturated fatty acids in their diet with healthier fats from avocados and other sources. Kris-Etherton adds:\n\n\"We need to focus on getting people to eat a heart-healthy diet that includes avocados and other nutrient-rich food sources of better fats. In the United States avocados are not a mainstream food yet, and they can be expensive, especially at certain times of the year. Also, most people do not really know how to incorporate them in their diet except for making guacamole. But guacamole is typically eaten with corn chips, which are high in calories and sodium. Avocados, however, can also be eaten with salads, vegetables, sandwiches, lean protein foods (like chicken or fish) or even whole.\"\n\nIt should be noted that this research was supported by the Hass Avocado Board, but the researchers say the organization played no other role in the study.\n\nIn January 2014, Medical News Today reported on a study suggesting that consuming half an avocado with lunch each day may satisfy hunger in overweight individuals and help with weight management.\n\nOur Knowledge Center article on the health benefits of avocado reveals some of the other ways the food may be good for us, as well as the potential risks of avocado consumption.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story does not resort to disease mongering to make its case.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "July 7, 2010 -- The FDA says it has approved the use of micro-sized implantable telescopes to improve vision in patients with end-stage, age-related macular degeneration.\n\nThe tiny device, called an Implantable Miniature Telescope (IMT), is designed to replace the natural lens.

All improve survival by a few months.\n\nThe FDA also has put a Merck melanoma drug, lambrolizumab, on a fast track to approval by designating it a \"breakthrough\" therapy.\n\nSeveral other drug companies are also working on melanoma therapies.\n\nMelanoma research will take center stage at the four-day annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which begins Friday in Chicago. Doctors will present 288 melanoma studies, compared to only 62 a decade ago.\n\n\"The number of new melanoma therapies is sort of astonishing,\" says melanoma researcher Lynn Schuchter, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. \"The pace is unbelievable.\"\n\nNo one can claim to have cured melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, which is diagnosed in 77,000 Americans a year and kills more than 9,400.\n\nBut after decades of failure, the spate of new drugs is helping more patients than ever before, giving people like Herry more time and better quality of life, Schuchter says. Doctors now dare to hope that giving these new drugs in sequence, or in combination, will help people with melanoma live for years while feeling relatively good.\n\nUnlike traditional chemo, which indiscriminately kills growing cells, the new generation of melanoma drugs work in a precise way, based on a better understanding of the specific genes and proteins that drive cancer growth, says Timothy Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation.\n\n\"The reason we're seeing these breakthroughs is because we did the basic science research to help us understand how this cancer happens, how it escapes therapy and how it progresses,\" Turnham says.\n\nMany of the new drugs aim to remove melanoma's \"cloaking device,\" allowing it to be recognized and killed by the immune system, says Roy Herbst, chief of medical oncology at the Yale Cancer Center.\n\nOther drugs \u2014 such as the two approved Wednesday, trametinib and dabrafenib \u2014 target growth signals within cancer cells.\n\nHerry has tried two of the newer drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb: ipilumumab, approved in 2011, and an experimental drug called nivolumab.\n\nAlthough her tumors increased while taking ipilumumab, Herry says a CT scan earlier this year found they had shrunk by half after beginning nivolumab.\n\nThe most noticeable side effects from nivolumab have been moderate fatigue and vitiligo, a loss of pigment on some areas of her hands and arms, says Herry, 57, from Santa Cruz, Calif. She's been able to continue working as a registered nurse throughout these latest treatments.\n\nOlder melanoma therapies \u2014 including interferon, interleukin-2 and five chemo drugs \u2014 caused much more serious side effects, leaving her too sick to work, Herry says.\n\nWhen the new immune therapies work, they often keep cancer at bay for a long time, says Schuchter, who has patients whose cancer has been controlled by ipilumumab for three years.\n\nAt the cancer meeting, featured presentations include a study by researcher Mario Sznol, of the Yale Cancer Center, who will discuss long-term results of nivolumab. Researcher Stephen Hodi, of Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, will present the results of combining ipilumumab with an immune-stimulating drug. Doctors from New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center will present research on uveal melanoma, which occurs in the eye, and affects about 1,200 Americans a year.\n\nOther studies released in advance of the conference have shown positive results.\n\nNone of the new drugs works for everyone. And none are risk-free.\n\nIpilumumab can cause severe side effects, created when the immune system attacks the body itself, Schuchter says. Vemurafenib, approved in 2011, can cause non-lethal skin cancers.\n\n\"Doctors will say, 'There are side effects, but they are manageable,'\" Turnham says. \"Well, 'manageable' can mean something different to patients.\"\n\nTurnham knew a 19-year-old woman with melanoma who \"woke up bleeding every morning\" because of rashes caused by one of the new drugs, which targets mutations in a gene called MEK. The woman died a year later.\n\nDrugs such as ipilumumab can seem like breakthroughs to doctors because they help 15% of patients. Patients with a limited time to live may not be so positive, Turnham says.\n\n\"If you are a patient and someone says, 'There is an 85% chance of you spending $120,000 on a drug, and spending four months of your life being sick, with no benefit,' you're not going to be so excited.\"", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease-mongering in the story.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Millions of Australians suffering from kidney stones could soon get relief, with researchers discovering a prostrate treatment can also help ease the painful condition.\n\nPatients with kidney stones were treated with the drug Tamsulosin in an Emergency Medicine Foundation Australasia (EMF) funded clinical trial run across five Australian hospital emergency departments.\n\nTrial leader and specialist emergency medicine physician at The Townsville Hospital, Dr Jeremy Furyk, said Tamsulosin was normally used to treat an enlarged prostate, but the research team found the treatment could also assist the passage of large kidney stones in the urine.\n\n\"Kidney stones are a bit of a mystery, occur frequently in the community and generally affect young, healthy adults,\" Dr Furyk said.\n\n\"It can be extremely painful to pass these jagged little crystallized minerals and it's very common for sufferers to go to an emergency department for treatment.\n\n\"Of more than 400 patients in the trial, we found those who received Tamsulosin passed their large kidney stones more often than the placebo group.\n\n\"This means patients with large stones might not need more complicated treatments including surgeries, and this has potential to improve care and reduce costs.

The drug contains only trace amounts of the psychoactive element THC and does not induce euphoria.\n\nEpidiolex was approved for patients age 2 and older who suffer from Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet syndromes. Both cause uncontrolled daily seizures and put patients at high risk for other physical and intellectual disabilities, injury and early death.\n\nThe disorders afflict fewer than 45,000 people in the United States, but experts expect Epidiolex to be prescribed for other types of epilepsy as well. The drug is the first treatment approved for Dravet syndrome.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the approval was \u201ca reminder that advancing sound development programs that properly evaluate active ingredients contained in marijuana can lead to important medical therapies.\u201d The medication, tested in three randomized, placebo-controlled trials with more than 500 patients, was effective in reducing seizures, the FDA said.\n\nGottlieb noted that the action was \u201cnot an approval of marijuana or all of its components\u201d but rather of one specific CBD medication for a particular use.\n\nThe agency, he added, remains concerned about \u201cthe proliferation and illegal marketing of unapproved CBD-containing products with unproven medical claims.\u201d\n\nIn April, an advisory committee unanimously recommended approval of the drug for the two types of epilepsy.\n\nThe FDA previously cleared medications containing synthetic versions of THC for nausea for patients getting chemotherapy and for other uses, but it had not approved any drug derived from the plant itself. Marijuana and its components, including CBD, are Schedule 1 controlled substances \u2014 meaning they are banned because they are thought to have a high abuse potential, no medical value and serious safety implications.\n\nNow that Epidiolex is approved by the FDA, cannabidiol is expected to be reclassified by the Drug Enforcement Administration within 90 days.

It turns out contemporary science may back these ancient claims.\n\nA new study conducted by the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Public Health found that participants who took naturalistic doses of \"classic\" psychedelics \u2013 magic mushrooms, DMT, mescaline and LSD \u2013 had significantly decreased the likelihood of having suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts and psychological distress.\n\nThe study, published recently in the Journal of Pharmacology, analyzed data from an annual survey conducted by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health that measures substance abuse in relation to mental illness. The data were compiled between 2008 and 2012, and drew from the experiences of 190,000 adults. Participants answered pre-recorded questions about their individual use of classic psychedelics, and the data was collected in person.\n\nOf those surveyed, 13.6%, or about 27,235 people, reported having used classic psychedelics. The results showed that those who had taken these substances in their lifetime had a 19% less likelihood of exhibiting psychological distress in the past month, and their reports of suicidal thoughts in the past year were likely to be 14% lower. What\u2019s more, that same group reported a 36% lower probability of suicide attempts in the past year.\n\nThe National Alliance on Mental Illness estimates that 30,000 people in the U.S. die from suicide each year, and worldwide that number is 1 million. While treatment for mental health disorders has improved markedly in the past century, the suicide rate remains stagnant.\n\nOnly two population studies to date, this one included, specifically address the relationship between mental illness and psychedelics. In 2011, individuals with advanced-stage cancer were given single doses of psilocybin and were found to have reduced long-term incidences of depression and anxiety.\n\nIn recent years, some scientists, such as this study\u2019s lead researcher, Peter S. Hendricks, have been pioneering innovative treatments to help decrease the suicide rate. Hendricks is a clinical psychologist by trade, but his interest in the use of psychedelics was piqued by working with people who struggled with addiction, particularly lifelong cigarette smokers. He says he became \"demoralized\" by patients who had little luck quitting with the intervention programs he and his team developed. Hendricks says psychedelics can possibly help patients shift their priorities, or lead to drastic changes in perspective or even spiritual experiences that will help them improve their mental states.\n\n\"Those who are addicted to, say, smoking or using cocaine, aren't doing so because they believe it's their purpose in life; in fact, often that behavior can conflict with whatever they believe their overall purpose might be. So when you administer a psychedelic, you re-prioritize their values such that whatever their grander purpose might be takes priority,\" Hendricks said in an interview with Newsweek.\n\nThe UAB isn't the first study to flirt with this idea. A smoking-cessation trial in the fall found that lifelong smokers who took several controlled doses of psilocybin demonstrated tobacco abstinence rates of up to 80% in the long term. The heightened connectivity to spirituality has also been demonstrated to curb suicidal thoughts and attempts.\n\nA lack of resources and funding is a hindrance to continuing studies, however, as psychedelics are still classified as schedule 1 narcotics in the U.S. and criminal offenses accompany their possession. While skeptics may question the idea of using psychedelics as treatment for psychological distress, Hendricks emphasizes that he does not advocate for rampant recreational use of psychedelics, or widespread legalization. He believes the data support the idea of demoting psychedelics to schedule 3 or 4, and that they can be used in controlled therapy situations.\n\nThe study does have shortcomings: For one, the data relied on people self-reporting their habits, so there is a possibility of error there. Additionally, the effects of psychedelics on the developing brain are still largely unknown, meaning they could pose a threat to people with a predisposition to schizophrenia. The scientists recognize, too, that it's still unknown if classic psychedelics concretely led to a drop in psychological distress and suicidality; perhaps those who participated in the study and had reported using psychedelics in the past had personalities that made them less susceptible to distress and suicidality in the first place.\n\nCulturally, psychedelics bear quite a bit of baggage: Timothy Leary\u2019s call to \u201cturn on, tune in and drop out\u201d became a countercultural slogan in the 1960s, and proved damaging to potential research on utilizing the drug to improve mental health for more than three decades. Perhaps this study will be a turning point in how our culture regards psychedelics and mental health. \"I know scientists are supposed to be objective and dispassionate,\" Hendricks says. \"But I'm excited and hopeful.

NSAIDs also include prescription medicines called COX-2 enzyme inhibitors, such as Celebrex (celecoxib).\n\n\"Our study showed that users of common painkillers, known as NSAIDs, have a lower risk of the three major types of skin cancer, [including] malignant melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma,\" said study lead author, Sigrun Alba Johannesdottir, at the department of clinical epidemiology at Aarhus University Hospital in Aarhus, Denmark.\n\n\"The greatest effect,\" she noted, \"was found for squamous cell carcinomas and malignant melanoma, especially when [these painkillers were] taken frequently and over a long time period.\"\n\nThe study appears in the May 29 online issue of the journal Cancer.\n\nThe authors noted that prior work supported the notion that NSAIDs may offer some measure of protection against cancer (most notably colorectal cancer), by specifically impeding the cancer-causing activities of COX-2 (cyclooxygenase) enzymes.\n\nHowever, the team suggested that past investigations into how NSAIDs may affect skin cancer risk, in particular, had key design problems that undercut efforts to nail down any NSAID-skin cancer connection.\n\nFor the new study, the researchers analyzed prescription databases and health information registries including the Danish Cancer Registry and the Danish Civil Registration System.\n\nThe team focused on diagnostic and death records concerning nearly 2,000 cases of squamous cell carcinoma, about 13,300 cases of basal cell carcinoma and nearly 3,250 cases of malignant melanoma diagnosed between 1991 and 2009 when the patients were at least 20 years old.\n\nIn turn, prescription histories were gathered for both the cancer patient group and almost 179,000 healthy Danes. Records covered the use of both low- and high-dose aspirin (ranging from 75 milligrams to 500 milligrams), so-called \"nonselective\" NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen [Advil] and naproxen [Aleve]), and both older and newer types of COX-2 inhibitors. Researchers noted the number of prescriptions issued per patient and their length of use, with short-term use defined as fewer than seven years.\n\nThe result: The relative risk for squamous cell carcinoma was found to have dropped by 15 percent among those Danes who had filled more than two NSAID prescriptions, compared to those who had filled two or less.\n\nSimilarly, malignant melanoma risk fell by nearly as much (13 percent) among those filling more than two NSAID prescriptions.\n\nHowever, the same dynamic was generally not seen with regards to basal cell carcinoma. But taking NSAIDs for long periods of time, and at relatively high doses, was associated with a reduced risk (between 15 and 21 percent), specifically for basal cell cases that manifested in skin regions that typically experience relatively little sun exposure (areas other than the neck or head).\n\nOn that front, long-term users and those who took NSAIDs at relatively higher doses appeared to benefit from the strongest protective effect, suggesting that when it comes to skin cancer risk reduction, more NSAID use is better.\n\nThe researchers pointed out that the NSAID-cancer connection could be affected by a range of lifestyle factors they did not account for, such as an individual's specific skin type or sun exposure patterns.\n\nBut Johannesdottir added that \"we hope that our finding will inspire more research on skin cancer prevention. Also, the potential cancer-protective effect should be taken into account when discussing benefits and harms of NSAID use,\" she noted.\n\nHowever, \"other studies need to detail the association further and to examine benefits versus risks,\" she cautioned. \"Meanwhile, the most important prevention against skin cancer remains sun protection.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. William Ting, a private practice dermatologist in San Ramon, Calif., praised the study despite agreeing that many factors are at play when it comes to skin cancer formation.\n\n\"Now we have a better understanding that inflammation also plays a significant role in cancer formation and even skin cancers,\" he said.\n\nAnd, \"this exciting article gives physicians and consumers a relatively simple way of diminishing one's risk of skin cancer by doing what most of us are doing already for heart health,\" Ting added.

While it may seem counterintuitive to treat bacteria with more bacteria, experts say this approach seeks to restore the natural microbial balance of healthy skin.\n\n\"There are over 1,000 species of bacteria that all live in balance on healthy skin, some that even produce natural antibiotics. However, we know that eczema patients lack the beneficial bacteria needed to kill Staph aureus, harmful bacteria that can worsen eczema,\" said Donald Leung, MD, head of the Division of Pediatric Allergy & Immunology at National Jewish Health.\n\nTo fight harmful bacteria, researchers isolate beneficial bacteria from our skin and grow it in a lab. It is then applied to eczema patients' skin as a lotion twice a day for a week. Bacterial DNA from patients' skin is then analyzed in a lab to determine if the cream effectively reduced the amount of bad bacteria present.\n\n\"Ideally, we want to eliminate all staph aureus from the skin of eczema patients,\" said Leung. \"What the cream does is help the skin gain back its natural balance and create that barrier needed to keep it healthy.\"\n\nResearchers hope that using the bacteria-infused cream will offer a long-term solution where other treatments fall short. Powerful antibiotics are commonly prescribed for eczema, but they kill good bacteria on patients' skin along with the bad. Creams containing corticosteroids are also often prescribed to eczema patients, but they come with harsh side effects, and patients usually can't tolerate them for long periods of time.\n\n\"The worst symptom of eczema is the itching and the scratching, and the more you scratch, the more it spreads. It can be very painful,\" said Cassandra Rodriguez, 33, who has struggled with eczema all her life.\n\nCassandra has tried just about every cream and medication on the market, and says when she learned about the clinical trial, she was on board to give it a try.\n\n\"The trial coordinator explained that it's like a probiotic for your skin,\" said Rodriguez. \"You hear all these things about good bacteria for your gut, so it seemed like a promising idea to apply that same concept to the skin.\"\n\nCassandra's son also has eczema, and she's hoping this research will lead to an effective treatment so that he won't have to suffer with the pain and embarrassment of the disease for as long as she has. \"He's little now, but dealing with eczema as a teen and an adult is really difficult,\" said Rodriguez. \"If there were something on the market that could help him and help everyone suffering with eczema every day, that would be amazing.\"\n\nExperts say there is more research to be done, but that the goal of the trial is to discover the best combination of bacteria to clear eczema from the skin and then make it available to patients as a prescription cream. The next steps involve testing those different combinations, ensuring they're safe and conducting a longer trial to see if the benefits of bacterial cream can truly provide a permanent solution for eczema patients.\n\nNational Jewish Health is the leading respiratory hospital in the nation.

Gluten is not a carbohydrate; it\u2019s a mix of proteins found in wheat and its close relatives (including spelt, kamut and farro), as well as in barley and rye. It\u2019s what gives bread its elasticity, but it also sets off the immune system of people with celiac disease, damaging the small intestine and sometimes producing painful and unpleasant symptoms.\n\nEven some people who don\u2019t have celiac disease feel better when they don\u2019t eat wheat. They may assume that they have gluten sensitivity, but some researchers believe that it\u2019s not the gluten they\u2019re sensitive to. Instead, it\u2019s fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols, or FODMAPS.\n\nNever was a group of molecules more desperately in need of an acronym. FODMAPs are a group of carbohydrates that don\u2019t get broken down and absorbed in the small intestine. Instead, they pass through to the large intestine, where they draw water into the gut and start to ferment. The process by which FODMAPs are broken down and fermented can cause gastrointestinal distress: diarrhea, bloating, pain, flatulence and constipation. Wheat and rye are high in FODMAPs, as are onions, garlic, apples, stone fruit, pistachios and many other foods.\n\nResearch by Peter Gibson, a professor of gastroenterology at Australia\u2019s Monash University, has found that some people who believed they were gluten-sensitive were, instead, FODMAP-sensitive. A low-FODMAP diet eased their symptoms, as it does for about 70 percent of people who suffer from irritable bowel syndrome, a condition that causes abdominal pain and bowel changes. Gibson estimates that, overall, about 10 percent of the population may be FODMAP-sensitive.\n\nBut there\u2019s a problem with a low-FODMAP diet. The fermentation that is painful to that 10 percent is good for your gut because it stimulates growth of the kind of bacteria associated with digestive health. \u201cFollowing strictly the low-FODMAP diet is associated with changes in the microbiota that many would not equate with good health,\u201d says Gibson, who stresses that a low-FODMAP diet should be used to reduce specific symptoms, not as a way to improve health.\n\nIf your gut can handle FODMAPs, foods that contain a lot of them can be very good choices \u2014 partly because the fermentation helps your gut biome and partly because the way FODMAPs are digested means you\u2019re absorbing fewer calories than indicated on a FODMAP-rich product\u2019s label.

The study is the first large, multi-institutional study of SBRT in prostate cancer with long-term follow-up.\n\nAlthough prostate tumors generally respond well to radiation therapy (RT), the possibility of radiation exposure to healthy tissue in the genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) systems can be of concern. SBRT is an advanced technique that precisely targets high doses of RT to the tumor in a small number fractions, simultaneously avoiding surrounding tissue and reducing toxicity to non-cancerous cells. The technique has become the standard of care for many non-surgical lung cancer patients, as it limits exposure to the heart and surrounding lungs. When treating tumors in the prostate, SBRT avoids the adjacent bladder, sex organs and rectum.\n\n\u201cSingle-institution studies on the use of SBRT as the primary treatment for prostate cancer have illuminated the treatment as a cost-effective and faster alternative to IMRT,\u201d said Robert Meier, MD, lead author of the study and a radiation oncologist at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle. \u201cOur study is the first to contribute multi-center data that support the use of SBRT as front-line therapy for men with prostate cancer.\u201d\n\nA total of 309 men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer were enrolled in the trial at 21 community, regional and academic hospitals across the U.S. Eligible patients had either low-risk disease (CS T1-T2a, Gleason 6, PSA < 10) (n = 172) or intermediate-risk disease (CS T1c-T2b with either Gleason 7 and PSA < 10, or Gleason 6 and PSA 10-20). All of the men received SBRT via a non-isocentric robotic platform, with an RT dose to the prostate of 40 Gy administered in five treatment sessions of 8 Gy each. Intermediate risk patients received a dose of 36.25 Gy to the seminal vesicles. Concurrent and adjuvant androgen ablation therapy were prohibited among study participants.\n\nPrimary outcomes included GU and GI toxicities and relapse-free survival (RFS). Researchers measured toxicity using the National Cancer Institute\u2019s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0. Biochemical failure was assessed using the ASTRO-consensus and the nadir+2 definitions. Overall survival (OS) was measured as a secondary outcome for the study. Actuarial OS and RFS were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier statistical method. Median follow-up was 61 months.\n\nAt five years following SBRT, 97 percent of patients were free from prostate cancer progression. In low-risk patients, the cancer control rates was superior to historical controls. Specifically in the low-risk group, the five-year RFS rate was 97.3 percent, which is superior to the 93 percent historical comparison DFS control rate (p = 0.014). Actuarial five-year OS was 95.6 percent for the entire cohort. Actuarial five-year nadir+2 RFS was 97.1 percent for all patients, representing 97.3 percent of low-risk and 97.1 of intermediate-risk patients. Actuarial five-year ASTRO RFS was 92.3 percent and 91.3 percent for low- and intermediate-risk groups, respectively.\n\nFewer than two percent of all patients experienced serious side effects in the five years following SBRT. Five grade three GU side effects were reported in four of the 309 study participants. There were no reported grade four or five toxicities nor any grade three GI toxicities. Between half and two-thirds of patients experienced less serious side effects, with rates of 53 and 59 percent for grade one GU and GI toxicities and rates of 35 and 10 percent for grade two GU and GI toxicities, respectively. These side effects were usually temporary.\n\n\u201cOur results illustrate how advanced technology has radically improved our ability to target cancer,\u201d said Dr. Meier. \u201cAfter following patients for more than five years, we found that serious side effects from a brief course of SBRT were uncommon and that cancer control rates were very favorable compared to historical data. Our trial confirms that SBRT may be preferable to other treatment approaches for newly-diagnosed cases of prostate cancer, including more aggressive disease.\u201d\n\nThe abstract, \u201cFive-Year Outcomes from a Multi-Center Trial of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Low- and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer,\u201d will be presented in detail during a scientific session at ASTRO\u2019s 58th Annual Meeting at 7:45 a.m. Eastern time on Monday, September 26, 2016.

The United States has banned or restricted the sale of ephedra products because of concerns about possible complications, such as heart attack, stroke and even death, related to its use as a weight-loss supplement.\n\nThe authors discuss their findings in the Aug. 16 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nThe 2009 H1N1 (\"swine flu\") pandemic sparked influenza cases around the globe, resulting in nearly 18,000 deaths, the authors said.\n\nPer World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, in most instances, Tamiflu was the treatment of choice, where it was available. However, it is often out of reach in less developed parts of the world, such as rural China, where traditional herbal medicines are a likely default treatment.\n\nThe M-Y flu preparation is composed of 12 herbs: ephedrae, zhimu, qinghao, shigao, yinhua, huangqin, chaoxingren, lianqiao, bohe, zhebeimu, niubangzi and gancao.\n\nTo compare the relative effectiveness of M-Y and Tamiflu in treating H1N1 influenza, the authors focused on 410 previously healthy patients who were diagnosed with a \"very mild\" form of the illness.\n\nThe men and women were relatively young, with an average age of 19. They were being treated in 11 different medical facilities across four Chinese provinces during the height of the pandemic, between July and November of 2009, to prevent spreading the flu, not because their symptoms were severe.\n\nWithin 72 hours of the onset of symptoms, the patients were assigned to one of four five-day treatment groups. One group was given 75 milligrams of Tamiflu twice a day in capsule form; a second group received 200 milliliters of M-Y four times a day in liquid form; a third group took the same dosages of Tamiflu and M-Y together; and a fourth group received no treatment.\n\nAll of the herbs were screened for quality, and the M-Y mixture was deemed to meet Chinese safety standards.\n\nThe results: Both M-Y and Tamiflu were effective at eliminating fever, whether administered on their own or in combination.\n\nAll three approaches helped to resolve fever sooner than no intervention whatsoever, the authors said, noting it appeared that fever dissipated fastest when M-Y and Tamiflu were given together. However, none of the treatment methods appeared to be superior in terms of overall viral control, and side effects were minimal in all cases.\n\nEven though the ephedra-containing herbal is not readily available in the United States, the M-Y herbal formula is available in many countries besides China, including Korea, Japan, India and Germany, the study authors noted.\n\nDuffy MacKay, vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs at the Council for Responsible Nutrition, which represents the dietary supplement industry, believes that fears over ephedra's use as a weight-control agent have overlooked \"its more traditional and much safer\" role as a medicine against lung inflammation.\n\nMacKay said that in China, traditional medicine is \"seamlessly integrated\" into everyday medical practice.\n\n\"Here in the U.S., we do things differently,\" he said. \"We have our prescription drugs on the one hand, and then we have dietary supplements on the other.\"\n\nBut, MacKay continued, \"it should also be understood that these two treatments actually work very differently. Tamiflu works to stop viral replication. But the herbal formula is working on symptoms to help people become more comfortable. And those are two very different goals,\" he noted.\n\n\"So our advice,\" MacKay added, \"is that because H1N1 can be very serious, it's very important to see your doctor. And once you're under the care of your licensed physician there's certainly a lot of things in the world of botanicals that might help.\"\n\nFor more on the flu and traditional medicine, visit the U.S. National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "Although the writer didn\u2019t hype the problem of influenza (which does result in a large number of deaths every year), the majority of those with the flu do not require treatment. So the story edges into disease-mongering territory when it suggests that Tamiflu was the \u201ctreatment of choice\u201d for most cases of H1N1. In fact, antiviral drugs were unconditionally recommended by WHO guidelines only for certain groups, such as those with severe illness or who were at\u00a0risk of developing a severe illness.\u00a0Patients like those in this study who had \u201cvery mild\u201d cases of the flu were not necessarily candidates for treatment with antivirals because their illnesses were typically short and self-limited and would not\u00a0be substantially affected by taking Tamiflu. In addition, overuse of antivirals encourages the development of drug resistant virus strains. By failing to draw this distinction, the story leads readers to believe that every case of H1N1, even very mild ones,\u00a0should be treated with Tamiflu, which is not accurate.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Morristown, N.J., Aug. 7, 2017 - As we age, managing healthy weight may become more difficult due to a slowing metabolism, however, help may come from a fiery source -- the capsicum pepper. A recent paper, Capsaicinoids Enhance Metabolic Rate in Normal Healthy Individuals using a Novel Metabolic Tracker Breezing Device-An Open Label Placebo Controlled Acute Study, published in the journal Obesity Open Access discussed the findings of the Metabolic Rate (MR) Study, which demonstrated that an extract from red hot peppers boosted metabolic rate (Chen, et al., 2017).\n\n\"Because capsaicinoids (the component of hot peppers that gives them heat) are hot, it was imperative that we use an ingredient which the subjects could tolerate,\" said Vijaya Juturu, Ph.D., F.A.C.N., one of the lead researchers on the MR Study. \"Since Capsimax is made using a proprietary beadleting technology, OmniBead, which coats the capsicum extract, releasing it only when it reaches the intestines where it is absorbed without discomfort, we were able to deliver beneficial levels of capsaicinoids to our subjects, which made the MR Study possible.\"\n\nThe MR Study was a placebo-controlled, crossover open label study with 40 healthy adults examining the effects of either 2 mg capsaicinoids from 100 mg of Capsimax or placebo on resting energy expenditure, heart rate and blood pressure. Resting energy expenditure is the amount of energy required by the body during resting conditions and accounts up to 60% of the calories you burn each day and so increasing this amount can aid in managing weight. The study showed that supplementing with this low dose of Capsimax increased metabolic rate which calculated to an equivalent to burning an extra 116 calories per day. Moreover, though resting energy expenditure varies with each individual, this increase would yield almost 1 lb. of fat lost over 30 days.\n\n\"Aging is inevitable, but that doesn't mean we can't be active participants in our weight management as we age,\" said Abhijit Bhattacharya, President of OmniActive Health Technologies Ltd., producers of Capsimax. \"Capsimax is supported by multiple studies with findings showing safety, increased lipolysis and satiety and improved healthy body composition.

Earlier studies had proved that low-calorie diets could reduce weight and alter metabolism in obese people.\n\nA six-month study in 48 people directed by Dr. Ravussin, being published today in The Journal of the American Medical Association, is the first rigorous test of calorie restriction in people who are overweight but not obese. Most participants reduced calories by 25 percent, but some cut back more and ate only 890 calories a day for several months.\n\n\"There's never been a study like this one,\" said Dr. Evan Hadley, director of geriatrics and clinical gerontology at the National Institute on Aging, which paid for the study. He called the results \"striking,\" even though the experiment was only a pilot study for a two-year trial of calorie restriction due to begin in the fall.\n\nAmong the main findings of Dr. Ravussin's study was that calorie restriction led to decreases in insulin levels and body temperature. Both are considered signs of longevity, partly because an earlier study by other researchers found both traits in long-lived people. The diet also led to a drop in thyroid hormones and declines in DNA damage.\n\nBut Dr. Ravussin and Dr. Hadley cautioned that the study was preliminary, and that it did not prove that calorie restriction could make people healthier or add years to their lives.\n\n\"It's an important step along the way,\" Dr. Hadley said.\n\nScientists have known for years that when people cut calories and lose weight, the body tries to compensate by slowing its metabolic rate. The slowing is a defensive mechanism to fight weight loss. It was probably preserved by evolution because it saved people from starving to death when food was scarce, but it is the bane of dieters because it means that the more weight they lose, the harder it is to keep reducing.\n\nSeveral explanations exist for why a strict diet, low in calories but high in nutrients, may slow aging. Many scientists think that an important factor in aging is DNA damage caused by free radicals, highly reactive oxygen-containing molecules formed during normal metabolism. Eating less leads to a slower metabolism and fewer free radicals.\n\nAnother possibility is that being deficient in calories turns certain genes on and off, with a net effect of slowing the clock.\n\nIn rhesus monkeys, calorie restriction has had pronounced effects. A University of Wisconsin team led by Richard Weindruch has been studying 76 monkeys for more than a decade, half on low-calorie diets and half in a control group that eats normally.\n\nThe low-calorie animals weigh about 30 percent less and have 70 percent less body fat than the controls, as well as lower insulin levels. The calorie-restricted monkeys have had two cases of cancer, compared with five in the controls. The controls have had twice the death rate from aging-related diseases like heart failure and diabetes. About 90 percent of the monkeys on low-calorie diets are still alive, compared with only about 70 percent of the controls.\n\nDr. Ravussin's study included men and women, ages 27 to 49, who were overweight but not obese. Some were just a bit heavy, but others were 30 pounds overweight.\n\nFor six months, a control group ate a diet created to maintain members' weights. Another group ate 75 percent of what members needed to keep their weight steady. A third group had members' calories cut 12.5 percent and their exercise increased to burn off 12.5 percent.\n\nThe final group went on an extreme diet of 890 calories a day \u2014 less than half of what most adults need \u2014 for two or three months, until members lost about 15 percent of their body weight. They then switched to a diet meant to keep them at their new lower weight.\n\nPart of the reason for the study, Dr. Ravussin said, was to find out whether people could stand calorie restriction. The participants, who were paid, turned out to be highly motivated, he said. Some were concerned about their weight and health. They had to take time off work for metabolism tests and also ate many meals at the clinic.\n\nJerelyn Key, 44, a Social Security claims representative, joined because she wanted to learn better eating habits for herself and her family. Ms. Key was assigned to the very-low-calorie group. For two months, she ate four or five shakes a day and a specially formulated \"brownie,\" adding up to just 890 calories a day. She is 5-foot-7, and her starting weight was 165 to 170; after two months she had lost about 28 pounds.\n\n\"I look back now wondering how I managed to do it,\" Ms. Key said. She has regained a bit and now weighs 140 to 145 pounds.\n\nAnother participant, Oscar Couvillion, 45, an insurance database administrator, said he was lured by a radio advertisement offering participants $7,000. There was heart disease in Mr. Couvillion's family, and at 5-foot-9, he weighed 192 pounds, about 30 pounds too much.\n\nHe wound up in the group assigned to cut calories by 25 percent. At first, he said, \"I was starving to death, I had headaches, I was grouchy.\" But cheered on by therapists in the study, he stuck with it and lost 30 pounds. He said joining the study was one of the best decisions he had ever made.\n\n\"You're not going to ask me what I weigh now, are you?\" he said, adding that he weighed 176. \"I have to repent. Now I know what to do.\"", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There isn\u2019t any discussion of how many Americans are overweight but not obese, so we can\u2019t judge the story unsatisfactory on this criterion.

This discovery won the Nobel Prize in 2006.\n\nBut the work that nabbed the prize was done in worms -- a far cry from humans.\n\nAnd there were other challenges, not the least of which was how to get the siRNAs into the appropriate cell and then make sure they did what they were supposed to do.\n\nThis team, from the California Institute of Technology (CalTech), devised a super-small nanoparticle system that, when injected into the body, would make its way to the tumor, deposit the siRNAs into the tumor cell and leave them to their assigned task.\n\nThis early-phase clinical trial involved actual patients with melanoma, a particularly virulent form of skin cancer.\n\nThe experiment proceeded just as planned, as biopsies later showed.\n\nThe researchers injected the cargo-laden nanoparticles into the patients, much as you would administer a flu or any other type of shot. They did not inject directly into the tumor as many other researchers have done.\n\nThe nanoparticles made their way smoothly to the target -- the tumor cell -- and cleaved the mRNA in just the right place, stopping production of the culprit protein.\n\nThe precision of the process is crucial to limiting side effects, the researchers said.\n\n\"Now you can go selectively at proteins involved in the disease and not have off-target effects,\" explained Mark E. Davis, lead author of the paper, and professor of chemical engineering at CalTech in Pasadena. \"Normally when you make drugs, it's hard to say 'attack only that protein.' In this particular case, I'm going to go in at the genetic level and eliminate that one protein I want to eliminate.\"\n\nAnd unlike conventional gene therapy -- where the offending gene is replaced by a new one or overridden -- this therapy is reversible, said Adams.\n\n\"This will run its course. Ultimately, it will restore itself,\" he said.\n\nThe authors believe the same system could provide a highly targeted, selective way to reach many different genes and affect tumors that have untll now eluded drug therapy.\n\nObviously, the process will have to be refined and optimized before it's actually used for treatment.\n\n\"This is the first qualitative 'yes, we can do it' publication and it really has to be kept in that perspective,\" Adams said.\n\nThere's more on RNA interference at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "Not applicable because no diseases were discussed in any detail.

About 70 percent of smokers give up the daunting effort during the first week of trying.\n\nThe researchers, led by Caryn Lerman, a professort of psychiatry, divided 1,246 subjects into slow metabolizers of nicotine and normal metabolizers of the addictive chemical, based on the length of time it took for them to rid their bodies of the drug. The ratio of two metabolites, or byproducts, of the body's processing of nicotine allows easy identification of the two groups. The metabolite is found in blood and saliva.\n\nThe results of the comparison showed that slow metabolizers did just as well on a nicotine patch or the drug varenicline (marketed as Chantix), a drug that works on the nicotine receptors in the brain. But the patch costs less and has fewer side-effects than varenicline (including nausea, difficulty sleeping and abnormal dreams), so the researchers concluded that slow metabolizers should be put on the patch.\n\nNormal metabolizers of nicotine, meanwhile, had more success with varenicline because they tend to rid their systems of nicotine faster, limiting the effectiveness of the patch. Varenicline contains no nicotine.\n\n\"The slower metabolizers, they do very well with the patch. And they get no incremental benefit from varenicline,\" Lerman said in an interview. \"Why spend the money? Why have the side-effects?\"\n\nThis may seem like common sense, but no one had ever tested it before, she said. And given how difficult it is to kick the habit, smokers need all the help they can get to succeed the first time they try, Lerman said.\n\n\"Each time somebody fails, it affects their self confidence,\" Lerman said. \"The trial and error approach is not optimal.\"\n\nResearchers did not test nicotine gum because it delivers a less consistent flow of nicotine to the user, she said. The patch, worn on the skin, delivers a steady flow of the drug, she said.\n\nIn some of the test groups, overall success rates were fairly low, Lerman noted, but the study was conducted during the Great Recession, a time when financial stress may have depressed the chances of succeeding for everyone, regardless of which approach was used.\n\nThis post has been updated.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story did not exaggerate the dangers of smoking.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "In 2012, a federally funded panel of experts on preventive care concluded there are more risks than benefits to screening American men for prostate cancer with the PSA test.

People don't even like to say the word out loud.\n\nThe good news, we're told, is that there are many things we can do \u2013 or not do \u2013 in our adult lives to lower our risk of developing different types of cancer. Want to avoid lung cancer? Don't smoke. Want to lower your risk of skin cancer? Stay out of the sun, or utilize a proper sunscreen.\n\nBut a new study published Monday in Cancer suggests that at least one decision our parents make FOR us may have an impact on our predisposition to certain types of cancer.\n\nResearchers at the University of Washington School of Medicine and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center looked at the association between circumcision and the prevalence of prostate cancer. They concluded that circumcision before first sexual intercourse is associated with a 15% reduction in the relative risk of developing prostate cancer.\n\nIt's important to note, right off the bat, that this study is not purporting to establish a cause and effect relationship. As is often the case, there are many additional factors at play.\n\nFirst, a bit of background. It has long been established that men who are uncircumcised are more prone to contracting sexually transmitted infections. As the study's authors point out, \"The mechanism(s) by which circumcision reduced acquisition of an STI [sexually transmitted infection] is thought to be related to the microenvironment of the thin, lightly keratinized mucosal lining of the inner foreskin.\"\n\nThis tissue is subject to small tears that allow potential access of pathogens into the bloodstream. Furthermore, \"The moist environment under the preputial skin may help pathogens survive for extended periods prior to direct infection.\" Circumcision, of course, removes this protective environment.\n\nWhy is this important? Infections are reported to cause almost 20% of cancers worldwide, either directly by infection, or indirectly via inflammation. Several STIs \u2013 such as gonorrhea, Chlamydia, HPV & HIV \u2013 have been found in the prostate.\n\nParticipants in the study were asked about their family\u2019s medical history, which may increase a man\u2019s risk of developing prostate cancer, and their PSA screening history, which can lead to overdiagnosis of the condition. Men were also asked to self-report their circumcision status, number of sexual partners, and their history of STIs.\n\nCircumcision was reported in 68.8% of the cases and 71.5% of the controls. Caucasian men more commonly reported circumcision (69%) than African American men (43%). For 91% who reported circumcision, the procedure was performed shortly after birth.\n\nA few potential caveats to note include the reliance on self-reporting when it comes to a man's history of STIs, as well as his sexual partners. A cursory review of the data suggests, for example, that the number of male sexual partners is greatly underreported. Male-to-male sexual activity has been shown to lead to an increased rate in STIs, including HIV.\n\nThis gives pause to make one wonder what other facts were underreported, though the numbers of circumcised vs. not circumcised do fall in line with national survey results.\n\nThe bottom line from the American Cancer Society: While this is an interesting finding, it's not likely to spur any change in recommendations or medical practice.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "We\u2019ll flag this story for an overly bombastic and totally unnecessary lead sentence.

We think this test could change that,\" she said.\n\nIn a new study published in the journal Academic Emergency Medicine, Papa and her team recently performed CT scans on 152 children and compared the results of those scans with results from the blood test she developed. As expected, the high definition imagery from the CT scans was able to identify which patients had suffered visible traumatic brain injuries. Moreover, the study showed that the blood test detected symptoms of concussions, even when brain injuries were not visible on the CT scan.\n\nThe team then tested blood serum from the same patients, which was taken less than 6 hours after their injuries. \"With our blood test, we were able to identify the presence of brain injuries 94 percent of the time,\" said Papa. \"This simple blood test was nearly as accurate as a state-of-the-art CT scan.\"\n\nEven more impressive, the blood test also gave doctors an indication of how severe the brain injury was. \"We were looking at different types of brain lesions detected by the CT scans, ranging from mild to serious injuries, and found that the biomarker we tested for actually corresponded to the injuries. Levels of the biomarker were lower in mild cases, and were much more elevated in severe case,\" said Papa.\n\nThe biomarker this particular blood test looks for is known as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). These proteins are found in glial cells, which surround neurons in the brain.\n\nWhen there's an injury to the brain cells, the GFAP are released. What makes them unique is that they pass the blood-brain barrier and enter the bloodstream, which makes them easy to detect with this particular test.\n\nCurrently, almost all concussions in children are diagnosed only by symptoms, which are either observed, like vomiting or balance problems, or symptoms that are reported by the child, like headaches, blurred vision or feeling groggy. Neither scenario gives doctors an objective indication of the severity of the injury.\n\nCT scans can provide a more definitive profile of the injury, \"however, they are expensive and are associated with radiation exposure,\" said Papa. \"You really want to minimize the amount of CTs you do to your patients, especially children, who are a lot more sensitive to radiation and the side effects that can come with it.\"\n\n\"If there was a simple diagnostic tool like a blood test that can tell us quickly and accurately if a brain injury has occurred, and how severe it might be, that would be ideal,\" said Papa. \"That's what we are striving for with this project.\"\n\nIn fact, Papa envisions the development of mobile devices that could diagnose concussions on the spot, much like the devices diabetics use to test their blood with a simple finger prick and a drop of blood.\n\n\"The idea is to get a point-of-care test that could be used on the field, to help the coaches, the trainers and the athletic directors, make a decision then and there about whether the child should go back to play,\" said Papa.\n\nIt's estimated nearly a quarter of a million children a year are treated in hospitals for traumatic brain injuries like concussions, that occur while playing sports. That's an average of nearly 700 children a every day.\n\n\"If we could find a simple test that takes the guess work out of diagnosing these kids, that would completely change the way we approach concussions and would certainly give parents greater peace of mind,\" said Papa.\n\nResearchers plan to do more studies with the blood test, but they hope it will be commercially available within the next 5 years.", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering here.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "It was an ordinary morning for Stefan Reisch as he was driving to work, when out of nowhere, it seemed to hit.

I felt like I was in a dream state until I finally ran off the road.\u201d\n\n911 calls to police that morning reported a drunk driver on the road and when Reisch crashed, the paramedics were quickly on the scene. First responders asked Reisch to smile and immediately recognized his drooping mouth as a sign of a stroke. At the hospital, the first-line therapy, a powerful blood-thinning medication called tissue plasminogen activator or tPA could not dissolve the blood clots in Reisch\u2019s brain.\n\nSo the doctors at the Comprehensive Stroke Center at the University of California San Diego tried an innovative approach called a stent retriever.\n\nStent retriever therapy essentially captures the clot and pulls it out of the brain. A catheter is placed into a blood vessel in the groin and guided up into the brain through the blocked artery. Then a wire mesh opens, grabbing onto and removing the blood clot while the patient is still having a stroke.\n\nRelated: New Recommendations Say More Americans Should Take Aspirin\n\nFor Reisch, the impact was almost immediate: he began to regain feeling while undergoing the procedure.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re awake through the whole process and actually the doctors are telling you what to do,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cShortly after that he told me I could relax and that I did a good job and they had retrieved the clot and just to relax and I immediately started trying to move my arm.\u201d\n\n\u201cA patient will come in, they can't speak, they can't move half their body,\u201d says neurosurgeon Dr. J Mocco, of Mt.

In April, the journal Radiology published findings that highlight the added importance of removing clots in a timely manner. Researchers examined data on patients treated with both tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the standard in stroke treatment, and stent retrievers and found that restoration of blood flow within 2.5 hours of stroke onset was associated with minimal or no disability in 91 percent of patients.\n\nRoughly 795,000 people suffer a stroke every year in the United States, and it\u2019s the fifth highest cause of death and a leading cause of adult disability, according to the American Heart Association.\n\nFor more than 20 years, an injection of tPA, which dissolves the clot and improves blood flow to the affected part of the brain, has been the standard care for stroke patients. The intravenous drug is very effective for smaller clots, but it often fails to break up larger clots and is usually most effective when given within 4.5 hours after the first symptoms.\n\n\u201cThe earlier that patients with acute ischemic stroke get to a hospital offering the appropriate treatment, the higher the likelihood is of a good outcome,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Mayank Goyal of the Hotchkiss Brain Institute at the University of Calgary.\n\nCurrently, stent retriever therapy is offered in just a few hundred hospitals across the country, including more than 100 Comprehensive Stroke Centers accredited by the American Heart Association and The Joint Commission.\n\nThe new research provides more evidence of the need for new regional centers of care, in order to minimize the time it takes to transport a patient to hospital capable of providing stent therapy, according to Dr. William J.

It's like a death sentence,\" says, Anselmo, now 59.\n\nOnly for her it wasn't.\n\nAnselmo's successful treatment shows how precision medicine \u2014 tailoring therapy to each patient's genetic needs \u2014 is beginning to transform cancer care.\n\nAt first, the outlook seemed grim. Although Anselmo's surgeon was able to surgically remove most of her tumor, she couldn't tolerate traditional chemotherapy that was the planned second step, and had to discontinue it.\n\nThe chemo failure was the latest in a string of personal setbacks.\n\nThe year before she was diagnosed with brain cancer, she'd lost her son to suicide. Weeks after that she was almost killed in a car crash outside a local mall. Her cancer was discovered after she had a dizzy spell, and her husband, Joseph, insisted she return to the hospital to have it checked out.\n\nAfter all that, Anselmo and her husband weren't ready to give up on her cancer fight. He'd read about advances in targeted therapies \u2014 drugs that go after cancer cells at the molecular level.\n\nThe family sent samples of her tumor samples for genetic testing to several leading cancer hospitals. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where she was being treated, also did its own sequencing. They all found the same thing. Anselmo's tumor had a BRAF mutation common in skin cancer, but very unusual for a brain tumor.\n\nHer oncologist, David Hyman at Memorial Sloan Kettering, enrolled Anselmo into a new kind of drug trial. Called a basket trial, the study is designed to include people whose tumors have the same kind of genetic fingerprint regardless of where in the body the tumors are found.\n\nKnowing more about the genetic mutations of a tumor enables doctors to find a potentially effective drug much more quickly and accurately. \"It's like you're in a parking lot,\" Hyman says. \"And you have a key to one of the cars in the parking lot. And so one option is just to go to each car and try to open the lock. The other is to know that it's the third car on the right. What we're doing now is we're saying, OK, this key fits that lock. And we're only going straight to that car.\"\n\nToday, Anselmo is doing well. She's been in the clinical trial for a year now, and continues to take Zelboraf (or vemurafenib generically) daily. The pills have kept her cancer from growing.\n\nThere are side effects, of course. She's lost some peripheral vision, though she's been able to compensate. And Zelboraf is expensive, though it's free to Anselmo because she's taking it as part of a study.\n\nNow she can focus again on the things she loves, like singing. Anselmo, a jazz singer who performed under the stage name Mariel Larsen before her illness, is planning a comeback. She's back in training with her longtime vocal coach.\n\nAs this kind of genetic sequencing of tumors has become faster and cheaper, more patients have access to this technology. More doctors are taking advantage of the information to treat patients with a targeted approach.\n\n\"We took a disease where nothing really works for any length of time and we've given her a year of life, and hopefully much more, where she's been much better,\" Hyman, her oncologist, says.\n\nStill, he cautions that the targeted treatments can't be considered cures. At some point the drug that is keeping Anselmo's cancer at bay could stop working. \"Every patient is different in how long it works,\" he says. \"We all have patients that have been on these drugs for years. But I don't know, I mean, I think if I was being honest eventually our expectation would be that it would stop working.\"\n\nThere's no way to predict when. But in the meantime, patients like Anselmo are grateful to have time they wouldn't have had otherwise.\n\nAfter all the misfortunes she's been through, it would be easy to think Anselmo has been incredibly unlucky.

New research out of Oxford helps confirm this and then some: The researchers\u2019 meta-analysis on how commercially available antidepressants compare with a placebo showed that just one of the 14 antidepressants examined was significantly better than a placebo in treating depression in children and adolescents.\n\nThe only drug to pass the test was fluoxetine, sold in the U.S. under the trade name Prozac. It outperformed all other antidepressants in both efficacy and tolerability, a term that researchers use to mean how often patients had to quit the drug due to negative side effects.\n\nProzac is also the only antidepressant approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat depression in people under 18. That\u2019s because the FDA has deemed that Prozac has demonstrated benefits that outweigh one of the suspected downsides of antidepressants in kids and teens: disrupting brain development. Dr. Andrea Cipriani, psychiatrist and lead author on the study, says these are concerns that practicing psychiatrists confront daily. \u201cFrom a clinical point of view, we tend to be very cautious when prescribing medication to children and adolescents because of the unknown effects on the developing brain,\u201d he said.\n\nThere\u2019s good reason for this. Researchers have long worried about the effects of psychoactive drugs on people whose brains are still developing. Back in 2004, researchers at Harvard Medical School released a study that sought to answer questions about the safety of certain drugs and chemicals, including antidepressants, in adolescents. The study, which used rats in lieu of human children, found evidence that reward pathways are severely altered following exposure to drugs that affect the brain. Research on how antidepressants actually affect human children\u2019s brain development is extremely hard to come by, given the limited numbers of actual children on antidepressants and the complications of gaining consent to study them. But other research on antidepressants suggest they negatively affect brain plasticity and memory\u2014something that would be problematic while the brain is still developing.\n\nAnd there\u2019s another major problem with the use of many antidepressants in children: They may increase suicidal thoughts and behavior. Since 2004, the FDA has advised that antidepressants not be prescribed to individuals under 24 due to the increased risk in suicidality, especially during the early phases of treatment. Dr. Mina Fazel, child psychiatrist at the Oxford University Children\u2019s Hospital, says, \u201cIt\u2019s complicated, because you\u2019re giving antidepressants when you\u2019re very worried about that young person\u2019s mood.\u201d Essentially, the moment when it seems most necessary to prescribe the drugs may also be the moment when the patient is most at risk of suicide. Untangling this cause and effect has thus far eluded researchers, though there is some evidence to suggest that antidepressants spark a chemical reaction in the brain that does in fact increase the risk of suicide. So far, the FDA is erring on the side of caution.\n\nA comment attached to the Oxford paper, written by Dr. Jon Jureidini, a child psychiatrist at the Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital in Adelaide, Australia, goes even further in decrying the use of antidepressants in kids. \u201cOnly if the discounted benefit outweighs the boosted harm should the treatment be prescribed,\u201d he writes. \u201cFor antidepressants in adolescents, this equation will rarely favor prescribing; in younger children, almost never.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, Jureidini believes there is almost never a justification for prescribing antidepressants to children or adolescents. I called him to be sure. \u201cThey\u2019re not better than nothing,\u201d he said, \u201cand there\u2019s quite clear evidence that they\u2019re more dangerous than nothing.\u201d He arrived at this conclusion after applying the customary dose of skepticism doctors are taught to apply when translating research findings to clinical practice.\n\nHis wariness of antidepressants being prescribed for kids, Prozac included, is further bolstered by the theory that these drugs don\u2019t work well in children because they weren\u2019t designed for children. They were designed for adults, and adults have very different physiological states than adolescents.\n\nThe Oxford paper notes that 3 percent of children ages 6-12 and nearly 6 percent of teenagers ages 13-18 suffered from major depressive disorder, the psychiatric term for what is colloquially known as depression. Given the U.S. population, that works out to more than a million children and adolescents. The disease manifests differently in kids: Whereas adults might report feeling apathetic, unmotivated, unfocused, and just plain sad, children with this disorder tend to be irritable and aggressive and as a result have trouble navigating social situations with adults and peers. That means that one of the first battles in treating depression in kids is recognizing it in the first place. Of course, having an effective intervention once it is recognized would help.\n\nIf there\u2019s an upside to be found in how ineffective antidepressants likely are for kids, it\u2019s that pharmacological solutions are not the recommended first line of defense, anyway. Guidelines from the psychiatric associations in most countries recommend that doctors first try psychotherapy, or \u201ctalk therapy,\u201d which is has been shown to work, at least by participants\u2019 own assessment of their depression levels (it\u2019s very hard to test therapy against a placebo, for obvious reasons). Methods such as cognitive behavioral therapy, in which psychiatrists help patients overcome destructive behaviors and thought patterns, and interpersonal therapy, which focuses more on the effect depression has on relationships, seem to be equally effective in treating depression, particularly in adolescents. Of course, this is a high-cost intervention in terms of both dollars and time invested, and it may not always be readily available\u2014but the upside is that there is no reason to believe it is harmful.\n\nLike in nearly all areas of science, biomedical or otherwise, our understanding is limited, and further research is required to find out more about both potential treatment options. Adolescent depression is particularly difficult, since gaining consent to study interventions in children is more complicated than it is in adults. If we are to answer these big unknowns regarding the safety of antidepressants in young patients (critical, because therapy and medication are more effective together than in isolation), we need more data.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story does not engage in disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "ROCHESTER, Minn. \u2014 A new type of blood test may help physicians identify which patients with and without evidence of coronary blockages are at risk for heart attacks and strokes. Even individuals with normal levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), known as the so-called \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol, but still at risk, seem to be identified, according to Mayo Clinic research being presented at the American College of Cardiology\u2019s 66th Annual Scientific Session.\n\nThe test, released commercially by Mayo Medical Laboratories in August 2016, measures blood concentrations of plasma ceramides, a class of lipids that are highly linked to cardiovascular disease processes. The study found that individuals with the highest levels of blood ceramides were found to have a 3- to 4-times greater risk of having a cardiovascular event compared with those with the lowest ceramide score, regardless of their LDL cholesterol level or the presence of a blockage in the heart\u2019s arteries.\n\n\u201cOur research suggests that evaluating ceramide levels in patients who are not at immediate risk for coronary artery disease events may help cardiologists decide who could benefit from proactive and preventive treatment, such as statins, or lifestyle changes to prevent a serious cardiac event down the road,\u201d says Jeff Meeusen, Ph.D., a clinical chemist, co-director of Cardiovascular Laboratory Medicine at Mayo Clinic and the study\u2019s lead author.\n\nAccording to Dr. Meeusen, ceramides are different than cholesterol, which gathers and causes a clog in the arteries. Ceramides are more active, attracting inflammatory cells and promoting clotting.\n\nIn the study, 499 Mayo Clinic patients who were referred for coronary angiography to check for possible artery blockages were included and followed prospectively for approximately eighteen years. Patients were similar in age and with regard to blood pressure, smoking status and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), the \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol; excluded were those who had diabetes or a previous heart attack, stroke or procedure to open narrowed coronary arteries. Researchers measured four different types of ceramides in the blood at baseline and combined the values into a 12-point scale. Patients were grouped into four risk categories according to their ceramide levels: low (0\u20132), intermediate (3\u20136), moderate (7\u20139) and high (10\u201312).\n\nOver the eighteen years, researchers recorded occurrences of heart attack, stroke, revascularization and death. Overall, 5.1 percent of patients had a major cardiovascular event each year. But the risk of having an event became higher as ceramide level increased; for each 1-point increase in the ceramide risk score, the risk rose by 9 percent. The rate of events was double among people with the highest ceramide score compared with those with the lowest (8.1 vs. 4.1 percent, respectively).\n\nIn patients without coronary artery disease following angiography, the rate of cardiovascular events was only 3.1 percent, lower than the average overall. But when researchers examined cardiovascular disease in this population by ceramide scores, people with the highest levels of ceramides were four times more likely to have an event compared with those with the lowest (7.8 vs. 2.2 percent, respectively). A similar trend was seen among people with low LDL levels (<100 mg/dL), typically considered a good LDL target. In this group, the rate of heart attack, stroke and revascularization and death was 3.7 percent among those with a low ceramide score, but 16.4 percent in people with the highest ceramide levels.\n\n\u201cThere is a need to identify patients at increased risk for cardiovascular events so that we can test strategies to prevent those events. This test seems to provide such information,\u201d says Allan S. Jaffe, M.D., senior author of the study, cardiologist at Mayo Clinic and chair of the Division of Clinical Core Laboratory Services.\n\nThe trial was funded by Mayo Clinic. The new test is available to health care providers worldwide through Mayo Medical Laboratories, which offers laboratory testing and pathology services to more than 4,000 health care organizations in more than 70 countries. Mayo Medical Laboratories collaborated with some of the original researchers who established the role of ceramides in cardiovascular disease and Zora Biosciences Oy, a diagnostics discovery company based in Finland, to develop and refine the test.

People who experience them see or hear things that are not there (hallucinations) and/or have false beliefs (delusions). The hallucinations and delusions experienced with Parkinson\u2019s disease are serious symptoms, and can lead to thinking and emotions that are so impaired that the people experiencing them may not relate to loved ones well or take appropriate care of themselves.\n\n\u201cHallucinations and delusions can be profoundly disturbing and disabling,\u201d said Mitchell Mathis, M.D., director of the Division of Psychiatry Products in the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \u201cNuplazid represents an important treatment for people with Parkinson\u2019s disease who experience these symptoms.\u201d\n\nAn estimated 50,000 Americans are diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease each year, according to the National Institutes of Health, and about one million Americans have the condition. The neurological disorder typically occurs in people over age 60, when cells in the brain that produce a chemical called dopamine become impaired or die. Dopamine helps transmit signals between the areas of the brain that produce smooth, purposeful movement -- like eating, writing and shaving. Early symptoms of the disease are subtle and occur gradually. In some people Parkinson\u2019s disease progresses more quickly than in others. As the disease progresses, the shaking, or tremor, which affects the majority of people with Parkinson\u2019s disease, may begin to interfere with daily activities. Other symptoms may include depression and other emotional changes; hallucinations and delusions; difficulty in swallowing, chewing, and speaking; urinary problems or constipation; skin problems; and sleep disruptions.\n\nThe effectiveness of Nuplazid was shown in a six-week clinical trial of 199 participants. Nuplazid was shown to be superior to placebo in decreasing the frequency and/or severity of hallucinations and delusions without worsening the primary motor symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nAs with other atypical antipsychotic drugs, Nuplazid has a Boxed Warning alerting health care professionals about an increased risk of death associated with the use of these drugs to treat older people with dementia-related psychosis. No drug in this class is approved to treat patients with dementia-related psychosis.\n\nIn clinical trials, the most common side effects reported by participants taking Nuplazid were: swelling, usually of the ankles, legs, and feet due to the accumulation of excessive fluid in the tissue (peripheral edema); nausea; and abnormal state of mind (confused state).\n\nNuplazid was granted for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Breakthrough therapy designation is a program designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint. The drug was also granted a priority review. The FDA\u2019s program provides for an expedited review of drugs that offer a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness for the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of a serious condition.\n\nNuplazid is marketed by Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. of San Diego, California.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

A nationwide survey by the National Institutes of Health found that 28 percent of adults in the U.S. are heavy drinkers or drink more than is recommended.\n\nYet, most heavy drinkers don't get the help they need.\n\n\"The biggest problem we have in the field is that less than 10 percent of individuals with an alcohol use disorder get any treatment whatsoever,\" says George Koob, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.\n\nPart of the challenge, researchers say, is that many drinkers don't realize that a medicine long used to help people addicted to opioids quit their drug habit can help alcoholics and other heavy drinkers cut back, too.\n\n\"I thought my only option was AA,\" John tells NPR. We've agreed to use only his middle name; disclosing his trouble with alcohol publicly, he says, would jeopardize his business.\n\nHe's a 47-year-old professional who says he started out as a social drinker \u2014 a few beers with his softball team after a game. But he sank into a deep depression after several deaths in his family, and sought \"solace in the bottle,\" he says.\n\n\"I wanted to numb my thoughts,\" says John.\n\nHe'd often start with hard liquor in the morning, John says, and it wasn't uncommon to have eight drinks or more before the end of the day.\n\nHe worked from home, so he was able to mask the problem for a while. But eventually his wife confronted him.\n\n\"She had come home and I was rushing to hide a glass and she was furious with me,\" he recalls. \"Just absolutely furious.\"\n\nHe went to see Paula DeSanto, a therapist and director of Minnesota Alternatives, in Spring Lake Park, Minn. The center provides outpatient mental health and substance use treatment services.\n\n\"I would say John's story is not unique,\" DeSanto tells us. \"A lot of people are reluctant.\"\n\nSometimes, traditional treatments \u2014 such as residential rehab or a 12-step program like Alcoholics Anonymous \u2014 \"can [lead to] a significant disruption in their lives,\" she explains. \"There's stigma, shame and embarrassment.\"\n\nDeSanto suggested a different approach to John. To help work through the loss and grief he was feeling, counseling can help, she told him. She also recommended he try naltrexone, a prescription drug.\n\n\"Naltrexone is an effective medication for the treatment of alcohol use disorders,\" says Koob. He points to a recent meta-analysis published in the journal Addiction that concluded that naltrexone helped reduce heavy drinking and cravings for alcohol.\n\nThe analysis included data from 64 clinical trials in which people were given either the medication or a placebo pill to test the effectiveness of the treatment. The analysis also found that another drug, acamprosate, is effective at helping people who have already stopped drinking to maintain abstinence, perhaps partly by easing the physical and emotional cravings experienced by heavy drinkers who quit.\n\nSo, how does naltrexone work? The drug seems to curb the euphoric and sedative effects of opiates in the brain. Alcohol is known to activate some of the same receptors in the brain that opioids do, and studies find that by tempering the pleasure from alcohol, naltrexone can help people drink less.\n\n\"It blunts the effects of alcohol,\" says Koob. \"People [who use naltrexone] will say they have a drink, and it's not doing much for them.\"\n\nThat was exactly John's experience. After taking the naltrexone pill, he didn't get the buzz he was used to getting, so didn't want to keep drinking. \"I actually didn't feel the alcohol's effects,\" he says. \"It was startling.\"\n\nIt's now been about five months since he started taking the medication. He has not stopped drinking completely, but says he has cut way back.\n\n\"This is helping me,\" John says. \"I can go out with friends and not worry that I'm going to end up inebriated or sloppy.\"\n\nAccording to the findings of a recent review, both naltrexone and acamprosate, are safe, cost-effective and efficacious. But they are substantially underused, according to the review.\n\nMany physicians are \"unaware that there are medications to treat alcohol use disorders,\" says Koob. His institute is stepping up efforts to work with the medical community on that front, he says, and is also touting Rethinking Drinking, a website aimed at consumers that offers the latest research-based information on a range of treatment options.\n\nAny health care provider who is licensed to prescribe medicine can prescribe naltrexone \u2014 not just mental health professionals or addiction specialists. As as long ago as 1997, a published study showed that treatment of alcohol dependence with naltrexone by primary care doctors can be effective; follow-up research has confirmed that the primary care approach not only works, but makes treatment much more accessible.\n\nAccording to the NIAAA, \"patients can now receive effective alcohol treatment from their primary care doctors or mental health practitioners by combining the newer medications with a series of brief office visits for support.\"\n\nNaltrexone is certainly not a cure-all, researchers say. And it won't help everyone who has a drinking problem \u2014 especially if the disorder is severe.\n\n\"I use these medications as an adjunct to therapy, and group [sessions] and 12-step meetings\" says Dr. Jeffrey Hsu, a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University who is certified in addiction medicine. He says that when used alone the medicines are only modestly effective.\n\nBut there's good evidence that the combination of counseling and drugs such as naltrexone can help people cut back on drinking, or move toward abstinence.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story may inadvertently overstate the portion of the population that is a candidate for treatment with this drug. The story says that 28% of the adult population are heavy drinkers or drink more than is recommended.

However, naltrexone is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe alcohol use disorder, formerly \u201calcohol dependence,\u201d and not for drinking more than is recommended or heavy drinking. So undoubtedly, the pool of drinkers who might benefit from this drug is smaller than the 28% figure cited in the story.\nThis is a close call.

They found that the two groups had widespread differences in terms of brain connectivity.\n\nEEG revealed that the children with autism had a reduced short range connectivity, indicating poor function of local brain networks. This was especially true in the left hemisphere regions of the brain responsible for language.\n\nThe children with autism also had increased connectivity between brain regions that were farther apart, which might be a mechanism developed to compensate for reduced short range connectivity, the researchers said.\n\nThe research was conducted at Boston Children's Hospital and was published online June 25 in the journal BMC Medicine.\n\nThe use of EEG-based testing may help diagnose autism in children and may improve early detection in infants, leading to more effective treatments and coping strategies, the researchers said.\n\n\"What was unique about this study is the very large number of children studied,\" Dawson noted. \"Consistent with many previous studies using EEG and functional MRI with both children and adults with autism, these investigators found that, overall, children with autism show reduced coordination (coherence) across brain regions.\"\n\nShe said the findings are important because, \"they help us understand why individuals with autism have difficulty with complex behaviors, such as social interaction and language. As children's brains develop, the different brain regions become increasingly connected, allowing for the acquisition of complex behaviors that require coordination across different brain regions.\"\n\nLanguage, for example, requires coordination across the auditory, visual, and motor brain regions, as well as the participation of the prefrontal cortex, she said.\n\n\"This reduced functional connectivity in the brain helps us understand impairments associated with autism,\" she added. \"The hope is that early behavioral intervention can help mitigate these functional impairments, helping to form the connections that natural develop in typical children.\"\n\n\"Although autism is still principally a clinical diagnosis, this study ... may allow for a new approach to classifying children with autism and may even assist in the early identification of affected children at a younger age,\" said Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven & Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York in New Hyde Park, NY.\n\nThe number of children diagnosed with autism in the United States has recently increased to one in 88.\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more about autism.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story does not engage in disease mongering, and we were glad to see that Dr. Dawson\u2019s comments focused on the new study and not on the broader question of the number of children with autism spectrum disorders.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Fast food outlets should hand out free cholesterol-lowering statin drugs to their customers to \u201cneutralize\u201d the heart risks of eating fatty foods like burgers and fries, British scientists suggested on Thursday.\n\nBut a few experts say you might want to ask your server to hold the statin at this point.\n\nIn a study published in the American Journal of Cardiology, scientists from the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College London calculated that the reduction in heart disease risk offered by a statin could offset the increase in risk from eating a cheeseburger and a milkshake.\n\n\u201cStatins don\u2019t cut out all of the unhealthy effects of a burger and fries.

That\u2019s because HPV \u2014 which causes changes in the cervix that can lead to cancer \u2014 may take a decade to progress to that point.\n\n\u201cNo test is perfect,\u201d said Philip Castle, an HPV expert at the American Society for Clinical Pathology in Chicago.

They asked doctors and staff what tests they used for cervical cancer screening and presented them with three patient scenarios.\n\nIn those scenarios, a woman age 30 to 60 has had two consecutive normal Pap tests but no HPV tests; two normal Paps and a negative HPV test; or a negative HPV test but no recent Pap tests.\n\nIn all of those cases, guidelines recommend waiting three years before screening the patient again, the authors explain in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology. But for each scenario, between 67 percent and 85 percent of doctors said they would bring the woman back in a year.\n\nRoland pointed to the extra costs women may incur to get childcare and make it to the doctor\u2019s office \u2014 plus the costs to a strained healthcare system of ordering more tests.\n\nAnd any extra screening increases the chance of getting a \u201cfalse positive\u201d result on a test \u2014 meaning the test finds something that doesn\u2019t turn out to be cancer.

First, they might not know about the guidelines. But women may also be used to annual testing and ask for it themselves.\n\nIn addition, Roland added, some doctors might be afraid of missing very early cervical cancer and getting sued if they screen less frequently.\n\nBut if doctors and hospitals want to rein in spending and limit unnecessary risks, that attitude has to change, researchers agreed.\n\n\u201cWe need to shift toward the wellness visit as opposed to, \u2018You have to come in here every year for a Pap,\u2019\u201d Castle said.\n\nWomen should talk to their doctors about screening, especially if they think they are being screened too often, researchers added.\n\n\u201cA woman should know what test is being used,\u201d said Dr. Mona Saraiya, a co-author on the new study. \u201cOften a provider just does the HPV test\u201d without telling the patient. \u201cA woman should say, \u2018What screening tests are you doing on me?\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd if doctors want women to come back again next year, women should ask them why, Saraiya said.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease-mongering at play here.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "WEDNESDAY, June 28, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Something as simple as taking a low-dose aspirin every day may protect pregnant women from the life-threatening condition known as preeclampsia, new research suggests.\n\n\"Preeclampsia is one of the most serious complications of pregnancy, with a high risk of death for the mother and baby,\" said senior study author Dr. Kypros Nicolaides. He is a professor of fetal medicine at Kings College Hospital in London.\n\nBut he added, \"This condition is, to a great extent, preventable.\"\n\nThe new study looked at an aspirin dose of 150 milligrams (mg) per day because some past studies with smaller daily doses of aspirin have produced conflicting results, according to Nicolaides. A baby aspirin dose is 81 milligrams.\n\nIn those studies using smaller doses, the reduction in preeclampsia risk hovered around 10 percent, he said, but the higher dose in this latest study was linked to a 62 percent reduction in risk.\n\nPreeclampsia is a serious high blood pressure disorder. It can affect all of the organs in a woman's body, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). The exact cause of the disorder is unknown, but certain risk factors make it more likely to occur, including:\n\u2022 Being pregnant with more than one baby,\n\u2022 Having chronic conditions, such as type 1 or type 2 diabetes, autoimmune disease and kidney problems.\n\nDr. Mitchell Kramer, chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Huntington Hospital in New York, said he'd add women who are severely obese and women who've had babies who had restricted growth to the list of women at high risk of preeclampsia.\n\nACOG already recommends that women who are at high risk of preeclampsia take a low-dose baby aspirin beginning between 12 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAbout 1,600 women completed the double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Just under 800 were randomly put into the daily aspirin group, while just over 800 were placed in the placebo group. The women came from 13 different maternity hospitals across Europe and Israel.\n\nInstead of relying solely on standard risk factors, the researchers combined those risk factors with measurements of maternal blood flow, blood pressure and two hormones produced by the placenta. They used an algorithm they designed to combine all those factors to select women who they believed were at a high risk of preeclampsia.\n\nBetween 11 and 14 weeks, the women began taking a daily 150 mg aspirin or a placebo. They continued taking the pills until they were 36 weeks' pregnant, or sooner if they delivered the baby early.\n\nJust 13 women in the aspirin group developed preeclampsia, while 35 women in the placebo group developed the complication, the findings showed.\n\nThe reduction in risk was even greater for early deliveries. Women who delivered at less than 34 weeks were 82 percent less likely to have preeclampsia if they were taking 150 mg of aspirin, Nicolaides said.\n\nThere were no serious side effects for expectant mothers, or adverse events for the babies related to aspirin use during pregnancy, the researchers noted.\n\nHowever, as with all drugs, women should talk to their doctor about the use of aspirin in pregnancy before taking up this regimen, because aspirin does increase the risk for bleeding.\n\nNicolaides said the aspirin may help improve blood flow from the mother to the placenta.\n\nAccording to Kramer, \"This randomized study concludes that [aspirin's] use is not only effective for reducing the incidence of preeclampsia at term, but also preterm. This is important because it will reduce the need for preterm delivery, which is risky for the baby.\"\n\nLow-dose aspirin can also help reduce the chances of eclampsia, which is seizures due to preeclampsia for high-risk women, Kramer noted.\n\nThe study is scheduled for presentation Wednesday at the Fetal Medicine Foundation meeting in Slovenia.

Scientists have looked at numerous possible causes, from genetics to environmental exposure, but no definitive answers. Autism is considered by most experts to be a lifelong condition, but numerous studies have found that children's outcomes improve with early therapy. Hundreds of millions of dollars of state and federal funding are being spent each year to provide help to children and adults with autism and being able to pinpoint children at risk in the early years could help direct those public resources to where they could do the most good.\n\nBrain imaging has become a popular subject of research in recent years as the technology to be able to scan, store and analyze the terabytes of information in the pictures has become more affordable. Scientists at a growing number of research centers are pinning their hopes that these images will help them unlock some of the secrets of everything from what causes childhood disorders like Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder to how neurons in the brain process vision and memory.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The article skirts the line when it talks about the \u201csoaring\u201d rates of autism diagnosis, which has reached 1 in 68 children.

On two separate occasions, 12 of the people took a dose of MDMA and then spoke for several hours with a pair of trained therapists. The others took a placebo but received the same therapy. (All of the participants received additional therapy sessions that did not involve the drug.)\n\nTwo months later, 10 of the 12 people who took MDMA had improved to the point where they no longer met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, and three participants whose condition had prevented them from holding down a job were able to return to work.\n\nBy contrast, just two of the eight people in the placebo group experienced a substantial improvement in their symptoms.\n\nMDMA is believed to raise levels of the feel-good brain chemical serotonin and the so-called \"bonding hormone,\" oxytocin. The resulting sense of euphoria and emotional warmth seems to help patients connect with their therapists, says Michael Mithoefer, M.D., the lead author of the study and a Mount Pleasant, South Carolina-based psychiatrist who specializes in PTSD.\n\n\"A lot of the time, people have quite painful and challenging experiences revisiting the trauma, and [MDMA] can help them do it without being overwhelmed or numbed out,\" he says.\n\nDon't try this experiment at home.

And when purchased on the street it can be contaminated.\n\nConducting a study with an illegal drug is a complex process.

A man\u2019s \u201clatency time\u201d can also become reduced later in his sexual life, and this secondary form is usually defined as ejaculation within three minutes or less.\n\nIn the current study, researchers evaluated 10 randomized controlled trials that included comparisons either to another type of treatment or to a placebo, or dummy, treatment. Two studies were of acupuncture, five were of Chinese herbal medicine, one of Ayurvedic herbal medicine and two of Korean topical \u201cseverance secret\u201d cream.\n\nTogether, the two acupuncture studies found that the treatment slightly increased intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) by about half a minute compared to placebo.\n\nChinese herbal medicine increased IELT by about two minutes, Ayurvedic herbal medicine increased IELT by nearly a minute and topical cream increased IELT by more than eight minutes.\n\nIn some instances, a combination of traditional and alternative options was the most effective. For example, Chinese medicine paired with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) increased IELT by two minutes longer than SSRIs alone and nearly three minutes longer than the Chinese medicine alone.\n\n\u201cThere are no approved treatments for premature ejaculation,\u201d said Donald Patrick, vice chair for research at the University of Washington in Seattle. \u201cThis is a common condition that has serious psychological effects on relationships,\u201d said Patrick, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cWe need treatments to address it, and it should be treated with equal seriousness as erectile dysfunction.\u201d\n\nThe prevalence of premature ejaculation is difficult to measure because of the differing definitions of the problem and some men\u2019s reluctance to report it. Some studies suggest that between 20 and 30 percent of men report early ejaculation concerns, but the International Society for Sexual Medicine estimates that about 4 percent of men have a lifelong condition.\n\n\u201cAlthough it is not openly discussed in the media - at least not as much as erectile problems have been discussed in the post-Viagra era - numerous studies report men feel frustrated, depressed and anxious because of this problem,\u201d said Ege Can Serefoglu of the Bagcilar Training and Research Hospital in Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nThe main limitation of the study is the underlying weakness of the studies evaluated. Bias was unclear in most of the studies, and only five used stopwatches to measure IELT, which is the \u201cgold standard\u201d for premature ejaculation studies, Patrick said.\n\nIn addition, the authors write, the studies are so different, it\u2019s tough to draw conclusions about the different options. For example, the five Chinese medicine studies tested different substances, including Qilin pills, Yimusake and Uighur.\n\nSome studies, but not all, discussed side effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort, dizziness, mild pain and decreased libido.

Some, like Dr. Dean Ornish, a longtime promoter of low-fat diets and president of the Preventive Medicine Research Institute in Sausalito, Calif., said that the women did not reduce their fat to low enough levels or eat enough fruits and vegetables, and that the study, even at eight years, did not give the diets enough time.\n\nOthers said that diet could still make a difference, at least with heart disease, if people were to eat the so-called Mediterranean diet, low in saturated fats like butter and high in oils like olive oil. The women in the study reduced all kinds of fat.\n\nThe diets studied \"had an antique patina,\" said Dr. Peter Libby, a cardiologist and professor at Harvard Medical School. These days, Dr. Libby said, most people have moved on from the idea of controlling total fat to the idea that people should eat different kinds of fat.\n\nBut the Mediterranean diet has not been subjected to a study of this scope, researchers said.\n\nAnd Barbara V. Howard, an epidemiologist at MedStar Research Institute, a nonprofit hospital group, and a principle investigator in the study, said people should realize that diet alone was not enough to stay healthy.\n\n\"We are not going to reverse any of the chronic diseases in this country by changing the composition of the diet,\" Dr. Howard said. \"People are always thinking it's what they ate. They are not looking at how much they ate or that they smoke or that they are sedentary.\"\n\nExcept for not smoking, the advice for a healthy lifestyle is based largely on indirect evidence, Dr. Howard said, but most medical researchers agree that it makes sense to eat well, control weight and get regular exercise.\n\nThat is also what the cancer society recommends. Dr. Thun, who described the study's results as \"completely null over the eight-year follow-up for both cancers and heart disease,\" said his group had no plans to suggest that low-fat diets were going to protect against cancer.\n\nOthers cautioned against being too certain that a particular diet would markedly improve health, and said that whether someone developed a chronic disease might not be entirely under their control -- genetics also plays a role.\n\nDavid A. Freedman, a statistician at the University of California, Berkeley, who is not connected with the study but has written books on the design and analysis of clinical trials, said the results should be taken seriously.\n\n\"The studies were well designed,\" Dr. Freedman said, \"and the investigators tried to confirm popular hypotheses about the protective effect of diet against three major diseases in women.\"\n\n\"But,\" he added, \"the diet studied here turned out not to be protective after all.\"\n\nThe study was part of the Women's Health Initiative of the National Institutes of Health, the same program that showed that hormone therapy after menopause might have more risks than benefits.\n\nIn this case, the study addressed a tricky problem. For decades, many scientists have said, and many members of the public have believed, that what people eat -- the composition of the diet -- determines how likely they are to get a chronic disease. But that has been hard to prove. Studies of dietary fiber and colon cancer failed to find that fiber was protective, and studies of vitamins thought to protect against cancer failed to show an effect.\n\nMany cancer researchers have questioned large parts of the diet-cancer hypothesis, but it has kept a hold on the public imagination. \"Nothing fascinates the American public so much as the notion that what you eat rather than how much you eat affects your health,\" said Dr. Libby, the Harvard professor.\n\nThe study found that women who were randomly assigned to follow a low-fat diet ate significantly less fat over the next eight years. But they had just as much breast and colon cancer and just as much heart disease. The women were not trying to lose weight, and their weights remained fairly steady. But their experiences with the diets allowed researchers to question some popular notions about diet and obesity.\n\nThere is a common belief that Americans get fat because they eat too many carbohydrates. The idea is that a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet leads to weight gain, higher insulin and blood glucose levels, and more diabetes, even if the calories are the same as in a higher-fat diet. That did not happen here.\n\nOthers have said the opposite: that low-fat diets enable people to lose weight naturally. But that belief was not supported by this study.\n\nAs for heart disease risk factors, the only one affected was LDL cholesterol, which increases heart disease risk. The levels were slightly higher in women eating the higher-fat diet, but not high enough to make a noticeable difference in their risk of heart disease.\n\nAlthough all the study participants were women, the colon cancer and heart disease results should also apply to men, said Dr. Jacques Rossouw, the project officer for the Women's Health Initiative.\n\nDr. Rossouw said the observational studies that led to the hypothesis about colon cancer and dietary fat included men and women. With heart disease, he said, researchers have found that women and men respond in the same way to dietary fat.\n\nThe most recent study follows a smaller one, reported last year, on low-fat diets for women who had breast cancer. That study hinted that eating less fat might help prevent a recurrence. But the current study, asking if a low-fat diet could protect women from breast cancer in the first place, had findings that fell short of statistical significance, meaning they could have occurred by chance.\n\nDr. Rossouw said he was still intrigued by the breast cancer data, even though it was not statistically significant. The women on low-fat diets had a 9 percent lower rate of breast cancer; the incidence was 42 per thousand per year in women in the low-fat diet group, compared with 45 per thousand per year in women consuming their regular diet.\n\nThat could mean that fat in the diet may have a small effect, Dr. Rossouw said, perhaps in some subgroups of women or over a longer period of time. He added that the study investigators would continue to follow the women to see if the effect became more pronounced.\n\nWhile cancer researchers said they were disappointed by the results, heart disease researchers said they were not surprised that simply reducing total fat had no effect, because they had moved on from that hypothesis.\n\nOf course, Dr. Libby acknowledged, the latest advice, to follow a Mediterranean diet and get regular exercise, has never been tested in a large randomized clinical trial. \"If they did a study like that and it was negative,\" he said, \"then I'd have to give up my cherished hypotheses for data.\"\n\nThe low-fat diet was not easy to follow, said Dr. Rowan T. Chlebowski, a medical oncologist at Harbor-U.C.L.A. Medical Center and one of the study's principal investigators. Women were told to aim for a diet that had just 20 percent of its calories as fat, and most fell short.\n\nThe diet they were told to follow \"is different than the way most people eat,\" Dr. Chlebowski said. It meant, for example, no butter on bread, no cream cheese on bagels, no oil in salad dressings.\n\n\"If a physician told a patient to eat less fat, that will do nothing,\" he said. \"If you send someone to a dietitian one time, that will do next to nothing.\" The women in the study had 18 sessions in small groups with a trained nutritionist in the first year and four sessions a year after that.\n\nIn the first year, the women on the low-fat diets reduced the percentage of fat in their diet to 24 percent of daily calories, and by the end of the study their diets had 29 percent of their calories as fat. In the first year, the women in the control group were eating 35 percent of their calories as fat, and by the end of the study their dietary fat content was 37 percent. The two groups consumed about the same number of calories.\n\nSome medical specialists emphasized that the study did not mean people should abandon low-fat diets.\n\n\"What we are saying is that a modest reduction of fat and a substitution with fruits and vegetables did not do anything for heart disease and stroke or breast cancer or colorectal cancer,\" said Dr. Nanette K. Wenger, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta. \"It doesn't say that this diet is not beneficial.\"\n\nBut Dr. Freedman, the Berkeley statistician, said the overall lesson was clear.\n\n\"We, in the scientific community, often give strong advice based on flimsy evidence,\" he said. \"That's why we have to do experiments.\"\n\nCorrection: February 16, 2006, Thursday A front-page article on Feb. 8 about a new study finding that low-fat diets have no effect on the risk of cancer or heart disease misstated the incidence of breast cancer among women in the study. It was 42 per 10,000 per year in women in the low-fat-diet group, compared with 45 per 10,000 in women consuming their regular diet -- not per 1,000. (The difference was deemed statistically insignificant.)", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "", "answer": 1}, {"article": "There\u2019s another type of prescription drugs, besides opioid painkillers, that\u2019s involved in thousands of drug overdose deaths in the US every year.\n\nThe drugs are benzodiazepines, which are widely known by their brand names Xanax and Valium and commonly prescribed to help treat anxiety. These drugs were involved in nearly 9,000 overdose deaths in 2015, according to federal data. But there\u2019s a catch: Such overdoses seem to be very closely tied to the opioid epidemic, with the majority of benzodiazepine overdose deaths involving both benzodiazepines and opioids.\n\nA new study published in BMJ looked at just how much the concurrent use of these two drugs increases the risk of overdose versus the risk of only using opioids. Drawing on a huge sample of nearly 320,000 patients who were continuously enrolled in private health insurance plans from 2001 and 2013, researchers compared those who were prescribed just opioids versus those who were prescribed both, and what their additional risk of an emergency room visit or inpatient admission was in the period they were prescribed both.\n\nThe study found that among all opioid users, concurrent use of benzodiazepines more than doubled the risk of an emergency room or inpatient visit for a drug overdose.\n\nThe study also found that eliminating concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid use could reduce the risk for an opioid overdose\u2013related emergency room or inpatient visit by 15 percent. If that reduced risk applies to overdose deaths as well, eliminating concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine use could have prevented up to 2,630 opioid painkiller\u2013related overdose deaths in 2015.\n\nKeith Humphreys, a drug policy expert at Stanford University and one of the authors of the study, said this reveals an underappreciated policy lever for reducing drug overdoses: making sure patients prescribed to opioids aren\u2019t also prescribed to benzodiazepines, and vice versa. \u201cEven if we didn\u2019t change opioid prescribing at all, the data here suggest that we could cut overdoses dramatically just [by] getting prescribers to not put people on a benzodiazepine at the same time,\u201d Humphreys said.\n\nYet the study suggests the opposite has happened. From 2001 to 2013, co-prescriptions to opioids and benzodiazepines among the studied pool of patients increased from 9 percent to 17 percent \u2014 a nearly 89 percent jump.\n\nFor some patients, eliminating these co-prescriptions could involve some tough trade-offs. If someone genuinely suffers from pain and anxiety, doctors and patients will need to work out which condition is more important to treat and which one can be treated with alternatives \u2014 to avoid a potentially deadly overdose. (Hopefully while keeping in mind that there\u2019s no good scientific evidence that opioids can treat chronic pain, so opioids aren\u2019t the right treatment for chronic pain in the first place.)\n\nThere are some caveats to the study. For one, emergency room visits and inpatient admissions for opioid overdoses likely aren\u2019t a perfect one-to-one proxy for overdoses that didn\u2019t involve a trip to a doctor. The study also only looked at legally prescribed opioid painkillers and benzodiazepines, missing the effects of concurrent use of illegally obtained pills or drugs. And since the research relied on patients who were continuously insured throughout the study period, it\u2019s possible the findings don\u2019t exactly apply to people with spottier coverage. (Although sensitivity analyses in the study for people who had lapses in insurance produced similar results.)\n\nFinally, since the study looked at correlation (not causation), it\u2019s possible that it missed some other factor driving up overdose deaths among concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid users \u2014 perhaps, for whatever reason, these users may be more likely to misuse their drugs.\n\nStill, it\u2019s well established that benzodiazepine and opioids compound each other\u2019s overdose risk. So it\u2019s not really controversial to conclude that simultaneously using opioids and benzodiazepines dramatically increases the risk of drug overdose \u2014 or, conversely, that stopping the concurrent use of these two drugs could reduce the risk of overdose.\n\nGiven that the opioid epidemic has quickly turned into the deadliest drug crisis in US history, it\u2019s important \u2014 and potentially lifesaving \u2014 for doctors and policymakers to at least consider the study\u2019s findings.\n\nFor more on the opioid epidemic, read Vox\u2019s in-depth explainer, the abridged explainer, or the maps and charts explainer.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story does some editorializing but accurately depicts the magnitude of the problem when it states that the opioid epidemic is the \u201cdeadliest drug crisis in U.S. history.\u201d", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Examining more than 500,000 Facebook posts from both groups, researchers determined which words, post lengths, frequency of posting and timing of posts were most associated with a depression diagnosis.

The treatment involved an electromagnetic coil placed over the left side of the brain that transmitted pulses of electrical currents.\n\nSimilar types of stimulation treatment are used in some patients with depression or during spinal surgery, according to Barrett. The device costs about $50,000.\n\nNine people in each group completed all the treatment sessions.\n\nBefore treatment, right after and another two weeks later, stroke patients were given tests to measure their visual-spatial skills, as well as attention and concentration.

He added that the treatment isn\u2019t painful, and only takes a few minutes for each session.\n\nClose to 800,000 people in the U.S. suffer a stroke each year, mostly older adults. For those with neglect, doctors typically prescribe cognitive rehabilitation, in which therapists teach skills and help the patient become more aware of the affected side of the body.\n\nBarrett, also from the University of Medicine & Dentistry of New Jersey, said that she wonders whether stimulation could help patients achieve the goals that are most important to regaining independence after a stroke, such as using the bathroom.\n\nIt\u2019s also not clear if the treatment might help most neglect patients, or if the findings only apply to certain groups, she told Reuters Health.\n\nThe ideal option might end up being a combination treatment that involves stimulation in certain patients and other therapies that address a range of skills important for regaining function, Barrett added.

The condition, marked by symptoms such as sinus pain and pressure, headache, stuffy nose and sneezing, can compromise quality of life more than even congestive heart failure, back pain or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the study authors said.\n\nEndoscopic sinus surgery has been performed in the United States since the mid-1980s, said Smith, who is director of the Oregon Sinus Center at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland.\n\n\"It's a minimally invasive type of surgery performed with a telescope that goes into the nostril,\" then basically snips away abnormal and interfering tissue while leaving normal tissue behind, Smith explained.\n\nSmith and his co-authors studied 302 patients with CRS from three academic medical centers, following them for an average of a year and a half after their surgery.\n\n\"These were patients who have chronic sinusitis so, by definition, they have at least three months of symptoms and they have evidence of an ongoing inflammation or infection of their nose and sinuses on either a CT scan or an examination of the nose and sinuses,\" Smith said.\n\nFollowing the surgery, about 76 percent of patients had \"clinically significant\" improvement in quality of life, as measured by various validated scales.\n\nPatients with worse disease at the outset seemed to fare the best after the procedure, as did those undergoing surgery for the first time. This second finding is probably explained by the fact that people going for second or further surgeries were probably sicker to begin with, Josephson said.\n\nNone of which is to say that patients shouldn't try medical therapies first, he added.\n\n\"I don't think it means everyone with CRS should consider surgery. They should try medical therapy, and if medical therapy fails and the surgeon feels that part of the problem is anatomic, then surgery would be a good tool for them to use,\" Josephson said. \"Some people with stage 1 and 2 diseases may even get cured.

Blood testing would allow pediatricians and other primary care doctors to diagnose allergies and treat many patients. But allergists contend that these generalists are not qualified to assess the laboratory results.\n\nDr. Dean Mitchell, an allergist in Manhattan, has virtually abandoned the skin-prick test. He was converted, he says, after taking a patient to the emergency room for a severe reaction to his skin test. Dr. Mitchell began to imagine a nearly needle-free office.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a longstanding fear of skin testing, and it turns off a lot of allergy sufferers from getting help,\u201d said Dr. Mitchell, the author of \u201cAllergy and Asthma Solution\u201d (Marlowe, 2006), which advocates oral immunotherapy, or allergy drops, instead of shots.\n\nFor that reason, he and other experts say, most sufferers never even see an allergist. (And many sufferers of seasonal and pet allergies know what they\u2019re allergic to, so they don\u2019t need a diagnosis.) For them, care has focused on treating symptoms with antihistamines and decongestants, not diagnosing the allergy and avoiding its triggers.\n\n\u201cThe question is, why aren\u2019t we identifying more children and adults suffering from allergic rhinitis and asthma to help them?\u201d Dr. Mitchell said.\n\nIn Europe, 60 percent of asthma patients are tested for allergies, compared with only 5 percent to 10 percent in this country. A lack of diagnosis may contribute to the worsening of symptoms in children \u2014 the so-called allergy march.\n\nIt begins with eczema in infants and toddlers, and progresses to respiratory problems and asthma in preschoolers and beyond. Half of babies who have eczema in the first two years of life will develop asthma in childhood, said Dr. Thomas A. E. Platts-Mills, president of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology.\n\nIn skin testing, a practitioner makes rows of pricks on a patient\u2019s back or forearm so allergen-containing extracts can seep into the skin. If the antibody IgE is bound to the immune system\u2019s mast cells in the skin, the patient will get an itchy, hivelike wheal surrounded by redness. The size of the wheal and the diameter of the redness help determine if the patient is allergic.\n\nA patient typically gets 15 to 20 skin pricks, but sometimes many more. Because the test comes with a small risk of a serious reaction, it should not be performed in very young children and pregnant women, among others.\n\nThe blood test, which is not without its own ouch factor, measures levels of circulating IgE. The lab sends the physician a report with these figures and the patient\u2019s risk of a reaction.\n\nThe first generation of blood tests were developed in the 1970s. Because they were not considered very sensitive, physicians were left with a lasting impression that blood testing was inferior to skin testing.\n\nA more sophisticated test with improved sensitivity, called ImmunoCAP, became available in 1992. It has performed equally well in comparison studies with skin-prick testing, said Dr. Jay M. Portnoy, chief of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology at Children\u2019s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Mo.\n\nStill, most allergists prefer skin testing. \u201cSkin testing is more sensitive and tells you more,\u201d said Dr. Dean D. Metcalfe, chief of the laboratory of allergic diseases at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. With blood tests, he went on, \u201cyou\u2019re not really measuring an allergic reaction, but a potential for a reaction.\u201d\n\nSkin testing produces an answer in about 20 minutes, compared with 48 hours for a blood test. The quick turnaround allows doctors to offer a diagnosis and immediate advice.\n\nBut skin-testing results can vary from one allergist to the next, and most allergists don\u2019t rely on a prior allergist\u2019s results when a patient switches practices.\n\nSome experts contend that allergists resist blood testing in part to protect their revenue. \u201cA barrier to allergy testing in the states has been the economics in our system,\u201d said Dr. Richard G. Roberts, professor of family medicine at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. If an allergist does an in-office skin-prick test, he gets the fees for those tests. If he requests a blood test, the laboratory gets the fee.\n\nBut others say allergists are simply more familiar with skin testing. \u201cThey have been trained to do skin testing, they\u2019re comfortable with it, and they get an answer in 20 minutes,\u201d said Dr. Portnoy.\n\nAllergists say some patients previously treated by primary care physicians were taken off foods like peanuts, though they never had an allergic reaction to them. Diagnosing requires a thorough medical history and interpreting the test results within that context; generalists may lack the time to do a complete history, especially under the pressures of managed care.\n\nDr. Roberts says that if primary-care physicians used the blood test, many more patients would be treated appropriately. While most allergy patients are seen by these generalists, he says, many allergies are not adequately diagnosed.\n\n\u201cCould we do a better job collectively?\u201d he asked. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\nSome allergists have made the switch to blood testing \u2014 especially in the area of food allergies, where blood testing is replacing the so-called food challenge test, a two- to six-hour procedure in which patients are given increasing amounts of suspect foods like egg or milk to determine whether they will have an allergic reaction.\n\nDr. Hugh Sampson, a food allergy expert at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, is seeking to add a level of precision to diagnosis. He correlates levels of specific IgE with a probability that the person is allergic to a food \u2014 a technique, he says, that reduces the need for food challenge testing by half.\n\nDr. Mitchell, the Manhattan allergist, called that approach promising. \u201cA lot of academic allergists are very conservative,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Hugh Sampson\u2019s work may turn the tide.\u201d\n\nAs for Sarah Marcus, starting last summer she was weaned from allergy shots so she would no longer need them when she went away to college, at the University of Pennsylvania. She has been shot-free and allergy-free since Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cAll in all,\u201d said her mother, \u201cif I could go back, if I had a 2-year-old now, I\u2019d never put her through the skin testing.\u201d", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story commits disease mongering by not emphasizing that the blood and skin tests are only used in those with severe allergies.

At a week old, doctors amputated his dead forearm and hand. They were afraid his body would be become infected and he would die. Falardeau mourned her boy's missing arm for years but, in time, embraced her son as he was.\n\nWyatt also learned to adapt. They tried a couple of prosthetics when he was younger and each time the toddler abandoned the false limb within months.\n\n\"His main interest was to create a shocking response from onlookers by pulling it off in the grocery store,\" Falardeau wrote on CNN iReport . In truth, she had been more concerned about getting him therapy for his autism-related delays -- the limb difference was secondary.\n\nSo when a friend shared a story from the \"Today Show\" with Wyatt in mind, about a team of University of Central Florida (UCF) students and graduates that made an electronic arm for 6-year-old Pring using a three-dimensional printer on campus, Falardeau was defensive.\n\n\"He doesn't need this,\" she thought.\n\nHer fifth-grader had a different reaction: \"I want one of these robot arms!\" Falardeau remembers Wyatt telling her and her husband. \"I could ride a bike! I might even be able to paddle a kayak!\"\n\nThere were other things the 12-year-old boy said he would do if he had two hands. A proper somersault. Clap with two hands. Dance with a pretty girl with one hand on her back and the other leading. Stuff she hadn't really thought about but he clearly had.\n\nFalardeau got in touch with the Orlando students through E-Nable , an online volunteer organization started by Rochester Institute of Technology research scientist Jon Schull to match people who have 3-D printers with children in need of hands and arms. The organization creates and shares bionic arm designs for free download at EnablingTheFuture.org that can be assembled for as little as $20 to $50. Middle and high school student groups and Girl and Boy Scout troops are among those donating their time and materials to assemble limbs for kids and give them to recipients for free.\n\n\"It's really just a step-by-step process of solving problems. The first problem we solved was: how do we make the hand move electronically? And then: how do we attach this arm to a child?\" said sophomore Tyler Petresky. \"It's just one problem after another we keep solving. That's what engineering is all about.\"\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about 1,500 babies in the United States are born with upper limb deformities each year. Comprehensive statistics aren't available for the number of children with amputations, such as Wyatt.\n\nThe UCF project started when Albert Manero, an engineering doctoral student, heard a story on the radio about one of the inventors of the 3-D printed hand. He got involved with E-Nable and met Alex, a local boy teased because of his missing arm, and set about designing a robotic replacement. They gave it to Alex for free.\n\nEach electronic limb takes about 30 to 50 hours to make and assemble. The students use the printer in the school's manufacturing lab and cover the cost of materials -- about $350 -- through donations.\n\nPetresky got involved with the design of Pring's hand because Manero knew he was good with electronics.\n\n\"He bribed me with some pulled pork sandwiches. I went over to his house and helped him out with electronics,\" he said. \"I found out he was working on an arm, and I thought that was the coolest thing in the world.\"\n\nEventually Manero moved to Germany for a Fulbright scholarship and left Petresky in charge of running the operations in Orlando.\n\nPetresky says they ask every family about the child's favorite color, superhero and interests, so the new limb can \"not just be a piece of plastic ... but be a part of them.\"\n\nAs they've designed the bionics, they've learned that kids don't necessarily want to blend in. Children have requested colorful designs inspired by superheroes, Disney's \"Frozen,\" and in Wyatt's case, the blue-skinned men from \"Blue Man Group.\" For Christmas, the group upgraded Alex's plain vanilla white arm to a new one resembling Optimus Prime from \"Transformers.\"\n\n\"We quickly found out this is much less about fitting in and feeling normal, and much more about expressing yourself,\" Petresky said. \"There's a large aspect of being artistic and being creative.\"\n\nThe team has made electronic arms for five children and are working with three more kids including Wyatt. He traveled with his mom to UCF last week and practiced flexing his muscle to make the hand open and close.\n\nHe expects to get fitted with his new arm later this month.\n\nHis mom, Cynthia, was most excited about seeing Wyatt being celebrated for who he is.\n\n\"The adoration of college students was an affirmation that money can't buy. He was wrapped in the joy of leading and advising students on how to help children like himself,\" she wrote in her iReport. \"Wyatt felt like he was making a difference for himself and other children.\"\n\nAs they got ready to leave the campus, her son told her he can't wait to see what he will accomplish with his new arm. And someday, he said, he wants to go to UCF and help other kids like him.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "We will give the story a passing mark on this criterion, because it obviously applies only to people who do not have two arms. However, while the story did mention that 3D printers might be able to help provide prosthetic arms to people around the world who do not have access to conventional prosthetic arms, the story would have been better if it provided some explanation of why the patients it profiled would choose a 3D printed arm over any of the other prosthetic arms currently available.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "\u201cWe had outstanding results, and our study, we think, is representative of these treatments in the and ,\u201d said Dr. Thomas G.

Brown, chief investigator for the European trial, the International Carotid Stenting Study, said that although differences in the groups studied might explain the disparate results, \u201cnobody has really shown stenting is better than surgery, so why choose a stent?\u201d\n\nDr. Brown added, \u201cEven if Crest shows little difference between the two, there are three other trials that suggest surgery is safer.\u201d\n\nStrokes are the third leading cause of death in the United States and a major cause of disability among adults. Each year, almost 800,000 Americans suffer a stroke, and more than 140,000 die.\n\nAlthough many patients take drugs like statins and medicine to reduce their risk of stroke, surgical treatment of severe blockages in the carotid artery has been shown to be more effective than medical therapy alone in preventing ischemic strokes caused by a buildup of plaque in the arteries.\n\nThe Crest trial, sponsored by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke with additional financing from the stent maker Abbott Vascular, is one of the largest randomized clinical trials to study the two major procedures used to open blocked neck arteries and restore blood flow to the brain.\n\nIt included 2,502 patients at more than 100 in the United States and Canada, who were randomly assigned to receive either surgery or stenting over a period of nine years. Most of the patients had an artery blockage greater than 70 percent. The trial included patients who had suffered a stroke or a ministroke and those who were asymptomatic.\n\nThe death rate in the trial was very low, but risks varied depending on the procedure. Within the first month after the procedure, 4.1 percent of stent patients had suffered a stroke, compared with 2.3 percent of the surgery patients. But surgery patients were at higher risk for , with 2.3 percent suffering a heart attack in the first 30 days compared with 1.1 percent of stent patients. Strokes had a higher impact on the patient\u2019s quality of life, the study reported.\n\nYounger patients \u2014 those under 70 \u2014 had better results with stenting, while older patients had better results with surgery, the study found.\n\nLong-term follow-up of patients, which was two and a half years on average but is continuing, found both groups at equal risk of suffering a stroke that should have been prevented by the procedure: 2 percent of those in the stent group compared with 2.4 percent of the surgical patients.\n\nThe European trial, which included 1,713 patients randomly assigned to either stent or endarterectomy, found that stent patients were at much higher risk of stroke, death or heart attack in the first 30 days after surgery, with 7.4 percent suffering one of these adverse events, compared with 4 percent of the surgery group.\n\nAmong the possible explanations offered for the disparities are that the European study included only symptomatic patients, who may have had more advanced disease, and that the North American trial carefully screened the doctors doing the stenting procedure, including only highly skilled physicians with a lot of experience.\n\nDr. Walter J. Koroshetz, deputy director of the institute that sponsored the North American trial, said the Crest trial was the first in which the results of stenting and surgery had been found to be equivalent \u2014 suggesting that the stent procedure had improved with time.\n\nThe most important message is that the overall death rate was extremely low, 0.6 percent, said one of the study\u2019s principal investigators, Dr. Gary S.

The findings suggest that for most people with prediabetes, a diet rich with vegetables fruits and wholegrains should be recommended for weight loss and could potentially improve diabetes markers.

However, it is now known that physical training can relieve many of the symptoms, including the excessive fatigue and mobility impairments that are often seen. New research now shows that resistance training may protect the nervous system and thus slow the progression of the disease.\n\nThis is the main finding of a study conducted by a research partnership between Aarhus University, Aarhus University Hospital, the University of Southern Denmark and the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, that has just been published in Multiple Sclerosis Journal.\n\nThe study shows that resistance training has a number of positive effects on the brain, which go beyond what can be achieved through effective disease specific medication.\n\n\"Over the past six years, we have been pursuing the idea that physical training has effects on more than just the symptoms, and this study provides the first indications that physical exercise may protect the nervous system against the disease,\" says one of the researchers behind the study, Associate Professor Ulrik Dalgas from the Department of Public Health at Aarhus University.\n\n\"For the past 15 years, we have known that physical exercise does not harm people with multiple sclerosis, but instead often has a positive impact on, for example, their ability to walk, their levels of fatigue, their muscle strength and their aerobic capacity, which has otherwise often deteriorated.

Half of the group engaged in resistance training twice a week, while the other half continued to live their lives normally without systematic training.\n\nPrior to and following the six-month period, the test subjects had their brains MR-scanned, and the researchers could see that there was a tendency for the brain to shrink less in those patients who undertook resistance training.\n\n\"Among persons with multiple sclerosis, the brain shrinks markedly faster than normal. Drugs can counter this development, but we saw a tendency that training further minimises brain shrinkage in patients already receiving medication. In addition, we saw that several smaller brain areas actually started to grow in response to training,\" says Ulrik Dalgas.\n\nThe researchers behind the study are still unable to explain why training has a positive effect on the brain in people with multiple sclerosis. A bigger and more in-depth on-going study will help to clarify this, and may also lead to improved treatment options, says Ulrik Dalgas. However, he stresses that the aim is not to replace medication with physical training.\n\n\"Phasing out drugs in favour of training is not realistic.

The difference came in later years, suggesting that tamoxifen has a carry-over effect that lasts long after women stop taking it.\n\nWhether these differences are big enough to cause women to take the drug for twice as long remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cThe treatment effect is real, but it\u2019s modest,\u201d said Dr. Paul E. Goss, director of breast cancer research at the Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nTamoxifen has side effects, including endometrial cancer, blood clots and hot flashes, which cause many women to stop taking the drug. In the Atlas trial, it appears that roughly 40 percent of the patients assigned to take tamoxifen for the additional five years stopped prematurely.\n\nSome 3.1 percent of those taking the extra five years of tamoxifen got endometrial cancer versus 1.6 percent in the control group. However, only 0.6 percent of those in the longer treatment group died from endometrial cancer or pulmonary blood clots, compared with 0.4 percent in the control group.\n\n\u201cOver all, the benefits of extended tamoxifen seemed to outweigh the risks substantially,\u201d Trevor J. Powles of the Cancer Center London, said in a commentary published by The Lancet.\n\nDr. Judy E. Garber, director of the Center for Cancer Genetics and Prevention at Dana-Farber, said many women have a love-hate relationship with hormone therapies.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t feel well on them, but it\u2019s their safety net,\u201d said Dr. Garber, who added that the news would be welcomed by many patients who would like to stay on the drug. \u201cI have patients who agonize about this, people who are coming to the end of their tamoxifen.\u201d\n\nEmily Behrend, who is a few months from finishing her five years on tamoxifen, said she would definitely consider another five years. \u201cIf it can keep the cancer away, I\u2019m all for it,\u201d said Ms. Behrend, 39, a single mother in Tomball, Tex. She is taking the antidepressant Effexor to help control the night sweats and hot flashes caused by tamoxifen.\n\nCost is not considered a huge barrier to taking tamoxifen longer because the drug can be obtained for less than $200 a year.\n\nThe results, while answering one question, raise many new ones, including whether even more than 10 years of treatment would be better still.\n\nPerhaps the most important question is what the results mean for postmenopausal women. Even many women who are premenopausal at the time of diagnosis will pass through menopause by the time they finish their first five years of tamoxifen, or will have been pushed into menopause by chemotherapy.\n\nPostmenopausal patients tend to take aromatase inhibitors like anastrozole or letrozole, which are more effective than tamoxifen at preventing breast cancer recurrence, though they do not work for premenopausal women.\n\nMr. Peto said he thought the results of the Atlas study would \u201capply to endocrine therapy in general,\u201d meaning that 10 years of an aromatase inhibitor would be better than five years.

Data from a second arm of the study is still being evaluated.\n\nA separate study of the drug also showed signs it could work in people who first appeared not to respond to the drug.\n\nResearchers reintroduced the drug to 32 patients who were initially treated as part of a study of 634 patients.\n\nEight of the 32 got ipilimumab alone, 23 got ipilimumab plus a vaccine called gp100, and one got the vaccine alone.

It is found throughout the human body, with high concentrations in the liver, adrenal glands and brain.\n\nThe latest research, conducted by investigators at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, is important not only because it suggests another treatment option for patients with depression, but because it also offers news clues into the physical pathways of depression that could ultimately lead to more effective treatments.\n\n\u201cThere are many directions in research that this opens up,\u201d said Dr. George I. Papakostas, director of treatment resistant depression studies at Mass General and the study\u2019s lead author. \u201cIt provides clues to new treatments, and it provides clues to understanding what causes depression as well as what goes on biochemically when people get better from depression.\u201d\n\nThe researchers studied the use of SAMe or a placebo in 73 adults with depression who were not responding to prescription antidepressant treatment. All of the study subjects continued to take the prescription antidepressant, but 39 of them were randomly assigned to receive SAMe for six weeks. The remaining 34 patients received a placebo in addition to their regular prescription treatment.\n\nAfter six weeks of treatment, 36 percent of the patients taking a combination of SAMe and an antidepressant showed improvement, compared to just 18 percent of those taking the antidepressant and placebo. And about 26 percent of patients in the SAMe group experienced a complete remission of symptoms, compared to just 12 percent in the placebo group, according to a report published in The American Journal of Psychiatry.\n\nThe research offers hope to patients who haven\u2019t been helped by traditional antidepressant treatment. Studies suggest that for more than half of depressed patients, antidepressants alone don\u2019t eliminate symptoms. As a result, doctors are looking for additional treatments to help these patients, referred to as \u201cnonresponders.\u201d\n\nModern antidepressants essentially work by building up concentrations of neurotransmitters, which amplifies their effect on the brain. It\u2019s not clear exactly how SAMe works to curb depression, but researchers have several theories. SAMe may influence the expression of genes involved in depression or alter the function of different receptors and structures that transport neurotransmitters in the brain. The molecule also may be directly involved in the creation of neurotransmitters.\n\n\u201cMost antidepressants we use are acting on neurotransmitters in the brain,\u201d said Dr. J. Craig Nelson, professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, and author of an editorial accompanying the study. \u201cIt may be that SAMe is facilitating the synthesis of the neurotransmitters that the drugs then act on. That\u2019s probably the best hypothesis.\u201d\n\nOther studies have suggested that SAMe can relieve symptoms of depression. A 2002 analysis of depression trials conducted by the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality found that SAMe use resulted in clinically meaningful benefits to depressed patients compared to placebo, and that the supplement worked as well as tricyclic antidepressants, a category of prescription drugs.\n\nIn his editorial, Dr. Nelson notes that SAMe is typically not covered by insurance companies, and that although the cost is relatively low, it is still more than the drug co-payments required by most health plans. A monthly supply of the same brand of supplement studied would be about $143, the editorial notes.\n\nDr. Nelson, who was not involved in the Harvard study, said the results need to be replicated in a larger study, and that more information is needed on dosing, side effects and long-term treatment with SAMe, among other things. Dr. Papakostas agrees the study \u201cneeds replication\u201d but said he is hopeful about the potential for future research.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge advancement in terms of expanding the types of medications we have to treat depression,\u201d Dr. Papakostas said. \u201cIn the last 60 years of depression research, all the treatments have focused on similar mechanisms of action. This is one of the first few studies that suggests a different mechanism. It\u2019s a medication that works differently than everything else.\u201d\n\nThe study was funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Mental Health, but the SAMe pills and placebo pills were provided by the dietary supplement maker Pharmavite.

He wasn't doing his homework. He was being very difficult with his little brother. And he was just melting down day after day,\" Ellison says. \"So I decided to devote a year to trying out different approaches to see if we could make it any better.\"\n\nIn recent years, more people have been trying an alternative approach called neurofeedback, a type of therapy intended to teach the brain to stay calm and focused. Neurofeedback is expensive, time consuming and still scientifically unproved. But, there's growing evidence that it can help.\n\nEllison says the idea appealed to her immediately.\n\n\"Because I was always wary about using meds as a single approach or for very long, it seemed to be an interesting alternative. It's really like meditation on steroids,\" says Ellison, a journalist who won a Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting -- and who has ADHD herself.\n\nEllison has written a book about living with ADHD called Buzz: A Year of Paying Attention. And one chapter of the book is devoted to neurofeedback.\n\nEllison says she tried meditation, but her mind kept wandering. Neurofeedback is better for people with ADHD, she says, because it provides constant feedback during a session, which is usually done in a therapist's office.\n\nPeople usually sit in a chair facing a laptop screen. The laptop is connected to electrodes applied to the scalp. Special software monitors the electrical activity in your brain. In particular, it measures rhythmic patterns known as theta and beta waves.\n\nProponents of neurofeedback say these patterns reveal when the brain is in a focused and attentive state. So the computer software looks for desirable brain wave patterns and changes the image on screen to let people know how they are doing.\n\nThe image that worked best for Ellison showed a field.\n\n\"When my brain responded the way that it was supposed to, the field would burst into color. I'd hear bird song and beautiful flowers would bloom,\" she says. \"But when I got distracted or when I got a little bit more sped up, the flowers would wilt. It would turn gray, and I'd know that I needed to work a little bit harder.\"\n\nAt first, people can't control their brain wave patterns, at least not consciously. But over time, their brains become conditioned to associate certain patterns with pleasant images or sounds -- a reward for good behavior. And our brains like rewards.\n\nThis sort of brain training can take 40 sessions or more, and typically costs thousands of dollars.\n\nEven though there are studies now showing that neurofeedback works for ADHD, all of these studies have serious limitations, researchers say. So the approach remains promising but unproved, says David Rabiner, a researcher at Duke University who writes a newsletter about treatments for ADHD.\n\n\"Parents do need to know that relative to treatments like medication treatment, to behavior therapy, at this point, the research base is not as extensive,\" Rabiner says.\n\nOn the other hand, Rabiner says, neurofeedback may offer something other treatments can't.\n\n\"The hope for neurofeedback is that after training ends, the benefits that resulted from training will persist -- that in some sense there's been more enduring change in the child's ability to focus and attend and to regulate their behavior,\" he says.\n\nBut it will take better research to figure out whether neurofeedback can live up to that promise, Rabiner says.\n\n\"There has been a need for some time to have the kind of carefully controlled study that would provide more definitive answers for parents and for the field,\" he says.\n\nAnd that research appears to be on the way.\n\nA team at The Ohio State University has nearly completed a pilot study of neurofeedback for ADHD that was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\nThe team had hoped to announce results last week at a scientific meeting in New York, but Gene Arnold, one of the scientists in charge of the study, says they had to delay that announcement because \"we weren't able to get the results analyzed in time,\" he says.\n\nThe results should be out within a few weeks, Arnold says. In the meantime, he says, the study has shown that it is possible to do neurofeedback research that involves a placebo.\n\nThe study used a video game involving race cars. For kids who got neurofeedback, he says, \"The ability to speed up the car and steer it was contingent on maintaining your brain waves in a more favorable ratio.\"\n\nBut other children got a placebo -- a race car that paid no attention to their brain waves.\n\nUntil a large study comes along using this sort of approach, parents and consumers will have to decide for themselves whether neurofeedback is worth the time and effort.

For example, a study tested the approach in 23 young adults, around age 24. Compared with a control group of 20 young adults, the treatment group increased letter recognition speed.

But in some people HPV leads to genital warts and cancers \u2013 notably, cervical cancer.\n\nThe vaccines Gardasil and Cervarix were designed as a prevention for young women who have not yet been exposed to HPV. Men up to age 26 are also eligible for Gardasil to protect against HPV. But there are a lot of people out there who still have HPV, and nothing protects against all 130 strains of the virus. At least half of all sexually active males and females have had HPV, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nA Pennsylvania start-up company called Inovio Pharmaceuticals has developed an experimental vaccine for people who already have HPV and precancerous lesions that are associated with it. A new study demonstrating the vaccine's safety and potential effectiveness was published this week in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\n \n\n The experimental vaccine does not use the live HPV virus; it is formulated in synthetic DNA and pure water. It uses the immune system of the treated women to fight off cancer, said Joseph Kim, president and CEO of Inovio Pharmaceuticals and study co-author.\n\nWorldwide, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer after breast cancer, with about 493,000 new cases and 274,000 deaths annually, the study said. HPV causes about 5% of cancers globally.\n\nSome women, because of their particular genetic makeup, can clear precancerous lesions on their own and would not need this vaccine. This happens in anywhere from 10% to 25% of women infected with HPV, Kim said.\n\nNo one knows why some women have this capability and others do not, but for those who lack it the Inovio vaccine is \"giving our immune system a little boost,\" Kim said.\n\nEighteen women with high-grade precancerous cervical lesions participated in the phase 1 study.\n\nStudy authors say the vaccine is formulated to work against all cancers caused by HPV types 16 and 18, including cervical, anogenital (anal and genital), and head and neck cancers. The researchers did not observe any side effects.\n\nIn the next phase of this research 150 women worldwide are participating, but they are not included in these published results, Kim said.\n\nThe phase 1 results are very early in the experimentation of this vaccine. The study was not done as a randomized controlled trial, the gold standard for determining whether a drug works better than chance. Also, 18 people is a small number for examining the effects of a medication.\n\nGiven those drawbacks, it\u2019s not appropriate to draw too many conclusions from this study, says Dr. Diane Harper, a prominent HPV researcher at the University of Missouri \u2013 Kansas City\u2019s School of Medicine. Harper contributed to the studies on both HPV vaccines that are currently available, Cervarix and Gardasil, and is not involved with this research.\n\n\u201cSeveral therapeutic vaccines have shown great promise in phase 1 and then not panned out in phase 2,\u201d she noted in an e-mail.\n\nThe vaccine consists of three injections in the arm over three months, Kim said. The vaccine trains T-cells in the body to go after cervical cells with potentially cancerous genes embedded in them.\n\nInovio is using this technology to develop vaccines for prostate cancer and HIV also, Kim said.\n\n\u201cWe certainly have a technology that can change the medical field by being able to program and generate strong immune responses that are specific and effective,\u201d he said.\n\nKim said the next phase results should be out at the end of 2013; then comes a larger phase 3 trial with about 500 patients, to be concluded around 2016 or 2017.\n\nHPV is spread through genital contact, including oral sex, and partners can bounce the virus back and forth between them, making it harder to clear naturally.

And so the current message is to replace saturated fat with unsaturated fat, and in so doing, consume a moderate-fat diet, not too much, and also not too little,\u201d Kris-Etherton told NBC News.\n\nKris-Etherton and colleagues did an intensive study with 45 typical Americans \u2013 all overweight or obese, but with healthy cholesterol and blood pressure levels.\n\nIt\u2019s tough to test diets in real life, because people eat so many different things, but the team controlled what everyone ate, feeding them carefully calibrated diets. One was a lower-fat diet without avocado, another was a moderate-fat diet without avocado, and the third added one avocado per day to the moderate-fat diet.\n\nThe two moderate-fat diets looked a lot like the average American diet, with about a third of calories coming from fat. The lower fat diet provided 24 percent of calories from fat.\n\nEveryone spent five weeks on each diet. No one lost weight, but their low-density lipoprotein (LDL or \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol) levels changed.\n\n\u201cAll diets decreased LDL cholesterol, the main lipid risk factor for cardiovascular disease. But the diet with the avocado decreased LDL cholesterol the most,\u201d Kris-Etherton said.\n\nAmericans are advised to keep total cholesterol below 200 and preferably below 180. LDL should be below 100.\n\nWhile they were eating the avocado-a-day diet, the volunteers saw their LDL go down by more than 13 points compared to their usual levels, Kris-Etherton\u2019s team reported in the Journal of the American Heart Association.\n\nLDL was 8.3 points lower on the moderate-fat diet without the avocado and 7.4 points less on the lower-fat diet.\n\nThe volunteers all ate Hass avocados, which have bumpy green skin. The Hass Avocado Board helped pay for the research, which was also funded by the U.S. government.\n\nIn addition to monounsaturated fats, the avocados contain fiber, phytosterols and polyphenols \u2013 all of which can help lower cholesterol. Avocados also contain natural sugars that may help regulate blood sugar.\n\n\u201cWe need to focus on getting people to eat a heart-healthy diet that includes avocados and other nutrient-rich food sources of better fats,\u201d Kris-Etherton said.\n\n\u201cAll the foods were exactly the same, except the avocado versus oils that were high in monounsaturated fat on the moderate-fat diet. So that was the only difference between the two diets, which then tells us that it's the avocado that has additional benefits which are beyond the unsaturated fat.\u201d\n\nThe findings are similar to a batch of studies that showed people who were given olive oil and nuts and told to add them to their diets ended up healthier. They were less likely to have strokes or heart attacks, and they were less likely to die over a period of years than people who didn\u2019t get the extra oils.\n\nSaturated fat \u2013 the kind found in meat and butter \u2013 has a different chemical structure from the unsaturated fats found in plant products. Repeated studies have shown it raises the risk of heart disease.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe studied avocados but maybe a lot of other fruits and vegetables have these bioactive components which have additional cholesterol-lowering effects,\u201d Kris-Etherton said. \u201cAnd certainly there's an emerging research base showing that some of these bioactive components may affect another lipoprotein particle favorably, like high-density lipoprotein. I think we need to stay tuned for that. \u201c\n\nAmericans may not be used to eating avocado but Kris-Etherton says it\u2019s easy to add.\n\n\u201cConsumers can include avocados in their diet in salads. They can include avocados on top of a sandwich, or in a sandwich. They can make guacamole and use vegetables rather than chips as the dip,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI love guacamole and with my recipe, I'll use avocados, cilantro, lime juice and garlic... and then sometimes I'll put salsa in, or red pepper flakes.\u201d\n\nBut like anything, too much of a good thing can be harmful. Avocados are definitely not low-calorie food.\n\n\u201cOne avocado has around 200 to 250 calories. So I would strongly urge people not to just add an avocado a day to their diet but they have to substitute nutrient-poor calories, which are so popular in the U.S. diet.,\u201d Kris-Etherton said.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story didn\u2019t engage in disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Evidence suggests it may not only be good for mind and body, but also for a long life\n\nThe consensus--one of the first of its kind--comes on the eve of the Ryder Cup, the biennial golf tournament between Europe and the US.\n\nAmid a growing body of evidence on the health impacts of the sport, the consensus aims to help current and would-be players maximise the health pros and minimise the health cons of golf, and to guide policy-makers and industry leaders on how best to make golf more inclusive and accessible and so encourage more people from all walks of life to take up the sport.\n\nThe statement draws on a systematic review of the available published evidence (342 eligible studies) and discussions among an international working group of 25 experts in public health and health policy, and industry leaders.\n\nAgreement was reached on 79 statements in three areas. These set out what is currently known about golf's associations with health; the factors that may help or hinder take-up of the sport; and a series of recommendations for golfers, industry leaders, and policy makers on how best to maximise its health benefits, promote sustainability, and widen participation.\n\nThe evidence shows that playing golf regularly is associated with longevity and reducing the risk factors for heart disease/stroke. And it can boost older people's strength and balance.\n\nThe sport is also associated with good mental health and improving the overall health of those with disabilities.\n\nCompared with other sports, the risk of injury is moderate, but as it's an outdoor activity, golfers may be more at risk of skin cancer.\n\nGolf is sociable, and gets people outdoors, connecting with nature. It can provide moderate intensity aerobic physical activity, and its health benefits are greatest for players (and spectators) who walk round the course rather than opt for a golf cart.\n\nWhile around 60 million people play golf at least twice every year, the participant profile is quite narrow: players tend to be middle aged to older, male, of white European heritage, relatively well off, and living in North America, Europe, and Australasia.\n\nAnd the sport is often perceived as expensive, male dominated, difficult to learn, and not a game for the young or those on the lower rungs of the social ladder.\n\nThis can put people off, says the statement. The sport needs to be more inclusive and welcoming of people from all walks of life and ethnic backgrounds, and any such initiatives should be supported, it says.\n\nMore people might be keen to take it up if golf were promoted as an enjoyable, lifelong outdoors activity that affords a sense of community and competitive challenge while providing some 'me time' as well as helping to fulfil recommended exercise quotas, says the statement.\n\nAnd the sport can do its bit for sustainability by \"practices that prioritise diversity, healthy societies, connection with, and care of, the environment, environmental integrity and health and wellbeing,\" the statement suggests.\n\nAmong its raft of recommendations, the consensus statement says that:\n\u2022 Should aim to play for 150 minutes/week, or do less, but couple golf with other physical activity, and walk the course rather than ride a golf cart\n\u2022 Do warm-up/strengthening exercises to cut the risk of injury and use sun-cream and wear collared shirts/blouses to minimise the risk of skin cancer\n\u2022 Build on existing initiatives to promote inclusivity and develop environments and price structures that will be attractive to everyone\n\u2022 Develop a culture that will inspire more women and girls to play golf\n\u2022 Make every effort to promote equality and diversity, and boost accessibility\n\u2022 Promote sustainability through wildlife conservation and by restricting the use of water, energy, and pesticides\n\u2022 Provide additional facilities at clubs, such as a gym, walking routes, cr\u00e8ches and improve the focus on health and safety, with the provision of healthy foods, defibrillators, and speed limiters on golf carts, for example\n\u2022 Promote the benefits of regular physical activity, including golf, for people of all ages, genders, and income brackets\n\u2022 Work with industry and national associations to boost take up of the sport, particularly in groups where physical activity levels are low\n\u2022 Work with industry and regulatory bodies to get golf included in the Paralympics\n\n\"These outputs, if widely shared and adopted, will contribute to an improved understanding of golf and health, and aid these groups in making evidence-informed decisions and to improve health and wellbeing,\" the consensus statement concludes.", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering noted.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "MONDAY, Jan. 28, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- Breast-conserving surgery for early stage breast cancers may result in better survival than mastectomy, according to a new study.\n\nFor those with early stage breast cancer, \"lumpectomy is just as effective if not more effective than mastectomy,\" said researcher Dr. Shelley Hwang, chief of breast surgery at Duke Cancer Institute in Durham, N.C.\n\n\"There are lots of women who think the more [treatment] they do, the better they will do,\" she said. \"This refutes that.\"\n\nThe findings, published online Jan. 28 in the journal Cancer, are especially strong for women over 50 with hormone-sensitive cancers, the researchers found.\n\nEarlier research had also concluded that the two procedures are similarly effective, but Hwang's is a more \"real-world\" study.\n\nHwang's team looked at 14 years of data from the California Cancer Registry, following more than 112,000 women with early stage breast cancer (stages 1 or 2) between 1990 and 2004. Ages ranged from 39 to 80.\n\nMore than half (55 percent) had lumpectomy and radiation, while 45 percent had mastectomy (complete breast removal) alone.\n\nHwang compared lumpectomy and radiation with mastectomy alone, not mastectomy plus radiation. \"We wanted to look at early stage disease, and those patients typically don't get radiation after mastectomy,\" she said.\n\nThe researchers tracked the women's progress for a median of more than nine years (half followed longer, half less). During that time, more than 31,000 women died, nearly 40 percent of them from breast cancer. The others died of other causes.\n\nFor the first three years after treatment, those who had a mastectomy had a higher risk of dying from heart disease and other ailments than those who had lumpectomy. This may indicate that the women who underwent lumpectomy were generally healthier, Hwang said.\n\nOver the entire follow-up, those who underwent lumpectomy were more likely to survive the breast cancer.\n\n\"The group that benefited the most -- who had the biggest difference in breast cancer survival -- were those women over 50 with estrogen-receptor positive disease,\" Hwang said. This means their cancer depends on estrogen to grow.\n\nAmong those women, the lumpectomy group had a 13 percent lower risk of death from breast cancer and a 19 percent lower risk of death from any cause than those who had a mastectomy.\n\nNot all women with early stage breast cancers can have a lumpectomy, Hwang said. In this procedure, just the tumor and some healthy tissue are removed, sparing the rest of the breast. Among the exceptions are those whose cancers are too large, or those who have different cancers in the same breast.\n\nThe percent of women with early breast cancers choosing a mastectomy has risen recently, after a dip in previous years. Hwang and others suspect that women told they could safely opt for lumpectomy were still afraid to try it.\n\nThe new research, which was funded by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, suggests that if a lumpectomy is possible, it may actually increase survival, Hwang said.\n\nThe findings may reverse the mastectomy trend, said Dr. Laura Kruper, co-director of the breast oncology program at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., who was not involved in the study.\n\nThe study is scientifically sound in many ways, Kruper said. \"They broke it down by year of diagnosis and by age category,\" she said. \"They looked at socioeconomic status, and they kept it early stage.\"\n\nDr. Wendy Woodward, section chief for breast radiation oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said that for women with early cancers, the study \"clearly reiterates there is no detriment to cancer control in having a lumpectomy and radiation for breast-conserving surgery candidates.\"\n\nBut, Woodward added, \"I am not sure the study convinces us that lumpectomy and radiation is better for breast cancer survival, but it may be.\"\n\nThe study was observational, Hwang stressed. It found a link or association but could not provide cause-and-effect proof that the breast-conserving treatment is more effective than mastectomy in early stage breast cancer.\n\nHwang believes the study does arm women with valuable information. However, \"I don't want women who chose mastectomy to think they did the wrong thing,\" Hwang said. \"At the end of the day, personal preference trumps everything else. I fully support the patient's options to choose the best treatment for themselves.\"\n\nTo learn more about lumpectomy, visit the American Cancer Society.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There was no disease mongering noted.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "(Edmonton, AB) Groundbreaking research from the University of Alberta and McGill University has opened the door towards the future prevention of cardiac fibrosis--a condition leading to heart failure for which there is currently no treatment.\n\nThe collaborative study, funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and published in PLOS One, examined the molecular mechanisms that lead to cardiac fibrosis in a pre-clinical model. The study discovered the specific triggers activating the development of fibrosis which accelerates heart failure. Blocking the triggers through the use of a specific kind of bile acid prevented cardiac fibrosis from occurring.\n\n\"This is something that nobody has ever seen before,\" says Marek Michalak, co-principal investigator and a distinguished professor in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Alberta's Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry. \"Cardiac fibrosis is considered a permanent remodeling of the heart. Inevitably it leads to heart failure and eventually death. The bottom line is that this shows for the first time that cardiac fibrosis is preventable.\"\n\n\"It offers hope to those who are living with heart failure,\" adds Luis Agellon, co-principal investigator and a professor at McGill University's School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition. \"Prevention of fibrosis will extend the ability of the heart to function, even if at a reduced capacity. Currently patients with heart failure have poor quality of life and a dismal prognosis. Improving their quality of life will do wonders for these individuals.\"\n\nFibrosis is an early step on the path to heart failure. According to the Heart and Stroke Foundation there are currently 1.3 million Canadians living with heart disease or heart failure--a condition that severely limits physical activity because the heart cannot pump enough oxygenated blood that the body needs. About 30 per cent of patients diagnosed with heart failure will die within the first year.\n\nCardiac fibrosis itself is caused by a variety of factors including high blood pressure, overwork of cardiac muscle and long-term consumption of a diet that is high in both saturated fat and sugar--all cause increased stress to heart cells. Individuals with diabetes, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and heart transplant recipients are also known to be at high risk.\n\n\"It's almost like building a scar,\" says Michalak. \"It's exactly the same type of biological activity but it's happening in the heart tissue. It destroys the ability of the heart to function normally.\"\n\nThe team is now pushing forward with additional studies to see if the same therapeutic effect can be achieved in humans. They also aim to gain a better understanding of exactly how bile acids can prevent cardiac fibrosis from occurring.\n\n\"We don't yet have a full understanding--nobody does--of how the bile acid actually does what it does in heart cells,\" explains Michalak. \"So, another phase of the work is to find out what actually happens within heart cells at the molecular level.

Cortisol levels fluctuate during the day meaning results were not always accurate, and only revealed cortisol levels at a single point in time.\n\nThe tests could also be unpleasant and invasive for children, given blood tests require a needle and saliva tests require the child to fast beforehand.\n\n\u201cHowever, hair samples are not only easier to obtain, but provide us with a picture of total cortisol throughout the system across many months rather than just at a point in time,\u201d Simmons said.\n\n\u201cLooking at hair tells us new things.\u201d\n\nThe research is part of the ongoing Murdoch Childrens Research Institute\u2019s Childhood to Adolescence Study following a cohort of 1,200 children in and around Melbourne and was published in the journal, Psychoneuroendocrinology.\n\nSimmons said the results did not mean all children with elevated cortisol levels would go on to develop behavioural problems or mental illness, with many other social, environmental and genetic factors also involved.\n\nBut it did reveal it was important to further study hormones and the body\u2019s endocrine system, and how they relate to mental illnesses like anxiety and depression, he said.\n\n\u201cWe hope this can be used as one of the tools to identify children at risk,\u201d he said.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "None.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "It turns out that cholesterol isn\u2019t the only thing you have to worry about to keep your heart healthy. In recent years, doctors have started to focus on inflammation \u2014 the same process that makes cuts red and painful \u2014 as an important contributor to a heart attack. It\u2019s the reason doctors recommend low-dose aspirin to prevent recurrent heart attacks in people who have already had them, why they also prescribe statins, which lower both cholesterol and inflammation, and why they have started to measure inflammation levels in the blood.\n\nBut it\u2019s never been clear exactly how much inflammation adds to heart disease risk. Since statins lower both, it\u2019s hard to tell whether inflammation or cholesterol has the bigger impact on heart problems.\n\nMORE: Why Inflammation in Your Mouth May Raise Your Risk of Cancer\n\nBut in a new paper published in the and presented at the European Society of Cardiology meeting, scientists say they now have proof that lowering inflammation alone, without affecting cholesterol, also reduces the risk of a heart attack.\n\nIn the study, 10,000 people who have already had a heart attack were randomly assigned to get injected with a placebo or different doses of a drug called canakinumab. Canakinumab, made by Novartis, is currently approved to treat rare immune-related conditions and works to reduce inflammation but does not affect cholesterol levels. After four years, the people who received the drug had a 15% lower chance of having a heart attack or stroke compared to people who didn\u2019t get the drug. The medication also reduced the need for angioplasty or bypass surgery by 30%.\n\n\u201cEven I am pinching myself,\u201d says Dr. Paul Ridker, who led the study and is director of the center for cardiovascular disease prevention at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and is a pioneer in exposing the role inflammation plays in heart disease. \u201cThis outcome is more than we hoped for. The bottom line is we now have clear evidence that lowering inflammation through this pathway lowers rates of heart attack and stroke with no change at all in cholesterol.\u201d\n\nAbout a quarter of people who have heart attacks will have another heart event even if they keep their cholesterol at recommended levels. For them, it may not be cholesterol so much as inflammation that is driving their heart disease. So the study further solidifies the fact that heart doctors should be measure inflammation as well as cholesterol in their heart patients. An inexpensive blood test that looks for a protein that rises in the blood with inflammation, called C-reactive protein (CRP), can tell doctors how much inflammation their patients have. Beginning in 2003, the American Heart Association started to provide guidelines on how doctors should use CRP testing; for patients like those in the current trial, the group did not see any additional benefit to CRP testing since those patients should already be treated with statins, which can lower both cholesterol and inflammation.\n\nBut with the new results, those guidelines may change. Ridker says the findings should clarify how doctors can optimize the way they treat their heart patients \u2014 about half of people who have had a heart attack tend to have high levels of inflammatory factors, while half have high cholesterol levels. The inexpensive CRP test could identify those with higher inflammation, who might be candidates for taking a drug like canakinumab.\n\nThe drug is not currently approved for any heart conditions, but Novartis will likely look at doing more studies to confirm its effectiveness in treating heart disease.\n\nPerhaps more intriguing are additional results that Ridker reported, related to cancer. In a separate study published in the using data from the same study, he found that people taking canakinumab lowered their risk of dying from any cancer over four years by 50%, and their risk of fatal lung cancer by 75%.\n\nWhile the connection between heart disease and cancer may not seem obvious, Ridker says that many people who have had heart problems, like those in the study, are former or current smokers, since smoking is a risk factor for heart attacks. And smoking increases inflammation. \u201cPeople who smoke a pack of cigarettes a day are chronically inflaming their lungs,\u201d he says. That\u2019s why he decided to look at cancer deaths as well as heart events in his study population.\n\nThe cancer data is still preliminary, and needs to be confirmed with additional studies, but it\u2019s encouraging, says Dr. Otis Bradley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, who was not involved in the study. \u201cWe know that free oxygen radicals and inflammation can damage DNA and can cause cancer,\u201d he says. \u201cThis all makes sense to me.\u201d Studies have already shown, for example, that inflammation may be a factor in prostate cancer and colon cancer.\n\nBut whether anti-inflammatory agents, like canakinumab, or even over-the-counter drugs like aspirin, should be part of standard cancer treatment isn\u2019t clear yet. There are a number of different inflammatory pathways, and canakinumab targets just one. Other pathways, along with new anti-inflammatory drugs, may emerge with more research.\n\nWhen it comes to heart disease, however, it\u2019s clear that inflammation-fighting medications like canakinumb may represent the next generation of treatment. \u201cTen years from now we will be doing more personalized medicine,\u201d says Ridker. \u201cSome people will get more cholesterol lowering. Some will get more inflammation-lowering drugs. Some will get other agents that we haven\u2019t considered yet.

Now, a groundbreaking study suggests that not all C-sections are equally risky.\n\nThe research looked at all full-term, firstborn births in Scotland over a 15-year period and tracked the babies\u2019 long-term health. It is one of the largest and longest studies to explore how planned C-sections differ from other deliveries.\n\nSurprisingly, the data showed more health problems among babies born by planned C-section than among those delivered by emergency C-section or vaginal birth, even though the planned surgery is done under more controlled conditions. The finding suggests that the arduous experience of labor \u2014 that exhausting, sweaty, utterly unpredictable yet often strangely exhilarating process \u2014 may give children a healthy start, even when it\u2019s interrupted by a surgical birth.\n\nThe new findings, published in JAMA this month, are important because the number of babies born by C-section has increased tremendously. In the United States, nearly one in three babies are born by C-section. Cesarean births that had no medical indication increased, to 5.5 percent of low-risk women in 2001, up from 3.3 percent of such women in 1991.\n\nDr. Mairead Black, the University of Aberdeen obstetrician who led the study, said that as cesarean births had increased in Scotland and worldwide, the researchers wondered what, if anything, children born by C-section \u201care missing out on.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur thinking was: If a baby is born naturally, it comes into contact with bacteria from the mother, which might help with immune system development,\u201d Dr. Black said.\n\nEven attempted labor may provide some exposure to bacteria, she said. But babies delivered by a planned C-section, which is usually scheduled to take place well before the first pang of labor, may miss out entirely.\n\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t wait for labor to begin on its own, you cut short all kinds of physiological changes and preparations for birth that are taking place toward the end of pregnancy,\u201d said Carol Sakala, the director of the nonprofit Childbirth Connection programs at the National Partnership for Women & Families. \u201cWhat is the effect of cutting off those processes so casually on such a large scale?\u201d\n\nStudies have consistently found that children born by C-section are at higher risk for health problems like obesity and allergies. C-section birth has also been associated with a higher risk for Type 1 diabetes.\n\nThe Scottish study took advantage of the small country\u2019s rich trove of linked birth and medical databases to track the long-term health of 321,287 babies. Nearly 4 percent were born by planned C-section and 17 percent were delivered by emergency surgery. The remaining 252,917 were vaginal births.\n\nThe researchers compared a range of health outcomes among the babies, including asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, Type 1 diabetes, early death and cancer.\n\nOver all, the differences between a scheduled C-section and an emergency C-section were slight. However, the data do begin to shed light on why babies born through vaginal birth may have fewer health risks than babies born by C-section.\n\nThe biggest difference between babies born by scheduled and unscheduled C-section appeared in risk for Type 1 diabetes. The results showed that babies born by planned C-section had a 35 percent higher risk of Type 1 diabetes compared with babies born by emergency C-section, after adjusting for differences among the mothers.\n\nAll of the babies born by C-section were slightly more likely to use an asthma inhaler at age 5: 10.3 percent of planned C-section babies and 10.19 percent of unscheduled C-section babies wound up using an inhaler, compared with 9.6 percent of vaginally born babies. Asthma hospitalization rates were also higher for babies born by planned C-section with a statistically significant increase of 22 percent over vaginally born babies.\n\nAlthough all of the C-section babies were more likely to be obese at age 5, the differences were not statistically significant after adjusting for differences among the mothers. There were no significant differences in cancer and irritable bowel disease among any of the types of births.\n\nNo one knows exactly why labor may be protective, but the spontaneous onset of labor prompts fluid to clear from a baby\u2019s lungs, said Dr. Aaron Caughey, who helped draw up 2014 guidelines for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that urged providers to let women spend more time in labor and avoid an unnecessary C-section.\n\nThe step is just one of a cascade of physiological changes that take place in mother and baby during the labor process, including surges in stress hormones and reproductive hormones like oxytocin that may help the fetus adapt during labor, preserve blood flow to the organs, and keep the baby alert and prepared for breast-feeding.\n\nDuring labor, a newborn absorbs maternal microbes into its mouth and gastrointestinal tract, said Dr. Josef Neu, a neonatologist at the University of Florida who has written about C-section babies and the hygiene hypothesis.\n\nThe theory is that maternal microbes \u201ctrain\u201d the infant\u2019s immune system, so it doesn\u2019t overreact or become destructive and precipitate autoimmune disorders like Type 1 diabetes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an education process that says, \u2018Calm down, you\u2019re going to be seeing this antigen again, you don\u2019t have to be so aggressive,\u2019\u201d Dr. Neu said.\n\nDr. Neu said the broad-spectrum antibiotics prescribed to the mother before a surgical delivery were another concern; the antibiotics can be transmitted to the baby through breast milk if not before birth, decreasing the diversity of natural bacteria.\n\nThe findings are a reminder that although C-sections are appropriate in some circumstances, they are a poor substitute for labor.\n\nChildbirth and labor are \u201ca physiological process that we\u2019ve evolved to over millions of years,\u201d Dr. Caughey said. \u201cIt\u2019s been really well-designed by evolution.\u201d\n\u2022 Does Frequent Sex Prime the Immune System for Pregnancy?\n\n\n\n For more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There was no disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Brachytherapy, a technique pioneered to treat prostate cancer, is increasingly being used on breast cancer patients.\n\nOklahomans had about 2,200 new cases of breast cancer this year.\n\nThe advantages of brachytherapy, also called \"accelerated partial breast irradiation,\u201d are shorter treatment time and a smaller area that is exposed to radiation.

Their findings appear in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nOverall, 716 women suffered the unusual type of thighbone fracture after starting the bone drugs, and nearly 10,000 had typical hip fractures.\n\nThe risk of a thighbone fracture differed depending on how long the women had been taking the medicine. After taking bone drugs for five years, about one in 1,000 women went on to suffer a thigh fracture over the next year.\n\nThat works out to nearly three times the risk of those who\u2019d taken the drugs for roughly three months or less, after accounting for other risk factors.\n\nOn the other hand, longer treatment was tied to a 24-percent decrease in hip fractures, which along with wrist and spine fractures affect about half of all people with osteoporosis.\n\nThere are several alternative ways to treat osteoporosis, including hormone treatment for women. And one preliminary study, published along with the Canadian findings in JAMA, hints that the common heart medication nitroglycerin might also boost bone health.\n\nSo far, however, the cheap and effective bisphosphonate bone drugs remain the most popular treatment option. But some experts worry that negative media coverage might have led to more fractures and possibly deaths by dissuading patients from taking the drugs.\n\n\u201cThe bad news is that overstating the levels of risk of side effects with these drugs \u2014 which the media have been doing for some time now \u2014 has led people to stop the drugs when they should be taking them,\u201d said Dr. Ethel S.

And the news is very good.\n\nThe paper outlines the results of an international clinical trial, led by Jeff Elias, MD, of the University of Virginia Health System, that evaluated the scalpel-free approach called focused ultrasound for the treatment of essential tremor (ET), a condition that afflicts an estimated 10 million Americans. Not only did the researchers determine that the procedure was safe and effective, they found that it offered a lasting benefit, reducing shaking for trial participants throughout the 12-month study period.\n\n\u201cThis study represents a major advance for neurosurgery, treatment of brain disease and specifically the treatment of ET,\u201d Elias said. \u201cFor the first time in a randomized controlled trial, we have shown that ultrasound can be precisely delivered through the intact human skull to treat a difficult neurological disease.\u201d\n\nPioneering Tremor TrialThe multi-site clinical trial included 76 participants with moderate to severe essential tremor, a condition that often robs people of their ability to write, feed themselves and carry out their normal daily activities. The trial participants all had tried existing medications, without success. The mean age was 71, and most had suffered with their tremor for many years.\n\nSeventy-five percent of participants received the experimental treatment using focused ultrasound guided by magnetic resonance imaging. The remaining 25 percent underwent a sham procedure, to act as the control group. (They would later be given the opportunity to undergo the real procedure.)\n\nParticipants who received the treatment showed dramatic improvement, with the beneficial effects continuing throughout the study period. The researchers employed a 32-point scale to assess tremor severity, and they found that mean tremor scores improved by 47 percent at three months and 40 percent at 12 months.

The device focuses sound waves inside the brain to create heat, much like a magnifying glass focuses light. That heat can then be used to interrupt the troublesome brain connections responsible for the tremor. Elias can actually watch as patients\u2019 tremor decreases, and the real-time imaging allows him to zone in on exactly the right spot before making any permanent changes to the brain.\n\nThe FDA approval means UVA can make the procedure available to eligible patients. UVA, however, is still working out the necessary logistics; it\u2019s not yet clear when Elias will begin treating patients.

It is also not available for pregnant women, people with heart conditions or very high blood pressure, patients with kidney disease or clotting disorders, patients on blood thinners, patients with a history of strokes or brain tumors and people with substance abuse issues.

By the third week, he said, both he and friends he asked for reactions were seeing results. \u201cI even busted out the old \u2018before\u2019 and \u2018after\u2019 pictures,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a noticeable difference.\u201d\n\nBut Latisse does not appear to be a silver bullet for hair loss. Instead, it appears to work in much the same way as Rogaine or Propecia: All three can strengthen and darken hair that grows from a dying follicle, but none can bring a dead one back to life. The result is an enhanced, refortified hairline rather than a brand new head of hair.\n\nAside from hair transplants, which can cost about $10,000 each and do not always look natural, the only current hope for complete replacement is hair cloning, the act of producing entirely new hair from the DNA of an existing one, which researchers have been attempting, unsuccessfully, for years.\n\nA pair of researchers last year claimed to grow new hair by combining plucked hair with a wound-healing powder made by ACell, a regenerative-medicine company in Columbia, Md. Though the claim was met with some skepticism by other clinicians, the idea that ACell\u2019s powder, which has been approved by the government, could facilitate new hair growth has breathed new life into the race to clone hair.\n\nDr. Robert M.

One advantage of Latisse is that it needs to be applied only once a day (Rogaine needs to be applied twice; Propecia is taken once daily), and does not seem to cause reactions in people who are allergic to minoxidil.\n\nIt is, however, expensive: a month\u2019s supply of Latisse can cost up to $150, and that is in amounts appropriate for use merely on the eyelashes. Rogaine, which is also available over the counter now, costs about $25 a month, and a month\u2019s supply of Propecia runs about $75. (Even Mr. Paduda has now switched to Propecia, citing cost.)\n\nThe potential for Latisse is not lost on Allergan. The company initiated a Phase 1 clinical study in August to determine whether bimatoprost can be used as a treatment in men and women suffering from hair loss (alopecia).\n\n\u201cThere is a great deal of interest in developing other uses of bimatoprost,\u201d Heather Katt, a spokeswoman for Allergan, wrote in an e-mail message, \u201cand Allergan is exploring ways to pursue that pathway through the F.D.A. approval process.\u201d\n\nFor those too impatient to wait, there is also the bold and fashionable solution of shaving one\u2019s head.\n\nBut the fact is that many men \u2014 and women \u2014 simply do not accept baldness easily.\n\n\u201cHair has been an evolutionary sign of health and sexuality and youth, and that doesn\u2019t change,\u201d Dr. Bernstein said. \u201cShaved heads look cool, but not everyone wants one, and not everyone looks good with one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have really dark eyebrows,\u201d he said. \u201cI would look like a psycho if I shaved my head.\u201d", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story does a great job avoiding what may be better termed fear-mongering in a case like this.

Hopeful New Signs Of Relief For Migraine Sufferers\n\nHumans have suffered from migraines for millennia. Yet, despite decades of research, there isn't a drug on the market today that prevents them by targeting the underlying cause. All of that could change in a few months when the Food and Drug Administration is expected to announce its decision about new therapies that have the potential to turn migraine treatment on its head.\n\nThe new therapies are based on research begun in the 1980s showing that people in the throes of a migraine attack have high levels of a protein called calcitonin gene\u2013related peptide, or CGRP, in their blood.\n\nStep by step, researchers tracked and studied this neurochemical's effects. They found that injecting the peptide into the blood of people prone to migraines triggers migraine-like headaches, whereas people not prone to migraines experienced, at most, mild pain. Blocking transmission of CGRP in mice appeared to prevent migraine-like symptoms. And so a few companies started developing a pill that might do the same in humans.\n\nClinical trials of the first pills were effective against migraine but halted in 2011 over concerns about potential liver damage. So, four pharmaceutical companies rejiggered their approach. To bypass the liver, all four instead looked to an injectable therapy called monoclonal antibodies \u2014 tiny immune molecules most commonly used to treat cancer. Not only do these bypass the liver to block CGRP, but one injection appears to be effective for up to three months with almost no noticeable side effects.\n\nTwo manufacturers, Amgen (in collaboration with Novartis) and Teva Pharmaceuticals, have completed clinical trials and expect to hear from the FDA by June whether the therapies have been approved. Two more companies, Eli Lilly and Alder Biopharmaceuticals, plan to file for FDA approval later this year.\n\nIt's been a long time coming. Right now, the only available preventive treatments are accidental discoveries: A number of people prescribed medications for depression, high blood pressure and epilepsy discovered migraine relief, too. Now, many of those drugs, including propranolol and topiramate, have been tested and approved for migraine. But no one drug works for everyone, and side effects can prove intolerable or downright unpleasant.\n\nMigraines are throbbing, one-sided headaches that can be accompanied by nausea as well as sensitivity to light, sound, smell, and movement. At their best, the headaches are an annoyance. At their worst, they can be completely debilitating. So for those of us who get numerous migraines each month, the prospect of a new approach feels almost life-changing.\n\nAccording to one recent survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 10 percent of men and 20 percent of women in the U.S. reported having had a migraine in the last three months. And up to 2 percent of all Americans has at least 15 migraine days every single month. The toll such pain can take on health, morale, and productivity is substantial.\n\nMy own migraines started when I was 13. They struck a few times a week and I thought they were normal headaches. For a while, I tried the usual over the counter pain relievers but, one by one, they stopped working. By age 25, I started to wonder if there was something seriously wrong with my head. My general practitioner diagnosed me with migraines, gave me my first preventive medication \u2014 an antidepressant \u2014 then sent me to see a specialist.\n\nSince that day more than 17 years ago, I have tried six preventive prescription medications. Not one helped. I alternated among four different, neurologist-recommended supplements, all to no avail. I received bi-monthly injections of magnesium and participated in one of the first clinical trials of Botox. And while Botox seemed to decrease my migraines by one or two per month, it wasn't enough to bother fighting about it with a new insurance company. I exercised regularly. I experimented with an elimination diet that left me eating nothing but broccoli and white rice, but still the migraines came. I averaged about 15 to 20 each month.\n\nStill, I considered myself lucky. The headaches almost never came with nausea, and I had medications that typically ousted them within an hour or two. All told, I usually lost only a few hours of productivity a week.\n\nWhen I grew older and had two children, my body changed and my migraines changed, too. I get them less frequently now, but when they come, they can stick around for a few days or even a week. Abortive medications still work, except when they don't. So when I heard about a new approach that was making its way through a number of pharmaceutical company pipelines, I began combing through the national clinical trials database to find a trial near me. I found one about 80 miles away, which didn't seem too far a trek considering the tantalizing reward of a migraine-free life. I made an appointment.\n\nNeurologist David Dodick, at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, has been involved in multiple clinical trials with each of the four anti-CGRP antibody treatments in development. And, he admits, he's optimistic. He has good reason to be: Each of the therapies decreases migraine frequency by at least one to two days per month. \"In a field where, over time, the progress and pace of research in understanding the underlying biology and mechanism of disease has been slow, this was very exciting,\" he says.\n\nBecause migraines are not life-threatening, most drugs have to pass a pretty high bar to be approved. And so far, patients on the experimental treatments report limited side effects that consist mostly of pain at the injection site. Unlike the current preventive medications, there is no nausea, no fuzzy thinking, no nerve pain, no weight loss or gain. And instead of remembering to take a daily pill, there is just a once-monthly injection.\n\nNeurologists already have patients eager to test these therapies, especially when everything else they've tried hasn't worked. \"There's a big hole to fill, both in prevention and acute therapies,\" says Alexander Mauskop, director of the New York Headache Center in New York City. (Disclosure: He's my former neurologist.) \"If I have someone who's really suffering and can't find a solution, I tell them that in June I might have something new for them to try.\" Right now, he says, he has a list of about two dozen such patients.\n\nEven if the new therapies are approved, however, patients may still have to jump through a number of hoops to get them. Biologic therapies like these are expensive, and treatment could reportedly range anywhere from $8,000 to $18,000 a year. At that price, Mauskop and other neurologists expect insurance companies to require patients to have tried just about everything else first.\n\nThe other hitch at this stage is a lack of long-term safety data. \"If someone is well-controlled with Botox or another drug, I'd not suggest they switch,\" Mauskop says. \"With Vioxx, it took 10 years before they discovered that it increased the risk of heart problems.\"\n\nSide effects are a potential concern. Elizabeth Loder, chief of headache at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, points out that because CGRP constricts blood vessels, there may be potential long-term effects on blood pressure or other cardiovascular function. In women of childbearing age, who are the ones most prone to frequent migraines, \"you can imagine that might have effects on fertility or placental function.\"\n\nRight now, the longest patients have been on one of these new therapies is one to two years.\n\nI ask Mauskop whether he'd recommend I enroll in a clinical trial, given my failure to respond to most everything else. He pauses, noting that he's no longer my neurologist and that he can't really give me any suggestions. But then he says that, since I'd previously shown some response to Botox, perhaps I might want to give it another try. I think about my two young children and my risk tolerance. Perhaps in 10 years I'll feel differently. For now, however, I pick up the phone and cancel my clinical trial appointment.\n\nLauren Gravitz is a science writer and editor in Hershey, Penn.

For one thing, it can be the factor that sends someone to get a genetic test in the first place. For another, people in many parts of the world don\u2019t have access to genetic tests at all.\n\nThat\u2019s inspired years of effort to train a computer to do the same thing. Software that analyzes a patient\u2019s face for signs of disease could help clinicians better diagnose and treat people with genetic syndromes.\n\nSome older attempts at facial analysis relied on large, clunky scanners \u2014 a tool better suited to a lab, not the field. Now, in the era of smartphones, such efforts have a whole new promise. Face2Gene, a program developed by Boston-based startup FDNA, has a mobile app that clinicians can use to snap photos of their patients and get a list of syndromes they might have.\n\nMeanwhile, Muenke and his colleagues at the NIH last month published an important advance: the ability to diagnose disease in a non-Caucasian face.\n\nIt\u2019s a promising preliminary sign. But if facial recognition software is to be widely useful for diagnoses, software developers and geneticists will need to work together to overcome genetics\u2019 systemic blind spots.\n\nThe algorithms in general work on the same principles: measuring the size of facial features and their placement to detect patterns. They\u2019re both trained on databases of photographs doctors take of their patients. The NIH works with partners around the world to collect their photos; FDNA accepts photos uploaded to Face2Gene.\n\nBut they differ in a key way: Whereas the algorithm the NIH uses can predict if someone has a given genetic disorder, the Face2Gene algorithm spits out not diagnoses, but probabilities. The app describes photos as being a certain percent similar to photos of people with one of the 2,000 disorders for which Face2Gene has image data, based on the overall \u201clook\u201d of the face as well as the presence of certain features. However, the app won\u2019t give clinicians a yes or no answer to the question of, \u201cDoes my patient have a genetic disorder?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s intentional. Face2Gene is meant to be more like a search engine for diseases \u2014 a means to an end.\n\n\u201cWe are not a diagnostic tool, and we will never be a diagnostic tool,\u201d said FDNA CEO Dekel Gelbman.\n\nDrawing that bright line between Face2Gene and \u201ca diagnostic tool\u201d allows FDNA to stay compliant with FDA regulations governing mobile medical apps while avoiding some of the regulatory burden associated with smartphone-based diagnostic tools.\n\nThe algorithm the NIH uses \u2014 developed by scientists at Children\u2019s National Health System in Washington, D.C., \u2014 seems to work pretty well so far: In 129 cases of Down syndrome, it accurately detected the disorder 94 percent of the time. For DiGeorge syndrome, the numbers were even higher: It had a 95 percent accuracy rate across all 156 cases.\n\nFace2Gene declined to provide similar numbers for their technology. \u201cSince Face2Gene is a search and reference informational tool, the terms sensitivity and specificity are difficult to apply to our output,\u201d Gelbman cautioned.\n\nBut there\u2019s one big stumbling block for both of them, a problem that has dogged medical genetics for decades: Data for non-white populations is sorely lacking.\n\n\u201cIn every single textbook, the ones we had [when I trained] in Germany and the major textbooks here in the US, there are photos of individuals of northern European descent,\u201d Muenke said. \u201cWhen I told this to my boss, he said there have to be atlases for children from diverse backgrounds. And there aren\u2019t. There just aren\u2019t.\u201d (Today there is that resource, based on Muenke and the NIH\u2019s work.)\n\nSo diagnosing diseases from a face alone presents an additional challenge in countries where the majority of the population isn\u2019t of northern European descent, because some facial areas that vary with ethnic background can often overlap with areas that signify a genetic disorder. Eventually, the software will also have to be able to tackle people with mixed ethnic backgrounds, too. \u201cWe have thought about it but haven\u2019t gone there yet,\u201d Muenke said.\n\nFor example, children with Down syndrome often have flat nasal bridges \u2014 as do typically developing African or African-American children. Across different races and ethnicities of children there were only two reliable identifiers that could be used to diagnose Down syndrome \u2014 the angles between landmark points on the child\u2019s nose and eye, according to a paper Muenke and Marius Linguraru at Children\u2019s National published with their colleagues earlier this year. All of the other \u201ctypical\u201d features weren\u2019t significantly more likely to show up when children were compared to ethnically matched controls.\n\nIn fact, using a Caucasian face as a reference can sometimes be the least representative choice. \u201cOne of the findings that I\u2019m very interested in [in] our recent study was that the population that we found to be most different from the others, in terms of facial patterns characteristic of DiGeorge syndrome, was the Caucasian population,\u201d Linguraru said.\n\nTo continue to fix this problem, both the NIH and Face2Gene need help from more researchers who can upload more patients\u2019 faces \u2014 but that\u2019s easier said than done. Confirming a suspected disorder with genetic tests is standard practice today, and there are no genetic labs based in Africa registered in the NIH\u2019s Genetic Testing Registry. Asia and South America are also relatively underserved.\n\nThose numbers also reflect the general patterns of distribution for medical geneticists. \u201cMost practitioners are located in North America and Europe,\u201d Gelbman said. Nigeria, for example, doesn\u2019t have a single medical geneticist in the entire country.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that might change, with time and effort. In addition to his work as a researcher, Muenke directs a program that brings health care professionals from developing countries to the US for a month-long crash course in medical genetics. (The program is funded by the NIH\u2019s Fogarty International Center; President Trump eliminated funding for the center in his 2018 \u201cskinny\u201d budget proposal announced in March.)\n\nFor now, both algorithms have shown that they can handle a diverse patient set. FDNA scientists published a paper in January showing that their algorithm could better identify Down syndrome after being trained with a more diverse set of faces, and Muenke and Linguraru have also published papers this year demonstrating their algorithm\u2019s ability to identify genetic disorders correctly in children across a variety of ethnic backgrounds.\n\nAs both groups work on recruiting more researchers, they are also working to push their tech forward. FDNA is working on establishing partnerships with pharmaceutical companies to start their commercial outreach. In theory, these partnerships could contribute to precision medicine efforts or help companies develop new therapies for rare diseases.\n\nMeanwhile, Linguraru has his eyes on eventual FDA approval for the algorithm the NIH has used. The ultimate goal would be a simple tool that any doctor could use anywhere to get fast results and better diagnose their patients.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There is no disease mongering in this piece.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The largest analysis to date of amyloid plaques in people\u2019s brains confirms that the presence of the substance can help predict who will develop Alzheimer\u2019s and determine who has the disease.\n\nTwo linked studies, published Tuesday in JAMA, also support the central early role in Alzheimer\u2019s of beta amyloid, the protein that creates plaques.

Its results built upon exciting data it released in June \u2014 showing that its drug can increase the window of time in which a woman\u2019s cancer doesn\u2019t get worse. (The study did not assess whether the drug helped women live longer, just how long it stopped tumors from growing.)\n\nA small pilot study on a drug called talazoparib, which is now owned by Pfizer, recently showed similarly compelling results.\n\nBut Colorado\u2019s Clovis Oncology fared less well. Though its own PARP inhibitor, rucaparib, showed that it could help some women compared to chemotherapy alone, its data didn\u2019t measure up to the other two trials. The company\u2019s stock plunged 18 percent on Friday after the data were released.\n\nOne PARP inhibitor has already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration: olaparib, sold by AstraZeneca as Lynparza. It\u2019s being used to treat ovarian cancer in women who have already undergone chemotherapy.\n\nChemotherapy deals heavy damage to tumors \u2014 but often, the cancer cells are able to regroup and repair themselves. PARP inhibitors work by stopping this repair. They\u2019re particularly useful in treating cancers associated with the BRCA mutation, since this gene codes for proteins that help repair damaged DNA.\n\nWhile chemotherapy is still used as a first line of attack, PARP inhibitors are largely being studied as maintenance drugs. The hope is that they\u2019ll keep cancer at bay once it\u2019s been attacked by chemo.\n\nA number of cancers are associated with BRCA mutations \u2014 including breast, prostate, and pancreatic.\n\nMore and more clinical trials will spring up to test PARP inhibitors in combination with other cancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, said Dr. Christina Annunziata, an investigator at the National Cancer Institute who studied the efficacy of Lynparza in ovarian cancer patients.\n\nThe field is so hot that over the summer, Pfizer agreed to spend an eye-popping $14 billion to buy San Francisco-based biotech Medivation. The key asset Pfizer wanted? The PARP inhibitor talazoparib. So far, there\u2019s just extremely early data, but it looks promising. In a pilot study of 13 breast cancer patients on the drug at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, tumors shrank on average 78 percent.\n\n\u201cWe found a significant decrease in the tumors with only two months of therapy,\u201d said Dr. Jennifer Litton, the lead investigator. She\u2019s launching a larger trial for further study.\n\nAs for Tesaro, it first shared initial data from a Phase 3 clinical trial this past June. It showed that patients with recurrent ovarian cancer treated with the drug got an extra 15 months without their disease getting worse, compared to a control group. At the European conference this weekend, Tesaro added a few more details to that data:\n\nThe study looked at 553 patients whose cancer responds to a certain type of chemotherapy, known as platinum chemo. The best results came from patients with the BRCA mutation: Their tumors didn\u2019t start to grow again for 21 months, on average, compared to 5.5 months for a control group that just received a placebo. Other groups of patients treated with the drug also had significantly better outcomes than control groups.\n\nThe results were published this weekend in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nA few weeks ago, the Food and Drug Administration granted Tesaro\u2019s drug fast-track approval status \u2014 and this new data will support its registration applications to both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, Tesaro CEO Lonnie Moulder said.

The participants fell into four groups: those with no use or low use of marijuana, early chronic users, those who only smoked during their teens and those who began using it later and continued using the drug. The early chronic users smoked a great deal -- a peak of more than 200 days per year on average when they were 22 years old.\n\nThe researchers found no links to physical or mental health issues -- including depression, psychotic symptoms or asthma -- in any group, even those with very high use. They controlled for cigarette smoking, other drug use, access to health insurance and other factors.\n\n\"What we found was a little surprising,\" lead author Jordan Bechtold, a research fellow at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said in a statement.\n\nBased on other studies in the past that seemed to allude to marijuana use and later development of psychotic symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations, the researchers had thought they might find some associations to disease or other health conditions. But there were none.\n\nThey also found no link to a wide range of other health issues: cancer, asthma, respiratory problems, depression, anxiety, allergies, headaches or high blood pressure.\n\nBechtold said the researchers wanted to \"help inform the debate about legalization of marijuana\" but that this is a very complicated issue and one, study, including his own, should not be taken in isolation and should be viewed in context of other studies on teenagers' marijuana use.\n\nOne major limitation of the study is that it ends when the men are in their 30s \"which may be too early for decrements in health to emerge,\" the authors acknowledge. \"Therefore, continued data collection and longer follow-ups are needed.\"\n\nUpdate: The study's findings generated significant controversy along with requests for supplemental analysis, according to the editors of the Psychology of Addictive Behaviors. In a lengthy clarification issued in December 2015, the journal said that by applying different models to look at the data they confirmed that there did not appear to be any link between marijuana use and health issues. However, the reanalysis regarding psychotic disorders contradicted the earlier conclusions -- that there indeed appeared to be a higher risk of psychotic disorders among marijuana users in the study versus non-users that approached statistical significance when using a more liberal test.\n\nYour office thermostat is set for men's comfort.

In Canada, that\u2019s roughly 3.6 million people. Many of these individuals turn to adaptive devices designed to magnify objects and text, but these devices can be prohibitively expensive, uni-functional and bulky.\n\nEnter the iPad: a technological device that\u2019s relatively cheap, serves many purposes, is smaller than most books, and \u2014 according to new research from Concordia University in Montreal \u2014 is just as effective a visual aid as traditional devices.\n\nA study recently described in Good Times Magazine provides the first experimental evidence that the Apple iPad is as good as technology traditionally used in reading rehabilitation for individuals with visual impairment.\n\nAnd that could help with stigmatization of the elderly and disabled.\n\nFor the study, the Concordia-based research team recruited 100 participants who ranged in age from 24 to 97. A little over half the participants had age-related macular degeneration, a disease characterized by the deterioration of the small central portion of the retina that is normally responsible for fine detailed vision tasks such as reading.\n\nThe researchers used questionnaires and tests to gauge participants\u2019 visual ability, and then compared the Apple iPad versus two traditionally used magnification devices, to see if reading rates varied across devices.\n\n\u201cUnsurprisingly, we found that most participants found it hard to read small and medium text, while nearly a quarter of them reported that reading large text was much easier,\u201d says Elliott Morrice, an MA student in Concordia\u2019s Department of Psychology and the study\u2019s first author.\n\n\u201cWhat was interesting to note was that it didn\u2019t matter what technology was used to do the magnification: an iPad worked just as well as a traditional device like a closed circuit television system (CCTV),\u201d he says. \u201cWhen we took previous experience into account, we found that participants who had used iPads before read on average 30 words per minute faster than those who were using the iPad for the first time. But there were no significant differences in the reading rates of participants who had previous experience using the CCTV, compared to the reading rates of first-time CCTV users.\u201d\n\nAnother benefit is that many older adults feel stigmatized by using the traditional devices, because they identify them as having an impairment or disability.\n\n\u201cTablet computers offer many of the same benefits while being socially acceptable,\u201d says Aaron Johnson, the study\u2019s senior author, and an associate professor in the psychology department, and a member of the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Rehabilitation of Greater Montreal (CRIR).\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more, compared to the devices currently used by those with low vision, iPads are multi-functional, allowing the user to go online, check email, make video calls \u2014 and they cost less than the traditional devices,\u201d he says. \u201cThis cost saving can be both to the individual, and if appropriate, to the insurance companies that may provide individuals with assistive devices.\u201d\n\nPartners in research: This work was supported in part by the Vision Health Research Network, the Fonds de recherche du Qu\u00e9b\u00e9c - Sant\u00e9, the Antoine Turmel Foundation, CRIR, and the MAB-Mackay Foundation.

Behavior and quality of life also improved.\n\nBut surgery also produced serious adverse effects in one-third of the children, most frequently a weakness on one side of the body, known as hemiparesis. The researchers said that was to be expected and, without surgery, patients probably would have experienced similar problems as a result of their continuing seizures.\n\n\u201cWhat the study clearly shows is surgery for children produces seizure freedom compared to children not operated on for similar conditions,\u201d senior author Dr. Manjari Tripathi, a professor of neurology and epilepsy at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi, told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.\n\nNot only \u201cdoes it reassure us that several surgical procedures are effective,\u201d she said, it demonstrates that surgery \u201cshould be done as early as possible\u201d once it becomes clear that a child is not responding to two anti-seizure medications.\n\nAbout 50 million people worldwide suffer with epilepsy and drugs can\u2019t control the seizures in approximately 30 percent of the cases.\n\n\u201cThis is the first randomized study to look at surgical outcome in children,\u201d said Dr. Donald Schomer, director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Program at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. He was not involved in the research.\n\n\u201cThe results are impressive,\u201d he told Reuters Health by phone. Adults who undergo surgery often suffer from the collective effect of years of uncontrolled seizures. \u201cThe study in kids shows if you reduce the time from the onset of seizures from the 15 to 20 years you see in adults down to four to five years, the outcome is much better. It\u2019s documentation that these techniques really work.\u201d\n\nAlthough 77 percent were judged by the Tripathi team to be seizure-free at the end of the study, some of those children actually had seizures immediately after surgery. Yet the cases were judged to be a success because the seizures decreased in frequency over time. Ultimately, 37 percent never had a seizure in the year after surgery.\n\nWhen all seizures were taken into account, children who did not have surgery were four times more likely to have a seizure during that year than youngsters in the surgery group, the researchers calculated.\n\nSuccess rates ranged from 87 percent to 100 percent depending on the type of surgery used to correct the child\u2019s particular brain abnormality.\n\nSurgery improved quality of life and social well-being, and it didn\u2019t affect IQ, something that can decline with ongoing seizures. But Dr. Schomer said the children were only followed for one year, and \u201cthat may be too soon to see a noticeable change\u201d in the intelligence quotient.\n\nPost-surgery weakness was seen in 15 of the 19 patients who had a serious side effect following surgery.\n\nThe weakness \u201cis significant,\u201d Dr. Tripathi said. \u201cThe child may not be able to ambulate by his- or herself. But with physical therapy, all regain the lower and upper limb function within six months. The only thing that does not improve is the wrist and the fingers. They are left with this minor deficit. But even before surgery, some of them have this weakness.\u201d\n\nOther side effects depended on the area of the brain that was removed or disconnected from the rest of the brain.\n\nIn contrast, 16.5 percent of the children waiting for surgery had a serious injury as a result of their continuing seizures.\n\nThe surgery \u201chad a transforming effect on how they get along in life,\u201d Dr. Tripathi said. \u201cMany could go back school earlier or go back to being tutored, and get on with their life.\u201d\n\nBut a major problem facing these children is getting insurance companies to pay for such surgeries, said Dr. Schomer of Beth Israel.\n\nRather than pay $35,000 to $50,000 on surgery that might cure the problem and prevent further damage to the child, insurance companies prefer to demand that more drugs be tried, even if the odds of them working in drug-resistant cases is small, he said.\n\n\u201cStudies like this lend credence to the idea that the earlier you do it, the better the outcome,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope insurance companies will look at this and realize that early detection and surgery, if appropriate, will ultimately save them money in the long term.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2gVClQv The New England Journal of Medicine, online October 25, 2017.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Jamie Stagl worries that women with breast cancer don\u2019t get enough help coping with their diagnosis. Cancer upends a woman\u2019s daily routine, her sense of her body, her vision of the future. There\u2019s almost nothing more stressful.\n\nSo Stagl, now a clinical fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital, helped study a University of Miami program that taught 240 breast-cancer patients relaxation techniques and coping strategies.\n\nThe program worked. The women who took the 10-week stress-management class shortly after surgery reported feeling better and having fewer depressive symptoms such as anxiety than those who took a one-day, breast-cancer education session.\n\nThe women felt better one year after the course, five years later, and \u2014 according to a new study published last month in the journal Cancer \u2014 an average of 11 years later. (Stagl and her colleagues tracked down 100 of the original participants; another 30 had died; and 110 couldn\u2019t be found or didn\u2019t want to participate.)\n\nThe positive results surprised even Stagl. \u201cIt\u2019s quite amazing,\u201d she said.\n\nStagl doesn\u2019t know whether the women are still using the techniques they were taught \u2014 which include mindfulness, deep breathing, visual imagery, cognitive behavioral therapy, and learning how to ask for help from friends and family.

It makes biological sense, Stagl said. Stress drives up levels of the hormone cortisol, which is known to weaken the immune system.

It has the potential to turn cancer into a chronic disease, because we can monitor patients individually and respond with treatment to the genetic makeup of their cancer.\"\n\nToner says the test is like a liquid biopsy and targets almost all solid cancers -- cancers found in \"solid\" organs like the breast or prostate. The cancer cells it finds would be analyzed and their genetic makeup determined, which would be useful in monitoring patients and targeting therapies to the individual.\n\nVeridex, a Johnson and Johnson company, announced the partnership in a statement, saying it involves Ortho Biotech Oncology Research and Development, a unit of Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development.\n\n\"This new technology has the potential to facilitate an easy-to-administer, noninvasive blood test that would allow us to count tumor cells, and to characterize the biology of the cells,\" said Robert McCormack, Veridex's head of technology innovation and strategy. \"Harnessing the information contained in these cells in an in-vitro clinical setting could enable tools to help select treatment and monitor how patients are responding.\"\n\nVeridex launched the first commercial test using circulating tumor cell technology in 2004, the company said. It describes circulating tumor cells as cancer cells that have detached from a tumor and are found at very low levels in the bloodstream. Capturing and counting those cells can provide information to patients and doctors about prognoses with certain types of metastatic cancers, the statement said.\n\n\"The value of capturing and counting CTCs is evolving as more research data is gathered about the utility of these markers in monitoring disease progression and potentially guiding personalized cancer therapy,\" the Veridex statement said.\n\nToner said you are likely to find just one circulating tumor cell in 5 to 10 billion blood cells. In fact, a tube of blood taken during an annual exam would only have a few CTCs.\n\n\"The challenging goal of sorting extremely rare circulating tumor cells from blood requires continuous technological, biological and clinical innovation to fully explore the utility of these precious cells in clinical oncology,\" Toner said. \"We have developed and continue to develop a broad range of technologies that are evolving what we know about cancer and cancer care.\"\n\nThe American Cancer Society said the new research is exciting, but it's important to remember it's just another step in the scientific process. \"Researchers have been working on this and similar technologies for some time, and others have predicted a day when we will be able to diagnose cancers before they are otherwise visible by current techniques,\" said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, the group's deputy chief medical officer. \"It is appropriate to view announcements such as the one today with enthusiasm, but recognize that we must temper that excitement with the realization that there is still much research to be done to determine the true impact of this test on the treatment of patients with cancer.\"", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No overt disease-mongering.

(PAHS), developer of the drug-free Freespira\u00ae treatment for panic attacks and other symptoms of panic disorder, today announced that another study has demonstrated clinically significant symptom improvement, with 80% of patients panic attack free one year after treatment.\n\nThis latest study, conducted as part of the VITAL Program at Allegheny Health Network in Pennsylvania, also demonstrated a 50% reduction in healthcare costs in patients with panic symptoms 12 months after being treated with Freespira.\n\nA Symposium at the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) Annual Conference in Washington, DC focused on the impact of abnormal breathing patterns on anxiety-related conditions and treatments as reported in five studies. Two studies reported nearly 80% of Freespira-treated patients were panic attack free at 12 months post-treatment. Two additional studies reported that patients with mixed anxiety disorders and low exhaled CO2 at baseline were less responsive and/or discontinued treatment with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or Acceptance Commitment Therapy.\n\nEarly data from a fifth study reported on Freespira treatment for patients with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Ninety percent of patients in this study experienced a significant improvement in PTSD symptoms at two months and six months post-treatment.\n\nSymposium Chair David Tolin, Ph.D., Director of Anxiety Disorders Center, The Institute of Living, and Adjunct Professor of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, commented, \"Studies of the Freespira treatment have shown that this innovative approach to treating patients suffering from panic symptoms and panic attacks not only significantly reduces or eliminates these symptoms in approximately 80% of patients, but also results in meaningful reduction in health costs.\"\n\nDebra Reisenthel, CEO of Palo Alto Health Sciences, added, \"Patients with panic symptoms and panic attacks have 3-5 times higher medical costs than patients without panic due to higher utilization of medical resources, including ED visits, physician visits and prescription drugs.\"\n\nFreespira is both easy to use and effective. Once a licensed healthcare provider authorizes the treatment and after a single training session, the patient uses Freespira at home, performing two 17-minute breathing sessions a day over a four-week period, after which the treatment is complete. The peer-reviewed published multi-center Freespira clinical trial, presented by Dr. Tolin, demonstrated that 71% of patients were panic attack free immediately after treatment and 79% of patients were panic attack free 12 months post-treatment.\n\nAbout Freespira\n\nFreespira is an FDA-cleared, drug-free, four-week at-home treatment for panic attacks and other panic symptoms. Treatment is authorized and completed under the supervision of a licensed healthcare provider. Freespira is clinically proven to reduce or eliminate panic attacks and other symptoms of panic disorder, a mental health condition in which debilitating anxiety leads to life-altering avoidance behaviors. Individuals with panic chronically hyperventilate, even when not experiencing a panic attack. This abnormal breathing pattern has been shown to exacerbate attacks. Freespira works by training the patient to stabilize respiration rate and exhaled carbon dioxide levels, which reduces or eliminates panic attacks.\n\nAbout Palo Alto Health Sciences, Inc.\n\nPalo Alto Health Sciences, Inc. is a privately held digital therapeutic company revolutionizing behavioral healthcare with evidence-based, non-invasive, drug-free solutions. Their first product, Freespira, is an FDA-cleared treatment for individuals suffering from panic disorder, panic attacks and other symptoms of panic. In the United States, over 6.7 million adults annually suffer from panic disorder; panic attacks affect a total of 27 million adults in the U.S. every year and are a common component of other anxiety disorders.\n\nFreespira is commercially available throughout the U.S. To learn more, visit http://www.freespira.com or contact info@pahealthsciences.com.", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There was no disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands: A test that measures the levels of five chemicals in the breath has shown promising results for the detection of cancers of the oesophagus and stomach in a large patient trial presented at the European Cancer Congress 2017 [1].\n\nTogether, stomach and oesophageal cancer account for around 1.4 million new cancer diagnoses each year worldwide [2]. Both tend to be diagnosed late, because the symptoms are ambiguous, meaning the five-year survival rate for these two types of cancer is only 15%.\n\nThe new research, involving more than 300 patients, showed that the test could diagnose cancer with an overall accuracy of 85%.\n\nDr Sheraz Markar, an NIHR Clinical Trials Fellow from Imperial College London, under the supervision of Professor George Hanna, told the Congress: \"At present the only way to diagnose oesophageal cancer or stomach cancer is with endoscopy. This method is expensive, invasive and has some risk of complications.\n\n\"A breath test could be used as a non-invasive, first-line test to reduce the number of unnecessary endoscopies. In the longer term this could also mean earlier diagnosis and treatment, and better survival.\"\n\nThe trial was based on the results of previous research that suggested differences in the levels of specific chemicals (butyric, pentanoic and hexanoic acids, butanal, and decanal) between patients with stomach or oesophageal cancer and patients with upper gastrointestinal symptoms without cancer. The new research aimed to test whether this 'chemical signature' that seemed to typify cancer could be the basis of a diagnostic test.\n\nIn the new study, the research team collected breath samples from 335 people at St Mary's Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust; University College London Hospital; and the Royal Marsden Hospital, London. Of these, 163 had been diagnosed with stomach or oesophageal cancer and 172 showed no evidence of cancer when they had an endoscopy.\n\nAll the samples were analysed with a technique called selected ion flow-tube mass spectrometry, which is able to accurately measure small amounts of different chemicals in mixtures of gases such as breath.\n\nResearchers measured the levels of the five chemicals in each sample to see which ones matched to the 'chemical signature' that indicated cancer.\n\nThe results showed that the test was 85% accurate overall, with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 81%. This means that not only was the breath test good at picking up those who had cancer (sensitivity), it was also good at correctly identifying who did not have cancer (specificity).\n\nDr Markar said: \"Because cancer cells are different to healthy ones, they produce a different mixture of chemicals. This study suggests that we may be able detect these differences and use a breath test to indicate which patients are likely to have cancer of the oesophagus and stomach, and which do not. However, these findings must be validated in a larger sample of patients before the test could be used in the clinic.\"\n\nOver the next three years, the researchers will continue with a larger trial, using the test with patients who are being given an endoscopy for gastrointestinal symptoms but not yet diagnosed with cancer. This will assess the ability of the test to pick up cases within a group that is likely to contain only a small percentage of cancers.\n\nThe team is also working on breath tests for other types of cancer, such as colorectal and pancreatic, which could be used as first-line tests in general practice surgeries.", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The release doesn\u2019t engage in disease mongering and provides statistics on the numbers of stomach and esophageal cancers diagnosed globally each year, which matches other sources, and this puts the disease in context for readers.

The study was conducted at the IMIM-Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nParticipants were randomly assigned to take the decaffeinated green tea extract or placebo for one year. All subjects also underwent cognitive training during the 12-month trial.\n\nAfter one year of treatment, functional brain scans (fMRI) showed that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG)-treated subjects had improved neuronal connectivity in certain brain regions. Participants who took the green tea extract also scored significantly better on assessments of visual recognition memory, inhibitory control, and adaptive behavior compared with those who took the placebo.\n\n\"It's an important trial,\" says Dr. Steven Hirsh, director of clinical research for Life Extension in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. \"The findings are very noteworthy and support further study in randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes and durations. It is very encouraging that this catechin, EGCG, from green tea extract, has the potential to benefit people with Down syndrome.\"\n\nDown syndrome is a genetic condition that affects about 250,000 Americans. Individuals with Down syndrome have an extra full or partial copy of chromosome 21.\n\nThe team of researchers, led by Dr. Rafael de la Torre, program director of IMIM Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute and study co-principal investigator, and Dr. Mara Dierssen, group leader at Center for Genomic Regulation, Barcelona, Spain, and study co-principal investigator, proposed that EGCG might have conferred these benefits by inhibiting an enzyme called DYRK1A, which has been implicated in Down syndrome and neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer disease.\n\nThe level of DYRK1A-positive cells is elevated in certain regions of Alzheimer disease patients' brains, and is roughly 20-fold higher in the frontal cortex, compared to normal brains. DYRK1A is implicated in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (via tau hyperphosphorylation) and amyloid plaques, both of which are features of Alzheimer disease.\n\nTea catechins may also modulate the damaging effects of amyloid-beta. Several animal studies have found that EGCG and related compounds from tea suppress amyloid-beta-induced cognitive dysfunction and neurotoxicity. Other possible mechanisms by which EGCG may influence cognition include epigenetic regulation, restoration of mitochondrial function, and anti-oxidative functions.\n\nIn an earlier pilot study supported by Life Extension, Drs. de la Torre and Dierssen's team showed that three months of EGCG treatment improved symptoms in individuals with Down syndrome, and in mice with a Down-syndrome-like condition characterized by overexpression of DYRK1A.\n\n\"We are excited that the benefits observed in the early pilot and preclinical research extended to this larger trial,\" says Luke G.

It is a state-of-the-art technology that allows for a concentrated dose to reach the tumor while limiting the radiation dose to surrounding healthy tissue.\n\n\"The high cure rate is striking when compared to the reported five-year cure rates from other approaches like surgery or conventional radiation, which range between 80 to 90 percent, while the side effects of this treatment are comparable to other types of treatment,\" said Dr. Raquibul Hannan, Assistant Professor of Radiation Oncology and lead author for the study. \"What we now have is a more potent and effective form of completely noninvasive treatment for prostate cancer, conveniently completed in five treatments.\"\n\u2022 Prostatectomy, the surgical removal of the prostate gland, which can be done with minimally invasive techniques and robotic assistance;\n\u2022 Brachytherapy, in which doctors implant numerous small radioactive seeds about the size of a grain of rice into the prostate gland using multiple large needles inserted through the skin in the operating room.

In the short term, the side effects of SBRT can include urinary issues (urgency, frequency and burning) and rectal irritation, which are often temporary and reverse within four weeks of treatment. Researchers found a small risk of longer-term urinary and rectal complications, which is also comparable to conventional treatments. Decrease in erectile function was seen in 25 percent of patients, fewer than with conventional radiation or surgery, said Dr. Hannan.\n\nTo reduce the side effects associated with SBRT, current clinical trials at UTSW are using a unique and biodegradable rectal spacer gel to protect the rectum. UTSW is currently the only accredited site in Texas at which this spacer gel can be used.\n\nOther clinical trials at the UTSW Department of Radiation Oncology are seeking to expand the application of SBRT to high-risk (Stage III) prostate cancer patients. \"Our hope is that the high potency of this form of treatment will significantly improve treatment of these patients,\" says Dr. Hannan, the principal investigator of the high-risk prostate SBRT trial.\n\nUT Southwestern has been a leader in pioneering use of SBRT. Dr. Timmerman, Director of Image-Guided Stereotactic Radiation Therapy, Medical Director of Radiation Oncology, and holder of the Effie Marie Cain Distinguished Chair in Cancer Therapy Research, has served as the lead investigator in several national trials designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SBRT to treat other types of cancer, including cancer in the lung, liver, and spine. A range of clinical trials of SBRT therapy are under way at Simmons Cancer Center, including new investigations evaluating use of SBRT for cancers in the breast and larynx.\n\nSince 2009, UT Southwestern has trained more than 300 physicians and peers interested in implementing SBRT in their clinical practice. Simmons Cancer Center's arsenal of stereotactic radiotherapy technology includes the cutting-edge Gamma Knife, CyberKnife, Agility, Vero SBRT and TrueBeam technologies.\n\nThe SBRT study for prostate cancer was supported by a grant from the U.S. Department of Defense. Additional UTSW researchers involved in the study include Dr. Yair Lotan, Professor of Urology and holder of the Helen J. and Robert S. Strauss Professorship in Urology, and Dr. Xian-Jin Xie, Professor of Clinical Science.\n\nThe Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center is the only NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in North Texas and one of just 45 NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers in the nation. The Simmons Cancer Center includes 13 major cancer care programs with a focus on treating the whole patient with innovative treatments, while fostering groundbreaking basic research that has the potential to improve patient care and prevention of cancer worldwide. In addition, the Center's education and training programs support and develop the next generation of cancer researchers and clinicians.\n\nThe Simmons Cancer Center is among only 30 U.S. cancer research centers and the only cancer center in North Texas to be named a National Clinical Trials Network Lead Academic Participating Site, a prestigious designation by the NCI, designed to bolster clinical cancer research for adults and to provide patients access to cancer research trials sponsored by the NCI, where promising new drugs often are tested.\n\nUT Southwestern, one of the premier academic medical centers in the nation, integrates pioneering biomedical research with exceptional clinical care and education. The institution's faculty has included six who have been awarded Nobel Prizes since 1985. The faculty of almost 2,800 is responsible for groundbreaking medical advances and is committed to translating science-driven research quickly to new clinical treatments. UT Southwestern physicians provide medical care in about 80 specialties to more than 92,000 hospitalized patients and oversee approximately 2.2 million outpatient visits a year.\n\nThis news release is available on our home page at http://www.\n\nTo automatically receive news releases from UT Southwestern via email, subscribe at http://www.", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There is no disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Claudia Kawas, a geriatric neurologist at the University of California, Irvine, said a patient strode into her office soon after the FDA approved the procedure and asked for the \"Alzheimer's test.\" In one hand, he held an article about the approval of Amyvid.
