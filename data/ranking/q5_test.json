As the ovaries curb production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone in the years leading up to menopause and afterward, women can experience symptoms ranging from irregular periods and vaginal dryness to mood swings and insomnia.\n\nFor the study, researchers looked at data on 27,347 women ages 50 to 79 who joined two WHI trials between 1993 and 1998 and were followed through 2014. One trial tested estrogen alone against a placebo, or dummy pill, while the other trial tested estrogen taken in combination with progestin.\n\nWomen were 63 years old on average when they joined the trials and had already gone through menopause. They took hormones or a placebo for five to seven years and were followed for a total of 18 years altogether.\n\nDeath rates were similar - at about 27 percent - among women who took hormones and women who didn\u2019t, researchers report in JAMA.\n\nYounger women in the study appeared to have better survival odds with HRT. Over the initial five to seven years when women were randomly assigned to take hormones or a placebo, death rates were about 30 percent lower among women aged 50 to 59 when they took HRT than when they didn\u2019t.\n\nFor women who started hormones in their 60s or 70s, however, there wasn\u2019t a meaningful difference in death rates according to whether they got the treatment or a placebo during the initial years of the study.\n\nAfter 18 years, including both the treatment period and a decade or more of follow-up, women\u2019s age when they joined the study no longer appeared to significantly influence death rates.\n\nOne limitation of the study is that the WHI didn\u2019t look at different dosages of hormone pills, and the findings may be different for other dosages or different types of therapy such as gels or creams or skin patches.\n\nStill, the current study should ease concerns raised by earlier results from the WHI trials that an increased risk of breast cancer or heart attacks might translate into higher long-term mortality rates, said Dr. Melissa McNeil, author of an accompanying editorial and a women\u2019s health researcher at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nTaking a combination of estrogen and progestin is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, but advances in screening and treatment since the WHI started now mean these tumors are unlikely to be fatal, McNeil said by email.\n\nWith additional years of follow-up, it also appears that the increased heart attack risk associated with HRT in the initial results from the WHI trials is limited to older women, McNeil added.\n\n\u201cHormone therapy has been in and out of favor - first it was good for all menopausal women, then it was dangerous for all women,\u201d McNeil said. \u201cThe take-home message now is that for the right patient, hormone therapy is safe and effective.\u201d", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There was no disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "TUESDAY, Oct. 16, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Stimulating a specific set of nerves that are nestled along the spine may deliver relief to those who suffer from chronic back pain and cut the need for opioid painkillers, new research suggests.\n\nThe therapy, which targets the root ganglion nerves, is more effective than other spine stimulation procedures because it places tiny leads precisely at the area where pain originates, unlike other devices that provide more generalized stimulation, the researchers said.\n\n\"In certain patients who have not gotten relief from other treatments, this therapy may give sustained pain relief and may allow them to reduce opioids for at least 18 months and perhaps longer,\" said lead researcher Robert McCarthy. He's a professor of anesthesiology at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.\n\nThe dorsal root ganglions are nerve cells, on both sides of each of the spine's vertebra, and are the gateway to pain between nerves in different parts of the body, spinal cord and brain. Stimulating this area interrupts pain signals between the painful area and the brain, the researchers explained.\n\nA pacemaker-like device implanted under the skin in the lower back sends small electronic pulses through a wire placed near the specific dorsal root ganglion associated with the pain, McCarthy said.\n\nThe pulses replace pain with tingling or numbness. The strength of stimulation, programmed by a doctor, is based on the patient's level of pain, he said.\n\nThe treatment has two advantages over spinal cord stimulation, McCarthy said. In spinal cord stimulation, a wire runs along the spinal cord sending pulses along the entire spine, but the pulses don't target the specific pain source.\n\nIn addition, dorsal root ganglion stimulation requires significantly lower levels of electric current to quell pain, McCarthy said.\n\nThe goal of this study, he said, was to judge the effectiveness of the therapy over a long period. McCarthy and his colleagues implanted the device in 67 people suffering with chronic back pain and followed them for three to 18 months. Among the participants, 17 had the device for over a year.\n\nBefore receiving the device, most patients rated their pain as an 8 on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being the worst. For most patients, the device reduced pain by 33 percent, which was significant, the researchers reported.\n\nIn addition, patients said they experienced a 27 percent reduction in disability or limitations on daily activities caused by pain. In all, 94 percent of the participants said the treatment was beneficial.\n\nThe procedure was not without complications. Five patients needed to have the wires implanted again, two patients had them removed because they were infected, and one had the device removed because of a complication.\n\nMcCarthy said the therapy is not widely available, even though it was approved by the FDA in 2016. At the moment, its use is confined to more advanced medical centers where doctors have been trained in how to implant and regulate the device.\n\nAlso, the procedure isn't covered by all insurance companies, so out-of-pocket costs to patients can be very high. It is, however, covered by Medicare, he said.\n\nFor uninsured patients, the cost of having spine stimulation devices can range from $15,000 to $50,000 or more, according to a 2008 report funded by the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries.\n\nSpine stimulation is usually approved only after patients have not responded to other treatment, according to Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other insurance companies may have varying policies.\n\nMcCarthy hopes that more doctors will be trained in the procedure and that it will become more available, especially because it has the potential to allow patients to stop taking opioids to control their pain.\n\nOne pain specialist not involved with the study saw the benefits of this procedure.\n\n\"The results of this study are very significant,\" said Dr. Kiran Patel, director of neurosurgical pain at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\nIt shows long-term data that patients experienced significant pain relief and functional improvements, she said.\n\n\"In my pain practice and career, dorsal root ganglion stimulation therapy has been one of the most effective technologies available to combat chronic pain,\" Patel said.\n\n\"I encourage chronic pain patients to seek out physicians who are trained and experienced in the application of dorsal root ganglion stimulation therapy to determine if they are a candidate,\" she said.\n\nThe findings were presented Sunday at the American Society of Anesthesiologists annual meeting, in San Francisco.

The number of women taking them early in pregnancy is unknown but probably is small, the study suggests.\n\nACE inhibitors are the second-most commonly prescribed class of pharmaceuticals in the United States, with 149 million prescriptions dispensed last year. They came on the market 25 years ago.\n\n\"It would be important for a pregnant woman and her health-care provider to be aware of this, so they can identify an alternative medicine to treat her hypertension,\" said William O. Cooper, a pediatrician at Vanderbilt Children's Hospital who headed the study, published in today's New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nExposure to ACE inhibitors early in pregnancy nearly tripled the risk of birth defects, the study showed. \"We all believe that we want to see more data. But this is important enough and impressive enough to tell people about,\" said Robert Temple of the Food and Drug Administration, who spoke to reporters about the findings.\n\nThe agency will consider broadening the \"black box\" warning against taking ACE inhibitors late in pregnancy, he said. The message is that women trying to get pregnant should switch to a different blood-pressure drug, Temple said.\n\nOne-third of the defects involved the heart, one-quarter the limbs or face, and one-tenth the brain or spinal cord, the study found. Many defects, especially the heart problems, are curable with surgery or other treatment. Others, however, cause permanent disability or retardation.\n\nCooper and his colleagues looked at 29,507 births to women covered by Medicaid in Tennessee between 1985 and 2000.\n\nOf that group, 209 babies were born to women who took an ACE inhibitor, and 18 had birth defects. Among 202 babies born to mothers taking some other blood-pressure medication, four had defects. The fraction of babies with defects was 7.1 percent in the ACE-inhibitor group; 1.7 percent in the other anti-hypertensive group; and 2.6 percent in the group taking no blood-pressure medication.\n\nThat such an effect was first noticed a quarter-century after ACE inhibitors arrived on the market points up the lack of data about the effect of drugs in pregnancy.\n\nAll new drugs are tested on pregnant animals to see whether they cause malformations, but those tests can be misleading. It's considered unethical to include pregnant women in studies of new drugs unless the medication is intended to treat pregnancy-related conditions.\n\nAs a consequence, the labels on nearly all medications carry a statement saying their safety to fetuses has not been established.\n\n\"I think it is safe to say that not a lot is known about the options for women in pregnancy,\" said Sandra L. Kweder of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.\n\nStudies of large databases such as Medicare records or registries that enroll pregnant women already taking particular drugs are the chief ways to discover and measure possible risks to the fetus from prescription drugs.\n\nIncreasingly, the FDA is seeking such data. It paid for the ACE-inhibitor study with help from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The alternatives that clinicians might want to consider are diuretics, alpha-methyldopa, some beta-blockers, and the calcium-channel blocker nifedipine, according to the FDA officials and an editorial accompanying the study.\n\nBlood pressure often falls slightly in pregnancy, and women with mild hypertension may be able to go without medicines, experts say.

The kids also missed fewer days of school and were less likely to need medical care.\n\nHowever, this strong benefit only applies to the first couple of years following surgery, Chinnadurai said. By the third year, there was no clear benefit in terms of the number of throat infections. Also, there was limited research on long-term results.\n\n\"The decision about whether those children should have tonsillectomy for that temporary benefit is really tied to what those children need or what they're suffering with,\" Chinnadurai said. Kids who miss a lot of school or need frequent trips to the doctor due to sore throats could benefit from the surgery, he said.\n\nThere's an even clearer benefit for kids whose sleep is disturbed due to inflamed tonsils, Chinnadurai said.\n\n\"In a child with a diagnosis of sleep apnea, we can see a benefit in sleep-related quality of life,\" he said. The kids get better sleep, and thus exhibit better everyday behavior and pay more attention in school.\n\nThe medical approach to treating tonsil infections has evolved over recent decades.\n\nTonsillectomy is the third most common surgery performed on U.S. children, with 530,000 such procedures completed each year, according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology -- Head and Neck Surgery.\n\nThirty years ago, nine out of 10 tonsillectomies in children were performed to treat recurring throat infections. These days, the procedure is done 20 percent of the time for infections and 80 percent of the time for sleep problems, according to the academy.\n\nSwollen tonsils can block the airway during sleep, causing breathing problems that range from simple snoring to obstructive sleep apnea, the researchers said in background notes.\n\nGuidelines say a tonsillectomy to treat throat infections is justified if a child had seven or more sore throats during the previous year; five or more sore throats two years running, or three or more sore throats for three years in a row, according to the background notes.\n\nThe researchers decided to review whether the throat infection guidelines are too stringent, ruling out patients who potentially could benefit but don't meet the high threshold of recurring infections, Chinnadurai said.\n\nThere aren't strong guidelines regarding the use of tonsillectomy to treat sleep disorders, so the doctors reviewed the evidence to see whether the surgery outperformed so-called watchful waiting -- monitoring the situation.\n\nThe study results showed \"there may be new evidence that supports expanding the criteria and opening up the procedure to more individuals,\" said Dr. Alyssa Hackett, an otolaryngologist with the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai in New York City.\n\n\"In the right child with the right indications, these are really wonderful procedures that can be life-changing for both the child and the family,\" said Hackett, who wasn't involved with the new research.\n\n\"If you need your appendix out, you need your appendix out,\" Hackett said. \"But for the tonsils and adenoids, there are great quality-of-life benefits that are evident for the surgery, but no child has ever died because they haven't gone through the surgery.\" (Adenoids, glands at the roof of the mouth, are often removed along with tonsils.)\n\nStill, Chinnadurai and Hackett warned against automatically choosing the surgery for every sore throat.\n\nAbout 3 percent of kids who undergo the procedure experience bleeding during the two-week recovery period, Hackett said.\n\n\"Though a tonsillectomy is low-risk, it is not risk-free, and those risks need to be weighed against the benefits for each individual child,\" Chinnadurai said.\n\n\"We're talking about a child who has significant sleep-related issues,\" Hackett said. \"We don't want people to say my child snores, they need to have their tonsils out.

Fatigue that stems from cancer or cancer treatments has been found to lower patients' quality of life even more than pain, and studies have shown that anywhere from 60 to 90 percent of patients receiving radiation therapy report this symptom. Furthermore, erectile dysfunction is reported in 21 to 85 percent of all prostate cancer patients, while urinary incontinence is reported in 24 percent of men with this disease.\n\nThe possible explanation for the benefits of yoga seen in the study stems from physiologic data demonstrating its ability to help reduce cancer- as well as treatment- related fatigue and to strengthen pelvic floor muscles and increase blood flow. These latter aspects may in turn improve erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence, said Vapiwala.\n\n\"There may also be a psychosocial benefit that derives from participation in a group fitness activity that incorporates meditation and promotes overall healthiness. And all of this ultimately improves general quality of life,\" she added.\n\nOther studies have demonstrated beneficial health and quality of life effects from yoga interventions in cancer patients. However, yoga has been predominantly evaluated for breast cancer, and research on its role in alleviating prostate cancer patients' side effects has been lacking, largely due to the perception that men would not be willing to participate in this form of holistic exercise.\n\nNational statistics indicate that 72 percent of those who practice yoga are female, and only 18 percent of practitioners are over the age of 55. The median age at diagnosis for cancer of the prostate is 66.\n\n\"Despite these figures, we found that a structured yoga intervention in the form of twice-weekly classes is feasible for patients during a six- to nine-week course of outpatient radiotherapy for prostate cancer,\" said Vapiwala. \"Our participation-rate finding alone is important because it is a caution against making assumptions about patients without proper evidence.\"\n\nSpecifically, between May 2013 and June 2014, 68 eligible prostate cancer patients were identified and offered study participation, of which 45 consented (66 percent) to attend twice-weekly yoga classes of 75 minutes each, taught by trained Eischens yoga instructors within the Abramson Cancer Center.\n\nAlthough 18 (40 percent) of these participants were voluntarily withdrawn early due to unavoidable and unanticipated conflicts between radiation treatment times and the yoga class schedule, the remainder were able to participate and the study's feasibility endpoint was met.\n\n\"Eischens yoga incorporates ideas from movement theory and kinesiology and is accessible to all body types and experience levels,\" said Tali Mazar Ben-Josef, DMD, a certified Eischens yoga instructor and researcher in the Abramson Cancer Center, who will present the results at the SOI meeting.\n\nMost yoga participants reported a sense of well-being at the end of each class, and upon finishing the yoga program and concluding their study involvement, many patients requested and received an at-home practice routine to fit their needs, Ben-Josef said.\n\nThe effect of yoga was measured by participants' responses to a series of questions that assess overall quality-of-life, cancer-related fatigue, and prevalence of sexual and erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence. The researchers chose these variables because they affect so many prostate cancer patients.\n\nSeverity of fatigue scores demonstrated significant variability over the time of treatment, with increases by week four as expected, but then improving over the course of treatment. Erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and general quality of life scores demonstrated steady trends.\n\nCurrently, the team is randomizing prostate cancer patients to participation vs. no participation in this structured yoga program in order to further characterize the potential benefits of yoga in this population.\n\nThis trial represents an expansion of the Abramson Cancer Center's integrative medicine and wellness services that are available to patients and survivors. In addition to yoga, patients can receive training in stress-reduction techniques, meditation, reiki therapy, acupuncture, and massage.\n\n\"We offer several ways to enhance quality of life, minimize or reduce side effects of cancer and cancer treatment, and promote healing and recovery,\" Vapiwala said. \"This study represents one of many research projects we are conducting in an effort to pinpoint the best, most effective practices to help patients with these needs.\"\n\nNearly 240,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year in the United States, according to the American Cancer Society, which funded the new study.\n\nThe full results from the feasibility study are expected to be published early 2016.", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The news release cites American Cancer Society figures on the incidence of prostate cancer in the United States and therefore cannot be accused of disease mongering.

Earlier studies had proved that low-calorie diets could reduce weight and alter metabolism in obese people.\n\nA six-month study in 48 people directed by Dr. Ravussin, being published today in The Journal of the American Medical Association, is the first rigorous test of calorie restriction in people who are overweight but not obese. Most participants reduced calories by 25 percent, but some cut back more and ate only 890 calories a day for several months.\n\n\"There's never been a study like this one,\" said Dr. Evan Hadley, director of geriatrics and clinical gerontology at the National Institute on Aging, which paid for the study. He called the results \"striking,\" even though the experiment was only a pilot study for a two-year trial of calorie restriction due to begin in the fall.\n\nAmong the main findings of Dr. Ravussin's study was that calorie restriction led to decreases in insulin levels and body temperature. Both are considered signs of longevity, partly because an earlier study by other researchers found both traits in long-lived people. The diet also led to a drop in thyroid hormones and declines in DNA damage.\n\nBut Dr. Ravussin and Dr. Hadley cautioned that the study was preliminary, and that it did not prove that calorie restriction could make people healthier or add years to their lives.\n\n\"It's an important step along the way,\" Dr. Hadley said.\n\nScientists have known for years that when people cut calories and lose weight, the body tries to compensate by slowing its metabolic rate. The slowing is a defensive mechanism to fight weight loss. It was probably preserved by evolution because it saved people from starving to death when food was scarce, but it is the bane of dieters because it means that the more weight they lose, the harder it is to keep reducing.\n\nSeveral explanations exist for why a strict diet, low in calories but high in nutrients, may slow aging. Many scientists think that an important factor in aging is DNA damage caused by free radicals, highly reactive oxygen-containing molecules formed during normal metabolism. Eating less leads to a slower metabolism and fewer free radicals.\n\nAnother possibility is that being deficient in calories turns certain genes on and off, with a net effect of slowing the clock.\n\nIn rhesus monkeys, calorie restriction has had pronounced effects. A University of Wisconsin team led by Richard Weindruch has been studying 76 monkeys for more than a decade, half on low-calorie diets and half in a control group that eats normally.\n\nThe low-calorie animals weigh about 30 percent less and have 70 percent less body fat than the controls, as well as lower insulin levels. The calorie-restricted monkeys have had two cases of cancer, compared with five in the controls. The controls have had twice the death rate from aging-related diseases like heart failure and diabetes. About 90 percent of the monkeys on low-calorie diets are still alive, compared with only about 70 percent of the controls.\n\nDr. Ravussin's study included men and women, ages 27 to 49, who were overweight but not obese. Some were just a bit heavy, but others were 30 pounds overweight.\n\nFor six months, a control group ate a diet created to maintain members' weights. Another group ate 75 percent of what members needed to keep their weight steady. A third group had members' calories cut 12.5 percent and their exercise increased to burn off 12.5 percent.\n\nThe final group went on an extreme diet of 890 calories a day \u2014 less than half of what most adults need \u2014 for two or three months, until members lost about 15 percent of their body weight. They then switched to a diet meant to keep them at their new lower weight.\n\nPart of the reason for the study, Dr. Ravussin said, was to find out whether people could stand calorie restriction. The participants, who were paid, turned out to be highly motivated, he said. Some were concerned about their weight and health. They had to take time off work for metabolism tests and also ate many meals at the clinic.\n\nJerelyn Key, 44, a Social Security claims representative, joined because she wanted to learn better eating habits for herself and her family. Ms. Key was assigned to the very-low-calorie group. For two months, she ate four or five shakes a day and a specially formulated \"brownie,\" adding up to just 890 calories a day. She is 5-foot-7, and her starting weight was 165 to 170; after two months she had lost about 28 pounds.\n\n\"I look back now wondering how I managed to do it,\" Ms. Key said. She has regained a bit and now weighs 140 to 145 pounds.\n\nAnother participant, Oscar Couvillion, 45, an insurance database administrator, said he was lured by a radio advertisement offering participants $7,000. There was heart disease in Mr. Couvillion's family, and at 5-foot-9, he weighed 192 pounds, about 30 pounds too much.\n\nHe wound up in the group assigned to cut calories by 25 percent. At first, he said, \"I was starving to death, I had headaches, I was grouchy.\" But cheered on by therapists in the study, he stuck with it and lost 30 pounds. He said joining the study was one of the best decisions he had ever made.\n\n\"You're not going to ask me what I weigh now, are you?\" he said, adding that he weighed 176. \"I have to repent.

Until recently, 20 to 30 per cent of these patients would develop epilepsy and many need regular antiepileptic treatment. The patients' cognitive performance, life quality and life expectancy is also affected by having the condition.\n\nThe research team has developed and delivered cooling treatment, known as therapeutic hypothermia, for newborns who suffer lack of oxygen during birth. For up to eight years, the researchers followed 165 infants who were born in the south west and who received cooling therapy at St Michael's Hospital, Bristol, part of University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust. The study examined how many babies were diagnosed with epilepsy and how many are on regular antiepileptic drug treatment at two and four to eight years of age.\n\nThe research found that babies, born after 2007, who received the cooling treatment, had much less epilepsy than before cooling treatment was introduced. At two years, seven per cent of the children had an epilepsy diagnosis, however, far fewer, only two per cent, were on regular antiepileptic drugs.\n\nThe study showed that more children had epilepsy when they reached the age of four to eight years with seven per cent on regular medication. However, these are very low numbers needing antiepileptic treatment compared to before cooling treatment was introduced as standard of care.\n\nBefore therapeutic hypothermia was introduced, poor outcome meaning death or moderate or severe disability was around 66 per cent (32 per cent death and 34 per cent surviving with disability).\n\nIn this cohort born after 2007, the number of children with poor outcome is lower at 34 per cent (11 per cent death and 23 per cent survived with disability). Also, the severity of cerebral palsy is milder and seven out of ten are able to walk. Even if a lesser severity of perinatal asphyxia is accounted for, cooling therapy has increased the number of healthy survivors and there are very few children with epilepsy needing drug treatment.\n\nProfessor Marianne Thoresen said: \"Even if we account for a lesser severity of perinatal asphyxia, our research has shown that therapeutic hypothermia reduces the number of children who develop epilepsy later in childhood. Cooling treatment also reduces the number and severity of cerebral palsy and increases the number of patients who survive normally.\"\n\nThe research was funded by Sparks UK; University of Bristol's Alumni Foundation; The Laerdal Foundation for Acute Medicine, Norway; University of Oslo, and a private donation.\n\n'Reduced infancy and childhood epilepsy following hypothermia-treated neonatal encephalopathy' by Xun Liu, Sally Jary, Frances Cowan and Marianne Thoresen in Epilepsia", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering here.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A small company started by a neuroscientist at the University of Rochester has moved closer to providing doctors with what he says is a simple, computer-based tool to help detect early signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease or other forms of dementia.\n\nCerebral Assessment Systems has received marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Cognivue, a cognitive-assessment tool that functions somewhat like a video game. A patient can perform the inexpensive and simple test while a time-strapped primary-care physician tends to other patients. The 10-minute, non\u00adinvasive examination can detect subtle lapses in the brain\u2019s perceptual ability that may signal the early stages of mental decline caused by dementia.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s approval to market the device comes as Alzheimer\u2019s researchers everywhere step up the pursuit for easier and more inexpensive ways to identify dementia in its earliest stages.\n\n[Scientists are cautiously optimistic about progress toward finding treatments for Alzheimer\u2019s disease]\n\n\u201cLook, there is a late-life tsunami of late-life cognitive decline coming at us, and health-care providers are standing on the beach,\u201d said Charles J. Duffy, a neurology professor at the University of Rochester Medical Center who founded the company. \u201cWhat we are all about is making cognitive care part of primary care.\u201d\n\nMore than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the leading cause of dementia. That number is expected to reach 13.5 million by 2050, according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association. With the United States shifting toward an older society, the hope is that earlier detection can lead to earlier intervention to slow or arrest the disease, perhaps through medications working their way to the market or changes in lifestyle. In addition to Alzheimer\u2019s, a person\u2019s mental competency can be hindered by other conditions, such as untreated diabetes, thyroid conditions or toxic interactions among prescription medications.\n\nDuffy said his tool holds promise as a relatively inexpensive and easy way to test people\u2019s memory and ability to think.\n\nWith Cognivue, patients sit before a video screen that shows a series of images, such as a group of dots, that move around and fluctuate in clarity. Using a rotary-shaped mouse called a manipulandum, the patients try to follow the dots with a wedge-shaped cursor. The task becomes more difficult, especially for people with early stages of dementia, as the dots move around, changing their direction, speed and intensity.\n\n\u201cAll perception is interpretive, and so what we\u2019re doing is measuring that process,\u201d Duffy said. Other parts of the test challenge memory recall or the ability to recognize letters and shapes.\n\nCerebral Assessment Systems\u2019 device received de novo approval from the FDA, a streamlined process for reviewing medical devices that appear to be new enough to have no equivalent and pose little risk.\n\nThe Pittsford, N.Y.-based company\u2019s FDA application included data from a comparative study involving 401 people recruited from 13 communities for older adults. The subjects, ranging in age from 55 to 95, were classified in three groups based on cognitive abilities: normal, mild cognitive impairment and impaired. Their performance on the Cognivue device was compared to their scores on an existing cognitive assessment test known as the St. Louis University Mental Status Examination (SLUMS).\n\nThe device would be available only for use by medical professionals as part of a more comprehensive assessment of cognitive function. It is not intended to be a standalone diagnostic tool, and its effectiveness for people with less than 12 years of education is not proven.\n\nLinda M. Rice, a primary-care internist with about 1,200 patients in her Rochester practice, said that after a year of using the device in her clinic, she is convinced of its worth. About half of her patients are older than 65, and they often have questions about memory loss and their cognitive abilities.\n\nBut her options for rating their performance involve administering the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) , also known as the Folstein test, that uses a 30-point questionnaire. The test, which has been around since 1975, offers only a broad indication of cognitive abilities and fails to pick up borderline problems, she said.\n\n\u201cYou have to be pretty bad to do poorly on this exam,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the alternative involves referring patients for a battery of neuropsychiatric tests that can take hours to complete and cost $1,000 or more. The computer-based tool created by Duffy has helped Rice to convince some patients that it\u2019s time to stop driving and to start them on medications sooner to slow the progress of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a really potentially valuable tool,\u201d said Leslie Algase, an internist who tends about 2,000 patients in Rochester, at least 30 percent of whom are older than 65. Algase, who said she has no financial ties to the company, agreed to use the Cognivue in her practice about three years ago after meeting Duffy at a conference.\n\nAlgase rates the device as about as accurate as the MMSE.

One group of 105 patients was offered a three-month regimen of self-care advice on diet, exercise and psychological support.\n\nThe second group, of 85, was offered the same advice in the same time frame along with 10 half-hour weekly sessions of \"traditional\" acupuncture.\n\nAll of the participants kept hot flash diaries. At the end of the three-month period (and for up to six months thereafter) daily hot flash experiences were assessed for changing severity and frequency.\n\nThe result: by the end of the treatment period, those in the acupuncture group were found to have hot flash scores that were 50 percent lower than those in the non-acupuncture group. The finding continued to hold up for a half-year after the acupuncture sessions ended.\n\nThose in the acupuncture group also seemed to have a generally higher overall quality of life in terms of both physical and mental health, with no serious side effects, the study authors said.\n\nSo why does acupuncture seem to work?\n\nRazzini cited several reasons, including acupuncture's ability to prompt blood vessel dilation in the patient's nervous system, while stimulating the release of endorphins -- a neurotransmitter that interacts with brain cells involved in the regulation of pain and emotion. It also triggers the release of the stress hormone norepinephrine, as well as the mood regulator serotonin.\n\nRazzini didn't know how much American patients might have to pay for such treatment, but added, \"Compared to other effective treatments such as antidepressants, (acupuncture) should be less expensive, and, for sure, more safe and feasible.\"\n\nDr. Courtney Vito, a breast oncologic surgeon at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., was pleased that a serious issue in breast cancer treatment is getting a closer look.\n\n\"Anyone who treats breast cancer struggles with this problem in their practice, because the hot flashes that some women experience with anti-hormonal treatment can be profound,\" she said.\n\n\"Almost all women experience them. For some it's a moderate situation, but for others it's a really significant problem. Some women -- I would say probably about 15 percent -- have such severe hot flashes that they even refuse to take medications that can cut their risk for cancer or cancer recurrence by 50 percent, simply because they can't handle the hot flashes,\" Vito explained.\n\n\"And I've actually had patients who have had acupuncture with good success, so I'm not surprised by the finding,\" she added. \"But it is heartening that we now have scientific proof that this can work.

Under previous therapies, none had shown progress.\n\nThis success, in a small study designed as a pilot to test the safety of the technique, suggests larger trials will confirm the effectiveness of the deep brain stimulation (DBS) device, the researchers wrote in the medical journal The Lancet.\n\nAnorexia has one of the highest mortality rates of any psychiatric disorder and is among the most common psychiatric disorders in girls aged between 15 and 19 years. Symptoms include deliberate weight loss induced and sustained by the patient, and a need to control calorie intake and output.\n\nTreatment usually focuses on changing behaviour, but experts say up to 20 percent of patients get no benefit from such treatments and are at risk of dying prematurely.\n\nCommenting on the results of this small trial, Janet Treasure and Ulrike Schmidt of King\u2019s College London\u2019s Institute of Psychiatry said the technique looked promising and would give hope to patients with especially pernicious forms of anorexia.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the procedure was associated ... with improvements in affective and obsessional symptoms is of key importance,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201c(This) will go some way towards reassuring patients that DBS is not just another treatment designed to fatten them up without making them feel better.\u201d\n\nDBS is used to treat several neurological illnesses including Parkinson\u2019s disease and chronic pain.

The devices were activated 10 days later and researchers measured changes in the patients\u2019 mood and anxiety to help find the correct level of stimulation.\n\nThe patients, all women, were aged between 24 and 57 and had had anorexia for between four and 37 years.\n\nInitially all six lost weight, but researchers said this was expected since studies of DBS in patients with depression also found a delay of a few months before treatment starts to work.\n\nThree months after treatment, the weight loss began to reverse in some patients, and after nine months, three patients weighed more than before treatment - the longest period of sustained weight increase since they had become ill. Around half also had better moods and less obsessive-compulsive behaviour.\n\nAndres Lozano, who led the study, said the results were encouraging because they pointed to a genuine therapeutic effect, rather than a placebo or hunger-increasing effect.\n\nHe also said the improvements in mood and anxiety even in patients who were still underweight were \u201cespecially striking\u201d given that severely anorexic patients did not respond well to conventional medicines or psychotherapies.

These drugs work by increasing bone thickness, thereby reducing the risk of fractures, the researchers said.\n\nIn prior studies, bisphosphonates have already been shown to be associated with a reduced odds for breast cancer.\n\n\"These [new] findings are meaningful because they point to a possible protective effect of this class of drugs being relevant to prevention of many different cancers,\" said lead researcher Dr. Gad Rennert, from the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology Faculty of Medicine and chairman of the department of community medicine and epidemiology at the Carmel Medical Center of Clalit Health Services in Haifa, Israel.\n\n\"This is [similar] to the effect that we and others have shown for [cholesterol-lowering] statins,\" he said, noting that \"bisphosphonates and statins share the same metabolic pathway.\"\n\nThe results of the U.S. National Cancer Institute-supported study are published in the Feb. 14 issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\nFor the study, Rennert's team collected data on almost 1,900 postmenopausal women who took part in the Molecular Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer study, which is a population-based trial in northern Israel.\n\nThe researchers found that taking bisphosphonates, mostly Fosamax, for at least a year was associated with a significant 59 percent reduction in relative risk for colorectal cancer.\n\n\"The magnitude of the reduced risk is less important because this is an association study; however, it is very significant after controlling for a dozen other known risk factors,\" Rennert said.\n\nThey took into account factors such as family history, ethnic background, diet, physical activity, weight, vitamin D consumption and the use of other drugs such as aspirin, statins and hormone replacement therapy.\n\nThe findings in this study show that bisphosphonates are associated with a reduced risk of developing colorectal cancer, but they cannot confirm a causal effect -- that is, the study doesn't prove that the use of bisphosphonates is responsible for the lower risk of colorectal cancer.\n\nHowever, the lowered risk of colorectal cancer seen with bisphosphonates may be due to the way the drug acts in the body, which is similar to how cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins work, according to Rennert. These same researchers also found in another study that statin use also reduced the risk of colorectal cancer, he noted.\n\n\"We also found a similar effect last year with risk of breast cancer, which has already been replicated by three other groups,\" Rennert added.\n\nA randomized trial is need to prove that bisphosphonates are protective against colorectal cancer, Rennert said. \"It should be relatively easy, as it seems that all that is needed is a year of treatment to see the effect,\" he said.\n\nThe researchers noted, however, that the risks of using bisphosphonates include the possibility, in rare cases, of osteonecrosis of the jaw (destruction of the jawbone or jaw tissue). Bisphosphonates used for osteoporosis have also been linked to a rare fracture of the thigh, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\n\"The adverse effects profile is of major importance if bisphosphonates are going to be recommended for cancer prevention in healthy people,\" the study authors cautioned.\n\nCommenting on the study, Eric Jacobs, Strategic Director of Pharmacoepidemiology at the American Cancer Society, said that \"the lower risk of colorectal cancer risk seen among bisphosphonate users in this study is intriguing.\"\n\nHowever, these results should be interpreted with caution and require confirmation by additional studies, he said. \"Results from the only other study of bisphosphonate use and colorectal cancer, a recent large study from the United Kingdom, do not support an important protective effect,\" Jacobs noted.\n\nFortunately, there are other proven ways to help lower risk of colorectal cancer, he said. \"In particular, all Americans, 50 or older, should get a screening test so that precancerous polyps can be detected and removed before they turn into cancer.\"\n\nFor more information on colon cancer, visit the American Cancer Society.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "Neither story engaged in disease-mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "An experiment in Thailand involving more than 16,000 men and women has demonstrated for the first time a small but measurable protective effect of an AIDS vaccine.\n\nThe vaccine, a complicated mixture of six \"prime\" and \"booster\" shots, reduced a person's risk of becoming infected by about one-third compared with people getting placebo injections.\n\nThe results were barely significant on statistical grounds, perplexing for scientific reasons and unanticipated by most researchers.

They float around in the mother's bloodstream and can be picked up by blood tests.\n\nHowever, a new blood test \u2014 which is still experimental and not yet available outside of a research lab \u2014 can pick up on gene activity in the body that suggests a pregnancy is at risk for preterm delivery, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Science . The researchers also found a similar type of blood test could determine gestational age, which is used to calculate the due date of the baby. Currently, gestational age is calculated in the first trimester using ultrasound, and it's not that accurate if used later in pregnancy.\n\nPregnancies are usually about 40 weeks, and a premature birth is when a baby arrives three or more weeks early. This happens in about 9% of all deliveries and it can be seriously risky for the infant ; they can have all kinds of complications, including lung problems, brain hemorrhages, and infections.\n\nThe scientists analyzed 20,000 genes to find the ones that were active during pregnancy and labor.\n\nThey identified seven cfRNAs that seemed to be associated with premature birth, and in a test of 38 women, they found that they could predict premature birth up to two months in advance.\n\nAll the women were at risk for premature labor because they had early contractions or a previous preterm delivery, and 13 did indeed go on to have a premature baby.\n\nIn a subgroup of women, the test accurately classified 4 of 5 preterm deliveries as being at-risk, and incorrectly suggested that 3 of 18 women who had a full-term pregnancy were at risk for early labor.\n\nIn a test of 31 healthy pregnant women, testing for nine cfRNAs seemed roughly as accurate as an ultrasound at measuring gestational age. An ultrasound has a 48% accuracy rate at predicting a due date that's within two weeks of a baby's actual birth, while the blood test was 45% accurate. The test, if it does turn out to work in clinical trials, would be cheaper than ultrasound, said Quake.\n\n\"It might be tens or hundreds of dollars, rather than thousands,\" he said.\n\nThere's a lot more work to be done before these tests becomes available, including clinical trials.

While some cases of anosmia may be treated by caring for an underlying cause (often nasal obstruction, in which odors can\u2019t reach the nerves of the olfactory system due to swelling, polyps or sinus disease), other cases involving damage to the sensory nerves of the nose (i.e. head injury, viruses and aging) are much more complex. There are currently no proven therapies for these cases.\n\nOur sense of smell not only contributes to our enjoyment of life, but also to our daily safety and well being. We rely on our sense of smell to make us aware of smoke in detecting a fire, natural gas leaks and to avoid eating rotten food. In the elderly, of whom there are estimates that greater than 50 percent of the population over the age of 65 has experienced smell loss, it can be difficult to get proper nutrition, as the sensation of flavor is closely tied to the sense of smell, and as flavor diminishes, appetite decreases in this population.\n\nA Cochlear Implant for the Nose\n\nMotivated by work conducted by research colleagues at Virginia Commonwealth University\u2019s School of Medicine, Mass. Eye and Ear physicians wanted to address the question of whether electrical stimulation of the olfactory bulb could induce the sense of smell in human subjects.\n\nThe findings described in the International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology report demonstrate this feasibility. In the report, the researchers describe endoscopic procedures to position electrodes in the sinus cavities of five patients with an intact ability to smell.

The prostate is a walnut-shaped gland that produces semen and it is hard to get to.\n\nDigital rectal exams can tell a specialist that the prostate is getting bigger, but that happens with normal aging as well as with cancer. A blood test for prostate specific antigen or PSA shows when PSA rises, but PSA goes up with either cancer or just normal enlargement of the prostate \u2014 or even if the gland is inflamed, such as from an infection.\n\nBiopsies are difficult and painful to do and may take a portion of healthy prostate, missing any tumors entirely.\n\nAnd prostate tumors can grow slowly. A study last year estimated that more than 1 million men in the United States alone had been needlessly treated for prostate tumors that likely would never have killed them.\n\nThe Progensa test looks for a genetic material called PCA3. It is a string of RNA that does not appear to have any function but that is overexpressed, or overactive, in prostate cancer.\n\nLightly touching the prostate can cause its release and it can then be detected in the urine using the test.\n\nCrawford and colleagues tested Progensa in about 1,900 men who had high PSA readings, an abnormal digital rectal exam or both and who were scheduled to have biopsies.\n\n\u201cIt reflects on the aggressiveness of the cancer,\u201d Crawford said. \u201cIf you had no cancer your PCA3 was at 25 or 20. If you had precursors such as high grade PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) your score was about 38 to 40 and men who had cancer scored about 50 to 55.\u201d\n\nThe test had a specificity of 78 percent, meaning that 78 percent of the men who had cancer indicated by the test actually did. This compares to just 21 percent for PSA alone, the researchers told a meeting of the American Urological Association in San Francisco.\n\n\u201cIf the PCA3 is abnormal, above about 35, you have got an 80 percent chance of having cancer,\u201d Crawford said.\n\nThe test had a sensitivity of 49 percent, meaning it correctly identified 49 percent of cancers. This is far less sensitive than PSA, which catches 87 percent of tumors, but if the two tests are used together they can help rule out the need for unnecessary surgery or radiation.\n\nAmong the 1,946 men studied, 42 percent turned out to have prostate cancer.\n\nThe test was approved for use in Europe in 2006 but is not yet approved in the United States.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "\u00a0The story did not engage in overt disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Researchers in Finland studied more than 500 adults who had uncomplicated appendicitis, meaning their appendixes had not ruptured and they had no signs of infection or other problems in their abdomens. Half of the patients received an appendectomy, which is the standard of care, while the other half got an IV of antibiotics for three days followed by antibiotic pills for a week.\n\nThe researchers found that 73% of the patients who took antibiotics recovered from appendicitis and did not need surgery for at least a year afterward. The rest of the patients -- who went on to have another case of appendicitis and need an appendectomy -- did not have a higher rate of complications than the patients who initially received surgery.\n\n\"This is quite a radical change in the line of thinking, because appendectomy has served patients well for over 100 years,\" said Dr. Paulina Salminen, a surgeon at the Turku University Hospital in Finland and lead author of the study, which was published on Tuesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association . An editorial accompanying the study added, \"the time has come to consider abandoning routine appendectomy for patients with uncomplicated appendicitis.\"\n\nThe findings suggest that for patients with uncomplicated cases, who make up about 80% of the patients diagnosed with appendicitis, surgery may not be necessary, Salminen said. However, if the appendix has ruptured, emergency surgery must be done because patients can develop deadly infections in the abdomen and antibiotics alone are not strong enough to treat them, she added.\n\nSeveral previous studies have compared appendectomy with antibiotics , but most of them have relied on clinical examination to diagnose uncomplicated appendicitis. The current study relied on CT scans, which are a more accurate way to diagnose the disease and to make sure only patients with simple cases are studied, Salminen said. Still, in both the current study and a 2011 study that also used CT scans, more than a quarter of patients who were treated with antibiotics for their well-diagnosed cases of simple appendicitis had a recurrence of appendicitis and ended up needing surgery. In contrast, the failure rate was less than 1% in the group that initially got an appendectomy in the current study. (One patient died of heart disease in the week after surgery.) The high failure rate of antibiotic therapy suggests that it is not ready for the clinic, said Dr. Curtis Wray, an associate professor of surgery at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. \"I think we need to determine who are really the candidates for this type of nonoperative therapy,\" Wray said. Part of the reason for the 27% failure rate could be that the antibiotics did not clear up the obstruction in the appendix that was the root cause of the inflammation. More analyses need to be done to understand how this group differed from the other 73% -- maybe they had more advanced appendicitis -- and thus to be able to predict who might not make a full recovery with antibiotics alone, Wray said. If antibiotic therapy does become a viable alternative to appendectomy, it would probably lead to a big cost savings, Wray said. There are about 300,000 appendectomies performed every year in the U.S. About 200,000 of them are uncomplicated cases, many of which could be good candidates for antibiotics. However, as Wray pointed out, it may take a little while for this nonsurgical option to be accepted by patients, because appendectomy is considered the gold standard. In addition, laparoscopic appendectomy is minimally invasive and patients usually go home the same day, he added. Nevertheless, Salminen said that surgery can cause several days of pain and missed work, whereas patients would probably not experience pain following antibiotic therapy and would have a faster recovery. Because the study only looked at people between 18 and 60, it is not clear how effective antibiotic therapy would be in children, the group that accounts for most cases of appendicitis. Other researchers are planning to do a similar study in children, Salminen said. Salminen and her colleagues also did not include pregnant women in the study. \"You can't really do a CT scan on pregnant women, so you can't really have the precise diagnosis, so to be on the safe side those patients would probably have to undergo appendectomy,\" she said. The study gave patients in the antibiotic group an IV of ertapenem once a day for three days and then prescribed a week of oral antibiotics, levofloxacin and metronidazole. \"Every time you use antibiotics, you have to think about the risk of developing antibiotic resistance, (especially) because the antibiotics used here are very broad spectrum,\" Salminen said. She added that future studies should look at whether lower doses of antibiotics, and the use of more specific antibiotics that may be less likely to lead to resistance, could also be effective in treating appendicitis.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering here.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Eating a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra virgin olive oil was associated with a relatively lower risk of breast cancer in a study of women in Spain, according to an article published online by JAMA Internal Medicine.\n\nBreast cancer is a frequently diagnosed cancer and a leading cause of death in women. Diet has been extensively studied as a modifiable risk factor in the development of breast cancer but epidemiologic evidence on the effect of specific dietary factors is inconsistent.\n\nThe Mediterranean diet is known for its abundance of plant foods, fish and especially olive oil. Miguel A. Mart\u00ednez-Gonz\u00e1lez, M.D., of the University of Navarra in Pamplona and CIBEROBN in Madrid, Spain, and coauthors analyzed the effects of two interventions with the Mediterranean diet (supplemented with extra virgin olive oil [EVOO] or nuts) compared with advice to women to follow a low-fat diet. Study participants in the two intervention groups were given EVOO (one liter per week for the participants and their families) or mixed nuts (30 grams per day: 15 grams of walnuts, 7.5 grams of hazelnuts and 7.5 grams of almonds).\n\nThe study was conducted within the framework of the large PREDIMED (Prevenci\u00f3n con Dieta Mediterr\u00e1nea) trial, which was designed to test the effects of the Mediterranean diet on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2009, 4,282 women (ages 60 to 80 and at high risk of cardiovascular disease) were recruited. Women were randomly assigned to the Mediterranean diet supplemented with EVOO (n=1,476), the Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts (n=1,285) or the control diet with advice to reduce their dietary intake of fat (n=1,391).\n\nThe women were an average age of 67.7 years old, had an average body mass index of 30.4, most of them had undergone menopause before the age of 55 and less than 3 percent used hormone therapy. During a median follow-up of nearly five years, the authors identified 35 confirmed incident (new) cases of malignant breast cancer.\n\nThe authors report that women eating a Mediterranean diet supplemented with EVOO showed a 68 percent (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio of 0.32) relatively lower risk of malignant breast cancer than those allocated to the control diet. Women eating a Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts showed a nonsignificant risk reduction compared with women in the control group.\n\nThe authors note a number of limitations in their study including that breast cancer was not the primary end point of the trial for which the women were recruited; the number of observed breast cancer cases was low; the authors do not have information on an individual basis on whether and when women in the trial underwent mammography; and the study cannot establish whether the observed beneficial effect was attributable mainly to the EVOO or to its consumption within the context of the Mediterranean diet.\n\n\"The results of the PREDIMED trial suggest a beneficial effect of a MeDiet [Mediterranean diet] supplemented with EVOO in the primary prevention of breast cancer. Preventive strategies represent the most sensible approach against cancer. The intervention paradigm implemented in the PREDIMED trial provides a useful scenario for breast cancer prevention because it is conducted in primary health care centers and also offers beneficial effects on a wide variety of health outcomes. Nevertheless, these results need confirmation by long-term studies with a higher number of incident cases,\" the authors conclude.\n\nIn a related editor's note, Mitchell H. Katz, M.D., a deputy editor of JAMA Internal Medicine, writes: \"Of course, no study is perfect. This one has a small number of outcomes (only 35 incident cases of breast cancer), the women were not all screened for breast cancer with mammography, they were not blinded to the type of diet they were receiving, and all were white, postmenopausal and at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Still, consumption of a Mediterranean diet, which is based on plant foods, fish and extra virgin olive oil, is known to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and is safe. It may also prevent breast cancer. We hope to see more emphasis on Mediterranean diet to reduce cancer and cardiovascular disease and improve health and well-being.\"\n\nEditor's Note: Authors made conflict of interest and funding/support disclosures.

This rare genetic defect causes severe visual impairment beginning in infancy and can eventually lead to blindness. The company believes the total \"population in the US, Europe and select additional markets in the Americas and Asia/Pacific is up to approximately 6,000 individuals\" who have the mutation targeted by Luxturna, explained Monique da Silva, a spokeswoman for Spark Therapeutics.\n\nThe drug will be available in the United States in early spring, with an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 people in the US standing to benefit from this treatment, according to Spark.\n\nLuxturna is only the third gene therapy approved for use in the United States; two others were also approved in 2017. This is the first to correct an inherited genetic mutation.\n\nLuxturna is a liquid that is injected directly into the eye with a microscopic needle during a surgical procedure. The drug supplies a third gene -- a normal RPE65 gene -- to cells in the retina, a layer of tissue lining the back of the eye. This third version of the gene does not remove or replace the two mutated genes causing the disease, which remain inside the cells. However, the normal gene delivered by the treatment is able to function within the retinal cells and correct vision problems.\n\nIn the phase 3 clinical trial, 27 out of 29 participants -- 93% -- who received the gene therapy demonstrated a gain in functional vision as assessed by a mobility test performed in a maze, according to the company. Risks of the treatment include cataracts, elevated eye pressure, retinal tears and holes and inflammation.\n\nThe company's offer of unusual payer models, including rebates and installment payments, will \"help ensure patients' individual financial situation does not hinder access to treatment,\" da Silva said.\n\n\"New technologies such as gene and cell therapies hold out the potential to transform medicine,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a statement announcing the August approval of Kymriah, considered to be the first gene therapy to be approved for the US market.\n\nKymriah is a leukemia treatment made by pharmaceutical giant Novartis.

Most Americans don't get the 25 to 38 grams a day that's recommended, depending on age and gender.\n\nBut if you're skimping on fiber, the health stakes are high, especially if you're a teenage girl.\n\nA study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics concludes that eating lots of fiber-rich foods during high school years may significantly reduce a woman's risk of developing breast cancer.\n\nThe findings are based on a long-term study of 44,000 women who were surveyed about their eating habits in high school. The women also completed detailed questionnaires about their dietary habits every four years.\n\nThe researchers found that women who consumed high levels of fiber (28 grams per day, on average) had a 24 percent lower risk of developing breast cancer before menopause, compared with women who ate low levels of fiber (14 grams per day, on average). For the women on the high-fiber diet, the lifetime risk of developing breast cancer was also cut by 16 percent.\n\nOf course, the idea that high-fiber diets can help keep us healthy is not new. It's well-known that fiber can prevent constipation and keep the bowel moving by making stools bulkier and absorbing water. Prior studies have shown dietary fiber can protect against colorectal cancer and may lower the risks of diabetes and heart disease. There's also a growing body of evidence linking fiber to weight management.\n\nThis new study provides some evidence of yet another potential benefit.\n\n\"This is a really important study ... [suggesting] that the more fiber you eat during your high school years, the lower your risk is in developing breast cancer,\" says Kimberly Blackwell, a breast cancer specialist at the Duke Cancer Center.\n\nIn a commentary accompanying the study in Pediatrics, Blackwell writes, \"There is longstanding evidence that dietary fibers may reduce circulating estrogen levels.\" And this may help explain the reduced risk of breast cancer.\n\nThe authors point to other possible explanations, too. For instance, high-fiber diets may reduce the risk of breast cancer by improving insulin sensitivity, since fiber can slow down the absorption of sugars and help keep blood sugar levels more stable.\n\nMaryam Farvid, a fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health who is lead author of the study, says the influence of fiber on cancer risk may be time-sensitive. Adolescence is \"a period when breast cancer risk factors appear to be particularly important,\" she says.\n\nOne limitation of this new study is that it relies on data from women who had to recall what they ate during high school. They were in their 30s and 40 when asked, so there could be \"recall bias\" \u2014 the women's memories may be foggy.\n\n\"The recollection of dietary habits more than a decade earlier must be questioned,\" writes Blackwell. On the other hand, she says, \"people's dietary habits don't really change a lot. ... In general, what you eat as a teenager is really formative as to what you eat later in life.\"\n\nSo, how might the message of this new study linking high-fiber diets to a lower risk of breast cancer be communicated to teenagers?\n\nThis is a question Kristi King, a dietitian at Texas Children's Hospital, has thought about a lot.\n\nShe says it can be hard to get the attention of teenagers about healthy eating. \"Unfortunately for teenagers, they're [into] instant gratification,\" and they're not necessarily focused on how their actions today will influence their future health, she says.\n\nBut, she says, explaining that dietary choices may influence their risk of breast cancer may grab their attention. \"Most teenage girls do know someone that has been affected by breast cancer,\" says King. \"So I feel like that touches a nerve with them.\"\n\nGiven the known benefits of high-fiber diets and the growing evidence that fiber may play a role in preventing disease, the government's Dietary Guidelines for Americans also say most people need to consume more.\n\nWomen are advised to consume 25 grams a day. Men are advised to consume 38 grams a day.\n\nSo, how best to reach these targets? \"Add fiber at each meal,\" says King, in the form of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts or seeds. Pears are a great bet with 7 grams of fiber apiece.\n\nAnd check out fiber-rich snacks, like popcorn and edamame.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "In its second paragraph, the story says \u201c\u2026if you\u2019re skimping on fiber, the health stakes are high, especially if you\u2019re a teenage girl.\u201d That\u2019s scary language. This study is an interesting one, and possibly an important one, but it is also just one study addressing one risk factor for one disease. Granted, breast cancer is a scary disease.

Of the 12 AML patients who received this experimental T-cell therapy after a transplant put their disease in remission, all are still in remission after a median follow-up of more than two years.\n\nGiving these cells when disease is in remission after transplant \"might actually be helping patients who have a high risk of relapsing to not relapse down the line,\" said Dr. Aude Chapuis, cancer physician and immunotherapy researcher at Fred Hutch, one of the study's leaders. Chapuis presented these results at the 2016 annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology in San Diego, California.\n\nThe findings in this group of trial participants contrast with the outcomes the researchers observed in a cohort of similar patients who received transplants around the same time but did not receive engineered T cells. In all of these transplant-only patients, the transplants produced remissions, but more than a quarter of them relapsed within just 10 months.\n\nIn the experimental T-cell therapy tested in this trial, certain T cells from each patient's transplant donor were genetically engineered to produce receptors that allowed the T cells to recognize, very specifically, a target molecule called WT1. WT1 is 10 to 1,000 times more common in leukemia cells than their noncancerous cousins, making it a natural target for therapies designed to destroy cancer cells while leaving most healthy cells alone.\n\nThis is the team's first trial of this strategy, which was initially developed in the lab of Dr. Phil Greenberg, one of the study's leaders and the head of Fred Hutch's Program in Immunology. Because it was the first study of this particular approach, the researchers focused on a high-risk group -- AML patients undergoing bone marrow transplant who had certain genetic or disease characteristics that decrease the chance of long-term transplant success -- \"a hard population of patients,\" Chapuis said, many of whom \"were horribly sick.\"\n\nEach patient's therapy was created just for them in a specialized Fred Hutch facility. Certain T cells from each patient's matched donor were given the genetic instructions to make a receptor that specifically reacts to WT1. Then came a blood stem cell transplant: Patients' leukemic bone marrow and blood cells were destroyed and replaced with healthy cells from their donors. A month later, when the team examined these 12 patients' marrow, they found no trace of the cancers. Rapidly thereafter, once the transplanted cells fully engrafted, each patient then received up to 10 billion of the genetically engineered donor cells, infused into their arm through an IV.\n\nChapuis's role in this trial is on the laboratory side of the research, ensuring the quality of the genetically engineered cell products and monitoring the activity of the cells after infusion. She co-leads this research with Greenberg and Dr. Dan Egan of Fred Hutch, the trial's principal investigator and the care provider for trial participants. The study was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health and spinoff Juno Therapeutics, of which Greenberg is a scientific co-founder.\n\nOutside of this trial, Chapuis treats cancer patients at Fred Hutch's clinical care partner, Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. Watching her patients undergo bone marrow transplant ? itself the first clear and reproducible example of cancer immunotherapy, developed at Fred Hutch ? has made her want to work toward something better.\n\n\"That's my source of inspiration. I'm always horrified by the intense treatment that we inflict on bone marrow transplant patients and the hardship that we make them go through. And I really think we can do better,\" Chapuis said. \"That's why I'm doing this.\"\n\nAt Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, home to three Nobel laureates, interdisciplinary teams of world-renowned scientists seek new and innovative ways to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, HIV/AIDS and other life-threatening diseases.

But you can't make any conclusions about definite health benefits\" based on the study findings, said lead author Suzanna M. Zick, a naturopathic physician and research associate professor at University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor.\n\nThe study, funded by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, was published online Oct. 11 in Cancer Prevention Research.\n\nGinger, an herb, is found in supplements and in many foods such as ginger snaps and Asian dishes. Research has supported its use to treat stomach problems such as nausea and vomiting; the U.S. National Library of Medicine says it's \"likely safe,\" although some people may develop mild side effects.\n\nPrevious research in animals has suggested that ginger can reduce inflammation but isn't potentially toxic to the stomach like aspirin, Zick noted. And scientists have linked chronic inflammation in the gut to colon cancer, suggesting that easing this inflammation could reduce the risk of the disease.\n\nIn the new study, Zick's team randomly assigned 30 people to take pills containing 2 grams of ground ginger root extract or a \"dummy\" placebo pill each day for 28 days. They measured the level of inflammation in the participants' intestines before and after the test period.\n\nThe amount of ginger in the pills is equivalent to 20 grams of raw ginger root, the authors said. That is probably well beyond what most people would eat in their regular diet, Zick noted. As for cost, she said that a month's supply of similar ginger supplements typically runs about $10 to $30.\n\nThe researchers found that the level of inflammation in the subjects who took the ginger pills fell by an average of 28 percent, while staying about the same in those who took the placebo.\n\nIf more funding becomes available, the researchers hope to launch a larger study, Zick said.

And the news is very good.\n\nThe paper outlines the results of an international clinical trial, led by Jeff Elias, MD, of the University of Virginia Health System, that evaluated the scalpel-free approach called focused ultrasound for the treatment of essential tremor (ET), a condition that afflicts an estimated 10 million Americans. Not only did the researchers determine that the procedure was safe and effective, they found that it offered a lasting benefit, reducing shaking for trial participants throughout the 12-month study period.\n\n\u201cThis study represents a major advance for neurosurgery, treatment of brain disease and specifically the treatment of ET,\u201d Elias said. \u201cFor the first time in a randomized controlled trial, we have shown that ultrasound can be precisely delivered through the intact human skull to treat a difficult neurological disease.\u201d\n\nPioneering Tremor TrialThe multi-site clinical trial included 76 participants with moderate to severe essential tremor, a condition that often robs people of their ability to write, feed themselves and carry out their normal daily activities. The trial participants all had tried existing medications, without success. The mean age was 71, and most had suffered with their tremor for many years.\n\nSeventy-five percent of participants received the experimental treatment using focused ultrasound guided by magnetic resonance imaging. The remaining 25 percent underwent a sham procedure, to act as the control group. (They would later be given the opportunity to undergo the real procedure.)\n\nParticipants who received the treatment showed dramatic improvement, with the beneficial effects continuing throughout the study period. The researchers employed a 32-point scale to assess tremor severity, and they found that mean tremor scores improved by 47 percent at three months and 40 percent at 12 months. Participants reported major improvements in their quality of life. People who couldn\u2019t feed themselves soup or cereal could again do so.\n\nParticipants who received the sham procedure, on the other hand, showed no significant improvements.\n\n\u201cThe degree of tremor control was very good overall in the study, but the most important aspects were the significant gains in disabilities and quality of life \u2013 that\u2019s what patients really care about,\u201d Elias said.\n\nThe most commonly reported side effects were gait disturbances and numbness in the hand or face; in most instances, these side effects were temporary but some were permanent.\n\nFDA Approved Based on the clinical trial led by Elias, the federal Food and Drug Administration has approved the focused ultrasound device, manufactured by InSightec Inc., for the treatment of essential tremor. The device focuses sound waves inside the brain to create heat, much like a magnifying glass focuses light. That heat can then be used to interrupt the troublesome brain connections responsible for the tremor. Elias can actually watch as patients\u2019 tremor decreases, and the real-time imaging allows him to zone in on exactly the right spot before making any permanent changes to the brain.\n\nThe FDA approval means UVA can make the procedure available to eligible patients. UVA, however, is still working out the necessary logistics; it\u2019s not yet clear when Elias will begin treating patients. Because the approach is so new, insurance plans will not yet cover the procedure, though that may change in the coming months. The cost at UVA has not yet been determined.\n\nPeople interested in the procedure can learn more at uvahealth.com/focusedultrasound. The site includes a list of frequently asked questions and will be updated as UVA prepares to make the treatment available.\n\nThe procedure is not for everyone with essential tremor. It can\u2019t be used in patients who cannot undergo MRI imaging, including those with implanted metallic devices such as a pacemaker. It is also not available for pregnant women, people with heart conditions or very high blood pressure, patients with kidney disease or clotting disorders, patients on blood thinners, patients with a history of strokes or brain tumors and people with substance abuse issues. There are other exclusions as well. Doctors at UVA will evaluate potential patients to determine their eligibility and then recommend the best course of treatment.\n\nGroundbreaking ResearchUVA is a world leader in focused ultrasound research.

The investigational prep is designed to be good-tasting, with no fasting and lower fluid requirements than standard preps. It consists of nutritionally balanced bars and beverages incorporating the standard purgative active ingredient, PEG 3350, which a patient consumes during the 24 hours prior to colonoscopy.\n\nResults from the randomized, single-blind study will be presented today at the American College of Gastroenterology 2016 Annual Scientific Meeting, being held in Las Vegas, NV, by principal investigator, Douglas K.

The publication has published a comprehensive review article exploring Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). It included a favorable review of IBgard\u00ae, a novel formulation of peppermint oil developed as a medical food specifically for the dietary management of IBS.\n\nThe lead author of the review article, entitled \"Irritable Bowel Syndrome,\"1 was Paul Enck, M.D., Department of Internal Medicine VI (Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy), University Hospital T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany. In the section of the article discussing management options for IBS, Dr. Enck and the accompanying panel of researchers stated \"peppermint oil\u2026is beneficial in reducing IBS symptoms.\" The researchers also concluded that, \"A novel formulation of peppermint oil, designed to cause sustained release in the small bowel, was superior to placebo in causing a reduction in total symptoms.\"\n\nNature publishes broad review articles, called Primers, that cover global aspects of various diseases and describe all aspects from epidemiology, disease mechanisms, diagnosis, screening and prevention, management and quality of life.

The consensus report, entitled \"Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Global Perspective,\"2 guides health providers in the best management of IBS through recommendations based on the latest evidence and resulting from a global expert consensus process based on best current practice. An international scientific and medical review team reported that there are a range of agents available to treat IBS and physicians should be knowledgeable about the efficacy and risk profile of any option they are about to prescribe. The review team concluded that as a first-line therapy option, peppermint oil is superior to placebo in improving IBS symptoms and the risk of adverse events is no greater with peppermint oil than with a placebo.\n\nThese evidence-based guidelines go through a rigorous process of authoring, editing and peer review. They are available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Mandarin and Russian. WGO, formed in 1935 and incorporated in 1958, is a federation of 110 member societies and 4 regional associations of gastroenterology representing more than 50,000 individual members worldwide focusing on the improvement of standards in gastroenterology training and education on a global scale.\n\nAdditionally, the support from the medical community builds on a previously important review article about the use of peppermint oil in IBS. In a meta-analysis by Dr. Enck, entitled \"Therapy Options in Irritable Bowel Syndrome,\"3 published in The European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Dr. Enck and the authors concluded that the highest efficacy in the management of IBS is currently found in peppermint oil. Among the thirteen IBS options that Dr. Enck and the authors reviewed, only peppermint oil had the lowest NNT (number needed to treat) of 2-3 patients needed for one patient to benefit from the therapy.\n\nAbout Irritable Bowel Syndrome\n\nOne in six Americans experience Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), a frustrating, under-diagnosed and under-treated condition characterized by recurrent abdominal pain, often associated with alteration in stool frequency and/or form. Bloating is also a common symptom experienced by patients with IBS. Recent understandings of the root causes of IBS point to gut mucosal barrier dysfunction and malabsorption.\n\nAbout IBgard \n\nIBgard\u00ae is a medical food specially formulated for the dietary management of IBS. IBgard\u00ae capsules contain solid state microspheres of peppermint oil, including its principal component l-Menthol, in a unique delivery system. With its patented Site Specific Targeting (SST\u00ae) technology, pioneered by IM HealthScience\u00ae, IBgard\u00ae capsules release Ultramen\u00ae, an ultra-purified peppermint oil, quickly and reliably to the small intestine, where its actions help manage IBS. Peppermint oil can help toward normalizing the digestion of food and the absorption of nutrients, which have been compromised by IBS. Peppermint oil has also been shown to normalize intestinal transit time.\n\nIBgard\u00ae was studied in a pivotal, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, multi-center trial called the rritable owel yndrome eduction valuation and afety rial (IBSREST\u2122). The study findings were accepted by a leading, peer-reviewed scientific journal, called Digestive Diseases and Sciences, and published in February 2016. The data showed that IBgard\u00ae demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the Total IBS Symptom Score (TISS) in as early as 24 hours and at four weeks. The TISS represents a composite score of eight individual IBS symptoms. Currently, there are limited options for patients with IBS that offer effective and rapid relief, especially during a flare-up.\n\nOver 10,000 healthcare practitioners, including 3,000 gastroenterologists, are estimated to have already used IBgard\u00ae for their patients. In a recent nationwide survey of gastroenterologists, IBgard\u00ae was the number one recommended peppermint oil for IBS. Like all medical foods, IBgard\u00ae does not require a prescription, but it must be used under medical supervision. Only doctors can diagnose IBS. The usual adult dose of IBgard\u00ae is 1-2 capsules as needed, up to three times a day, not to exceed 8 capsules per day.\n\nIBgard\u00ae is available to patients in the digestive aisle at most CVS/pharmacy, Walgreens and Rite Aid stores nationwide and now increasingly in independent drug stores and grocery stores across the country.\n\nAbout IM HealthScience\u00ae\n\nIM HealthScience\u00ae (IMH) is the innovator of IBgard\u00ae for the dietary management of irritable bowel syndrome. It is a privately held company based in Boca Raton, Florida, that is also the innovator of FDgard\u00ae for the dietary management of functional dyspepsia. It was founded in 2010 by a team of highly experienced pharmaceutical research and development and management executives. The company is dedicated to developing products to address gastrointestinal issues where there is a high unmet need.

A week later they were shown the colours again, accompanied by a loud sound but no shocks, and their fear responses were measured.*\n\nThe fear response was 60% lower in participants who had doxycycline in the first session compared to those who had the placebo, suggesting that the fear memory was significantly suppressed by the drug. Other cognitive measures including sensory memory and attention were not affected.\n\n\"When we talk about reducing fear memory, we are not talking about deleting the memory of what actually happened,\" explains lead author Professor Dominik Bach (UCL Wellcome Centre for Neuroimaging, Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research and University of Zurich Division of Clinical Psychiatry Research). \"The participants may not forget that they received a shock when the screen was red, but they 'forget' to be instinctively scared when they next see a red screen. Learning to fear threats is an important ability for any organism, helping us to avoid dangers such as predators. Over-prediction of threat, however, can cause tremendous suffering and distress in anxiety disorders such as PTSD.\"\n\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a term for a broad range of psychological symptoms that can develop after someone experiences or witnesses a traumatic event. PTSD is caused by an overactive fear memory, and the new research shows that doxycycline can reduce the fear memory response in healthy volunteers.\n\n\"We have demonstrated a proof-of-principle for an entirely new treatment strategy for PTSD,\" explains Professor Bach. \"The theory is based on the recent discovery that our brains need proteins outside nerve cells, called matrix enzymes, to form memories. Matrix enzymes are found throughout the body, and their over-activity is involved in certain immune diseases and cancers. To treat such diseases, we already have clinically approved drugs that block these enzymes, including the antibiotic doxycycline, so we wanted to see if they could help to prevent fear memories from forming in the brain. Our results support this theory, opening up an exciting avenue of research that might help us to find treatments for PTSD.\n\n\"Using drugs to prevent PTSD would be challenging, since in the real world we don't know when a traumatic event is about to occur. However, there is growing evidence that people's memories and associations can be changed after the event when they experience or imagine similar situations. This is called 'reconsolidation', and we now plan to test the effect of doxycycline on reconsolidation of fear memories. If this is successful, we would hope to apply the technique to more clinically realistic models of PTSD within a few years.\"\n\nThe work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation, University of Zurich and Wellcome.\n\n*In the first session, participants were given either doxycycline or a placebo and put in front of a computer. The screen would flash either blue or red, and one of the colours was associated with a 50% chance of receiving a painful electric shock. This happened 160 times, with the colours appearing in random order, so that participants learnt to associate the 'bad' colour with the shock.\n\nA week later, under no medication, participants returned to repeat the experiment. This time there were no electric shocks, but a loud sound played after either colour was shown. Participants' fear responses were measured by tracking their eye blinks, as this is an instinctive response to sudden threats. The fear memory response was calculated by subtracting the baseline startle response -- the response to the sound on the 'good' colour - from the response to the sound when the 'bad' colour was showing.", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The release doesn\u2019t engage in disease mongering.

Private investors and corporations are pouring money into the field.\n\nSean Parker, the internet mogul of Napster fame, donated $24 million to set up an allergy research center at Stanford University. Nestl\u00e9 this month invested $145 million in a startup aimed at tackling peanut allergy. And the Broad Institute of Cambridge, Mass., recently launched a new initiative to unravel the basic biology of food allergy.\n\nThe potential market is huge: It\u2019s estimated that 50 million Americans have allergies. As many as 10 percent of children suffer from hay fever, nearly 12 percent have skin allergies, and 5 percent have food allergies, most commonly peanuts, dairy, and shellfish, according to the 2014 National Health Interview Survey.\n\n\u201cI foresee that a lot of allergy therapies will become more and more specific and targeted, and more customizable to the individual patient,\u201d said Andrew Long, the lead investigational drug pharmacist at Stanford\u2019s Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy & Asthma Research.\n\nThe experimental treatment that may be closest to market is also one of the simplest. Bay Area startup Aimmune, backed in part by Nestl\u00e9 with that $145 million investment, is creating a methodical peanut desensitization pill that slowly weans patients away from allergy.\n\nThe company has identified the peanut proteins that trigger allergic reaction and is filling little capsules with the stuff. Patients start out by taking half a milligram of peanut protein, and gradually work their way up \u2014 over the course of about six months \u2014 to the equivalent of eating a single peanut.\n\n\u201cThe people who need it the most are the people who have the most profound and potentially life-threatening reaction,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Adelman, chief medical officer of Aimmune.\n\nThe capsules are science\u2019s answer to previous efforts from allergists, who would concoct \u201chome brews\u201d of peanut protein to desensitize patients under the table. Aimmune\u2019s peanut powder is in Phase 3 trials \u2014 and, despite its relative simplicity, is still considered something of a trailblazer in allergy science.\n\nResearchers at Stanford University are building on the concept of desensitization.\n\nOne of the drugs Long is excited about: omalizumab, a biologic drug made by Genentech under the trade name Xolair.\n\nTo understand how it works, you have to back up and look at why you get all itchy and wheezy when you encounter an allergen. Such responses make sense from an evolutionary standpoint: They initially came into being to protect our bodies against toxins, like snake venom, or to ward away parasites. But they can be deadly in the modern era.\n\nTwo types of immune cells \u2014 called mast cells and basophils \u2014 are the biggest culprits behind allergic reactions. When a person encounters an allergen, let\u2019s say peanut protein, a type of antibody called immunoglobulin E, or IgE, gets activated. This stimulates the mast cells and basophils to release a storm of chemicals that provoke an allergic response to help exorcise peanut protein from the body.\n\nGenentech\u2019s drug is an engineered antibody that binds to human IgE, blocking it from triggering that chemical storm.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in 2003 to treat a form of asthma often triggered by allergens, but Stanford researchers are now testing it on patients with food allergies \u2014 and finding that it might help speed along classic allergy desensitization therapy, in which patients are slowly introduced to escalating quantities of the allergen, via allergy shots or those \u201chome brew\u201d concoctions.\n\n\u201cRight now, the process of immunotherapy is painstakingly long \u2014 it takes not just weeks or months, but years, to treat a single allergy this way,\u201d said Dr. Toshi Kawakami, a researcher at the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology.\n\nThis timeline becomes untenable for patients with multiple allergies \u2014 and about 70 percent of people who have an allergy to one type of food will also be allergic to another, Long said.\n\nSo Stanford has paired Xolair with desensitization therapy to treat up to five different food allergens at any given time. Instead of taking years to gird a patient\u2019s body against peanuts, they\u2019re able to help her control her reactions to, say, hazelnuts, fish, dairy, and wheat as well.\n\nLooking at IgE from a different angle, Harvard statistical geneticist Liming Liang has been hunting for new drug targets that might modulate how, exactly, the antibody is expressed. In a paper published last year in Nature, Liang\u2019s team found 30 genes that are involved in kicking off the allergic response.\n\n\u201cWe think we\u2019ll be able to identify a potential drug target here for allergy reaction \u2014 but, of course, it\u2019ll take quite a long time to turn that into a medicine used by patients,\u201d Liang said.\n\nAnother compelling approach is being taken by Japan\u2019s Astellas Pharma, which is developing a DNA vaccine meant to protect the body from cedar pollen. (Hay fever has been called a \u201cnational affliction\u201d in Japan, affecting a quarter of the population.)\n\nThe underlying research, from Immunomic Therapeutics and Johns Hopkins University, involves attaching a fragment of DNA from, say, cedar pollen to a template vaccine that can embed itself inside the cell. Once there, it revs up an aggressive immune response and imprints an \u201cimmunological memory,\u201d which means the immune system will respond even more quickly to future exposures to the allergen.\n\nThe idea is to create resistance to an allergen without ever having to expose the patient to that substance. If it works, it\u2019d be fairly easy to swap out the cedar pollen DNA for a different allergen \u2014 for instance, the genetic material that codes for peanut or cat antigens \u2014 and tack it onto this vaccine template.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of this is that, unlike food desensitization or skin patches, patients aren\u2019t exposed to the circulating antigen,\u201d Long said. \u201cThat hypothetically decreases the risk for adverse events.\u201d\n\nFor all the research on allergies, none of the drugs in the pipeline is a sure thing.\n\nFor a cautionary tale, look no further than Circassia Pharmaceuticals, which has been working on an experimental immunotherapy drug to forestall cat allergies. Interest in Circassia had been sky-high \u2014 the small biotech\u2019s market value had shot up to $1 billion earlier this year on speculation that its drug would prove effective.\n\nBut in a Phase 3 study, it turned out that the placebo effect was as effective as the drug itself. The company\u2019s stock plummeted on that news this past June.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that solving allergies is hard. Current medications \u2014 such as Benadryl, Claritin, and epinephrine (best known for powering the EpiPen) \u2014 do a decent job controlling symptoms in most patients, so there\u2019s little incentive to innovate.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a dearth of new allergy products because antihistamines work so well,\u201d said Dr. Todd Brady, CEO of Aldeyra Therapeutics, a startup in Lexington, Mass., that\u2019s developing a drug to reduce eye irritation from allergies.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re generic, they\u2019re cheap, they\u2019re safe, and easy to use \u2014 but unfortunately, a lot of patients suffer because of that phenomenon, because not everyone responds to antihistamines,\u201d Brady said.\n\nAnother reason for the hesitancy: liability concerns. It\u2019s a risky proposition to give patients the foods they\u2019re deathly allergic to \u2014 inducing anaphylactic reactions simply to test drugs in clinical trials.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s a fairly 19th-century approach,\u201d said Dr. Wayne Shreffler, a researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital who is working on the Broad Institute\u2019s Food Allergy Science Initiative. \u201cThere\u2019s really no doubt that there have been cold feet in the industry about this issue.\u201d\n\nBut investigators around the world have shown they can carry out these \u201cfood challenge\u201d trials safely \u2014 which could help hasten the development of new drugs.\n\n\u201cIn school, we didn\u2019t learn anything about allergy treatment, except antihistamines and epinephrine,\u201d Long said. \u201cBut now, we\u2019re seeing this whole new spectrum of treatments. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how this translates into making it into a pharmacy, and into the hands of patients.\u201d\n\nCorrection: A previous version of the story misstated some aspects of Aimunne\u2019s work on peanut allergies.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No mongering: the prevalence of allergies is high and, according to some sources, rising rapidly in the developing world as well as in the U.S.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "For the first time in many years, John Elder Robison entered a sixth-floor lab at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and settled into a chair. He was there to demonstrate \u2014 although not actually repeat \u2014 a procedure known as transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, in which electromagnetic impulses are fired into carefully targeted areas of a patient\u2019s brain. TMS activates neurological pathways and is most commonly used to treat depression.\n\nRobison, 58, is autistic. At age 40, the Amherst resident was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s syndrome, a developmental disorder marked by impaired social skills and difficulty with nonverbal communication. Although highly competent in fields like electronics, sound design, and car mechanics, Robison found his limited ability to read body language and other unspoken cues left him feeling cut off from normal human interaction.\n\nBeginning in 2008, Robison voluntarily underwent roughly a dozen TMS sessions as part of a research study conducted at BIDMC\u2019s Berenson-Allen Center for Noninvasive Brain Stimulation. The results are chronicled in Robison\u2019s new book, \u201cSwitched On: A Memoir of Brain Change and Emotional Awakening.\u201d\n\nIn a moving, often harrowing narrative reminiscent of \u201cAwakenings\u201d and other popular works by the late neurologist and writer Oliver Sacks, Robison writes of the transformations these sessions helped unlock, the welcome ones \u2014 and the not so welcome.\n\nAfter his initial TMS session, Robison experienced music on a visceral level he had once known, long ago, but sensed he had lost. He burst into tears. \u201cThe experience was richer and deeper, with an added layer of feeling,\u201d he writes. \u201cPerhaps I was hearing music pure and true, without the distorting lens of autism.\u201d\n\nOther striking changes in perception and mood soon followed. Some proved transitory, others seemingly more permanent.\n\n\u201cThe change in my ability to relate to people is really, really big,\u201d he said during an interview in a hospital conference room.\n\nHis book is likely to spark even greater interest \u2014 and funding \u2014 in TMS as a non-medicinal way to treat symptoms associated with disabilities like autism, epilepsy, ADHD, and dementia. Robison certainly hopes so.\n\n\u201cMy world is strikingly different, even if the TMS energy is all dissipated,\u201d he said. He maintains his ability to read body language and communicate his own feelings through facial expression have improved dramatically.\n\n\u201cI feel I hear music with more clarity, too. Whether I think it\u2019s there, or it really is there, it\u2019s all the same,\u201d added Robison, a physically large man who smiles easily and often. To a reporter who first met him a decade ago, the changes in his demeanor are obvious: more relaxed, less guarded, more emotionally engaged.\n\nRobison also happens to be a gifted writer \u2014 his 2007 memoir \u201cLook Me in the Eye: My Life With Asperger\u2019s\u201d was a critically acclaimed bestseller. He\u2019s also a prolific blogger with a knack for dredging wry humor out of awkward situations.\n\nStill, for all the positive changes described in \u201cSwitched On,\u201d Robison\u2019s fourth book, there were negatives he was forced to deal with. TMS treatments chipped away at what he calls his \u201cprotective shield\u201d of autism, he writes, leaving him disoriented and depressed at times.\n\nHis second marriage, to a woman who herself suffered from chronic depression, came undone within a year of his initial TMS sessions. He frequently fell behind schedule at work (Robison runs a high-end car repair business in Springfield and lives in Amherst). Old friendships fell apart. As Robison\u2019s public profile rose \u2014 since \u201cLook Me in the Eye,\u201d he has divided his time between the car business and advocating on behalf of autism awareness \u2014 it disrupted his life on many levels.\n\nAt his lowest point, in 2009, Robison considered killing himself. Gaining and then losing abilities he\u2019d never possessed caused \u201ca mixture of sadness and wonder,\u201d Robison writes, summing up his condition in one word: \u201cjarred.\u201d\n\nRobison has previously written about growing up in Western Massachusetts in an intellectually prominent family (his father taught philosophy, his mother wrote poetry) plagued by alcoholism and mental illness. Much of that dysfunction was also chronicled in \u201cRunning With Scissors,\u201d the 2002 best-selling memoir by Robison\u2019s brother, Augusten Burroughs.\n\n\u201cSwitched On\u201d revisits that dark and stormy past. Yet it is more than a linear account of a life transformed by cutting-edge medical technology.\n\nA \u201ctechno geek\u201d with a deep knowledge of mechanical and electrical systems \u2014 he once worked as a sound engineer and special-effects designer for the rock band KISS \u2014 Robison delves into the latest brain-research findings and TMS\u2019s potential to help others like himself. He celebrates neurodiversity more generally, too, a subject he has been teaching at William & Mary College and Harvard Medical School.\n\nDuring the interview, Robison addressed the concerns and hopes he took into his TMS sessions, and the impact they\u2019ve had on his life since then. People close to him questioned whether the risk was worth it. Or even if an \u201cimproved\u201d version of himself would be someone they could love as much.\n\n\u201cSome thought I was crazy to let them do that to my brain, but I never had that fear,\u201d said Robison. \u201cThe technology was thoroughly familiar to me. And even though I knew these kinds of things could be dangerous if used wrong, I had confidence that a Harvard teaching hospital would use them safely.\u201d\n\nWeighing the risk-reward balance, he continued, \u201cI wondered, what if [the sessions] could really turn me on to being sensitive to other people? I\u2019d concluded that one reason I was kind of down was, I could not receive all these messages of love and kindness coming my way. People would ask, \u2018Can\u2019t you tell how happy you made us?\u2019 Well, no, I\u2019d say. I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nEven a 1 percent chance at success seemed worth the odds, Robison went on. And even if, as he\u2019d been warned, any changes in brain function might last only half as long as the 30-minute treatments themselves.\n\nThe negatives? These, too, he has come to accept.\n\n\u201cI was probably naive at the outset,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI had this idea that if I could only \u2018get\u2019 these happy messages, I would be happier. It didn\u2019t occur to me that most of the news out there, most of the emotion, is, if not bad, at least not all good. Not sweetness and light but a world of angst and avarice and greed. It was overpowering.\u201d\n\nRobison\u2019s TMS research team was led by Harvard neurologist Dr. Alvaro Pascual-Leone, who supplies an introduction to \u201cSwitched On.\u201d In a separate interview, Pascual-Leone says Robison\u2019s book demonstrates how small changes in brain function, however temporary, can have a life-changing impact.\n\nImagine, Pascual-Leone says, someone who cannot see color being told the sky is blue \u2014 an abstract, meaningless concept. Suddenly, for a brief period, he\u2019s able to see the sky in color. Forever after, the idea of \u201cblue\u201d will no longer be meaningless.\n\n\u201cNow translate that concept to emotions,\u201d he continues. \u201cIf you can give [someone like Robison] an idea of what emotions may be hidden behind a voice or face, then it enables his brain, without TMS, to change the way he approaches life and people.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Pascual-Leone acknowledges that these changes can be challenging as well as beneficial, as Robison describes. A recent paper by the BIDMC team concluded that TMS, while appealing and worth further study, is not yet recommended as an autism treatment. Rather, it may be best used to alleviate certain symptoms associated with spectrum disorder, including depression.\n\nStill, there are a number of clinics currently offering TMS as an autism treatment, a practice that concerns many researchers. \u201cPeople are desperate to help their loved ones, which I understand,\u201d Pascual-Leone says. \u201cWill it get more attention because of John\u2019s book? Absolutely. But his book does illustrate that the consequences can be long-lasting, and detrimental.\u201d\n\nRobison remains optimistic that as research continues, the potential benefits will outweigh the risks.\n\n\u201cI owe a great debt [to the Harvard team] for helping me see I was not broken or defective,\u201d he said. \u201cThat this painful disability of mine was a rare gift.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are scared of the science-fiction aspect to this, but it\u2019s real,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd what I wrote about in the book isn\u2019t 10 percent of what they\u2019re doing now.\u201d\n\n\u201cSwitched On\u201d ends in 2013. Robison, now happily remarried, says he\u2019s become even more militant advocating on behalf of what he calls \u201cmy tribe.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can look at my success in the world,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s not just in my mind. It\u2019s undeniable.\u201d", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There is no disease mongering.

High-risk tumors are more aggressive and thus more likely to eventually kill the patient.\n\nOf the blood thinners used in the study, aspirin was the one which seemed to account for most of the benefit, the researchers said\n\nThere has already been some evidence that cancer and the body's coagulation system might be linked in some way.\n\n\"Cancer patients tend to develop clots in their legs and lungs more frequently and also patients who develop clots in their legs and lungs tend to develop cancer more frequently,\" Choe noted. \"We hypothesized that anticoagulant medication may lower the chance of death from prostate cancer in men who have localized prostate cancer.\"\n\nAnd, at least according to this retrospective review of medical records, this did indeed appear to be the case. Retrospective studies -- where researchers look back over previously collected data, looking for associations -- are not as reliable as prospective trials, however.\n\nThe study included 5,275 men diagnosed with prostate cancer that had not yet spread beyond the prostate gland and had been treated with surgery or radiation. Of the almost 2,000 patients on anticoagulants in the study, 1,649 were taking aspirin, 428 warfarin, 287 clopidogrel (Plavix), 26 enoxaparin, and 408 a combination of blood thinners.\n\nAfter an average follow-up of about seven years, only 1 percent of men who had been taking an anticoagulant had died versus 4 percent of those in the control group. At 10 years, 4 percent of those taking one of these medications had died versus 10 percent in no-blood thinner group.\n\nThis translates to a risk reduction of about 50 percent, the researchers calculated.\n\nThe chances of the cancer spreading to the bone were reduced while PSA (prostate-specific antigen) blood levels -- thought to be a marker for cancer's advance -- were also better controlled.\n\n\"This benefit was seen whether these patients were treated with surgery or radiotherapy,\" Choe added.\n\nCancer cells are coated by platelets when they enter the bloodstream and are on their way to spreading. This protects them from immune cells and also helps them stick to their next location, Choe explained. Anticoagulants may work by interfering with this process.\n\nBut Choe said he is not ready to recommend routine aspirin use in men diagnosed with prostate cancer.\n\n\"It's premature to say that aspirin should be used in a standard-therapy way in all patients with prostate cancer,\" he said. \"But we may expect to see this benefit in those who are taking aspirin for other [usually cardiovascular] reasons.\"\n\nAspirin also comes with some risks of its own, including stomach bleeding, Choe pointed out.\n\nA second study, conducted in the United States, Canada and Great Britain and also being presented at ASTRO, suggests that a combination of hormone therapy plus radiation may be the best treatment for men who have locally advanced prostate cancer with a high risk of returning.\n\nThis usurps the previous view that hormone therapy was useless or even \"unkind or toxic,\" said study lead author Dr. Malcolm Mason, a radiation oncologist with Cardiff University in Wales.\n\nThis trial, the largest of its kind, involved about 1,200 men who were randomly chosen to receive hormone therapy alone or a combination of that and radiation.\n\nAn initial review at six years suggested that those taking the combination therapy had a 43 percent reduced risk of dying from prostate cancer, while side effects were not \"major,\" Mason said. \"If the figures from the interim analysis are similar to the final analysis, we would expect a 43 percent reduction in the chances of death from prostate cancer in men with this regimen,\" he said.\n\n\"We feel these results are practice changing,\" Mason added. \"The standard treatment for localized, high-risk prostate cancer for people who are fit for radiotherapy should be a combination of hormone therapy plus radiotherapy.\"\n\nExperts note that studies presented at scientific meetings do not face the same peer-review scrutiny as those published in reputable journals.\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on prostate cancer.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "\n\n\nThe story was clear that this study involved only men who had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and that it was in those with the highest-risk tumors where the differences were most apparent between those who were on anticoagulants and those who weren\u2019t.

At that time, the group, which represents about 60,000 pediatricians nationwide, concluded that there was no clear evidence for or against circumcising newborns. The group affirmed that position in 2005.\n\nSince then, the popularity of circumcision in the United States has declined. Only about 56 percent of newborn males are circumcised.\n\nThe academy's task force spent seven years combing through the latest research, analyzing more than a thousand studies. Their conclusion?\n\nFor starters, Blank says, circumcision helps baby boys pretty much immediately.\n\n\"The health benefits of male circumcision include a drop in the risk of urinary tract infection in the first year of life by up to 90 percent,\" she says.\n\nBut there's a much bigger reason to do it, Blank said. Circumcised males are far less likely to get infected with a long list of sexually transmitted diseases.\n\n\"It drops the risk of heterosexual HIV acquisition by about 60 percent. It drops the risk of human papillomavirus [HPV], herpes virus and other infectious genital ulcers,\" she says.\n\nIt also reduces the chances that men will spread HPV to their wives and girlfriends, protecting them from getting cervical cancer.\n\n\"We've reviewed the data and, you know, we have gone through them with a fine-tooth comb, and the data are pretty convincing,\" she says.\n\nCritics, however, were not convinced. They liken the procedure to female genital mutilation.\n\n\"We have no right as parents or as physicians or adults to strap them down and chop off a normal part of their body. To do that is a human rights violation and an ethical travesty,\" says Georgeanne Chapin of the anti-circumcision group Intact America.\n\nChapin and other critics argue that the scientific evidence is questionable. For one thing, the studies about HIV have only been done in Africa, where AIDS is much more common among heterosexuals.\n\n\"They're cherry-picking their evidence,\" she says. \"They act as though there's this huge body of literature. It's all the same couple of studies that have been regurgitated and reprogrammed. Over the past 150 years, all kinds of medical benefits have been proposed as resulting from cutting off the foreskin, and they have all been disproven.\"\n\nCritics also question the safety of the procedure, saying too many boys are damaged for life by botched circumcisions.\n\nBut many experts say the academy is making the right call. They dismiss any comparison to female genital mutilation as grossly misleading and say male circumcision is about as safe as any procedure could be.\n\nSome think the academy's position is long overdue, and that the group should have gone even further and more forcefully recommended circumcision.\n\n\"I think that all healthy newborn babies should be circumcised,\" says Edgar Schoen, a professor emeritus at the University of California, San Francisco. \"I feel about newborn circumcision the way I do about immunization: It's a potent preventive health procedure that gives you a health advantage.\"\n\nFor its part, the pediatricians group hopes the new recommendations will encourage more parents to circumcise their sons \u2014 and more insurance plans to pay for it. As Shots reported last week, a lot of state Medicaid programs have stopped covering circumcision.\n\n\"Those families who choose circumcision should have access to circumcision. Cost should not be a barrier,\" Blank says.\n\nThe federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been promising for years now to issue the government's first guidelines about circumcision.

The study was selected for the society's \"Best of ASCO,\" an effort to condense the research \"most relevant and significant to oncology\" into a two-day program to increase global access to cutting-edge science.\n\n\"Our findings will change the standard of care for women newly diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer,\" said principal investigator Atilla Soran, M.D., M.P.H., clinical professor of surgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, and breast surgical oncologist with UPMC CancerCenter. \"We've shown that surgery to remove the primary tumor--either through lumpectomy or mastectomy--followed by standard therapy, is beneficial over no surgery.\"\n\nDr. Soran began the trial in 2007, ultimately recruiting a total of 274 women newly diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer from 25 institutions. Half the women received standard therapy, which avoids surgery and consists of a combination of chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and targeted therapy, while the other half first had surgery to remove their primary breast tumor, followed by the standard therapy.\n\nAt about 40 months after diagnosis, the women who received the surgery plus standard therapy lived an average of nine months longer than their counterparts who received standard therapy alone. Nearly 42 percent of the women who received surgery lived to five years after diagnosis, compared with less than 25 percent of the women who did not receive surgery.\n\nThe trial also showed that surgery in younger women with less aggressive cancers resulted in longer average survival than in women with more aggressive cancers that had spread to the liver or lungs.\n\n\"Our thinking is similar to how you might approach a battle against two enemies,\" said Dr. Soran. \"First you quickly dispatch one army--the primary tumor--leaving you to concentrate all your efforts on battling the second army--any remaining cancer.\"\n\nThis research was primarily funded by the Turkish Federation of Societies for Breast Diseases.

For the study, researchers from Lund University in Sweden recruited 121 young adults who had injured their A.C.L.\u2019s. The volunteers, between 18 and 35, were physically active, and many were competitive athletes. They agreed, rather bravely, to be randomly assigned to one of two groups and accept radically different treatments for their torn A.C.L.\u2019s. The first group began physical therapy and then underwent surgical reconstruction of the ligament, considered by many people to be the best option for injured athletes. The second group received only physical therapy, with the option to have the operation later. Twenty-three subjects of that group did eventually have the operation. (For those fortunate enough not to be personally familiar with A.C.L. surgery, reconstruction involves replacing the injured ligament with tissue from elsewhere in your own leg or from a cadaver.)\n\nOver two years, the injured knees were assessed using a comprehensive numerical score that rated pain, function during activity and other measures. At the time of the original injury, the knee also had been scored. At the end of the two years, both groups showed considerable improvement. The scores for the surgically repaired knees had risen by 39.2 points. The scores for the more conservatively treated knees also had risen, by 39.4 points. In other words, the outcomes were virtually identical. Despite a widespread belief that surgery leads to a stronger knee, the results showed that surgically reconstructing the A.C.L. as soon as possible after the tear \u201cwas not superior\u201d to more conservative treatment, the study\u2019s authors wrote. The findings suggest, the authors concluded, that \u201cmore than half the A.C.L. reconstructions\u201d currently being conducted on injured knees \u201ccould be avoided without adversely affecting outcomes.\u201d\n\nThis possibility should reverberate across playing fields nationwide, where, at the moment, preseason high school, collegiate and adult-league sports practices are under way, with a concomitant surge in A.C.L. tears. By one estimate, as many as 1 in every 556 fit, active people will tear an A.C.L. \u2014 particularly if they participate in sports that involve frequent pivoting and landing, like soccer, football, tennis, skiing and basketball. At the same time, the urge to treat the injury with surgery appears to be growing. The \u201cbelief among most surgeons and patients is that surgery is a \u2018must,\u2019 at least if you aim to go back into an active lifestyle,\u201d the Swedish authors of the study e-mailed in response to questions.\n\nPart of the reason for A.C.L. surgery\u2019s popularity is that by most measures, it works. In the current study, most of the group members who had reconstructive surgery reported that their injured knees felt healthy after two years and that they had returned to activity \u2014 not, in most cases, at the same level as before their injuries, but they were active. Significantly, their knees also were notably more \u201cstable\u201d than the joints that hadn\u2019t been surgically fixed. Stability is, in theory, desirable. A stable knee rarely gives way.\n\nBut in practice, the importance of stability after A.C.L. treatment is \u201ccontroversial,\u201d The New England Journal study\u2019s authors, Richard Frobell, Ph.D., and Stefan Lohmander, M.D., Ph.D., of Lund University, wrote in their e-mail. In an important 2009 study published in The British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers retrospectively compared outcomes after 10 years in competitive athletes who had surgery or had opted for conservative treatment of their torn A.C.L.\u2019s. The surgically repaired knees were notably more stable. But they weren\u2019t fundamentally healthier. The surgically reconstructed knees and the conservatively treated joints experienced similar (and high) levels of early onset knee arthritis, a common occurrence after an A.C.L. tear. The treatments were almost identical, too, in terms of whether the athletes could return to sports and whether they reported subsequent knee problems.\n\nWhy, then, undergo A.C.L. reconstruction, an operation that can be expensive and, like all surgical procedures, carries risks? Several top-flight orthopedic surgeons I contacted say that they remain convinced that surgery leads to a better long-term outcome for certain patients, particularly if they want to return to pivoting sports. \u201cThe reason to have the surgery is to preserve\u201d other parts of the knee from injury during activity, says Dr. Warren Dunn, an assistant professor of orthopedics and rehabilitation at Vanderbilt University who has extensively studied A.C.L. tears. He points out that in The New England Journal of Medicine study, only 8 percent of the patients in the first surgical group subsequently tore a meniscus, a fragile pillow of cartilage that can rip if a knee gives way. Twenty-five percent of those in the physical therapy group eventually tore their meniscuses.\n\nWhat these numbers mean for anyone who tears an A.C.L. or is the parent of a young athlete in that situation is that they should have a long, frank conversation with an orthopedic surgeon and possibly also a nonsurgical sports-medicine specialist about options. \u201cWe recommend surgery based on activity level and sports,\u201d Dr. Dunn says. \u201cMost subjects can do in-line activities\u201d like running or biking \u201cwithout an A.C.L.\u201d He adds, \u201cOn the other hand, we believe that A.C.L.-deficient subjects that do return\u201d to sports involving cutting, pivoting or planting the leg \u201ccan consequently injure the meniscus\u201d or other cartilage in the knee and would benefit from a replacement A.C.L.\n\nThe authors of the study are less sure. \u201cOn the basis of our study results, we\u2019d tell patients\u201d that \u201cthere is no apparent downside of starting a good rehab program and waiting with the surgery decision to see if it is needed or not,\u201d the authors wrote to me.\n\nThe ultimate lesson of The New England Journal study is almost certainly that more science on the subject is needed. \u201cWe definitely know only parts of the long-term outcome\u201d after different A.C.L. treatments, says Dr. Duncan Meuffels, an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam and lead author of The British Journal of Sports Medicine study.\n\nBut large-scale, randomized controlled studies, the gold standard of medical research, may be difficult to orchestrate, in part because people with shredded A.C.L.\u2019s can balk at being denied surgery. In The New England Journal study, some of those assigned to physical therapy wound up requesting surgery, although they weren\u2019t experiencing any knee problems. For them, it seems, \u201cthe desire to undergo surgery was based on expectations rather than symptoms,\u201d the authors told me.

But in leg arteries, the active flexing can cause a stent to break.

Cytology-based screening, known as the Pap test or Pap smear, is used to detect abnormal cells. The Pap test can also find noncancerous conditions, such as infections and inflammation.\n\nCervical cancer screening guidelines have changed dramatically over the last 15 years, following introduction of testing for the dozen high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types that cause virtually all cervical cancer and its precursors. Despite more research into HPV, and the introduction of preventive HPV vaccines, screening will remain important and comprise many millions of tests annually for decades to come. But improved screening methods have also introduced some confusion, even controversy.\n\nHPV testing is more sensitive than the Pap test for detecting precancer. The HPV test captures the known cancer causing viruses, but there are gynecologists who believe that there may be unknown cancer causing viruses and so continue to do the Pap smear (plus HPV testing).\n\nHowever, reports of rare HPV-negative, Pap-test-positive cancers are motivating continued use of both tests (cotesting) despite increased testing costs. An HPV test, in which doctors test a cervicovaginal specimen for the presence of the nucleic acids of carcinogenic types of HPV, is more sensitive than the Pap test (a microscopic examination of exfoliated cells) for detection of precancers. Thus, if a single screening method were chosen to complement HPV vaccination, primary HPV testing likely would gradually supplant the Pap test.\n\nIn the US, an interim guidance issued by a committee of experts from several clinical societies recommended primary HPV testing every three years, the same as the Pap test. Alternatively, current guidelines recommend cotesting but, in recognition of the additional reassurance provided by this approach compared with the Pap test alone, the screening interval is extended to every five years. Draft guidelines from the US Preventive Services Task Force recently recommended either primary HPV testing every five years or the Pap test every three years for women 30 to 64, and did not recommend cotesting.\n\nThe accumulated evidence supports inclusion of HPV testing in screening; thus, the main choice moving forward is between cotesting and primary HPV testing alone.\n\nResearchers were searching for realistic performance data to quantify the additional benefit of the Pap test component of cotesting, as the costs of intensive screening of all women using two screening tests are substantial.\n\nIn January 2003, just prior to US FDA approval of HPV and Pap test cotesting in mid-2003 and interim guidelines in 2004, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large integrated health care organization, introduced three-year cotesting in women aged 30 years and older. Kaiser Permanente has now screened over a million women by cotesting. This remains the most extensive experience of HPV testing incorporated into routine screening in the world.\n\nResearchers here quantified the detection of cervical precancer and cancer by cotesting compared with HPV testing alone at Kaiser Permanente, where 1,208,710 women have undergone triennial cervical cotesting since 2003. Screening histories preceding cervical cancers (n=623) and precancers (n=5,369) were examined to assess the relative contribution of the Pap test and HPV test components in identifying cases.\n\nThe analysis found that HPV testing identified more women subsequently diagnosed with cancer and precancer than the Pap test. HPV testing was statistically significantly more likely to be positive for cancer at any time point, except within 12 months. HPV-negative/ Pap test-positive results preceded only small fractions of cases of precancer (3.5%) and cancer (5.9%); these cancers were more likely to be regional or distant stage than other cases.\n\nGiven the rarity of cancers among screened women, the contribution of the Pap test to screening translated to earlier detection of at most five cases per million women per year. Two-thirds (67.9%) of women found to have cancer up to 10 years of follow-up at Kaiser Permanente were detected by the first cotest performed.\n\nThe researchers conclude that the added sensitivity of cotesting versus HPV alone for detection of treatable cancer affected extremely few women.?\n\nThe paper \"Relative Performance of HPV and Cytology Components of Cotesting in Cervical Screening\" is available at: https:/\n\nTo request a copy of the study, please contact: Daniel Luzer\n\n daniel.luzer@oup.com", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There was no disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Every healthy newborn in the United States should receive a new vaccine designed to protect against an intestinal germ called rotavirus, a federal advisory panel decided yesterday as it set aside theoretical concerns about the vaccine's safety.\n\nThe decision means that pediatricians are likely to recommend three doses of the oral vaccine for nearly every child at age 2 months, 4 months and 6 months, beginning almost immediately. The vaccine won approval from the Food and Drug Administration on Feb. 3, and some doctors have received supplies of it.\n\nThe recommendation for universal use of the vaccine was approved at a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the federal panel that sets vaccination policy in the United States.

Even the IUD can't stay in place for more than 10 years.\n\nThe only once-and-be-done-with-it option for women has been tubal ligation (\"tying the tubes\") -- surgery that renders a woman sterile. Now a procedure called Essure, recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, gives women an alternative. The nonsurgical approach uses a hysteroscope -- a camera-tipped instrument -- to thread two small wires through the vagina, cervix and uterus and into the fallopian tubes. The wires, composed of polyester fibers and metals, cause inflammation and, over time, scar tissue that blocks the fallopian tubes, preventing sperm from reaching eggs. Women can undergo the procedure in 35 minutes in their doctor's office, under local anesthesia; they are advised to rest for 24 to 48 hours before resuming normal activity. Essure is 99.8 percent effective in preventing pregnancy -- a rate similar to that of tubal ligation, according to the manufacturer, Conceptus Inc. of Mountain View, Calif.\n\nPros and Cons Ellen Whitaker, a gynecologist at the Washington Hospital Center, says \"the biggest advantage\" of Essure is that it involves no incisions or general anesthesia, which both carry risks. By going through the vagina, she says, you \"avoid all the organs in the abdomen.\" In a tubal ligation, she says, \"there's always the possibility of bowel injury, bladder injury . . . which can be very serious.\"\n\nThe biggest drawback, Whitaker says, is the need for X-rays three months after the procedure to confirm the fallopian tubes are blocked. Until then, the patient must use another form of birth control.\n\nSide effects may include pain, cramps and mild bleeding or spotting.

Neither had a painful bone-marrow transplant nor an experimental treatment. Her careworn father cried in the shower to hide his anguish. Her mother couldn\u2019t help but wonder, \u201cWhy is this happening to our child?\u201d\n\nBut Ava was fortunate in one respect. Discoveries in the burgeoning field of immunotherapy are offering lifelines to desperate patients who previously had none. \u201cFive years ago,\u201d said her mother, Bethany Christianson, \u201cour doctor would have just had to tell us to go home.\u201d\n\nInstead, in a five-minute procedure at the NIH Clinical Center in late July, the freckle-face girl got another chance to beat the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that has stalked her since age 4. She was infused with 30 million of her own T cells, a key part of the immune system, that had been genetically modified to track down and kill her cancer like a pack of crazed dogs.\n\nAva\u2019s treatment, called CAR T-cell therapy, is one of the new immunotherapies that attempt to rally the body\u2019s own defenses to fight malignancies. Unlike other cancer advances, it is being tested widely in children because of its stunning effectiveness in ALL, the most common pediatric cancer. In early-stage trials, many patients who had repeatedly relapsed saw their leukemia disappear. Some remain cancer-free.\n\nYet big questions surround the therapy, and many scientists are urging caution. \u201cThere\u2019s very real promise with this approach, but the immune system is complicated,\u201d said Terry Fry, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) scientist who is running Ava\u2019s trial. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that still needs to be worked out.\u201d\n\n[Here\u2019s what you need to know about immunotherapy]\n\nComplications can be lethal; one clinical trial was briefly halted in July after three young adults died of brain swelling. It is also far from clear that such a personalized approach \u2014 possibly costing hundreds of thousands of dollars \u2014 is economically viable on a large scale or will produce the lasting remissions that everyone hopes to see.\n\nU.S. researchers running CAR T-cell trials for children and adults with leukemia and lymphoma have reported remission rates up to 90 percent in some cases. That\u2019s a major achievement in a group whose cancer is emboldened by every treatment failure. But rates in other trials are considerably lower, and many patients eventually relapse.\n\n\u201cThe treatment is great about getting people into remission but not at keeping everyone in remission,\u201d said Rebecca Gardner, a pediatric oncologist at Seattle Children\u2019s hospital. She ran an early-stage trial using CAR T-cell therapy in which 39 of 42 patients went into complete remission. By a year, about half had relapsed, either because their T cells had inexplicably disappeared or their cancer had changed so that the T cells could no longer recognize it. \u201cLeukemia is really smart,\u201d she said.\n\nAva\u2019s family understands that better than most. She underwent her first CAR T-cell procedure in Minnesota last year, but her leukemia returned within six months. Her treatment at NIH involved a next-generation version, developed by NCI, that used a different target for her marauding T cells. In this first-in-humans trial, she is Patient No. 18.\n\nIn late August, the Christiansons learned that Ava had gone into remission. She and her mother, who were still at the Clinical Center in Bethesda, Md., gleefully rushed home to Wisconsin so Ava could start third grade.\n\nHer parents, so frequently disappointed, remain guardedly optimistic. \u201cHope is all you have,\u201d said her father, Jay Christianson.\n\nHer mother added, \u201cWe just need this to work and to stay working.\u201d\n\nNCI\u2019s Fry is careful not to make any promises about an extended remission. \u201cI can\u2019t say that\u2019s going to be the case,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause we just don\u2019t know. It\u2019s too soon.\u201d\n\nScientists have wanted for decades to marshal the immune system to vanquish cancer, but their attempts have mostly been frustrated. In the past few years, however, breakthroughs have led to the development of two types of immunotherapy \u2014 checkpoint inhibitors and CAR T cells \u2014 that are generating enormous excitement.\n\nCheckpoint inhibitors are off-the-shelf therapies aimed at unleashing the immune system\u2019s power to see and attack the disease. Used mostly in adults, to date, they are producing impressive results, albeit in a minority of cases. The most prominent: Jimmy Carter. The former president became the poster patient when he was successfully treated last year with a checkpoint inhibitor called Keytruda, along with surgery and radiation, for his advanced melanoma.\n\nMuch of the earliest research for customized CAR T-cell therapy was conducted at NCI, the University of Pennsylvania, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Seattle Children\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThe technology of CAR T cells is really a breakthrough, especially for children,\u201d said Michael Jensen, director of the Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research at Seattle Children\u2019s Research Institute.\n\nAlmost all the initial work focused on CD19, a protein found on the surface of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Scientists figured out ways to use a chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, to reprogram T cells to recognize the protein and kill the cancer.\n\n[Immunotherapy is showing benefits in an increasing number of cancers]\n\nZane Esposito, a 13-year-old from Plano, Tex., calls himself the \u201cT-Cell Explorer.\u201d He was diagnosed with ALL in June 2010. \u201cI just thought my back hurt,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t walk up the steps very well.\u201d Almost three years of treatment, including punishing chemotherapy, provided a couple of years of remission. His leukemia returned in January, and this time it did not respond to treatment.\n\nSoon after Zane relapsed, he and his father bumped into friends in a local doughnut shop who told them about a TV segment on CAR T-cell therapy. Paul Esposito searched online and found Gardner\u2019s clinical trial in Seattle. Zane signed on, got the treatment, went back into full remission and gained 25 pounds.\n\nHis Texas doctors have talked about a bone-marrow transplant to increase the chance of a true cure, but the Espositos have resisted. The Seattle doctors say it is not clear yet whether that is necessary or whether there would be still other options should Zane\u2019s cancer recur.\n\nZane is moving on, with dreams of competing on \u201cChopped Junior\u201d to show off his homemade pasta and pizza. On July 27, the day that Ava got her T cells, he celebrated his 13th birthday.\n\nAva was 4 when she started having leg pains, then trouble standing up. Her mother suspected Lyme disease. \u201cYou never think of cancer with a child,\u201d she said, eyes filling as she recalled her daughter\u2019s cancer diagnosis in November 2012. The doctors assured the family that it was typical leukemia \u2014 and curable.\n\nLike most children, Ava quickly went into remission after starting the prescribed 30 months of chemotherapy. But at home in Prescott, a small Wisconsin city at the confluence of the Mississippi and St. Croix rivers, things did not get easier for the Christiansons. In early 2013, Ava was hospitalized in Minneapolis for a lung infection. About the same time, the couple\u2019s second daughter, Audrey, was born 13 weeks premature and hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit in St. Paul. Bethany, who manages occupational therapists for a nursing-home chain, and Jay, a rural mail carrier, shuttled between the Twin Cities visiting their daughters.\n\n\u201cI would be with Ava during the day, and then when Jay got home, he would stay with Ava, and I would spend time with Audrey,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter what you do, you feel like a bad mom.\u201d\n\nA year or so after treatment began, Ava relapsed. Now she was in a much more dangerous category: children whose leukemia no longer responds to chemo. Her doctors arranged for a bone-marrow transplant, with her baby sister as the donor.\n\nThe transplant made her sick and the whole family miserable. Ava spent months in the hospital and then a year at home. Because of fears of infection, she couldn\u2019t go out much. She missed all of first grade. But her parents had hope that the transplant would keep her cancer at bay.\n\n[Brain cancer now the leading cause of cancer deaths in children]\n\nAt a six-month checkup, tests showed that the leukemia was back again. There were no more conventional treatments to try. But because of her two relapses, Ava was now eligible for a CAR T-cell trial at the University of Minnesota Masonic Children\u2019s Hospital. Her T cells would be genetically altered to go after CD19.The number of cells then would be vastly increased and reinfused.\n\nIt sounded like science fiction, but Bethany Christianson found comfort in talking to the father of Emily Whitehead. In 2012, the 6-year-old Pennsylvania girl became the first child to be treated with reprogrammed T cells for leukemia. She has been in remission ever since.\n\nAva got her treatment in April 2015 \u2014 after her cells were extracted via a tube inserted into her neck \u2014 and five days later had a massive immune reaction with a high fever and intense pain. While that is typical, some patients become dangerously ill. Yet Ava recovered fast, went into remission and attended summer school, where she learned how to make pigs-in-a-blanket and wrote her own cookbook.\n\nBy then, her parents had gotten used to living in the midst of remissions and relapses. \u201cWhen she felt better, we would do everything we could,\u201d Bethany said. They visited Robot World, a scientifically themed attraction a few hours from Prescott. \u201cYou don\u2019t put things off, because you are always thinking, \u2018What if?\u2019 \u201d\n\nLast fall, doctors delivered the bad news. Ava\u2019s cancer had changed. It was no longer producing the CD19 protein, which meant her modified T cells could no longer recognize the disease. But the leukemia was still producing another common protein, called CD22, and that offered an opportunity.\n\nAs it happened, Fry, head of the blood-cancer section in NCI\u2019s pediatric oncology branch, had already launched the world\u2019s first trial using CAR T-cell therapy to focus on CD22. It seemed an equally promising target that could broaden the therapy\u2019s impact, researchers thought. At the time, they did not realize that a significant percentage of patients in the other trials might relapse because of changes in their cancer.\n\nFry insisted as he designed the study that children be included, despite ever-present concerns about exposing them to safety risks. He wanted to avoid a delay in testing what could be a lifesaving pediatric treatment. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to take two to three years on adults, and then go back and do children,\u201d he said.\n\n[For a 6-year-old with cancer, a future staked on medicine\u2019s hottest field]\n\nThe clinical trial already has treated nearly two dozen leukemia and lymphoma patients through age 30. The majority have gone into remission, although some have had their cancer return. While it is far too early to know long-term outcomes, Fry said he is convinced the CD22 treatment holds much potential. He is planning another trial next year with the Stanford University School of Medicine. It will target both proteins \u2014 CD19 and CD22 \u2014 simultaneously.\n\nOnce Ava relapsed after the Minnesota trial, Fry\u2019s study at the NIH Clinical Center appeared to be the only option. But there was no slot immediately available. With Ava deteriorating, doctors put her on an experimental treatment that sent her into remission but had serious side effects.\n\nThey immediately stopped the medication when they learned Ava might get her T-cell therapy in January \u2014 she actually needed a high level of leukemia in her body to participate. But on this wrenching roller coaster of research and treatment, it turned out that she still had to wait several more months.\n\nAva\u2019s cancer returned in June. Her T cells were extracted in preparation for the trial, even as she got sicker and sicker.\n\nShe was admitted to the Clinical Center in mid-July, to a room with dancing penguins painted on the windows. The day before her therapy, an ebullient Audrey burst into the room and the two sisters ran down the hall to a play space.\n\nHer mother was ready this time for the intense immune reaction that followed treatment, although she still found it hard to watch Ava spike a fever of 106. \u201cWhen you see that temperature on the thermometer, every bone in your body says it\u2019s wrong to let it get that high,\u201d Bethany said. \u201cThen suddenly it\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nIf his daughter\u2019s cancer returns yet again, \u201cI have no idea what we\u2019ll do,\u201d Jay said. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of up against the edge.\u201d\n\nFry thinks she might be able to undergo a second round of her latest immunotherapy, as long as her cancer is still producing CD22 proteins. Doctors in Minnesota also might recommend a second bone-marrow transplant \u2014 something her parents dread, saying it was the roughest treatment of all.\n\nFor now, Ava is happily back in school. \u201cI just want her to be a kid,\u201d Bethany Christianson said. \u201cShe has missed out on a lot of that.\u201d", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering here.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "People with Type 2 diabetes get an earful of grim lectures about their health prospects and endure much hardship to manage their condition well.

In effect, you\u2019re trading one problem (addiction) for another (undertreatment of chronic pain).\n\nA new study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, however, offers a cause for optimism: Reviewing the research so far, it found that it may be possible to reduce doses for patients in long-term opioid therapy and improve their pain outcomes. So doctors can potentially pull back the opioids that launched the current drug overdose crisis and still successfully treat pain patients.\n\nNow, by this latest study\u2019s own admission, the evidence is of generally poor quality. Most of the studies reviewed were of poor methodology or sample size, while only a few were of \u201cfair\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d quality. The review also only looked at patients who volunteered to taper off opioids, meaning this research does not prove that involuntarily pulling patients off the drugs will lead to similar outcomes.\n\nSuffice to say, then, a lot more research is necessary before this issue is settled.\n\nBut the new study does offer a glimmer of hope in a fairly grim opioid epidemic: Maybe it is possible to reduce the amount of dangerous opioids that patients are consuming and still alleviate people\u2019s pain.\n\nFor the latest review of the evidence, researchers looked at 67 studies that collectively provided data on more than 12,000 pain patients who were weaned off at least some opioids. Though the researchers found a lot of studies to pool from, they generally graded these studies as \u201cvery low\u201d in quality and methodology.\n\nResearchers then identified the studies \u2014 none of which were graded as \u201cgood\u201d quality \u2014 that evaluated pain-related outcomes for patients after long-term opioid therapy was tapered. Focusing on the \u201cfair-quality\u201d studies, they found that after opioid dose reductions, patients on average saw improved pain, function, and quality of life.\n\nThe authors provide a few possible explanations for this: Perhaps the non-opioid pain treatments, such as physical therapy and meditation, that accompanied dose reductions simply produced better results than the opioids did. Maybe the opioids themselves caused problems that negatively impacted function or quality of life, \u201csuch as constipation, fatigue, poor sleep, and depressed mood.\u201d It\u2019s possible that opioid dose reduction also resolved what\u2019s known as opioid-induced hyperalgesia, \u201ca paradoxical response in which patients receiving opioids become more sensitive to painful stimuli.\u201d\n\nOr, the researchers suggested, the observational studies simply showed reverse causation \u2014 \u201cthat is, patients successfully tapered opioids because pain severity decreased.\u201d\n\nThe findings do not mean that doctors can now simply yank patients off opioids and expect them to get better. For one, the reviewed studies generally looked at the results of tapering, when patients are slowly weaned off opioid painkillers \u2014 a process that, Stanford psychiatrist Anna Lembke told me, can take months or even years.\n\nCrucially, the studies also looked at what happened when these reductions in opioid doses were paired with alternative treatments, including alternative medicines like acupuncture, interdisciplinary pain programs, and medication-assisted treatment for addiction. This is very, very different from a situation in which a patient is taken off opioids and effectively left stranded without any other form of care.\n\nAs the researchers readily admit, the study also had several major limitations. Most of the studies analyzed were of poor quality \u2014 meaning there\u2019s a serious need for better research in this area. And the studies only evaluated voluntary reductions in opioid doses; it\u2019s entirely possible that involuntary reductions in opioid doses would lead to sharply different outcomes.\n\n\u201cWe should be cautious in interpreting the findings,\u201d Joseph Frank, lead author of the study, told me. He emphasized that more research needs to be done to fill \u201cimportant gaps\u201d in our knowledge. He added, \u201cI want patients and their doctors to use caution in applying this.\u201d\n\nA few pain patients will still benefit from opioids\n\nOne of the study\u2019s implications is that opioids actually aren\u2019t a good treatment for chronic pain. This isn\u2019t new. As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded in its 2016 summary of the research, there are simply no good long-term studies looking at the effects of opioids on long-term pain outcomes, while there are many studies showing that long-term opioid use can lead to bad results in other areas, including addiction and overdose.\n\nThat does not mean opioids are never an effective treatment for chronic pain.\n\nAs addiction and pain experts often tell me, health care can vary vastly from patient to patient. Some patients feel worse on opioids, while others report quick pain relief. Some patients experience grueling withdrawal if taken off opioids, while for others the symptoms are much less severe. Some patients are at unusually high risk for addiction, while many \u2014 most, in fact \u2014 aren\u2019t. And so on.\n\nIn a few cases, then, opioids will still be the best answer for some individual chronic pain patients. When prescribed carefully on a schedule that works to diminish the excessive buildup of tolerance, they can work for some people. But as Stanford pain specialist Sean Mackey emphasized to me, opioids should not be a first-line treatment due to the risks, and alternatives should be tried first.\n\nThis, then, is another key caveat to the study: Its findings shouldn\u2019t be applied to every patient. Like much of health care, each case will typically require individual evaluations to see what works.\n\n\u201cThere are people who do well with tapering [opioids],\u201d Stefan Kertesz, an addiction researcher at the University of Alabama Birmingham who was not involved in the study, told me. \u201cThere are people who do not do well with tapering.\u201d\n\nBut the study suggests that getting some patients off opioids could improve their pain outcomes. The key is convincing patients that this truly can work so they buy into the treatment and genuinely follow through with it \u2014 and making non-opioid treatments for pain accessible enough that patients see them as realistic options.\n\nAlternative pain treatments need to be made more accessible\n\nThe reality, though, is non-opioid pain treatments are often out of reach for many Americans. Patients may not have insurance to cover the treatment. Even if they do have insurance, their health plan might not cover comprehensive pain care. And even if they do have insurance and their health plan covers pain treatments, there may not \u2014 particularly in rural areas \u2014 be a nearby pain clinic or doctor who can actually provide the care these patients are seeking.\n\nThis is something the study\u2019s authors readily acknowledge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an important part of this challenge,\u201d Frank said. \u201cThese non-opioid strategies that were tested in these research studies are not adequately available. Several of the studies were done in pain centers where they have expert programs, and those just are not widespread.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the lack of access to non-opioid strategies may be one big reason that doctors resorted to opioids in the first place. The drugs offered an easy answer \u2014 if ultimately an ineffective one \u2014 to the many problems doctors faced, including patients who had complicated pain problems that physicians didn\u2019t fully understand and tight schedules driven by the current demands of the health care system that made it hard to take the time to work through a patient\u2019s individual problems. (More on all that in my interview with Lembke.)\n\nTo address this, Frank argued that patients need better access to pain treatments. And doctors, especially primary care doctors who are frequently the first people patients see in the health care system, also need to be better trained to deal with chronic pain.\n\nThese solutions could help a lot of people: According to one study from the Institute of Medicine, 100 million US adults suffer from chronic pain. The opioid epidemic shows that if this care isn\u2019t made available, patients may end up resorting to drugs that can literally get them killed \u2014 or, as has been reported in other tragic cases, they may kill themselves once the pain grows too bad. (The newest study, however, noted that there is no good research yet looking at these two potential outcomes if pain patients are taken off opioids.)\n\n\u201cNot only do we lack the data, but I have seen and heard of countless cases of overdose and suicide from people who have been involuntarily discontinued,\u201d Kertesz said, emphasizing this is strictly based on anecdotal observations. \u201cOne day in June, in my inbox were 42 deaths.\u201d\n\nThe findings show the balancing act of opioid policy: Even if doctors need to pull back opioids, they must be careful to ensure patients suffering from debilitating pain and other problems can still meet their other care needs.\n\nIt\u2019s not just pain care. When dealing with opioid users who are addicted, doctors and policymakers also need to ensure that addiction treatment is available. Otherwise, these patients will likely try to find another source of drugs \u2014 even if it means resorting to a riskier opioid, such as heroin or fentanyl, to satisfy their cravings.\n\nThere\u2019s good evidence this happened to many \u2014 but not all \u2014 opioid painkiller users: A 2014 study in JAMA Psychiatry found 75 percent of heroin users in treatment started with painkillers, and a 2015 analysis by the CDC found people who are addicted to painkillers are 40 times more likely to be addicted to heroin.\n\nThe fundamental problem is many of these patients don\u2019t get addiction treatment once they lose access to painkillers or before they progress to heroin or fentanyl. Without the option of treatment, opioid users\u2019 only answer to averting dependence-induced withdrawal becomes harder drugs. Yet based on a 2016 report by the surgeon general, only 10 percent of Americans with drug use disorders get specialty treatment.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that reducing prescriptions is a mistake. By stopping doctors from unscrupulously prescribing the drugs, governments can potentially stop opioids from flowing to new users who didn\u2019t really need the drugs and could have developed addictions had they been allowed to get painkillers.\n\nBut the reduction has to be paired with increased access to addiction care \u2014 and it frequently hasn\u2019t been.\n\nBeyond addiction treatment, Kertesz argued that policymakers should also address some of the underlying conditions that drive addiction. He emphasized the need for broader mental health care, given that people often have mental health issues that can make addiction more likely.\n\n\u201cWho is at higher risk \u2014 John with PTSD and a dose of 10 milligrams a day, or James, who has no PTSD and is on 200 milligrams a day?\u201d Kertesz said. Based on his reading of the data, \u201cit\u2019s John with PTSD on the 10 milligrams.\u201d\n\nBut as is true for addiction and pain treatments, adequate mental health care is also out of reach for many patients \u2014 showing just another way that the US health care system isn\u2019t built to adequately address the full needs of patients.\n\nAll of this shows why the policy solution to the opioid epidemic isn\u2019t as easy as simply pulling back prescription opioids: To avoid exacerbating existing problems or causing new ones, policymakers need to consider the other needs of people who were perhaps getting opioids they didn\u2019t really need.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "We didn\u2019t see any gratuitous wording about the opioid epidemic or treating painkiller addiction in this story.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Science doesn\u2019t just help to invent new products, it can push existing ones.\n\nLook no further than the beauty industry. It does lots of testing and flaunts products with scientific terms like microbeads, enzymes and rejuvenating serums. But what are the data behind them? And what if the company selling the product did the tests?\n\nTake Inneov Sun Sensitivity, a nutritional supplement \u201cclinically proven\u201d to protect your skin from the sun\u2019s harmful UV rays while leaving you with a nice tan, according to its maker Laboratoires Inneov, a joint venture between L\u2019Oreal and Nestle.\n\nThe pill combines lycopene and beta-carotene \u2014 the red and orange substances in tomatoes and carrots, respectively \u2014 with a probiotic reported to impact the skin\u2019s response to UV light.\n\n\u201cThe efficacy of our nutritional supplement was demonstrated by rigorous studies,\u201d said Nathalie Piccardi, of Laboratoires Inneov, who worked on the study.\n\n\u201cThe next step is to present this product to dermatologists,\u201d she told Reuters Health, noting it has already been launched in Europe and South America.\n\nBut a closer look reveals some shaky science, said Dr. Peter Schalock, a dermatologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who isn\u2019t affiliated with Laboratoires Inneov.\n\n\u201cScientifically there are no data there,\u201d he said about one of the company\u2019s experiments. \u201cIt sounds like opinion and nothing more.\u201d\n\nThe only published data on the tanning pill\u2019s ability to reduce sunburns came out last month in the British Journal of Dermatology. To test the pill, scientists had dozens of women expose their behinds or backs to strong UV light. They found an effect on immune cells in the skin, but the question was, would the women also get fewer sunburns and better tans?\n\nTo answer that, Laboratoires Inneov conducted a so-called randomized controlled trial \u2014 the most powerful kind of study in the scientific toolbox \u2014 in which women were randomly assigned to take Inneov Sun Sensitivity or a placebo pill.\n\nBut the researchers never compared the response directly between the two groups, the whole point of a randomized controlled trial. Instead, they used a weaker method comparing the before-and-after differences within each group.\n\nWhile Piccardi said she thought this method was appropriate, it means the company can\u2019t claim women taking their product had a higher threshold for sunburns than those taking a placebo pill. The same goes for the tan.\n\nAs a result, said Schalock, the company\u2019s claim that women taking their product can sunbathe with less concern of getting burned might be a stretch.\n\nSchalock told Reuters Health he has a \u201chard time seeing that statistically or scientifically they have proven it.\u201d\n\nThe fact that the company did the testing itself could also raise a red flag.\n\n\u201cThere is some evidence to indicate that we are right to be concerned about the quality of research when there is a conflict of interest,\u201d said Josephine Johnston, a bioethicist at the Hastings Center in Garrison, New York.\n\nJohnston, who said she could not speak to the scientific merits of the Inneov report, said other studies had shown industry-funded research is more likely to have positive outcomes, and that people could be influenced by financial interests even if they didn\u2019t realize it.\n\n\u201cThe major problem,\u201d she told Reuters Health, \u201cis that it has an impact of trustworthiness.\u201d\n\nBranding personal care products with clinical claims is a very common strategy, an expert who studies consumer marketing told Reuters Health.\n\n\u201cClaiming that kind of a benefit is certainly something people respond to,\u201d said the expert, a professor at an East Coast university who asked to remain anonymous because his institution receives funding from the cosmetics industry.\n\nWhile some people will want to see and feel an impact, he said, for many the clinical claim alone suffices. \u201cThe key question is, will the consumer view as credible that ingesting a pill will prevent (sun) damage?\u201d\n\nIn another experiment, Laboratoires Inneov scientists gave the tanning pill to 80 women and asked them to sunbathe as they normally would over the summer, applying sunscreen at their discretion.\n\nThen they asked dermatologists, recruited by a company paid by Laboratoires Inneov, a series of questions about how these women fared. According to the report, the dermatologists told Laboratoires Inneov the product prevented sunburns.\n\n\u201cWe truly believed that this kind of study, taking into account consumers\u2019 opinion, complements experimental and control studies,\u201d said Piccardi.\n\nBut the study did not answer a number of questions: How did the women usually do in the summer? Did they end up like boiled lobsters or were they careful not to get burned? Might they have been extra cautious because they were part of a skin protection study?\n\n\u201cIt would have been nice to really know that it worked, and that it\u2019s not just a placebo effect,\u201d Schalock said.\n\nHe pointed out it was hard to draw any conclusions from this part of the study because it didn\u2019t include any data. What kind of evaluations did the dermatologists do? What exactly did they tell Laboratoires Inneov?\n\nOf more than a dozen researchers and dermatologists contacted about the quality of this study, only Schalock agreed to comment.\n\nDr. Tobias W. Fischer, a dermatologist at the University Lubeck in Germany, offered this rationale for why he didn\u2019t: \u201cI don\u2019t give interviews, criticizing other researchers\u2019 work, even if industrial.\u201d\n\nThe editor of the journal that published the study, Dr. Tanya Bleiker, said it had been reviewed by experts before acceptance, as are all the journal\u2019s reports.\n\nWhile there had been some concerns about the methods, \u201con balance there was enough interest to publish it,\u201d she told Reuters Health.\n\nThe journal does ask researchers if they have financial ties to the products they are studying. According to Bleiker, \u201cthe authors stated very clearly that there was no conflict of interest.\u201d\n\nHowever, more than half of the authors work for Laboratoires Inneov, as indicated on the cover page of the report.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t being hidden that they worked for the company,\u201d Johnston told Reuters Health. \u201cThe journal knew it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question for the journal, given that the authors worked for the company, is, \u2018Do we publish something like that?\u2019\u201d\n\nJohnston said there was an ongoing debate about whether or not scientists who review studies should know about potential industry interests.\n\nThe question then becomes what, if anything, to do when there is a conflict of interest.\n\n\u201cThe reader can\u2019t do anything,\u201d said Johnston. \u201cIt needs to be done by people higher up in the food chain.\u201d\n\nWhether or not Inneov Sun Sensitivity has been \u201cclinically proven\u201d to protect against sunburns, \u201cWe have to deal with the fact that the scientific literature contains research from people with financial conflicts,\u201d Johnston said.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The opposite of disease mongering, pointing out how \"branding personal care products with clinical claims is a very common strategy.\"\u00a0 ", "answer": 1}, {"article": "FRIDAY, Jan. 21, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Americans suffering from muscle pain are used to taking a pill or rubbing in a cream to help soothe their aches.\n\nBut a new form of pain relief seems to be catching on: analgesics delivered through a medicated patch placed directly where it hurts.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the country's first over-the-counter, pain-relieving transdermal patches in 2008. But the patches, marketed under the brand name Salonpas, are nothing new. They've been sold in various countries in Asia since the 1930s, according to their manufacturer, the Japanese firm Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical.\n\n\"Salonpas is the Western world catching up with Asia,\" said Dr. Rick Rosenquist, a professor of anesthesia and director of pain medicine at the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine and chairman of the American Society of Anesthesiologists' committee on pain medicine.\n\n\"If you are an Asian kid, you've had these placed on you since time immemorial,\" he said. \"It's just now starting to hit more mainstream in the United States. They're gaining more acceptance.\"\n\nBefore the FDA action, pain-relieving patches were available in the United States only by prescription, said Dr. John Dombrowski, director of the Washington Pain Center in Washington, D.C. Their active ingredients include such medications as lidocaine, capsaicin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. The active ingredients in Salonpas are methyl salicylate and menthol, common components of pain-relieving gels and creams, such as Bengay.\n\nPain patches have a number of benefits, Rosenquist and Dombrowski said, not the least of which is convenience. With a patch, you \"put [it] on and forget about it, rather than having to remember to take pills,\" Dombrowski said.\n\nThe patches also deliver their medicine directly to the site of a person's pain. This may eliminate some of the side effects that come with taking pills. For instance, some analgesics are likely to cause an upset stomach unless they're taken with food. \"Obviously, patches get around that,\" he said. \"It's a very clever way of getting the medications right where they need to be.\"\n\nAnd, because patches release their medication slowly into the body through the skin, people also should get more consistent pain relief than they do with pills.\n\nOn the other hand, people have to be sure to carefully follow instructions for using the patches, to avoid overdose.\n\nThe main downside to pain patches, however, apparently comes from their effect on the skin. Some people may find themselves allergic to either the active ingredient in a patch or the adhesive used to keep the patch on the body.\n\n\"You need to pay attention when you put them on, to see if you have any kind of skin reaction to the compounds that are contained in the patch,\" Rosenquist said.\n\nBoth doctors said that they expect more over-the-counter pain patches to hit the market if the popularity of Salonpas continues to grow. Future over-the-counter options, they predicted, could include reduced-dosage versions of the NSAID-delivering patches now available through prescription.\n\n\"Success begets success,\" Dombrowski said. \"If this does very well, other drug companies will say, 'I want a piece of this action.'\"\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more about pain.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story may lead the reader to think minor aches deserve treatment with a medication when, in fact, they might not benefit from any medication.

But the standard PSA test cannot distinguish between cancers that grow so slowly they can safely be left alone and aggressive life-threatening tumors that call for surgery or radiation therapy.\n\nThe new test measures blood levels of three different types of PSA. Combined with annual biopsies, or tissue samples, it was about 70 percent accurate in singling out the aggressive tumors in a small study, John Hopkins University researchers were to report Sunday at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting, in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"What we have shown is that using the Prostate Health Index and tissue DNA measurement is informative in separating out patients whose cancers are likely to progress vs. those that are not likely to progress,\" said study leader Robert W.

It is the pro-PSA level that is most valuable as a predictor, Veltri said, but it is only one part of the study.\n\nThe new PSA test is given twice a year, along with a digital rectal exam to determine the size of the tumor, and a yearly biopsy. The regimen found unfavorable indications for 39 of the cancers -- meaning progression of cancer grade or tumor size -- and favorable for the 32 others, Veltri said. \"When you combine the DNA reading and the serum Prostate Health Index, it is accurate in about 7 out of 10 cases,\" he said.\n\nBut it was a small study, and \"it will take another year or two to get enough cases to nail down the predictive index,\" Veltri said.\n\nThe Hopkins group is trying to identify other biomarkers that would improve the program's predictive value, he said.

The comprehensive meta-analysis and assessment of human clinical trials, published in the official journal of the American Urological Association, The Journal of Urology\u00ae, assures practitioners and their patients that cranberry products are a low cost, low risk and effective way to help prevent recurrent UTIs.1\n\nTo answer the question, \"Can Cranberries Contribute to Reduce the Incidence of Urinary Tract Infections?\" a total of 28 studies showing results from nearly 5,000 patients were considered. Authors found a statistically significant risk reduction in repeat UTIs overall, but not significant for any particular subgroup. However, patients with recurrent UTIs who ingested cranberry products and had undergone gynecological surgery, experienced a significant reduction in UTIs.\n\n\"Our investigation supports that cranberry products can be a powerful tool to fight off frequent UTIs,\" explains lead author, Dr. \u00c2ngelo Lu\u00eds. \"While recommendations for dosage and duration of treatment require further study, the efficacy of the medicinal properties of cranberry products has been well-established.\"\n\nThe review explains that the medicinal properties of cranberries may be attributed to their unique polyphenol, proanthocyanidins - or PACs, for short. Their ability to keep infection-causing bacteria from sticking to the urinary tract walls may be the major reason for their effectiveness in limiting infection growth and recurrence.\n\nAccording to the authors, scientists and practitioners continue to explore the use of alternative therapies in the prevention of common infections as part of the global movement to reduce antibiotic use and resistance.

The sensitivity may also trigger or exacerbate headaches.\n\nWhile sunglasses can provide some relief from photophobia, wearing them all the time is not always a practical solution, nor is it pleasant for patients to live in a dark room for days at a time. A new study from the University of Cincinnati (UC), published online this week in the Journal of Athletic Training, assessed the use of colored lenses in post-concussion patients and found wearing certain color-tinted sunglasses may be a good alternative to dark sunglasses.\n\n\"While sunglasses can provide some relief, they are not very practical indoors or in low light environments,\" says Joe Clark, PhD, professor in the Department of Neurology and Rehabilitation Medicine at the UC College of Medicine and lead author of the study. \"What is needed is a light mitigation strategy that can be readily employed indoors, which can optimize relief in those who suffer from photophobia, or light sensitivity.\"\n\nClark and researchers at the College of Medicine assessed visual symptoms of 51 concussion patients and used frames with varying colored lenses to find out if certain hues provided relief from photophobia.\n\n\"We found that 85 percent of patients reporting photophobia had relief of the symptoms with one or more colors-- blue, green, red and purple--with no reported adverse events,\" Clark says.\n\n\"Sensitivity to light can be common and impact activities of daily life suggesting that light mitigation might improve quality of life in many of these patients. Photophobia is a common symptom for patients following traumatic brain injury. Our goal in this study was to provide medical staff like athletic trainers with a method and means to assess and subsequently provide relief to an athlete who may be experiencing symptoms of photophobia,\" Clark adds.\n\nThe goal is to help the concussion patient feel better as the brain heals. \"We compare the colored glasses to being like a brace or cast but for the brain,\" he says. \"It is temporary but prevents further injury or pain.\"\n\nAt least 3.8 million people in the United States sustain a concussion or traumatic brain injury every year, many not for the first time. As with many other health conditions, the presentation of concussion symptoms can vary greatly--while some individuals exhibit very little to no change in functionality and may report no symptoms at all, others may report confusion, headache, decreased balance and vision disturbances including blurry vision, trouble focusing and sensitivity to light.\n\nPhotophobia is so common that many neurosurgical intensive care units consider it standard operating procedure to keep lights dimmed in rooms containing TBI patients says Clark.\n\nIn addition to trying colored-lens sunglasses, the article suggests other ways to mitigate photophobia including wearing a wide-brimmed hat when outdoors, adjusting digital screen and device settings to an appropriate hue and brightness or purchasing filters for screens. However, the researchers noted, they do not recommend wearing colored glasses while driving. Certain colors make seeing stop lights or emergency vehicle lights difficult.\n\n\"We believe that an athletic trainer, in consultation with team physicians, may find it useful to apply this photophobia assessment and recommend colored glasses to his or her athlete,\" Clark says. \"The use of the colored glasses in the high school, college or other setting can allow a person to engage in some medically approved activities, while minimizing the risk of symptom exacerbation. We believe the use of the colored glasses that provide photophobia mitigation has added benefits superior to dark sunglasses, especially for indoor lighting.\"\n\nAdditional researchers on the study include Jon Divine, MD, a professor in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at the UC College of Medicine and head team physician for University of Cincinnati Athletics.\n\nThere was no funding used for this study.", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "We did not find any disease mongering in the piece.

There could be fewer fillings in your future. A painless way to prevent cavities in adults is gaining traction.\n\n\"OK, Alice, we are going to put the fluoride varnish on your teeth,\" says Marion Manski, director of the dental hygiene program at the University of Maryland School of Dentistry. Fluoride varnish is standard practice for children's teeth, but Manski's patient, Alice Clash, is 91 years old. Like many older patients, Clash is taking medications that cause dry mouth, which puts her at high risk for cavities.\n\nSo Manski takes a skinny brush and a little pot of yellowish liquid and paints the varnish on Clash's teeth. \"We know that saliva helps us wash away bacteria and food in the mouth,\" Manski says. \"The fluoride varnish will help that.\"\n\nOne way fluoride helps is by seeping into the enamel and drawing the calcium and phosphate that's naturally present in the saliva. The minerals boost the teeth's natural healing process and make them more resistant to future decay. But there are other theories about how fluoride works. It strengthens the enamel before the tooth erupts, which is why it's so important for children. And it attacks the acid-producing bacteria in the mouth. One study shows fluoride makes it more difficult for these bacteria to stick to the teeth.\n\nIt takes about a minute, and the fluoride treatment is done. Some patients are also given a prescription for a concentrated fluoride gel that can be used at night.\n\n\"These preventative approaches work on adults just as well as they do on children,\" says Norman Tinanoff, a professor of pediatric dentistry at the University of Maryland. He says part of what's making fluoride treatments popular for adults is a move to make dental care personal, with an individual treatment plan for each patient. To do that, you have to weigh a patient's risk of getting cavities.\n\nOne of the biggest proponents of this approach is John Featherstone, dean of the University of California, San Francisco School of Dentistry. Featherstone came up with a comprehensive way of measuring a person's risk for caries, or tooth decay. It includes testing the level of bacteria in the mouth, and looking at dietary habits, medical conditions, medications, saliva flow and history of tooth decay. When Featherstone put his patients on personal treatment plans, he found the strategy worked.\n\n\"It really proved that drilling and filling did not fix the disease,\" Featherstone says. \"Putting in a filling fixes that hole in the tooth, but it doesn't deal with the bacteria in the rest of the mouth.\" Most bacteria are friendly, but a couple of bad actors can cause cavities. These guys feed on sugars and expel acid that eats away at the enamel.\n\nTraditionally, dentists were taught that the only way to deal with decay was to drill it out. That's still important in some cases, Featherstone says, but without fixing the underlying problem of bad bacteria, patients just keep coming back for more fillings. Featherstone saw another way. \"It's a little bit like your car is starting to rust,\" he says. \"If you can stop the rust before the rust goes right through the body of the car, then you're in good shape.\"\n\nLike rust, tooth decay is a slow process. A full-on cavity is a hole that needs to be fixed. But if you catch decay early, Featherstone says, it can be reversed using fluoride treatments like varnish and concentrated toothpaste and gels.\n\n\"In the past we believed tooth decay was a rapidly progressive disease. But research shows it's slowly progressive,\" says Wendell Evans, associate professor of dentistry at the University of Sydney in Australia. He recently published a study that found using these techniques reduced the need for fillings in adults by 30 to 50 percent.\n\nStriking as these results seem, the concept isn't new. This shift to a preventive model of dentistry is decades in the making. \"Some of the stuff in our study has been known for 50 years,\" Evans says, referring to the use of fluoride treatments.\n\n\"Prevention has always been a part of the world of dentistry,\" says Richard Valachovic, president of the American Dental Education Association. \"What we're seeing is a generational shift,\" Valachovic says. As dentists have come to better understand the microbiology of the mouth, more effective preventive techniques have followed.\n\nBut cost has been an issue. Insurance companies routinely pay for fluoride treatments for children, but not so much for adults. The National Association of Dental Plans couldn't give a definitive answer about coverage, but calls to some individual carriers and dental offices suggest it depends entirely on the type of plan you have. Some higher-end plans cover two fluoride treatments per year, while cheaper plans tend not to cover any. If you pay out of pocket, a varnish treatment costs from $23 to $55, compared with a filling, which ranges from $86 to $606, according to the American Dental Association.\n\nCost could also be a factor for dentists. Featherstone and Wendell say some dentists may be reluctant to embrace the preventive methods because they worry they'll lose money if they they do fewer costly procedures.\n\nAt this point, Featherstone says, two-thirds of dental schools in the U.S. teach some kind of disease management model based on a thorough risk assessment. And he expects that at some point all dentists will follow a preventive protocol.\n\n\"It will happen,\" Featherstone says. \"It's just a matter of time.\"", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "Cavities in adults can cause serious health problems if left untreated, and any new effective treatment or trends in this area is worthy of press coverage.\nHowever, the studies\u00a0discussed\u00a0in the story focused on a relatively small group of people with unusually high risk of tooth decay\u2013and so these results may not apply to the adult population at large, which this piece implies.\n\u00a0", "answer": 1}, {"article": "THURSDAY, April 14, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- In the latest research to test the concept of an artificial pancreas for the management of type 1 diabetes, British researchers report that they were able to improve blood sugar control and reduce the risk of dangerous low blood sugars overnight.\n\nAn analysis of pooled data showed that the overall time that plasma glucose levels were in target \"increased by a median 28 percent\" with the artificial pancreas, said the study's lead author Roman Hovorka, a principal research associate at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom.\n\nHovorka's team is one of several working to produce an effective artificial pancreas, also known as a closed loop system or closed loop delivery.\n\nAn artificial pancreas combines existing diabetes management technology -- insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors -- with a sophisticated computer algorithm that tells these devices what to do when blood sugar levels are rising or falling.\n\nThe closed loop insulin delivery system, for example, computes insulin doses and administers them according to glucose levels detected by a sensor. The hope is that an artificial pancreas will closely mimic the way the human pancreas normally releases insulin in response to food or stress.\n\nAn effective artificial pancreas has the potential to vastly improve the lives of people with type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. The autoimmune attack destroys so many beta cells that someone with type 1 diabetes can no longer produce the insulin the body needs.\n\nInsulin is a hormone that's essential for the body to use sugar as fuel. Without replacement insulin, people with type 1 diabetes couldn't survive. But, replacing insulin isn't easy.\n\nWhile too little insulin can be deadly, too much insulin can also cause serious problems, and in the worst case, coma and death. Replacing insulin is a delicate balancing act, requiring constant blood sugar monitoring.\n\nPrevious research suggests that in a 24-hour period, the average person with type 1 diabetes spends about 10 hours with blood sugar levels too high, and about an hour a day with blood sugar levels too low, according to Aaron Kowalski, assistant vice president for treatment therapies at the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.\n\nThe current study included 24 people with type 1 diabetes and challenged an artificial pancreas prototype in two different real-life scenarios. The first trial was meant to mimic a night of eating at home, while the second trial was designed to simulate an evening out, including drinking alcohol, which can unpredictably lower blood sugar levels.\n\nFor the eating-in portion of the randomized study, 12 of the study volunteers were assigned to consume a medium-sized meal (60 grams of carbohydrates) at 7 p.m., and then another half were placed on the artificial pancreas program during the night, while the other half maintained their standard insulin pump therapy. Several weeks later, the participants came back for another meal and switched overnight regimens.\n\nThe second arm of the trial simulated a meal out. The other 12 volunteers were given a larger meal (100 grams of carbohydrate) at 8:30 p.m., and were dispensed white wine along with their meal. As with the other trial, half were managed with the artificial pancreas while the others used conventional insulin pump therapy.\n\nBoth groups were monitored twice overnight in each study.\n\n\"For the eating-in scenario, overnight closed loop delivery increased the time plasma glucose levels were in target by a median 15 percent,\" said Hovorka. For the eating out scenario, the average time good blood sugar control was increased was 28 percent on average. And, when combined, the average increase in blood sugar control was 22 percent, according to the study.\n\nOf greater concern to most people with type 1 diabetes is the ability to avoid low blood sugars while they're sleeping. The study found no serious low blood sugar events after midnight. There were four instances of severe hypoglycemia, but the researchers attributed three of them to insulin administered prior to the start of the study in the evening.\n\nResults were published online in the British Journal of Medicine on April 14.\n\nAlthough an accompanying journal editorial noted that the artificial pancreas is still \"in its infancy,\" some experts were cheered by the findings.\n\n\"This study is more good news, and we're seeing an evolution of more and more sophistication in this closed loop study,\" said Kowalski. \"What we're doing now is pressing these systems in real situations with the goal of getting to the next step of testing at home,\" he added.\n\nHovorka said his team is working on developing a home trial now, and hopes to begin home trials by the end of the year.\n\nLearn more about type 1 diabetes from the Nemours Foundation.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "We don\u2019t think the story intended to engage in disease-mongering, but the story is framed in such a way that the risk of renal failure following surgery is overly hyped.

But the men in this study had an average age of about 65, when the disease is less common and more likely to kill.\n\nWilliam B. Isaacs, a professor of urology and oncology at Johns Hopkins University and an author of the new report, said that if research validates what has been found, men may want to get the new genetic test when they are young, 35, say. Those at high risk because of their genetics might then choose to start prostate-cancer screening earlier than the usual age of about 50, using a blood test that looks for proteins secreted by prostate tumors.\n\n\u201cI think that makes sense,\u201d said Dr. Howard Sandler, a professor of radiation oncology at the University of Michigan and a spokesman for the American Society of Clinical Oncology.\n\nBut others worry that more frequent testing could exacerbate what is already a major problem: most prostate cancers grow so slowly that they would have been harmless if left alone.

How does it help them make decisions? And if they make a decision, does that lead to a day, a week, a month, of life saved?\u201d\n\nThe study, by scientists at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, the Harvard School of Public Health, and Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, will appear in the Feb. 28 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. It was released online on Wednesday, a journal spokeswoman said, because \u201cit is a very active area of research with a lot of competition.\u201d\n\nResearchers long knew that the disease often runs in families. Though scientists spent years looking for genes, they found none that were reproducibly associated with a marked effect.\n\nWith new technology to scan the entire length of a person\u2019s DNA, researchers tried a new approach. They began looking for small variations in tiny DNA regions that were associated with prostate cancer. That resulted in the discovery, by several groups of investigators in Iceland and the United States, of the gene variants, small alterations in gene sequences. Unlike traditional genetic links to disease, the variants are not mutations that destroy a gene\u2019s function. In fact, no one knows what their effect is.\n\nThe next step was to ask whether those variants really could predict who had prostate cancer. So Dr. Jianfeng Xu, a professor of epidemiology and cancer biology at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, and his colleagues studied a Swedish population of 2,893 men with prostate cancer and 1,781 men who did not have it. That led to their finding that each of the five variants independently predicted prostate cancer risk.\n\n\u201cEach confers a moderate risk,\u201d Dr. Xu said, adding that the effect of having just one of the variants \u2014 a 10 or 20 percent increase in a man\u2019s chance of having prostate cancer \u2014 was not enough to justify using a single variant for screening. But, he added, because each conferred an independent risk, the risks added up so that the more men had, the greater their risk. Then they found that family history of the cancer added an independent risk. \u201cThat was very, very surprising to us,\u201d Dr. Xu said.\n\nThe next step, Dr. Isaacs said, is to look in other populations. \u201cWe think that can happen almost instantaneously,\u201d he said, explaining how scientists have blood samples and family histories of thousands of men who were tested for prostate cancer.\n\nBut some said that if the test leads to more screening, it is not necessarily a good thing. There is already too much prostate-cancer screening, they say, resulting in too much treatment. \u201cTo me, it is a nightmare,\u201d Dr. Albertsen said. \u201cWe are just feeding off of this cancer phobia.\u201d\n\nWhat is needed, and what the new test does not provide, is a way to decide which cancers are dangerous and which are not, Dr. Isaacs said. Still, he said the new test could help patients if it was used with caution. \u201cWe may be premature with this idea \u2014 everyone has a different way of thinking about this \u2014 but it should not take five years to know if we are on the right track.

No link between overall flavonoid consumption and Parkinson\u2019s disease risk was found in women.\n\nBut when researchers looked at specific sub-groups of flavonoids, they found both men and women who ate the most foods rich in anthocyanins, which are found primarily in berries and apples, had a 22% lower risk of Parkinson\u2019s disease compared to those who ate the least.\n\nThe study doesn\u2019t prove that berries (or flavonoids in any other food) prevent Parkinson\u2019s disease. This was an observational study and therefore can\u2019t establish cause and effect. Nor is it clear why the results differed for men and women.\n\nThis study will be presented at a medical conference.

People who experience them see or hear things that are not there (hallucinations) and/or have false beliefs (delusions). The hallucinations and delusions experienced with Parkinson\u2019s disease are serious symptoms, and can lead to thinking and emotions that are so impaired that the people experiencing them may not relate to loved ones well or take appropriate care of themselves.\n\n\u201cHallucinations and delusions can be profoundly disturbing and disabling,\u201d said Mitchell Mathis, M.D., director of the Division of Psychiatry Products in the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \u201cNuplazid represents an important treatment for people with Parkinson\u2019s disease who experience these symptoms.\u201d\n\nAn estimated 50,000 Americans are diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease each year, according to the National Institutes of Health, and about one million Americans have the condition. The neurological disorder typically occurs in people over age 60, when cells in the brain that produce a chemical called dopamine become impaired or die. Dopamine helps transmit signals between the areas of the brain that produce smooth, purposeful movement -- like eating, writing and shaving. Early symptoms of the disease are subtle and occur gradually. In some people Parkinson\u2019s disease progresses more quickly than in others. As the disease progresses, the shaking, or tremor, which affects the majority of people with Parkinson\u2019s disease, may begin to interfere with daily activities. Other symptoms may include depression and other emotional changes; hallucinations and delusions; difficulty in swallowing, chewing, and speaking; urinary problems or constipation; skin problems; and sleep disruptions.\n\nThe effectiveness of Nuplazid was shown in a six-week clinical trial of 199 participants. Nuplazid was shown to be superior to placebo in decreasing the frequency and/or severity of hallucinations and delusions without worsening the primary motor symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nAs with other atypical antipsychotic drugs, Nuplazid has a Boxed Warning alerting health care professionals about an increased risk of death associated with the use of these drugs to treat older people with dementia-related psychosis. No drug in this class is approved to treat patients with dementia-related psychosis.\n\nIn clinical trials, the most common side effects reported by participants taking Nuplazid were: swelling, usually of the ankles, legs, and feet due to the accumulation of excessive fluid in the tissue (peripheral edema); nausea; and abnormal state of mind (confused state).\n\nNuplazid was granted for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Breakthrough therapy designation is a program designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint. The drug was also granted a priority review.

Combining data from 20 clinical trials, which included over 1,000 patients with chronic insomnia, the authors calculated sleep improvements after C.B.T. treatment, relative to no treatment. On average, treated patients fell asleep almost 20 minutes faster and were awake in the night almost half an hour less. The total amount of time that they were sleeping when in bed increased by nearly 10 percent. These results are similar to or better than improvements from many sleep drugs, and lasted longer.\n\nMy experience is consistent with these averages. The C.B.T. treatment I received, through an online program recommended by my doctor, also included keeping careful track of how much sleep I got each night. This proved very helpful. It demonstrated progress \u2014 the nights in which I got only four or five hours of sleep became less common, and, on average, my nights of sleep lengthened by 30 minutes. My sleep log also helped me be more objective. Many nights I might have considered \u201cbad\u201d \u2014 and fretted over \u2014 were ones in which I got only one hour less sleep than my target of seven hours. Recognizing that\u2019s not really so bad helped me relax, and relaxing helped me get more and better sleep.\n\nImprovements like mine and those reported in the study bring sleep statistics for those with insomnia quite close to those without it. This further emphasizes the point that many insomniacs aren\u2019t that different from normal sleepers. Many sleep fine most nights, but also have more frequent nights of insufficient sleep than normal sleepers would experience. A big part of the difference may be how insomniacs perceive their sleep performance and the negative messages they give themselves about their poor sleep and how it will affect their daily lives.\n\nC.B.T. practitioners learn that if you label a night of sleep \u201cbad\u201d and expect a bad day to follow a bad night of sleep, you\u2019re more likely to get it, as well as more likely to be anxious the next time you attempt to sleep. In this way, unless exacerbated by physical causes \u2014 like sleep apnea or restless leg syndrome \u2014 insomnia is a condition of the mind that then infects the body. Like a patch on faulty software, C.B.T. reorients one\u2019s thinking and behavior so that sleep is first thought to be, and then soon after actually is, a more positive experience. Drugs, on the other hand, just treat insomniacs\u2019 symptoms without addressing the underlying cause, which is why the relief they provide may be less durable.\n\nFor me, and many patients, C.B.T. works.

The findings of this project will play a crucial role in these efforts going forward.\n\nFunded by the Bowel Disease Research Foundation (BDRF) charity, the work has been published in the Lancet Oncology journal.\n\nThe study worked with data on more than 10,000 patients, examining whether current methods of checking if anal cancer has spread to lymph nodes are giving experts an accurate picture of survival rates. The research team was led from Manchester, working hand in hand with centres in Leeds and Switzerland.\n\nAnal cancer that has spread to lymph nodes is linked to a worse prognosis and lower chance of survival.\n\nThe project's findings however have uncovered a phenomenon suggesting rates of lymph node spread are being overestimated, potentially leading to overtreatment of patients with chemo radiotherapy.\n\nThis can result in damaging side-effects, and doctors are particularly keen to avoid it in cases where it offers little benefit to the patient at potentially great cost.\n\nThe results will be crucial to future large scale trials looking at optimum care for anal cancer patients.

The new findings show that black tea polyphenols, which are too large to be absorbed in the small intestine, stimulate the growth of gut bacterium and the formation of short-chain fatty acids, a type of bacterial metabolites that has been shown to alter the energy metabolism in the liver.\n\n\"It was known that green tea polyphenols are more effective and offer more health benefits than black tea polyphenols since green tea chemicals are absorbed into the blood and tissue,\" said Susanne Henning, the study's lead author and an adjunct professor at the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition, which is part of the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. \"Our new findings suggest that black tea, through a specific mechanism through the gut microbiome, may also contribute to good health and weight loss in humans.\"\n\n\"The results suggest that both green and black teas are prebiotics, substances that induce the growth of good microorganisms that contribute to a person's well-being,\" she said.\n\nIn the study, four groups of mice received different diets -- two of which were supplemented with green tea or black tea extracts:\n\nAfter four weeks, the weights of the mice that were given green or black tea extracts dropped to the same levels as those of the mice that received the low-fat diet throughout the study.\n\nThe researchers also collected samples from the mice's large intestines (to measure bacteria content) and liver tissues (to measure fat deposits). In the mice that consumed either type of tea extract, there was less of the type of bacteria associated with obesity and more of the bacteria associated with lean body mass.\n\nHowever, only the mice that consumed black tea extract had an increase in a type of bacteria called Pseudobutyrivibrio, which could help explain the difference between how black tea and green tea change energy metabolism.\n\nDr. Zhaoping Li, director of the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition, chief of the UCLA Division of Clinical Nutrition and the study's senior author, said the findings suggest that the health benefits of both green tea and black tea go beyond their antioxidant benefits, and that both teas have a strong impact on the gut microbiome.\n\n\"For black tea lovers, there may be a new reason to keep drinking it,\" she said.\n\nThe findings build on a 2015 UCLA study that demonstrated that both green tea and black tea helped prevent obesity in mice that consumed a high-fat, high-sugar diet.\n\nThe new study also concluded that both green tea and black tea have different effects on liver metabolism.

Honey also beat out no treatment at all.\n\n\"(Honey) is a cheap and effective treatment,\" said Dr. Ian Paul, lead investigator for the study. \"Consider using this as a treatment before going to the pharmacy to pick up an over-the-counter cough and cold medicine.\"\n\nHoney has long been used by some parents as an alternative treatment for cough, although it should not be given to children under 1 year old.\n\nThe study comes at a time when parents are on the lookout for new ways to give sick children relief. A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended last month that children under the age of 6 not be given over-the-counter cough and cold medicines.\n\nFor the study, 105 children ages 2-18 with upper respiratory tract infections that kept them awake at night were given either a dose of buckwheat honey, honey-flavored cough syrup or no treatment half an hour before bedtime.\n\nOne dose measured one-half teaspoon for children aged 2-5, one teaspoon for children aged 6-11 and two teaspoons for children aged 12-18.\n\nParents of the 35 children who received honey, given either on its own or with a non-caffeinated drink, reported they coughed less and slept better than those who gave their children nothing. The group that used honey also reported more favorable results than those who used cough syrup, but since the study group was small, those differences weren't statistically significant.\n\nOne local pediatrician said she wouldn't discourage parents from trying honey with their children, but more studies are needed to draw solid conclusions.\n\n\"In older children, if it makes them comfortable and it helps them sleep at night, then there may be a potential benefit,\" said Dr. Sara Rizvi, assistant professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine who also works at a primary care clinic at Texas Children's Hospital. \"I would be reluctant to routinely recommend to all parents that they give honey, because in some rare cases children can have reactions to honey.\"\n\nPaul, a pediatrician who practices at Penn State Children's Hospital and teaches at the university's College of Medicine, said he began the study because he was frustrated no treatment had been proven beneficial to relieve the common children's cough. Several years ago, he led another study that showed over-the-counter cough medicine was no more effective than placebos.\n\nHoney is not only cheap and readily available, it's also generally safer than cough medicine, which can have side effects or be administered in the wrong dose.\n\nHoney should not, however, be given to children under the age of 1 because it sometimes contains a bacteria that causes botulism, a rare paralytic illness that can result in death. Unlike older children, infants can't fight the bacteria.\n\nPaul's group tested buckwheat honey instead of the lighter, more popular varieties because it's known to have more antioxidant and antimicrobial effects, which have been shown in other studies to help wounds heal. Honey may suppress cough because its sweetness causes salivation that coats the throat, authors of the study suggested.\n\n\"It's kind of amazing that something so simple could be an answer,\" Paul said.\n\nThe study was paid for by the National Honey Board, an industry-funded agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

It is very powerful.\u201d\n\nA lot of work lies ahead, researchers say \u2014 making sure the tests are reliable if they are used in doctors\u2019 offices, making sure the research findings hold up in real-life situations, getting doctors and patients comfortable with the notion of spinal taps, the method used to get spinal fluid. But they see a bright future.\n\nAlthough the latest PET scans for Alzheimer\u2019s are not commercially available, the spinal fluid tests are.\n\nSo the new results also give rise to a difficult question: Should doctors offer, or patients accept, commercially available spinal tap tests to find a disease that is yet untreatable? In the research studies, patients are often not told they may have the disease, but in practice in the real world, many may be told.\n\nSome medical experts say it should be up to doctors and their patients. Others say doctors should refrain from using the spinal fluid test in their practices. They note that it is not reliable enough \u2014 results can vary by lab \u2014 and has been studied only in research settings where patients are carefully selected to have no other conditions, like strokes or depression, that could affect their memories.\n\n\u201cThis is literally on the cutting edge of where the field is,\u201d Dr. DeKosky said. \u201cThe field is moving fast. You can get a test that is approved by the F.D.A., and cutting edge doctors will use it.\u201d\n\nBut, said Dr. John Trojanowski, a University of Pennsylvania researcher and senior author of the paper, given that people can get the test now, \u201cHow early do you want to label people?\u201d\n\nSome, like Dr. John Growdon, a neurology professor at Massachusetts General Hospital who wrote an editorial accompanying the paper, said that decision was up to doctors and their patients.\n\nSometimes patients with severe memory loss do not have the disease. Doctors might want to use the test in cases where they want to be sure of the diagnosis. And they might want to offer the test to people with milder symptoms who want to know whether they are developing the devastating brain disease.\n\nOne drawback, though, is that spinal fluid is obtained with a spinal tap, and that procedure, with its reputation for pain and headaches, makes most doctors and many patients nervous. The procedure involves putting a needle in the spinal space and withdrawing a small amount of fluid.\n\nDr. Growdon and others say spinal taps are safe and not particularly painful for most people. But, he said, there needs to be an education campaign to make people feel more comfortable about having them. He suggested that, because most family doctors and internists are not experienced with the test, there could be special spinal tap centers where they could send patients.\n\nThe new study included more than 300 patients in their 70s, 114 with normal memories, 200 with memory problems and 102 with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Their spinal fluid was analyzed for amyloid beta, a protein fragment that forms plaques in the brain, and for tau, a protein that accumulates in dead and dying nerve cells in the brain. To avoid bias, the researchers analyzing the data did not know anything about the clinical status of the subjects. Also, the subjects were not told what the tests showed.\n\nNearly every person with Alzheimer\u2019s had the characteristic spinal fluid protein levels. Nearly three quarters of people with mild cognitive impairment, a memory impediment that can precede Alzheimer\u2019s, had Alzheimer\u2019s-like spinal fluid proteins. And about a third of people with normal memories had spinal fluid indicating Alzheimer\u2019s. Researchers suspect that those people will develop memory problems.\n\nIn checking their findings against data gathered in a separate study, the researchers found that among 57 patients with mild cognitive impairment who went on to develop Alzheimer\u2019s within five years, 100 percent had the characteristic protein levels five years before.\n\nThe prevailing hypothesis about Alzheimer\u2019s says that amyloid and tau accumulation are necessary for the disease and that stopping the proteins could stop the disease. But it is not yet known what happens when these proteins accumulate in the brains of people with normal memories. They might be a risk factor like high cholesterol levels. Many people with high cholesterol levels never have heart attacks. Or it might mean that Alzheimer\u2019s has already started and if the person lives long enough he or she will with absolute certainty get symptoms like memory loss.\n\nMany, like Dr. DeKosky, believe that when PET scans for amyloid become available, they will be used instead of spinal taps, in part because doctors and patients are more comfortable with brain scans.\n\nAnd when \u2014 researchers optimistically are saying \u201cwhen\u201d these days \u2014 drugs are shown to slow or prevent the disease, the thought is that people will start having brain scans or spinal taps for Alzheimer\u2019s as routinely as they might have colonoscopies or mammograms today.\n\nFor now, Dr. DeKosky said, the days when Alzheimer\u2019s could be confirmed only at autopsy are almost over. And the time when Alzheimer\u2019s could be detected only after most of the brain damage was done seem to be ending, too.\n\n\u201cThe new biomarkers in CSF have made the difference,\u201d Dr. DeKosky said, referring to cerebral spinal fluid. \u201cThis confirms their accuracy in a very big way.\u201d", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "1clip_filelist.xml\"/>\n\n\n\nThis story does not exaggerate the prevalence or seriousness of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. However, by incorrectly stating that the test can identify people who are \"on their way to developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\" the story encourages confusion between risk factors for a disease and the disease itself.

All of the trials reviewed had \"major limitations,\" such as having too few patients, relying on parental reports of symptoms, or the study design (such as not being double-blinded).\n\n\"The notion that any form of complementary and alternative medicine is effective for infantile colic currently is not supported from the evidence from the included randomized clinical trials,\" the researchers from the United Kingdom wrote. \"Additional replications are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.\"\n\nBut because fennel extract, certain herbal teas and sugar water are generally safe, and because the research does suggest babies may benefit, pediatricians said they would feel comfortable recommending them to parents.\n\n\"It's reasonable for parents to consider those kinds of interventions for which there is some suggestion of benefit but no known risks,\" said Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York.\n\nThe study, published in the April print issue of Pediatrics, appears online March 28.\n\nColic usually starts when a baby is about three weeks old, said Dr. Ari Brown, a pediatrician in Austin, Texas, and author of the Expecting 411 book series. Colic is usually defined as excessive and inconsolable crying for at least three hours a day for more than three days a week over more than three weeks.\n\n\"It's miserable for both baby and the parents,\" Brown said. \"And although we've been studying it for years, no one has figured out what the cause is, which makes it all the more difficult to treat.\"\n\nIn the United States, between 5 and 19 percent of infants are estimated to have colic, according to background information in the article.\n\nBecause pediatricians can't offer parents much help with it -- for the most part, babies grow out of colic in time -- desperate parents often turn to alternative or complementary treatments, according to the study.\n\nIn the review, the study authors searched various databases of medical research and chose 15 randomized clinical trials involving alternative treatments for colic. The studies were published between 1991 and 2008, came from 10 different countries and included a total of 944 children.\n\nSeveral studies looked at spinal manipulation by a chiropractor. In three of those studies, parents reported their children cried significantly less afterwards. But those studies were small and flawed, so no conclusions can be made about the technique, according to the new review.\n\nThree studies looked at herbal supplements. One found improvement in infants given fennel extract compared to infants given a placebo; another found that infants given a tea containing chamomile, vervain, licorice, fennel and balm-mint seemed to work; while a third found infants given a tea containing fennel, lemon balm and chamomile cried less than infants given a placebo.\n\nFennel, an intestinal \"antispasmodic,\" may increase the speed at which food moves through the intestine, Brown said. This may help if the underlying cause of colic is cramping or discomfort due to an immature digestive tract, although that is just a theory, Brown added.\n\nTwo studies looked at giving babies solutions of sugar water, which some researchers believe has pain-killing properties. The parents of babies given sugar water reported significantly less crying. (If parents want to try it, they could deliver sugar water in a dropper, or put a small amount in a bottle, Adesman said.)\n\nA study of probiotics, which are reputed to help digestion, found that 95 percent of infants given L. reuteria probiotics seemed to reduce their average crying time compared to 7 percent of babies given simethicone, which is marketed to relieve gas under the brand names Mylicon and PediaCare Infants' Gas Relief.\n\n\"This is pertinent given that simethicone is considered the best available and most commonly prescribed treatment for colic, although it previously has been shown to be no more effective than the placebo,\" according to the authors.\n\nBrown said the strength of that finding suggests L. reuteria is worth further study.\n\nOne study found no difference in improvement of symptoms between infants whose parents were taught to do infant massage compared to infants put in a crib that vibrated. Nor did soy-enriched formula seem to help.\n\nA small study of babies given reflexology showed some improvement, but there was no difference in whether the reflexology targeted the feet, which are considered to be therapeutic for colic, or other parts of the body.\n\nThis implies the improvement may \"have more to do with the therapeutic effect of touch than the actual therapy itself,\" Dr. Edzard Ernst, of the department of complementary medicine at Peninsula Medical School, Universities of Exeter and Plymouth, in the United Kingdom, and colleagues wrote in the report.\n\nThe Nemours Foundation has more on colic.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story does not engage in disease-mongering and, in fact, goes further by making it clear that colic is transitional, even if it feels like it will never end. \u201cIn the United States, between 5 and 19 percent of infants are estimated to have colic, according to background information in the article.

Fielding, senior scientist and director of the Nutrition, Exercise Physiology, and Sarcopenia Laboratory at the USDA HNRCA.\n\nFor the LIFE study, the researchers analyzed data from 1,635 men and women age 70-89 over an average of 2.6 years. Half were randomly assigned to a program of walking and walking-based strength, flexibility and balance training; half participated in health education workshops. All had low levels of physical functioning at the start and reported fewer than 20 minutes per week of regular physical activity in the month prior to starting the study. Participants were evaluated at baseline, six, 12, and 24 months. The researchers relied on movement monitors and self-reporting to measure physical activity outside study sessions.\n\nChanges in activity were significantly greater in the physical activity intervention group than the health education group from baseline through 24 months. There was a continuous, graded effect with the greatest benefits seen in the participants who engaged in at least 48 minutes of physical activity per week. The greater differences were also associated with prevention of major mobility loss.\n\n\"Our goal was to have participants walking up to 150 minutes per week. To see benefits at 48 minutes is encouraging. We wanted the physical activity sessions to include exercise that participants could do outside of the study, and we hope that learning of these results might motivate others to try to make safe, incremental changes to their activity levels. Reducing muscle loss, functional decline, and loss of independence are important to anyone, at any age, and at any physical ability,\" said Fielding.\n\nThe researchers acknowledge limitations of this study, including examining the different quantities of exercise participation achieved in the LIFE study participants and not specifically prescribing different amounts of exercise to different study groups. In addition, there were differences in the measured absolute amounts of exercise performed when comparing objective activity monitoring using a wearable \"device\" and self-report of physical activity.\n\nAdditional authors on this study are Jack M.

So a patient who's had a prior kidney transplant may be highly sensitized -- meaning they have a large number of the offending antibodies.\n\nIt can also happen to patients who've had blood transfusion or ever been pregnant, Montgomery said.\n\nIt's almost impossible to find a compatible donor for those patients. But they might be able to receive a kidney from an incompatible donor if they first undergo an extensive \"desensitization\" process.\n\nThat involves various treatments -- including IV drugs called immune globulin and rituximab -- that try to quash the antibodies that would attack the donor organ.\n\nNow the new research suggests a simple approach -- an infusion of a particular enzyme hours before the transplant -- could offer a better alternative.\n\nResearchers found that the treatment -- dubbed IdeS -- quickly wiped out the dangerous antibodies, allowing all but one of 25 patients to have a successful transplant.\n\nThe findings were published in the Aug. 2 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Funding for the study came from the company developing IdeS -- Hansa Medical.\n\nMontgomery, who was not involved in the study, said he's \"never seen anything like it.\"\n\n\"When you give this, all of the antibodies are gone,\" Montgomery said. \"I'm hopeful that this will turn out to be a game-changer.\"\n\nHowever, he stressed, many questions remain.\n\nCritically, the enzyme does not banish the antibodies forever. They come back, Montgomery said -- and the results of that comeback vary from patient to patient.\n\nIn the study, 10 patients had an episode of antibody-mediated rejection anywhere from two weeks to five months after their transplant. That means antibodies started to attack the new kidney.\n\nThose patients were all successfully treated with standard anti-rejection drugs, according to the researchers.\n\nStill, it's not yet clear how the patients will fare in the long term, said Dr. Julie Ingelfinger, a professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston.\n\nIngelfinger, who wrote an editorial published with the study, echoed Montgomery's cautious optimism.\n\nIf larger, longer studies bolster the current findings, she said, \"this could potentially be practice-changing.\"\n\n\"But,\" Ingelfinger stressed, \"only time will tell.\"\n\nLead researcher Dr. Stanley Jordan agreed that more work is necessary.\n\nBut the findings mark another step forward for patients like these, according to Jordan, who is medical director of the kidney transplant program at Cedars-Sinai, in Los Angeles.\n\nTraditionally, highly sensitized patients in need of a kidney have languished on waiting lists because it's so hard to find a compatible donor.\n\nBut in the past 15 years or so, desensitization has emerged as an alternative.\n\nLast year, a landmark study proved that patients who receive transplants after desensitization live significantly longer than those who stay on dialysis.\n\n\"The outcomes have been good,\" Jordan said.\n\nBut, he added, there's clearly room for improvement.\n\nIngelfinger agreed. \"The desensitization protocols now in use are time-consuming, and they don't always work,\" she said, noting that they can leave dangerous antibodies behind.\n\nDesensitization adds about $20,000 to $30,000 to the cost of the transplant, according to the University of Wisconsin's transplant center.\n\nThe new approach is quite different, Ingelfinger said.\n\nPatients receive one infusion of an enzyme called IdeS four to six hours before the transplant.\n\nThe enzyme is derived from a strain of Streptococcus bacteria, and it essentially chops up the antibodies that would attack the organ.\n\nJordan acknowledged that the source \"sounds scary,\" but stressed that patients do not receive the bacteria itself -- but an engineered version of the enzyme.\n\nIn all, 25 U.S. and Swedish patients received an infusion of IdeS before their kidney transplant. All but one had a successful transplant, and none had detectable antibodies immediately afterward.\n\nIdeS patients still received additional treatment -- including a week of immune globulin and rituximab infusions.\n\nAnd as with all transplants, they needed standard anti-rejection drugs.\n\nBecause IdeS so readily banishes the offending antibodies, it might make transplants feasible for even the most highly sensitized patients, Montgomery said.\n\nBut the \"$65,000 question\" remains, he said: Can it extend the survival of the donor kidney and, ultimately, patients' lives?\n\nIdeS is still experimental, and the only way patients could receive it is through a clinical trial. It will be \"a few years\" before it could be more widely available, Montgomery said.\n\nThe National Kidney Foundation has more on kidney transplantation.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No mongering here.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "How to treat patients who have microinvasive breast cancer - tumors that are 1 mm or less in size (the thickness of a dime) -- is somewhat controversial.

This is not the case for other surgeries currently offered for obesity management.\n\n\u201cIt is also important that teenagers undergoing this surgery have access to an experienced surgeon as part of a multidisciplinary paediatric team of doctors and Health professionals to ensure there is long-term regular follow-up.\u201d\n\nPaediatric surgeon Mr Sanjeev Khurana, who did all the lap band surgeries between 2009 and 2013, says lap band surgery is a reversible surgical procedure that can be safely used in teens with severe obesity.\n\n\u201cAlthough gastric banding has been controversial and is currently less used in adults with severe obesity, lap band surgery is one of the most studied surgeries for obesity management, has a high safety record and can be a temporary option to manage severe obesity during adolescence,\u201d says Mr Khurana, who is also a Senior Lecturer in the University of Adelaide\u2019s Discipline of Paediatrics.\n\n\u201cOur findings support lap band surgery as a safe and effective option for management of adolescents with severe obesity \u2013 provided it is performed by an experienced surgeon and managed afterwards in a paediatric multidisciplinary environment with regular follow-up until adulthood.\u201d", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The text makes clear that this strategy would be relevant only for severely obese teenagers and then goes on to define that term.

No longer did he always have to buy the aisle seat at the theater because \"you feel guilty hanging over the person sitting next to you.\" No longer did he have to endure humiliations such as breaking a chair at his brother's wedding.\n\nThe best part, says Thayer, a Boston area professor, was not having to \"think about food for the first time in my life. It was fantastic. I ate when I was hungry, stopped when I was full. I didn't feel like I was fighting an uphill battle.\"\n\nUntil five years later, when the weight started creeping back on.\n\nWhen the 6-foot Thayer edged up to 310 earlier this year at age 45, he decided to go for a second operation: adjustable banding, more commonly known as lap-band surgery, which allows for repeated stomach-tightening and thereby offers a new opportunity for reining in appetite. Reactions to his decision vary, he says. While some people close to him worry about his going under the knife again, others have asked, \"What the hell did you do wrong?\"\n\nSecond surgeries to combat obesity are on the rise. The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery doesn't keep statistics on repeat customers, but obesity surgeons are reporting upticks. Dennis Halmi, a member of the Bluepoint Surgical Group in Woodbridge, says that in 2002 \"we did a handful\" of second operations on obesity patients, \"maybe five, six. This year we are doing probably 30.\" Scott Shikora of Tufts Medical Center in Boston says that until recently he hadn't performed a second obesity operation on anybody but is already up to about a half-dozen patients. Thayer was one of them.\n\nGeorge Fielding, whose obesity surgery practice at the NYU Medical Center in New York has gone from two or three second operations in 2004 to \"probably 20 or 25 this year,\" isn't surprised at the trend. \"There was a huge surge in gastric bypass from 1998 to 2001,\" he says. \"Going into the early 2000s, everyone thought the gastric bypass was the best thing since Eric Clapton picked up a guitar. Then they went and hid, then they came in for help.\"\n\nThe second time around, many, like Thayer, are opting for the adjustable band, which works differently from the bypass. With a bypass, 95 percent of the stomach is closed off with a stapling device. What could once stretch to the size of a football is reduced to the size of an egg that can't hold more than a tablespoon or two of food. In addition, the small intestine, where food goes when it leaves the stomach, is cut into two pieces. The lower piece, two to three feet down from the upper piece, is connected to the new, tiny stomach pouch. Thus, when food empties from the stomach, it bypasses a few feet of upper intestine, which means that fewer nutrients (including fewer calories) are absorbed by the body.\n\nObesity surgeons, Fielding included, report a high success rate for the bypass. Bypass patients lose some 60 to 80 percent of their excess weight, and 60 to 80 percent of those patients keep off at least two-thirds of the weight they lose. Such people often experience a near-complete reversal of diabetes, sleep apnea, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, arthritis pain and a host of other health-compromising problems, frequently going from several prescription drugs a day to none.\n\nThe thing is, for about 20 to 40 percent of patients, the operation fails over the long term. It's not always clear why. In a number of people, the stomach pouch softens, as does the opening between the stomach and the small intestine. That allows more food through more quickly, and the person's old level of hunger begins to return. As Joseph Moresca, a New York nurse who initially went from 440 pounds to 220 with a bypass, put it, \"instead of being able to eat a quarter of a sandwich, I was eating three-quarters of a sandwich.\" He regained 45 pounds by the time he decided to go for banding.\n\nIn contrast to the bypass, the band does its work by separating the stomach into two parts: a tiny upper pouch and a larger pouch below the band. The tighter the band, the more slowly food goes from the upper part of the stomach to the lower, reducing hunger dramatically. The operation is far safer than bypass surgery because organs are not being cut and sewn. In addition, there's no nutrient malabsorption as there is with the bypass, because the small intestine is left intact; banding patients do not have to take nutrient supplements for the rest of their lives, the way bypass patients do.\n\nBut the biggest difference is that when hunger starts to return, the banding patient can go in to his doctor's office for a tightening. The band is shaped like a little life preserver that can fill and go slack. Saline solution injected into it through a portal just beneath the skin makes it more taut. The tighter the band, the less hungry you are, the less food you can get down comfortably, and the less you eat.\n\nBut in that advantage lies the band's disadvantage. If the patient doesn't go in for adjustments, the whole thing won't work. Also, you can eat around, or rather, through, the band. Ice cream shakes and other very soft or liquid foods can go through even a tight band, and every obesity surgeon can point to band patients who have sabotaged their operations by eating foods that slip right through. The ability to control the tightness is presumably part of the reason that patients who opt for banding lose less weight, at least initially, than gastric bypass patients -- an average of 50 to 65 percent of their excess weight in the first three years.\n\nAnother difference between the band and the bypass that proves both a plus and a minus is that the band doesn't cause the dumping syndrome. That's an often frightening attack of sweating, nausea, faintness, diarrhea, cramps and rapid pulse that bypass patients sometimes suffer after eating just a bite of a sugary food -- a deterrent to consuming certain calorie-dense items.\n\nOf course, a second obesity surgery comes with increased risk. After a gastric bypass, there's often scarring that causes organs to adhere to one another. \"The liver, stomach, spleen and diaphragm -- they all get drawn in together in a big blob of scar,\" says NYU surgeon Fielding. Thayer says his banding operation, which would typically take about an hour, kept him under general anesthesia for 3 1/2 hours because his surgeon \"ran into a lot of adhesions.\"\n\nAlong with the risk comes the uncertainty of how well people will be able to lose -- and keep off -- weight the second time around. Not enough time has elapsed since the advent of second operations to get a long-term assessment.\n\nWhat obesity surgeons do feel confident saying is that no matter which type of surgery is chosen, and whether it's the first or second time, the patient has to meet the operation halfway. You \"still have to follow some semblance of dietary compliance,\" says Tufts's Shikora. \"You also have to be more physically active, take care of your health. And you have to follow up.\"\n\nIn other words, anyone who sees obesity surgery as a solution in itself is chasing weight-loss rainbows.\n\nThayer, who was down 30 pounds a month after having had his band inserted, gets it. \"You still have to diet,\" he says. \"You still have to commit to an exercise plan.\" No obesity operation is \"a magic bullet.\" But what he misses is that the bypass operation initially let him maintain his weight loss without putting extraordinary focus on his efforts.\n\nLike a lot of other obese people, he says, he \"had always been a person who could lose 100 pounds. I did it many, many times. The problem is, I'm not a great maintainer.\" The bypass, at least at first, let him not only achieve but also maintain the weight loss without thinking much about it. \"I didn't have to count calories. I exercised,o but I didn't have to exercise two hours a day in order to stay at that weight.\"\n\nHe wants the new procedure to return his appetite to a more manageable level so that it helps the pounds stay off. \"I'm hoping that this band will not allow me to eat a whole pizza anymore,\" he says. \"Last summer I was able to eat a whole pizza again, and I was like, this can't be right.\"\n\nLarry Lindner's latest book is \"Fighting Weight\" (HarperCollins), co-authored with George Fielding, Christine Ren and Khaliah Ali, Muhammad Ali's daughter, whose weight loss is the subject of the book.

While it may reduce the risk of over diagnosis and overtreatment, the reduction in intermediate and high risk cancer diagnoses raises concern because of the potential for delayed diagnoses of important cancers in men who may benefit from treatment, according to investigators reporting in The Journal of Urology\u00ae.\n\nProstate cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death among men in the U.S., with nearly 30,000 deaths annually. Deaths from prostate cancer have declined by about 40% since the advent of PSA screening in the late 1980s, and 40-70% of that decline may be attributable to screening. However, radiation therapy and surgery have a negative impact on quality of life. The uncertain benefit of PSA based screening, combined with the complications associated with treatment, led the USPSTF to conclude in October 2011 that the harms of PSA based screening outweighed the benefits, leading it to recommend against regular screening.\n\n\"Our study was designed to assess the impact of the USPSTF recommendation on screening practices among urologists and primary care providers and the incidence of prostate cancer,\" explained lead investigator Daniel A. Barocas, MD, MPH, of the Department of Urologic Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee. \"We know there is decreased utilization of PSA testing in some institutions and health systems, but has the number of incident cases per month changed substantially since the draft guideline was issued?\"\n\nInvestigators evaluated the effect of the USPSTF guideline on the number and distribution of new prostate cancer diagnoses in the U.S. They identified incident cancers diagnosed between January 2010 and December 2012 in the National Cancer Database and assessed the trend of new prostate cancers diagnosed each month before and after the draft guideline was issued, comparing their findings with colon cancer.\n\nThis study helped quantify the potential benefits (reduced harms of over diagnosis and overtreatment of low risk disease and disease found in elderly men) and potential harms (missed opportunities to diagnose important cancers in men who may benefit from treatment).\n\nThe number of prostate cancer diagnoses dropped by more than 12% (1363 cases) in the month after the USPSTF draft guideline was issued and the number continued to drop, resulting in an overall decline of 28% in incident prostate cancer diagnoses in the year after the draft guideline was issued. By contrast, the number of monthly colon cancer diagnoses remained stable. Diagnoses of low, intermediate, and high risk prostate cancers all decreased significantly, but new diagnoses of non-localized disease did not change. The decreases were similar across all subgroups of age, comorbidity, race, income, and insurance.\n\nThe study showed that 12 months after the draft guidelines were published diagnoses of new low risk cancers had fallen by 37.9%, and continued to fall more rapidly than other disease risk strata, suggesting that, in this regard, the USPSTF recommendation had its intended effect,. Similarly, new diagnoses had fallen by 23.0-29.3% among men over age 70 and by 26.0% among infirm men, populations at risk for harms of treatment but unlikely to live long enough to benefit from early detection.\n\nHowever, the study also identified a drop of 28.1% in diagnoses of intermediate risk disease and 23.1% in high risk prostate cancer one year after the draft guideline, which could result in missing important opportunities to spare men with higher risk cancers from progressive disease and cancer death.\n\n\"While some of the effects of this guideline may be beneficial in terms of reducing harms of over diagnosis and overtreatment, the reduction in intermediate and high risk cancer diagnoses raises concern for delayed diagnoses of important cancers associated with inferior cancer outcomes,\" noted Dr. Barocas. \"Future research should focus on prostate cancer screening paradigms that both minimize harms and maximize the potential benefits of screening, as well as accounting for individual patient risk factors and preferences.\"", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "We think there\u2019s some fear-mongering going on related to the downside of following USPSTF guidance.

But as quickly as drug companies find ways to sabotage HIV, the virus develops a new survival strategy. Nearly 30 percent of HIV-positive Americans have viral infections that were resistant to at least one drug in the multidrug cocktails that keep them alive.\n\n``We desperately need new compounds with novel mechanisms of action,\" said Eric Freed, chief of the virus-cell interaction section of the HIV Drug Resistance Program of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nThat's why some patients, doctors, and researchers are excited about an experimental drug based on an herb known by the Latin name Syzigium claviflorum that had been used in Taiwan to treat diarrhea and stop bleeding. Now its derivative is being tapped to fight HIV by a small Watertown-based biotechnology company.\n\nIf approved by the Food and Drug Administration, bevirimat, developed by Panacos Pharmaceuticals Inc., would represent the first in a new class of drugs that uses an unusual approach to block maturation of the virus that causes AIDS.\n\nThe HIV virus can't make copies of itself; instead it hijacks a human cell to borrow its replication machinery. Bevirimat interrupts the process at a key stage, resulting in harmless, immature HIV copies that the body quickly flushes. The therapy is exciting, AIDS specialists say, even though it is at least three years from market, because it could offer a completely new tool to combat a 25-year-old foe.\n\nAnd, bevirimat works later in the virus life cycle than protease inhibitors, which have been the mainstay of AIDS therapy. That hints at the opportunity to use bevirimat in potent combination with existing drugs, said Dr. Daniel R. Kuritzkes, director of AIDS research at Brigham and Women's Hospital and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.\n\nBevirimat is being developed as physicians begin to use drugs from different classes in combination to fight the virus at different steps in its life cycle.\n\n``We can, once again, get control of virus replication in patients with the most advanced disease who are resistant to other drugs and really have a major impact on the course of disease and on survival in these patients,\" said Kuritzkes, who is a paid consultant to Panacos.\n\nSuch new therapies could prove effective when given in combinations of specific classes.\n\n``It's only when we started giving people three drugs from at least two different classes that we really started making an impact,\" said Kenneth Mayer, medical research director at Boston's Fenway Community Health and a Brown University professor of medicine.\n\nIn 2003, roughly 1.2 million Americans lived with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and another estimated 40,000 Americans are newly infected with the human immunodeficiency virus each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBut therapies have been improving steadily. By the calculations of researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, people who started AIDS therapy in 2003 lived an estimated 13 years longer than people diagnosed with AIDS in 1988.\n\nExperimental AIDS therapies in clinical trial or awaiting FDA approval hint at more life-saving benefits, like the once-a-day AIDS pill that the agency hailed last month as the ``holy grail\" of drug development because it simplifies drug delivery in developing nations. The experimental therapies include drugs that bolster the body's ability to block the doorways that HIV uses to enter cells, that enhance the body's ability to neutralize the virus, and that limit the damage caused by HIV infection.\n\nPanacos estimates its drug could garner $500,000 to $1 billion in peak annual sales from a drug candidate initially spotted by a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who was screening natural products in search of potential HIV therapies.\n\n``There aren't many new mechanism drugs,\" Graham P.

But experts said the results are promising, and should prompt further studies.\n\n\"We just wanted to see if this is feasible, and this study shows that it is,\" said lead researcher Dr. Mark Cook, of the University of Melbourne and St. Vincent's Hospital in Australia.\n\nThe prospect of being able to predict seizures is \"very exciting,\" he said, in part because it's the uncertainty of the disorder that can dim people's quality of life.\n\nIf people know a seizure is coming, Cook said, they can avoid driving or swimming that day, for example. They might also be able to adjust their medication use.\n\nEpilepsy is a neurological disorder in which the brain's normal electrical activity is temporarily disrupted, leading to a seizure. Seizures can be obvious, causing unconsciousness or convulsions, but often they trigger subtler changes in a person's perceptions or behavior -- like a short staring spell, confusion or an altered sense of taste or smell.\n\nEpilepsy is usually managed with medication, but for 30 percent to 40 percent of people with the condition, drugs don't keep seizures at bay. The new study included 15 people who were having at least two to 12 \"disabling\" seizures a month that were resistant to drug therapy.\n\nCook's team implanted each patient with the experimental device, which consists of electrodes placed between the skull and the brain, plus wires that run to a unit implanted under the skin of the chest.\n\nThat unit wirelessly sends data to a hand-held device that flashes a red warning light if there is a \"high likelihood\" of an impending seizure. (A white light signals a \"moderate\" likelihood, while a blue light means the odds are low.)\n\nFor the first four months, the devices collected data on patients' seizures without actually flashing warnings. For 11 of the 15 patients, the implants seemed capable of correctly predicting a high risk of seizure at least 65 percent of the time. Those patients went on to the next four-month phase, where the devices were activated to give warnings.\n\nOver those four months, the implants worked fairly well for eight patients -- correctly giving the high-risk warning anywhere from 56 percent to 100 percent of the time.\n\nThere are plenty of questions left, said Dr. Ashesh Mehta, director of epilepsy surgery at the North Shore-LIJ Comprehensive Epilepsy Care Center in Great Neck, N.Y.\n\n\"This study is an important first step,\" said Mehta, who was not involved in the research. \"The next step would be to implant these in a larger sample of patients. And you need to see which groups of patients might be good candidates for this.\"\n\nMehta said someone who has seizures only once in a while might not get enough benefit to outweigh the downsides of false alarms, for example. And someone who has many seizures each month might get little added information from the warning system, he said.\n\nIt may be the people who fall in the middle -- who have disabling seizures at unpredictable intervals -- who would stand to benefit the most, he said.\n\nBut any benefits need to be weighed against the risks. Besides false alarms and unnecessary anxiety, the implant itself can cause problems. In this study, three patients had serious complications, including one with an infection and one whose chest device moved and caused her pain. Two patients ultimately had the implants removed.\n\nStill, Mehta agreed that the technology could prove helpful to some people with epilepsy. If they know a seizure is coming, they might take an extra dose of their medication, for example.\n\nAn implanted device like this could also give patients and their doctors more information about their epilepsy, he added. In this study, the implants revealed that most patients were suffering more seizures than they thought; one patient who reported 11 a month was actually having more than 100.\n\nIn real life, Mehta said, it can be hard to know if you're feeling bad because of side effects from epilepsy medication or because you're having a lot of seizures. A device like this could help sort that out.\n\nBut what's still needed is evidence that this device does improve the quality of patients' lives, Mehta said.\n\nThe study was funded by NeuroVista, the Seattle-based company developing the technology.

It is led by Enrique Schisterman of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Results are in the current online issue of Human Reproduction.\n\nRusso says, \"One of our main findings is that there was no overall relationship between most types of physical activity and the likelihood of becoming pregnant for women who had already had one or two pregnancy losses, except for walking, which was associated with higher likelihood of becoming pregnant among women who were overweight or obese.\"\n\nWhitcomb, whose research on the determinants of fertility and pregnancy outcomes usually involves studying biomarkers at the molecular level, adds, \"Lifestyle is definitely relevant to these outcomes because it can have an effect at the molecular level. What we eat and what we do are potential factors we can change to shape our health. So this sort of research is important because it helps provide information on the things people can actually do something about.\"\n\nFurther, he says, \"We were happy to be able to add scientific evidence to general recommendations about physical activity. This is especially true for the results about walking for even limited blocks of time. Walking has great potential as a lifestyle change because of its low cost and availability.\"\n\nFor the 1,214 women in the study, the association of walking with the ability to become pregnant, known as fecundability, varied significantly by body mass index, the authors report. Among overweight/obese women, walking at least 10 minutes at a time was associated with improvement in fecundability. Further, in statistically adjusted models, women reporting more than four hours a week of vigorous activity had significantly higher pregnancy chances compared to no vigorous activity.\n\nModerate activity, sitting and other activity categories were not associated with fecundability overall or in BMI-stratified analyses, they add. Russo and Whitcomb say one finding that is still not clear is the different associations related to vigorous compared to moderate and low-intensity activities. Whitcomb says, \"We don't know what to make of the finding that high intensity physical activity may have different biological effects than walking, but our study doesn't offer enough detail to get at why vigorous activity would work differently than other levels.\"\n\nAmong a number of cautions the researchers point to in this work is that physical activity is related to other behaviors and lifestyle factors, and women who are more physically active may be different from women who are less active in many ways. Russo says, \"We did our best to try to account for the differences and to address them statistically.\"\n\nThe researchers also note that the overall generalizability of this work is limited because the study population may not be representative of the general population with regard to fecundability, and exercise habits may differ in women with prior miscarriage compared to those without.\n\nWhitcomb says another way in which this study is distinct from other work in this area has to do with who was included in the study. The EAGeR trial focused on women with a history of one or two prior pregnancy losses. However, he adds, \"We were happy to be able to conduct research considering women having the most difficulty getting and staying pregnant, and to provide messages about common lifestyle factors they may be able to address.\"\n\nThe researchers conclude that \"these findings provide positive evidence for the benefits of physical activity in women attempting pregnancy, especially for walking among those with higher BMI. Further study is necessary to clarify possible mechanisms through which walking and vigorous activity might affect time-to-pregnancy.\"", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "MILAN, ITALY, Sept. 12, 2017 - An antibody treatment reduces the rate of flare-ups by nearly 20 percent in patients with a subgroup of treatment-resistant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), according to the results of two large international trials presented today at the European Respiratory Society International Congress in Milan, Italy, and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\n\"The goal of precision medicine is to give the right treatment to the right patient,\" said lead author Frank Sciurba, M.D., director of the Center for COPD and Emphysema and UPMC Pulmonary Function Exercise Physiology Laboratory, and visiting professor in the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. \"These findings are the first example of a precision therapy that is uniquely effective in a subgroup of patients with treatment-resistant COPD.\"\n\n\"There is significant variation between patients in the cells and other proteins responsible for lung inflammation, so there are actually many different subtypes of COPD,\" said Sciurba.\n\nOne subgroup called eosinophilic predominant COPD is present in as many as 40 percent of patients and is characterized by elevated levels of a type of white blood cell known as eosinophils, he said.\n\nThe new study reports the results from two Phase III clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of mepolizumab, an antibody treatment that reduces the number of eosinophils in the blood, in moderate to severe treatment-resistant eosinophilic COPD by blocking the pro-inflammatory effects of interleukin-5.\n\nPatients included in the trials were still having flare-ups despite a year of a standard treatment known as \"triple inhaled therapy\" that includes bronchodilators and glucocorticoids.\n\n\"These patients already have been given every treatment we have to offer them and are still having flare-ups that significantly interfere with their quality of life and can lead to deterioration in lung function and higher mortality,\" said Sciurba. \"We hoped to be able to offer them an option.\"\n\nMepolizumab is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to reduce symptom flare-ups and improve quality of life in eosinophilic asthma.\n\nThe first trial, termed METREX, was conducted at 117 sites in 15 countries from 2014 to 2017. A total of 837 COPD patients were stratified by blood eosinophil counts and randomized to receive either 100 milligrams of mepolizumab or placebo, delivered under the skin every four weeks for one year.\n\nThe patients with high eosinophil counts who received mepolizumab had a statistically significant 18 percent lower rate of moderate/severe exacerbations (1.4 per year compared to 1.7 per year) than those in the placebo group. The exacerbation rate in the low eosinophil group treated with the biologic did not differ from placebo. The time to the first exacerbation also was higher with mepolizumab than placebo, but only in the high eosinophil group.\n\nIn a second, simultaneous trial, termed METREO, the team assessed the effect of a higher dose of mepolizumab in 675 patients with elevated eosinophil levels. Patients were randomized to receive 100 or 300 milligrams of mepolizumab or placebo, with the same delivery method and schedule as METREX.\n\nSimilar to METREX, the exacerbation rate was reduced by 20 percent in the high eosinophil group after 100 milligrams of mepolizumab. The METREO results narrowly missed statistical significance. The 300-milligram dose did not provide an advantage over the lower dose.\n\nAn analysis of data from both trials found that as baseline blood eosinophil counts increased, so did mepolizumab's reduction in the annual exacerbation rate. This finding indicates that patients with higher initial eosinophil counts benefited more from mepolizumab than those with lower eosinophil counts, Sciurba said. The safety profile of mepolizumab did not differ from placebo in either trial.\n\n\"In addition to providing a new treatment option for patients with treatment-resistant, moderate to severe COPD, the new results also are important because they identify a potential biomarker for the disease and demonstrate that eosinophilic inflammation plays a role in flare-ups in COPD,\" Sciurba said.\n\nPitt's Division of Pulmonology, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine has a legacy of pioneering treatments for lung disease. UPMC also is home to a leading lung transplant program.\n\n\"The findings in these trials exemplify what we hope to achieve not only in COPD but across all lung diseases with regards to a precision approach to treatment,\" said division chief, Rama Mallampalli, M.D.\n\nFunding for both trials was provided by GlaxoSmithKline, which plans to seek approval from the FDA for the use of mepolizumab in eosinophilic COPD.\n\nAdditional authors on the study are Ian Pavord, F.Med.Sci.

Now, researchers say a special scoring system might point to those people at highest risk for colon cancer, who may need the test the most.\n\nThe system might also make colon cancer screening more efficient and boost the number of people who get checked for the disease, said a team led by Dr. Thomas Imperiale of Indiana University Medical Center, in Indianapolis.\n\nOne expert said more efforts are needed to get people to undergo colonoscopy, which is currently recommended once every 10 years beginning at age 50.\n\n\"Five percent of the U.S. population will be diagnosed with colon cancer within their lifetimes,\" said Dr. Arun Swaminath, director of the inflammatory bowel disease program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He was not involved in the new research.\n\nSwaminath noted that one study published in 2012 found that \"colonoscopy reduced the risk of death from colon cancer by 53 percent, by removing polyps. No other procedure is available to remove polyps from anywhere in the colon.\"\n\nAnd while some areas of the United States have rates of compliance with colonoscopy guidelines of 75 percent or more, \"many areas have poor colon cancer screening rates,\" he added.\n\nImperiale's team noted that not all people deemed to be at \"average risk\" for colon cancer face the same risk of the disease, and so some might benefit more from invasive colonoscopy than others.\n\nIn the new study, the Indiana researchers looked at more than 4,400 Americans who were scheduled to undergo their first screening colonoscopy. They calculated a clinical \"score\" for each of these patients, based on their health information, and the five most common risk factors for colon cancer: age, sex, waist size, smoking and family history.\n\nThen they looked at the results of each patient's colonoscopy. The study found that patients classified under the scoring system as low-risk did, in fact, have far fewer advanced abnormal growths that might develop into cancer, compared to patients classified as high-risk.\n\nSo, patients scoring at the lower end of risk for colon cancer might be able to have less invasive screening tests (such as the fecal occult blood test), while those at higher risk would require a colonoscopy, Imperiale's team concluded.\n\nHowever, Swaminath wasn't fully sold on the notion.\n\nHe believes that the scoring system \"was only modestly able to separate people within the risk groups.\" Swaminath pointed out that even the new study found that \"low- to intermediate-risk patients still have a risk between of between 1.9 percent to 9.9 percent of harboring a polyp that can develop into cancer.\"\n\nFor now, he said, the data from this study is not strong enough to spur any changes in current screening recommendations.\n\nDr. Jules Garbus is co-chief of colon and rectal surgery at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, N.Y.

Still, the drug -- or others like it in development -- could add to the power of new drugs in the pipeline that are poised to cure many more people with hepatitis C, said Dr. Eugene R. Schiff, director of the University of Miami's Center for Liver Diseases.\n\nThe greater possibility of a cure and fewer side effects, in turn, will lead more people who think they have hepatitis C to \"come out of the woodwork,\" said Schiff, who's familiar with the study findings. \"They'll want to know if they're positive.\"\n\nAn estimated 4 million people in the United States have hepatitis C, but only about 1 million are thought to have been diagnosed. The disease, transmitted through infected blood, can lead to liver cancer, scarring of the liver, known as cirrhosis, and death.\n\nExisting treatments can cure about half of the cases. As Schiff explained, people's genetic makeup has a lot to do with whether they respond to the treatment. Those with Asian heritage do better, whereas those with an African background do worse, he said.\n\nAnd there's another potential problem with existing treatments. The side effects, particularly of the treatment component known as interferon, can be \"pretty hard to deal with,\" said Nicholas A. Meanwell, a co-author of the study and a researcher with the Bristol-Myers Squibb pharmaceutical company.\n\nThe study, published online April 21 in Nature, examines an experimental drug designed to combat the hepatitis C virus.

The main side effect was headache, Meanwell said.\n\nAt this point, it's not clear how much the drug might cost or how it would work with existing drugs.

But that might be changing, at least when it comes to risk of death.\n\nThe body mass index, or BMI, associated with the lowest risk of death has increased since the 1970s, a study finds, from 23.7, in the \"normal\" weight category, to 27, which is deemed \"overweight.\"\n\nThat means a person who is 5-foot-8 could weigh 180 pounds and be in that epidemiological sweet spot, according to the NIH's online BMI calculator. The results were published Tuesday in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nThe researchers came to that conclusion by looking at data from three studies of people in Copenhagen, one from the 1970s, one from the 1990s and one from 2003-2013. More than 100,000 people were involved. Because Denmark has an excellent national health registry, they were able to pinpoint the cause of death for every single one of those people.\n\nThe risk of death for people who are obese, with a BMI of 30 or greater, also declined, to the point that it was on a par with some people of so-called \"normal\" weight.\n\nSo being fatter, at least a bit, may be healthier.\n\n\"I was surprised as a scientist to see how clear the result was,\" Borge Nordestgaard, a clinical professor and chief physician at Copenhagen University Hospital and senior author of the study, told Shots.\n\nSo he and his colleagues sliced and diced the data to see what could account for the shift. They looked at age, sex, smoking, cancer and heart disease. The most relevant was the decline in smoking since the 1970s. But when they looked at the mortality rates in nonsmokers who had never had cancer or heart disease, it also became associated with a higher BMI over time.\n\nSo what's going on?\n\n\"Now we get into the speculation part, right? I know you journalists always want that,\" Nordestgaard says. \"One option certainly is over these three decades we have become much better at treating the cardiovascular risk factors that come with overweight and obesity.\"\n\nThat includes treating high cholesterol with statins; treating high blood pressure with diet, exercise and an array of medications; and making concerted efforts to help people to control blood sugar.\n\nPeople in Denmark got heavier on average over the course of the study, as they have in the United States and most other countries. By 2013, 56 percent of the Danes had a BMI of 25 or higher. So you could think, OK, the new average is a heavier average.\n\nOr you could wonder if being a bit heavier somehow helps confer health benefits that affect longevity.\n\nResearchers have long known that people who are very thin tend to have a shorter life expectancy, often because they're dealing with cancer or other serious illnesses. The sweet spot on the BMI/longevity axis is typically somewhere near the middle. But there's not much data to back the notion that a bit more pudge is protective. \"This is total speculation,\" Nordestgaard says.\n\nThe BMI has been vilified as a poor measure of an individual's health. Someone who is big, fit and well-muscled, like a pro football player, can peg an obese BMI. And all of the people in this study are white, so that's a limitation. But the BMI, which is a general measure of body fat, has proven useful for thinking about the health of large groups of people, as in this study.\n\nNordestgaard and his colleagues are going to dig into this more in an effort to figure out what's going on, but he cautions that these kinds of data dives can take many months.\n\nBut this does raise the prospect of whether it may soon be time to tweak the official definition of normal, healthy weight.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story noted that the number of people who are overweight or obese has been increasing in many countries in recent decades\u2013an assertion that can be backed up with data\u2013and\u00a0did not overstate the case.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "It's pretty well known to doctors that the most successful treatment for obesity is surgery, especially the gastric bypass operation. But here's something the medical world is just realizing: that the gastric bypass operation has other even more dramatic effects. It can force type 2 diabetes into almost instant remission and it appears to reduce the risk of cancer.\n\nSurgeons have been performing bariatric, or weight loss operations since the 1950s, but they're much safer than they used to be. They're typically done laparoscopically now, where doctors use tiny surgical tools and video cameras instead of making big, deep incisions.\n\nDespite the increase in obesity, only a small number of people have had the gastric bypass operation.\n\nmet some people who were once morbidly obese.\n\nThere was Tony Sideman, who underwent surgery in April 2007 and has lost 140 pounds; there was Janet Rovak, who lost 90 pounds in the eight months since her surgery; and there was Travis Goodbou, who lost 260 pounds in the seven months since he underwent the operation.\n\nDr. Neil Hutcher from Richmond, Va. has performed more than 3,000 bypass surgeries. Asked how many people gain the weight back, Dr. Hutcher tells Stahl, \"You know I think when you're dealing with an incurable disease that kills many people, if you have an 85 to 90 percent success rate, that's pretty darn good.\"\n\n\"Is that what you have?\" Stahl asks.\n\nThere's no diet, no exercise regimen, and no pill with a success rate like that. These patients lose a ton of weight and keep it off.\n\nHere's how Hutcher does the surgery: first, he sections off a small pouch of the upper part of the stomach, which is then attached to a lower part of the small intestine, bypassing most of the stomach, so that there's not a lot of room for food.\n\nIt used to be that roughly one in 100 people died from this operation. Hutcher says it's now about one in 1,000, which makes it less deadly than most major surgeries.\n\n\"It's less than gall bladder surgery. It's about one-tenth of cardiac surgery,\" he explains.\n\nIt's safer because of new surgical techniques which have also made it more effective. For instance, they can make the stomach pouch smaller than they used to.\n\n\"Even if I wanted to eat a whole cheesecake, my stomach is very tiny. It holds four ounces max, stretched to the max. And that's not even one piece of cheesecake,\" a female patient explained.\n\nA big reason the operation works is because it seems to suppress appetite. \"If you listen to your patients, they come back and they say, 'Doctor, you put the fire out,'\" Hutcher says.\n\n\"When you see a sign for fast food or\u2026she's already shaking her head at me,\" Stahl asked a patient.\n\n\"Don't want it,\" the female patient replied. \"I used to crave sweets all the time. I couldn't go past the gift shop at work without getting a candy bar. Now I go past it and I never give it a thought.\"\n\nPaul Delios of Saugus, Mass. has lost 90 pounds. He owns a doughnut shop with his siblings, but he's able to resist the cravings. \"Before I'd have cravings for everything. Now I really don't,\" he told Stahl.\n\nFor most patients the cravings really do disappear. One theory is that's because the operation suppresses the levels of a stomach hormone called \"grelin\" that activates the sensation of hunger.\n\nYet most people who have this operation do not get skinny. Dr. David Cummings, an expert on appetite at the University of Washington, says as a rule these patients end up just one third lighter.\n\n\"Most people with severe obesity who undergo gastric bypass do not become fully normal, in terms of body weight. They go from severely obese to mildly obese, or from obese to overweight. But nevertheless it's an enormous change,\" Dr. Cummings explains.\n\nAnd not just in terms of weight loss. Dr. Hutcher says the operation itself can take type 2 diabetes - which has ballooned in this country - and throw it into complete remission.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The segment does not exaggerate the risks or burdens of obesity or diabetes, which are considerable.

Other components included: a moderate daily intake of alcohol with meals- mostly from red wine; eating fish, poultry or tree nuts (like walnuts or cashews) weekly; and limiting eating red meat to about twice a month. The researchers say what's responsible are the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.\n\nPanagiotakos added that the diet includes all main food groups, but in a balanced way. The study notes physical activity is also an important part in preventing the risk factors for the metabolic syndrome.\n\nThe Mediterranean diet isn't just a little extra olive oil, noted Dr. Robert Eckel, an endocrinologist and past president of the American Heart Association.\n\n\"It's all these other components,\" Eckel said.\n\n\"I think the health professional needs to recognize that people that meet the criteria for the metabolic syndrome are at higher risk [for heart disease and diabetes] and we strongly recommend that lifestyle intervention is used to prevent the syndrome and also to modify its prevalence,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the American Heart Association, data from 2003-2006 shows a third of adults age 20 and older met that criteria.

It's occurring throughout Mexico, Central and South America, Southeast Asia, Australia and around the world.\"\n\nEckel said obesity is by far the largest issue responsible for the metabolic syndrome. According to the World Health Organization's 2008 figures, at least one in three of the world's adult population is overweight, and almost one in 10 people is obese. For children, the numbers are also sobering: 20 million kids under age 5 are overweight.\n\nPanagiotakos concludes that this pattern of eating can be easily adopted by people of various cultures and populations.\n\n\"The macro-environment we are living promotes obesity in all age groups of people... the choice of a healthy diet, like the Mediterranean diet, is on our hands.

Along with obesity, high levels of blood fats can lead to heart disease and other health problems, including diabetes.\n\nThe U.S. government currently recommends screening for high cholesterol in children with a family history of heart disease or high cholesterol (with at least one parent or grandparent who has suffered a premature heart event such as heart attack or stroke, or at least one parent with total cholesterol levels above 240 mg/dL). The guidelines also recommend that youngsters whose parents are not aware of their family history of heart disease be screened.\n\nIn the new study, led by Dr. William Neal of West Virginia University, scientists observed a group of more than 20,000 fifth-graders in West Virginia and found that 71% were eligible for cholesterol screening based on national criteria. Experts believe using family history is a good way to identify children who may be at greatest risk of high cholesterol \u0097 and therefore of future heart disease. Based on the results of the screen, doctors may then advise families to change their children's diet or exercise routines or prescribe medication to lower their cholesterol.\n\nBut because West Virginia has one of the nation's highest rates of death from heart disease, since 2000, the state has offered free, universal cholesterol screening to all fifth-graders enrolled in public schools. That allowed Neal and his team to determine how many children who actually had high cholesterol would have been missed if they had been screened based on federal guidelines.\n\nAmong the 5,798 children who would not have been screened, nearly 10% had elevated LDL cholesterol levels (above 130 mg/dL), according to the study, published in the August issue of Pediatrics. And 1.7% had levels high enough (above 160 mg/dL) to warrant cholesterol-lowering medications. Indeed, of all the children in the study whose LDL levels were above 160, one-third were in the group who would not have been screened.\n\nThe current guidelines were put in place in the 1990s, and at the time, experts predicted that high cholesterol would be missed in as many as 25% of children, says Neal. But doctors assumed that in most cases, these children would have only slightly elevated cholesterol levels that would eventually be detected when they became adults and would be lowered with diet and exercise.\n\nNeal's data show that may not be the case. Further, Neal says, the findings apply not only to heart-disease risk but also to the risk of diabetes, since high cholesterol at a young age is a strong predictor of prediabetes and diabetes. \"We worry about that because if these children don't change their ways, then they are going to have Type 2 diabetes,\" he says. \"It's something we would become more aware of if more children were screened.\"\n\nNot everyone agrees that universal screening is the answer. Rather than calling for all youngsters to have their cholesterol tested, which would entail considerable expense on the national level, Dr. Ralph Sacco, president of the American Heart Association (AHA), suggests looking more critically at current screening guidelines. \"Maybe the way we are doing family screening, with a very simplistic questionnaire about any parent having early heart disease or having high blood cholesterol, is not effective,\" he says. \"I think we need more effective screening tools. We need to assess these options before jumping to possible universal screening.\"\n\nSacco notes that both the AHA and the American Academy of Pediatrics now recommend cholesterol screening in children with risk factors for heart disease other than family history, such as obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes. \"The weight of the child, his waist circumference and whether he has siblings who are overweight would help to select a group that is at greater risk of having high cholesterol,\" he says. \"Now that we have this data, it does call into question these original guidelines from the government.\" The next update of the recommendations is expected in spring 2011.\n\nSee TIME's Pictures of the Week.\n\nSee the Cartoons of the Week.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "1clip_filelist.xml\" rel=\"File-List\"/>\n\n\n\n \nThe lead of the story focuses on the number of children with elevated cholesterol who might be missed based on current national guidelines and does not jump to the conclusion that these children would necessarily benefit from treatment. The story also reports that less than two percent of the children tested had cholesterol levels high enough that doctors might consider drug treatment. Oddly, the lead sentence says current guidelines \u201cmay miss nearly 10% of those who have high levels of LDL, or bad cholesterol,\u201d but the researchers put the figure at closer to a third.

Now a study published in the journal Circulation confirms and quantifies that benefit; women who ate three or more servings of blueberries and strawberries per week reduced their risk of heart attack by up to one third.\n\nIn the study, researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health and the University of East Anglia in the U.K. analyzed data from 93,600 women ages 25 to 42 enrolled in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study II. For 18 years, the women filled out surveys detailing their diets at four-year intervals.\n\nDuring the study the women experienced 405 heart attacks. But women who consumed the most blueberries and strawberries had a 32% reduced risk of heart attack compared with the women who ate berries once a month or less. The women who ate more berries also tended to eat healthier overall, consuming more vegetables and fruits than those who didn\u2019t eat as many berries; but when the scientists broke down the women\u2019s diets, they found that the highest consumers of berries even had a lower risk of heart attack compared with women who still ate plenty of fruits and vegetables but fewer berries. The effect remained even after the researchers adjusted for other things that can influence heart-disease risk, such as obesity, high blood pressure, smoking, low levels of physical activity and a family history of heart disease.\n\n\u201cThese foods can be readily incorporated into diets, and simple dietary changes could have an impact in reducing risk of heart disease in younger women,\u201d says study author Aedin Cassidy from the University of East Anglia. \u201cThis supports growing lab data showing that these compounds can help keep arteries healthy and flexible.\u201d\n\nSo what is it about berries that help the heart? The researchers focused on blueberries and strawberries because these are the most widely consumed varieties in the U.S. Both berries contain high levels of anthocyanins, as well as other flavonoids, which fight the effects of stress and free-radical damage to cells as they age. They can also keep heart vessels more elastic and flexible, which helps combat the growth of plaques that can build up and rupture, causing heart attacks.\n\nThe results are particularly encouraging because they showed that a change in diet could affect heart-disease risk for relatively young women. That means that regular consumption of berries might be a relatively easy way to lower a woman\u2019s risk of having a heart attack later in life, possibly even insulating her from heart problems. \u201cAlthough we know about the effects of antioxidants and flavonoids, and their effects in wine and chocolate, it is interesting to look at their effects in such a large group of women over a long period of time,\u201d says Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, director of women and heart disease at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThe take-home lesson is that even if you are eating these early in life, you\u2019re getting benefits that last for life.

Now a systematic review and meta-analysis of 19 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of cocoa consumption reveals some further pieces of supporting evidence.\n\nThe meta-analysis in the Journal of Nutrition, an assessment of the combined evidence from all 19 RCTs, focused on whether consumption of flavanol-rich cocoa products was associated with improvements in specific circulating biomarkers of cardiometabolic health as compared to consuming placebos with negligible cocoa flavanol content. In all, 1,139 volunteers were involved in these trials.\n\n\"Our meta-analysis of RCTs characterizes how cocoa flavanols affect cardiometabolic biomarkers, providing guidance in designing large, definitive prevention trials against diabetes and cardiovascular disease in future work,\" said corresponding author Dr. Simin Liu, professor and director of the Center for Global Cardiometabolic Health at Brown University who worked with epidemiology graduate student and lead author Xiaochen Lin. \"We found that cocoa flavanol intake may reduce dyslipidemia (elevated triglycerides), insulin resistance and systemic inflammation, which are all major subclinical risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases.\"\n\nLiu noted some limitations in the trials. All studies were small and of short duration, not all of the biomarkers tracked in these studies changed for the better, and none of the studies were designed to test directly whether cocoa flavanol consumption leads to reduced cases of heart attacks or type 2 diabetes.\n\nBut taking into account some of these heterogeneities across studies, the team's meta-analysis summarizing data from 19 trials found potential beneficial effects of flavanol-rich cocoa on cardiometabolic health. There were small-to-modest but statistically significant improvements among those who ate flavanol-rich cocoa product vs. those who did not.\n\nThe greatest effects were seen among trial volunteers who ate between 200 and 600 milligrams of flavanols a day (based on their cocoa consumption). They saw significant declines in blood glucose and insulin, as well as another indicator of insulin resistance called HOMA-IR. They also saw an increase in HDL, or \"good,\" cholesterol. Those consuming higher doses saw some of the insulin resistance benefits and a drop in triglycerides, but not a significant increase in HDL. Those with lower doses of flavanols only saw a significant HDL benefit.\n\nIn general, Lin said, where there were benefits they were evident for both women and men and didn't depend on what physical form the flavanol-rich cocoa product was consumed in --dark chocolate vs. a beverage, for example.\n\n\"The treatment groups of the trials included in our meta-analysis are primarily dark chocolate -- a few were using cocoa powder-based beverages,\" Lin said. \"Therefore, the findings from the current study apparently shouldn't be generalized to different sorts of chocolate candies or white chocolates, of which the content of sugar/food additives could be substantially higher than that of the dark chocolate.\"\n\nThe authors therefore concluded, \"Our study highlights the urgent need for large, long-term RCTs that improve our understanding of how the short-term benefits of cocoa flavanol intake on cardiometabolic biomarkers may be translated into clinical outcomes.\"\n\nIn addition to Lin and Liu, the study's other authors are Isabel Zhang, Alina Li from Brown University, JoAnn Manson, Howard Sesso and Lu Wang from Brigham and Women's Hospital.\n\nThe authors acknowledge funding from the National Institutes of Health including the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, the American Heart Association, and Pfizer.

ALA is plant-based and found in such edible seeds as flaxseed and in oils, such as soy, canola and hemp oil. EPA and DHA are found in marine life, such as fish, algae and phytoplankton.\n\nPublished in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, the study involved feeding the different types of omega-3s to mice with a highly aggressive form of human breast cancer called HER-2. HER-2 affects 25per cent of women and has a poor prognosis.\n\nMa exposed the mice to either the plant-based or the marine-based omega-3s, beginning in utero.\n\n\"The mice were exposed to the different omega-3s even before tumours developed, which allowed us to compare how effective the fatty acids are at prevention,\" said Ma. \"It's known that EPA and DHA can inhibit breast tumour growth, but no one has looked directly at how effective these omega-3s are compared to ALA.\"\n\nMa found overall exposure to marine-based omega-3s reduced the size of the tumours by 60 to 70 per cent and the number of tumours by 30 per cent.\n\nHowever, higher doses of the plant-based fatty acid were required to deliver the same impact as the marine-based omega-3s.\n\nOmega-3s prevent and fight cancer by turning on genes associated with the immune system and blocking tumour growth pathways, said Ma.\n\n\"It seems EPA and DHA are more effective at this.

Some days the pain is so bad, she says, \"By 11 o'clock in the morning, I'm on the couch in a darkened room with my head packed in ice.\"\n\nOver the years, Bradford, who is 50 years old and lives in Bedford, Mass., has searched desperately for pain relief. She's been to the doctor countless times for countless tests. \"Everything I've had, I've had twice,\" she says. \"I've had two spinal taps; I've had so many nerve blocks I've lost count.\"\n\nBradford is not alone. It's estimated that every year 12 million Americans go to the doctor seeking help for headaches. Nearly one quarter of the population suffers from recurrent severe tension headaches or migraines.\n\nPeople who go to the doctor for headaches are increasingly likely to be sent for advanced testing and treatment, a study finds. That testing is expensive, it may not be necessary and it could even be harmful, says lead researcher Dr. John Mafi, of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.\n\nMafi looked at the rates of advanced imaging like CT scans and MRIs in people with headaches, as well as referrals to other doctors, presumably specialists. He found that from 1999 to 2010, the number of diagnostic tests rose from 6.7 percent of all doctor visits to 13.9 percent. At the same time, referrals to other doctors increased from 6.9 percent to 13.2 percent. In other words, almost double what it was a decade ago.\n\nMafi says this isn't because more people are suffering headaches. The headache rate has remained virtually the same over the past decade. But what has changed is supply and demand. Today there are a lot more advanced diagnostic machines than there were a decade ago, and more patients are asking to be tested.\n\n\"Patients are more assertive than ever before,\" Mafi says. \"They do research online, are more informed and sometimes go to the doctor demanding, 'I think I need an MRI.' \"\n\nAnd while an informed patient is a good thing, Mafi says sometimes the patient gets it wrong. \"I think there's a subconscious perception that more is better, and that fancier, more expensive tests are better and that equals better care.\"\n\nMafi's study did not include patients with tumors or other serious problems that can cause headaches. He only looked at otherwise healthy patients who suffered chronic headaches. And in these cases, repeated diagnostic testing can lead to further unnecessary procedures like biopsies.\n\nOn top of that, exposure to radiation in tests like CT scans adds up over time and can increase the risk of certain cancers.\n\nFor Terri Bradford, the years of searching for effective treatment proved futile. \"I've been to four neurologists. A lot of them have given up on me because I haven't gotten any better,\" she says.\n\nEventually Bradford ended up at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where neurologist Carolyn Bernstein directs the Comprehensive Headache Center. Bernstein says she sees lots of desperate patients like Bradford. \"The majority of them have really been suffering a number of years and they're really miserable with the pain,\" Bernstein says. They say, \" 'I hope you have a magic pill,' and of course there is no magic pill.\"\n\nThere is just no single reason why people get chronic headaches, although we do know that migraines have a genetic component and usually a trigger. \"If you are a migraine sufferer and I expose you to the right trigger, you're going to have a migraine,\" Bernstein says.\n\nBut the triggers are different for different people. They can include poor diet, too much sugar or certain types of alcohol. Problems sleeping, stress, lack of exercise or a combination of any number of these things can cause chronic headaches.\n\nAt the headache center, patients receive a thorough medical history that includes headache patterns, disability and mood assessments. Then the center works with patients to try to identify what triggers their headaches and how they can avoid those triggers in the future.\n\nSome people find relief through exercise. \"I write an exercise prescription probably as often as I write a prescription for medication,\" Bernstein says. She acknowledges it's sometimes difficult to encourage a patient with cracking head pain to get up and exercise. But even a little can help, and according to Bernstein it doesn't have to be jogging for miles and miles. It can be yoga, tai chi or even just a little stretching.\n\nA big lifestyle adjustment worked for Terri Bradford. She started exercising and changed her diet, giving up gluten, dairy and sugar. And she learned how to meditate to reduce stress. All these changes, she says, have made a huge difference. She has far fewer headaches and when she does have them, they're far less severe. \"I'm finally healing,\" she says.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "We\u2019re flagging the story for several problems that collectively rise to the level of Not Satisfactory:\n1.

However, its use is being researched for a number of conditions, including epilepsy, depression and bipolar disorder. Francisco Ponce, MD, Director of the Barrow Center for Neuromodulation, believes there are potential applications for Alzheimer's disease - the most common form of dementia - as well. Whereas in Parkinson's disease and essential tremor, the target for the electrodes are nodes within the motor circuits, the Alzheimer's study targeted the fornix, which is part of the memory pathway.\n\n\"There are more than five million Americans living with Alzheimer's, and yet there are few promising pharmacologic treatment options for this progressive disease,\" says Dr. Ponce. \"Previous pilot studies researching the use of DBS in Alzheimer's have indicated the potential to slow cognitive decline in some patients, and have even shown metabolic changes in the brain that may slow the progression of the disease.\" Barrow Neurological Institute is part of Dignity Health St. Joseph's Hospital in Phoenix.\n\nThe ADvance Trial, using a device from Functional Neuromodulation, Inc., is aimed at evaluating the safety, efficacy and tolerability of DBS in this patient population.

The condition more commonly affects men, as well as people who are overweight, over 40, and have large necks. Women with sleep apnea may suffer poorer heart health than men, according to a recent study.\n\nObstructive sleep apnea occurs when the soft tissues of the mouth and airway, especially the tongue, block air flow into the lungs. This causes breathing to stop multiple times throughout the night, and oxygen levels in the body to fall \u2014which was happening to Turner. The drop in oxygen while sleeping is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, say experts.\n\nAfter being diagnosed, Turner tried an external continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine, which proved too cumbersome for her continued use.

Campos, lead author of one of two papers appearing in the February issue of the Archives of Surgery.\n\nGastric bypass and lap-banding are the two most common surgical weight-loss procedures performed in the United States. The former involves stapling the stomach so food has to bypass a section of the small intestine, meaning you get full faster and less food gets absorbed into the gut.\n\nLap-banding, introduced in 2001, involves separating the stomach into two sections with a band so, simply speaking, eating too much becomes more difficult. \"It's a diet with a seatbelt,\" said Dr. Mitchell Roslin, chief of bariatric surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City and Northern Westchester Hospital in Mt. Kisco, N.Y.\n\nIn a third type of weight-loss procedure, known as sleeve gastrectomy, surgeons remove part of the stomach.\n\nThe study led by Campos compared weight loss and diabetes outcomes in 100 patients who underwent gastric bypass surgery with 100 patients who underwent lap-banding. Gastric bypass is considered riskier and more technically demanding than the band.\n\nAll patients were morbidly obese (with a body-mass index higher than 40), and 34 in each group had type 2 diabetes.\n\nAlthough Campos is now an associate professor of surgery at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison, he conducted the study while at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nIn the bypass group, patients lost an average of 64 percent of their excess weight, vs. 36 percent for those in the lap-banding group. Three-quarters of those undergoing gastric bypass surgery saw their diabetes improve or resolve, vs. only half in the other group.\n\nThe average cost of a bariatric surgery is nearly $30,000, according to a recent study from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nLike all surgeries, weight-loss surgery carries its own set of possible risks, including bleeding, blood clots, infection and leaks from sites where body tissues are sewn or stapled together, according to the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Later complications may include malnutrition, hernias and a tendency in about one in 10 people to regain much of the weight they lost as a result of the procedure.\n\nIn Campos' study, roughly equal numbers of patients in each group experienced complications after one year (12 percent in the gastric bypass group compared to 15 percent in the lap-banding group); these included infection, internal bleeding and blood clots, but no deaths. More people in the bypass group had complications right after the surgery. More of those undergoing lap-banding, however, needed repeat surgeries (13 percent vs. 2 percent).\n\nThe second study, conducted in Taiwan and led by Dr. Wei-Jei Lee of the Min-Sheng General Hospital, involved randomly assigning 60 obese (but not morbidly obese) patients with type 2 diabetes to receive gastric bypass surgery or sleeve gastrectomy.\n\nAlmost all of those undergoing gastric bypass surgery (93 percent) had their diabetes resolved, vs. only half in the other group (these numbers declined to 57 percent and 0 percent after a year).\n\nThose in the gastric bypass group also lost more weight, and there were no serious complications in either group.\n\nThere are various theories to explain why gastric bypass may be superior, including one that attributes the success to changes in hormones that control the metabolism of blood sugar.\n\nAnd certain procedures may still be preferable for certain patient populations, added Roslin, such as bands for patients with lower BMI who don't have so many metabolic challenges.\n\n\"Everyone thinks that all weight-loss operations are the same, even the doctors and the surgeons.

It is also been reported that LAGB patients are likely to regain much of their lost weight years down the road.\n\nTo explore satisfaction levels and the long-term complication history of gastric banding, in 2009 Himpens and his team examined a pool of patients who had undergone the surgery between 1994 and 1997.\n\nThe results: 12 years or more later, more than 60 percent of the banding patients said they were \"satisfied\" with their experience. On average, excess weight loss had been maintained at a level approaching nearly 43 percent, and quality of life appeared to be equal to that of patients who had not undergone the surgery.\n\nHowever, 39 percent of the patients had experienced serious complications, including abnormal pouch expansion (9), band erosion (23) and band infection (1). Another 22 percent experienced relatively minor complications. Almost 50 percent had to have the bands entirely removed, while 60 percent needed to undergo subsequent surgery. The procedure \"appears to result in relatively poor long-term outcomes,\" the researchers concluded.\n\nOne in six of the patients ended up deciding to have a gastric bypass procedure, and all of these patients demonstrated good outcomes following their subsequent surgery.\n\nHimpens said that patients should limit their expectations with respect to banding, noting that \"all weight-loss operations have a high failure rate\". But he added that \"it is still defendable for surgeons to continue doing this.\"\n\n\"The high failure rate of the band gastroplasty [in] the long term is not that much worse than other procedures,\" he noted. \"[I] therefore think patients will continue to ask for the procedure.\"\n\nBut he cautioned that patients undergoing band surgery should do so knowing that they need to commit themselves to rigorous long-term follow-up.\n\nMeanwhile, in a critique published alongside Himpens work, Dr. Clifford W. Deveney, a professor of surgery in the department of surgery at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, concluded that the current study does \"not shed a favorable light on the use of LAGB\".\n\n\"The band has a spotty history,\" Deveney said. \"Some groups have very good results, with 60 to 70 percent weight loss. But other groups have either poor weight loss or complications, or both.\"\n\n\"So I think,\" he continued, \"that the patient should be made aware of these facts, and also that the weight loss is going to be less with the band than with a gastric bypass. And that it'll take longer to achieve the weight loss, because with gastric bypass most of the weight loss occurs over the first year, while with a band it takes five to six years.\"\n\n\"It's also easier to 'cheat' on the band,\" he added. \"You can eat around the band and render it ineffective if you're not disciplined in following a healthy diet. With gastric bypass that's not as much of an issue. But all this is not to say that I think we shouldn't be doing bands. It's just not as good as bypass.\"\n\nDr. Mitchell S. Roslin, chief of bariatric surgery at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y., said he was not surprised by the findings.\n\n\"I always tell my patients that bands are like going a diet with a seatbelt,\" he said. \"And that there's bound to be a 5 percent extraction rate of these bands per year that they're in. Which actually comes to about the same percent of band removals these researchers observed among their patients.\"\n\n\"I think the problem with the bands is simply that having a fixed obstruction underneath your esophagus is not a natural occurrence,\" Roslin noted. \"And also these bands make it more difficult to eat, but they do not make every patient less hungry. So there's a big variability in treatment effect. You'll see patients who do great and patients who don't. Almost like a camel with two humps.\"\n\n\"So bands are easy to sell and very heavily marketed,\" he added. \"But for many patients, there are better options.\"\n\nFor more on gastric banding, visit the National Institutes of Health.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story did not engage in overt disease-mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "TUESDAY, Dec. 21, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- The recreational drug known as ecstasy may have a medicinal role to play in helping people who have trouble connecting to others socially, new research suggests.\n\nIn a study involving a small group of healthy people, investigators found that the drug -- also known as MDMA -- prompted heightened feelings of friendliness, playfulness and love, and induced a lowering of the guard that might have therapeutic uses for improving social interactions.\n\nYet the closeness it sparks might not be result in deep and lasting connections.\n\nThe findings \"suggest that MDMA enhances sociability, but does not necessarily increase empathy,\" noted study author Gillinder Bedi, an assistant professor of clinical psychology at Columbia University and a research scientist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute in New York City.\n\nThe study, funded by the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse and conducted at the Human Behavioral Pharmacology Laboratory at the University of Chicago, was published in the Dec. 15 issue of Biological Psychiatry.\n\nIn July, another study reported that MDMA might be useful in treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), based on the drug's apparent boosting of the ability to cope with grief by helping to control fears without numbing people emotionally.\n\nMDMA is part of a family of so-called \"club drugs,\" which are popular with some teens and young at all night dances or \"raves.\" These drugs, which are often used in combination with alcohol, have potentially life-threatening effects, according to the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nThe newest study explored the effects of MDMA on 21 healthy volunteers, nine women and 12 men aged 18 to 38. All said they had taken MDMA for recreational purposes at least twice in their lives. They were randomly assigned to take either a low or moderate dose of MDMA, methamphetamine or a sugar pill during four sessions in about a three-week period.\n\nEach session lasted at least 4.5 hours, or until all effects of the drug had worn off. During that time, participants stayed in a laboratory testing room, and social interaction was limited to contact with a research assistant who helped administer cognitive exams.\n\nA moderate dose of MDMA was found to significantly increase feelings of loving, friendliness and playfulness, the researchers said, whereas the low dose of MDMA boosted feelings of loneliness.\n\nThe moderate dose also prompted a drop in the ability to accurately recognize fear in other people's faces, determined by having the participants look at a range of photos, the study found, but it did not affect the ability to perceive the shifting cues in a person's eyes or voice, determined by having the participants listen to a series of audio clips.\n\nThis effect, the Bedi and his team suggested, could help people improve their social skills by shielding them from the negative emotions of others.\n\nIn a twist, the researchers also found that methamphetamine similarly prompted feelings of friendliness and loving. In fact, those who took the drug actually rated themselves as more sociable than those taking MDMA.\n\nAs a warning, the researchers noted that MDMA might indeed facilitate socializing, but it also might impair a person's perceptive abilities and thus prompt risk-taking.\n\nNonetheless, the researchers suggested that MDMA might help people with PTSD as well those with autism, schizophrenia or antisocial personality disorder cope with a variety of emotional difficulties.\n\n\"More controlled research is needed to establish whether MDMA can safely and effectively add to psychotherapy for some conditions and, if so, what the mechanisms of these effects are,\" Bedi said.\n\nDr. Michael Mithoefer, author of the earlier study on MDMA and PTSD, also urged further exploration of the medicinal potential of the drug.\n\n\"First, I think it's very important that we investigate potential new therapies, and that we shouldn't be dissuaded from doing that just because something can be misused,\" he said. \"Many things can be life-threatening or dangerous if used incorrectly.

Based on the study results, the intervention is promising for people in the initial stages of adjustment to any serious chronic illness.\n\nThe paper was published recently in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology.\n\nThe HIV study is part of a larger body of positive affect research being conducted by Moskowitz.

Observational studies in people living with HIV have shown positive emotion is related to a higher CD4 count (an indicator of less HIV-related damage to the immune system). Or, the reduced viral load may be the result of participants' better adherence to their antiretroviral drug therapy, which generally leads to a suppressed or undetectable viral load, Moskowitz said.\n\nThe positive emotion intervention also improved mental health.

The results appear in the journal Cancer Research.\n\nOne difficult but crucial determination for surgeons and tissue pathologists is figuring out where a tumor ends. A solid tumor may be easily identifiable, but the tissue around the main body of the tumor, known as the margin, may contain cancerous cells as well. Because of this, excess tissue surrounding the tumor is typically removed, but the question lingers of whether any cancer cells remain to re-emerge later as tumors.\n\n\"In almost all solid-tumor surgeries, there's a question of margins,\" said Dr. Boppart, who also is a medical doctor. \"Typically, surgeons will remove the tissue mass that contains the tumor and will send it to the lab. The pathologist will process, section and stain the tissue, then examine the thin sections on microscope slides. They look at the structure of the cells and other features of the tissue. The diagnosis is made based on subjective interpretation and often other pathologists are consulted. This is what we call the gold standard for diagnosis.\"\n\nThe new device is a hand-held probe based on a technology called optical coherence tomography (OCT) that uses light to image tissue in real time. Cancer cells and normal tissue scatter light differently because they have different microstructural and molecular features, Boppart said, so OCT gives physicians a way to quantitatively measure the cellular feature of a tumor. Surgeons can pass the OCT wand over a section of tissue and see a video on a screen, with no special chemical stains or lengthy tissue processing required.\n\n\"In many cases, you can't tell the difference between cancer cells and normal tissue with the naked eye, but with OCT they're very different,\" said Boppart, who also is affiliated with the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the U. of I.\n\nIn the clinical study, surgeons treated patients according to the standard surgical procedure, but OCT data were collected from the margin of the tumor cavity and the margin of the removed tissue mass during surgery so that the results could be compared later. The study found that the OCT device analysis identified the differences between normal and cancerous tissue with 92 percent sensitivity and 92 percent specificity. They also found that the way that OCT spotted cancer in the removed tissue was closely correlated with the results from the postoperative pathology reports, which often came days later.\n\n\"For the first time, this study demonstrates the use of OCT for imaging tumor margins within the tumor cavity, in the patient, during surgery,\" Boppart said. \"It is likely better to check to see if any residual tumor cells might be left behind, rather than checking the tissue mass that was taken out. Then, the surgeon can intervene immediately.\"\n\nThe researchers will continue clinical studies with the OCT device, looking at other types of solid-state tumors. Diagnostic Photonics, a start-up company Boppart co-founded that also collaborated on the study, is commercializing the OCT probe technology for broader use.\n\n\"Ultimately, new technological innovations like this in medicine and surgery are going to improve our health care and save lives. That's when this work will be most rewarding,\" Boppart said.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health supported this work.\n\nThe paper \"Real-time imaging of the resection bed using a handheld probe to reduce incidence of microscopic positive margins in cancer surgery\" is available online at http://cancerres. .", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No mongering here, but instead a quite clear explanation of why assessing margins is important in the surgical treatment of cancer.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A therapy that allows hay fever sufferers to get allergy shots in the form of a tablet or drops can help alleviate symptoms and cut people\u2019s reliance on allergy medication, a new research review confirms.\n\nKnown as sublingual immunotherapy, the treatment relies on the same principles as traditional allergy shots, but is delivered by tablets or drops that dissolve under the tongue.\n\nAllergy shots may be used for hay fever when antihistamines and other allergy medications do not control a person\u2019s symptoms adequately, or for people who want to reduce their reliance on medication.\n\nThe shots help prevent hay fever symptoms by exposing people, over time, to small amounts of the pollen to which they are allergic, essentially desensitizing the immune system to the allergen.\n\nAllergy shots are typically given weekly at first, followed by monthly injections over several years. The treatment does not cure hay fever but is generally effective at reducing symptoms. However, inconvenience and discomfort limits patients\u2019 willingness to try allergy shots.\n\nSublingual immunotherapy is an alternative and has become commonly used in Europe, where two tablet-based products against grass-pollen allergies are available: Grazax and Oralair. There are also a number of drop-based products. No sublingual immunotherapy products have yet been approved in the United States, however.\n\nFor the new study, reported in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Italian researchers combined the results of 19 clinical trials conducted since 1995 on the effectiveness of immunotherapy tablets and drops against hay fever caused by grass pollen.\n\nThe trials lasted anywhere from three months to three years.\n\nAcross the studies, which included a total of 2,971 adults and children with grass-pollen allergies, immunotherapy reduced symptoms by about 20 percent to 30 percent, on average. It also allowed patients to reduce their use of antihistamines and other medications.\n\nThe researchers, led by Dr. Gabriele Di Lorenzo of the University of Palermo, describe the benefits as \u201cmodest.\u201d\n\nIn an email, Di Lorenzo told Reuters Health that the findings suggest that sublingual immunotherapy is \u201chighly effective in many, but not in all patients.\u201d He said that more work is needed to identify which patients might be most likely to benefit.\n\nDr. Harold Nelson, an allergist at National Jewish Health in Denver, said that the body of evidence indicates that sublingual immunotherapy beats antihistamines and other medications used to control hay fever symptoms.\n\nIn an interview, he noted that antihistamines reduce symptoms by about 12 percent to 15 percent, on average. Nasal steroids, another hay fever option, appear to cut symptoms by about 17 percent.\n\nOn the other hand, Nelson said, allergy shots appear to outperform the oral versions, with a symptom reduction about twice that of sublingual immunotherapy.\n\nIn addition, the long-term effectiveness of the grass-pollen tablets is not yet fully clear.\n\nLike allergy shots, the oral immunotherapy takes time. Grazax, for instance, is taken daily, starting several months before the start of the next grass-pollen allergy season and continuing for three years thereafter.\n\nResearch so far suggests that the symptom relief persists in the year after patients stop taking Grazax. A study published earlier this year \u2014 and not included in the current analysis \u2014 found that during that post-treatment year, Grazax patients had one-quarter fewer hay fever symptoms than those who had been given a placebo for comparison.\n\nBut longer term data are not yet available. The benefits of allergy shots, by contrast, have been shown to persist for 10 years or beyond, Nelson noted.\n\nThe ultimate cost-effectiveness of sublingual immunotherapy has also yet to be determined; in the UK, for example, Grazax treatment costs about 2.25 pounds ($3.50) per day. In theory, that could pay off if long-term use of allergy medications was cut, but that has yet to be shown.\n\nStill, Nelson said that if sublingual products do win approval in the U.S., they will likely boost the number of hay fever sufferers who want to use under-the-tongue immunotherapy. Even though the effectiveness is less than that of allergy shots, the convenience of an at-home version of immunotherapy is a plus, and the sublingual therapy tends to have fewer side effects than shots, according to Nelson.\n\nThe most common side effects include itchiness and irritation in the mouth, ears and eyes, swelling of the mouth or tongue, headache and gastrointestinal problems like stomach pain and heartburn.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "1clip_filelist.xml\" rel=\"File-List\"/>1clip_themedata.thmx\" rel=\"themeData\"/>1clip_colorschememapping.xml\" rel=\"colorSchemeMapping\"/>\n\n\n\n \nGiven the number of allergy sufferers in the U.S., the story could have easily engaged in disease mongering, but that was not the case. \n", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Eugene Overton was given two options after being diagnosed with melanoma last year: standard chemotherapy or an experimental treatment.\n\nOverton chose the experiment, an injection he receives every three weeks. The idea is simple: Instead of poisoning the cancer and causing grueling side effects, it signals the patient's immune system to attack malignant cells, much as the body does with viruses and bacteria.\n\n\"I figured chemotherapy would, at most, just control the cancer,\" says Overton, 74, a retired surgeon who lives in Lampasas, about 85 miles north of Austin. \"But if my body could be trained to recognize wandering cancers, that might be a cure.\"\n\nDoctors aren't using the word cure \u2014 Overton hasn't even finished treatment \u2014 but after years of painstaking research, immunotherapy is starting to show promise as a cancer treatment. Famously unsuccessful in previous decades, it's poised to break through in the near future, say cancer immunologists.\n\nAround the country, about 140 immunotherapy trials are under way, some of them the final hurdle before they go up for Food and Drug Administration approval. Leading the way is the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, which three years ago opened a state-of-the-art immunology research center.\n\nIn one high-profile success, one of the therapies has helped keep an M.D. Anderson doctor healthy and thriving nearly 15 months after he was diagnosed with the deadly disease he treats: brain cancer. The cancer, glioblastoma, typically kills within that time.\n\nThe greatest promise seems to involve blood and microscopic cancers, but targets for immunotherapies in clinical trials range from lymphoma and brain cancer to cancers of the breast, prostate, colon and lung. More are on the way.\n\n\"It's the first time I've seen usually jaded oncologists excited about the prospects with immunotherapy,\" says Dr. Amy Heimberger, an M.D. Anderson neurosurgeon whose study of the glioblastoma immunotherapy drug won a Young Investigator's Award from the American Association of Neurological Surgeons. \"Suddenly, senior doctors who once pooh-poohed immunotherapy are referring patients to junior researchers in the field.\"\n\nThe treatment \u2014 shots that grab the immune system and jolt it to fight against rebel tumor cells \u2014 has been a dream for more than a century. It dates back to 1891, decades before antibiotics, when New York doctor William Coley inoculated cancer patients with live streptococcal cultures and some experienced remissions.\n\nOver the years, the shot fell by the wayside, a victim of its own inconsistent results and the growing dominance of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Other attempts flopped, often after grandiose claims by practitioners. By the 1970s, when cancer researchers referred to immunotherapy, it usually was dismissively.\n\nHowever, in the years after, the first real seeds of the science were being planted via a better understanding of immunology. By the mid-90s, textbooks had grown to 1,000 pages. Researchers began describing early immunotherapy efforts as so crude they really had little in common with the new field.\n\nThe challenge was getting the immune system to recognize the enemy. A sort of anatomical turncoat \u2014 good cells gone bad \u2014 cancer doesn't set off the immune system's attack dogs like germs do. The new knowledge, much of it thanks to the genomics revolution, is helping cancer scientists remedy that.\n\nSpecifically, researchers discovered markers unique to cancer cells the immune system can be trained to target. They also found naturally occurring, immune system-boosting compounds that can be produced in the laboratory. As a result, the researchers are now giving one-two punches of drugs that energize the immune system and direct it to go after cancer cells it had hardly noticed.\n\n\"It's made a big difference,\" says Dr. Jeff Molldrem, an M.D. Anderson professor of blood and marrow transplantation. \"It's like suddenly having the cancer's postal address and being able to activate the immune system to deliver its blow there.\"\n\nSome early returns have been impressive. One therapy at M.D. Anderson produced complete responses in a clinical trial for patients with acute myeloid leukemia for which no other intervention had been successful. Another, the trial involving glioblastoma, found that median survival for 23 participants significantly surpassed that for patients treated with the most current chemotherapy and radiation regimen.\n\nAt the Mary Crowley Medical Research Center in Dallas, scientists developed an immunotherapy that produced responses \u2014 sometimes years-long remission \u2014 in half of trial participants with a kind of lung cancer that typically kills within four to six months. And at the National Cancer Institute, a mix of cancer-specific T cells and a booster produced unheard-of improvement in patients with advanced melanoma.\n\nSurprisingly, some research shows immunotherapy works best in conjunction with chemotherapy or radiation, which suppress the immune system. An M.D. Anderson study found immunotherapy helped fight an aggressive form of lymphoma, even though prior chemotherapy had eliminated virtually all the B cells thought necessary to mount a defense.\n\nBecause it doesn't inflict the damage to healthy tissue caused by chemotherapy and radiation, immunotherapy's great appeal is its nontoxicity. Overton, for instance, boasts he's not only had no recurrence of his melanoma, he's also had no side-effects from the treatment.\n\nDespite the endorsements, not everyone is ready to proclaim immunotherapy the future of cancer treatment.\n\n\"So many claims have been made about immunotherapy that have not borne out,\" says Dr. Steven Rosenberg, an NCI scientist who conducted the melanoma study but also published a review about the lack of randomized trials in support of the therapy. \"The field is promising, but there's always danger in making claims before the real data's in.\"\n\nResearchers acknowledge immunotherapy's promise is furthest from realization for bulky solid tumors, perhaps too advanced for the immune system to beat. They say the greatest strides are being made against cancers where the immune system can fight them in manageable stages, such as in the blood or lymph nodes.\n\nThat's why immunotherapy's greatest successes will come when it can be used early in treatment, they say. Now, because drugs are mostly tested on patients whose cancer has resisted previous treatment, it's usually used on tumors advanced to often fatal stages.\n\nIf all goes well, researchers hope to learn enough to not just trigger the immune system to fight cancer, but to prevent it. A few such cancer vaccines exist \u2014 notably, the recently approved cervical cancer vaccine \u2014 but they prevent viruses that cause those cancers, and most cancers aren't caused by viruses.

Over time, taste and smell abnormalities (TSA) can lead to a loss of appetite and anorexic behaviors, compromising patients' ability to recuperate from the disease.\n\nIn a new paper published in the journal Food & Function, Virginia Tech College of Agriculture and Life Sciences researchers Susan Duncan and Aili Wang investigated the feasibility of lactoferrin, a highly bioactive protein found in saliva and milk, as a treatment for TSA. Their findings could bring relief to millions of patients undergoing cancer treatment.\n\n\"The underlying molecular mechanisms of TSA are not well-understood,\" said Duncan, associate director of the Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station and a professor in the Department of Food Science and Technology. \"The prevailing symptom described by patients undergoing chemotherapy is a persistent metallic flavor or aftertaste, with or without food intake.

Although TSA is widespread and a frequent complaint of cancer patients, until now, there have been no established therapies that reliably prevent or treat this problem.\n\n\"Our research shows that daily lactoferrin supplementation elicits changes in the salivary protein profiles in cancer patients - changes that may be influential in helping to protect taste buds and odor perception,\" said Duncan. \"By suggesting lactoferrin as a dietary supplement, we can reduce TSA for many patients, restoring their ability to enjoy foods during a time in which nutrition can play a key role in their recovery.

The substance is well-known as a first-line defense, aiding the body's immune response, but little is known about its ability to impact salivary proteins. Their most recent study builds on the previous body of work through the application of lactoferrin supplements in treating taste and smell abnormalities.\n\nThe team's findings will make it possible for cancer patients to taste foods properly and to enjoy a healthier appetite, enabling more optimal nutrition during a critical period of recovery. Lactoferrin supplementation also enhances the expression of salivary immune proteins, which may help reduce oxidative stress and resulting side effects.

Symptoms include weakness, muscle stiffness and difficulty thinking--a phenomenon often referred to as \"brain fog.\" MS affects an estimated 2.5 million people worldwide, according to the Multiple Sclerosis Foundation.\n\nDamage to the thalamus, a structure in the middle of the brain that acts as a kind of information hub, and its connections with other parts of the brain play an important role in the cognitive dysfunction many MS patients experience.\n\nResearchers led by Laura De Giglio, M.D., Ph.D., from the Department of Neurology and Psychiatry at Sapienza University in Rome, recently studied the effects of a video game-based cognitive rehabilitation program on the thalamus in patients with MS. They used a collection of video games from the Nintendo Corporation, called Dr. Kawashima's Brain Training, which train the brain using puzzles, word memory and other mental challenges. The games are based on the work of Japanese neuroscientist Ryuta Kawashima, M.D.\n\nTwenty-four MS patients with cognitive impairment were randomly assigned to either take part in an eight-week, home-based rehabilitation program--consisting of 30-minute gaming sessions, five days per week--or be put on a wait list, serving as the control group. Patients were evaluated by cognitive tests and by 3-Tesla resting state functional MRI (RS-fMRI) at baseline and after the eight-week period. Functional imaging when the brain is in its resting state, or not focused on a particular task, provides important information on neural connectivity.\n\n\"Functional MRI allows you to study which brain areas are simultaneously active and gives information on the participation of certain areas with specific brain circuits,\" Dr. De Giglio said. \"When we talk about increased connectivity, we mean that these circuits have been modified, increasing the extension of areas that work simultaneously.\"\n\nAt follow-up, the 12 patients in the video-game group had significant increases in thalamic functional connectivity in brain areas corresponding to the posterior component of the default mode network, which is one of the most important brain networks involved in cognition. The results provide an example of the brain's plasticity, or ability to form new connections throughout life.\n\n\"This increased connectivity reflects the fact that video gaming experience changed the mode of operation of certain brain structures,\" Dr. De Giglio said. \"This means that even a widespread and common use tool like video games can promote brain plasticity and can aid in cognitive rehabilitation for people with neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis.\"\n\nThe modifications in functional connectivity shown in the video game group after training corresponded to significant improvements in test scores assessing sustained attention and executive function, the higher-level cognitive skills that help organize our lives and regulate our behavior.\n\nThe results suggest that video-game-based brain training is an effective option to improve cognitive abilities of patients with MS.\n\nIn the future, the researchers hope to study whether the plasticity induced by video games in MS patients is also related to improvements in other aspects of their daily lives. They also plan to look at how the video game can be integrated into a rehabilitation program together with other rehabilitative techniques.\n\n\"Multiple Sclerosis: Changes in Thalamic Resting-State Functional Connectivity Induced by a Home-based Cognitive Rehabilitation Program.\" Collaborating with Dr. De Giglio were Francesca Tona, M.D., Francesca De Luca, Psy.D., Nikolaos Petsas, M.D., Ph.D., Luca Prosperini, M.D., Ph.D., Valentina Bianchi, Psy.D., Carlo Pozzilli, M.D., Ph.D., and Patrizia Pantano, M.D.\n\nRadiology is edited by Herbert Y.

McEvoy, MD, MCR, and her co-authors report that at three months of age, the infants whose mothers took 500 mg of vitamin C in addition to their prenatal vitamin had significantly better forced expiratory flows (FEFs). FEFs measure how fast air can be exhaled from the lung and are an important measure of lung function because they can detect airway obstruction.\n\nThe researchers also discovered an association between the infant FEFs and a genetic variant some of the mothers possessed that appeared to amplify the negative impact of nicotine on the babies before they were born. Other studies have linked this genetic factor, specifically for the \u03b15 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, to increased risk of lung cancer and obstructive lung disease.\n\n\u201cSmoking during pregnancy reflects the highly addictive nature of nicotine that disproportionately affects the most vulnerable populations,\u201d said Dr. McEvoy, lead study author and professor of pediatrics at Oregon Health & Science University. \u201cFinding a way to help infants exposed to smoking and nicotine in utero recognizes the unique dangers posed by a highly advertised, addictive product and the lifetime effects on offspring who did not choose to be exposed.\u201d\n\nIn a previous study, the authors had shown that 72 hours after birth, babies of mothers who smoked had better lung function if their mothers were randomized to vitamin C (500 mg/day) during their pregnancies compared to those born to mothers who smoked and were randomized to placebo. That study used passive methods to measure lung function, and the authors note that FEFs provide a more direct assessment of airway function and are similar to methods used to diagnose lung disease in adults and older children.\n\nIn the current study, 251 pregnant women who smoked were randomly assigned at 13 to 23 weeks of gestation to either receive vitamin C (125 women) or a placebo (126 women). Smoking was defined as having had one or more cigarettes in the last week. All participants received smoking cessation counseling throughout the study, and about 10 percent of the women quit smoking during the study.\n\nThe researchers wrote that study results support the hypothesis that oxidative stress caused by cigarette smoking reduces the amount of ascorbic acid, a component of vitamin C, available to the body. At the time they enrolled in the study, the women had lower levels of ascorbic acid than have been reported among women who do not smoke. Those levels rose in study participants who received vitamin C to become comparable to women who do not smoke.\n\nInfants in this study will continue to be followed to track their lung function and respiratory outcomes. The authors believe that future trials of vitamin C supplementation in pregnant smokers should determine whether the benefits are greater if the supplementation starts earlier and continues postnatally in the babies themselves.\n\nSumming up the findings of the current study, Dr. McEvoy said that a relatively low dosage of vitamin C may present \u201ca safe and inexpensive intervention that has the potential to help lung health of millions of infants worldwide.\u201d\n\nHowever, she added, helping mothers quit smoking should remain the primary goal for health professionals and public health officials. \u201cAlthough vitamin C supplementation may protect to some extent the lungs of babies born to mothers who smoke during pregnancy, those children will still be at greater risk for obesity, behavioral disorders and other serious health issues,\u201d she said.\n\nThis study was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the Office of Dietary Supplements.\n\n\u201cFor mothers who smoke during pregnancy, vitamin C may reduce harm #smoking causes to their babies\u2019 #lungs, finds new study of #vitaminC supplementation. #Nosmokingduringpregnancy.\u201d\n\nAbout the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine\n\nThe AJRCCM is a peer-reviewed journal published by the American Thoracic Society.

And, increasingly, it resonates for Westerners.\n\nMove over, pomegranate and acai berry. Coconuts are the new \u201cin\u201d food, touted by natural-foods enthusiasts and chased by entrepreneurs looking for a big payday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good time to own a coconut farm, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Daniel Fabricant, vice president for government and scientific affairs at the Natural Products Association, a trade association in Washington.\n\nFabricant said companies that belong to his organization, representing natural-foods retailers and manufacturers, are increasingly offering coconut-based products.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got fiber, fats and oils, water-based compounds, and you\u2019ve got the milk,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a holistic approach.\u201d\n\nThe fruit\u2019s appeal rests, in part, on this versatility. A single coconut produces water, nectar, flesh, milk and even textile fiber. That translates into a broad slate of products. And in contrast to another natural substance that gets transformed into a wide variety of products \u2014 petroleum \u2014 coconuts are viewed as healthy.\n\nBut are they?\n\nCoconut water comes from young, green coconuts and contains a winning combination of electrolytes, sodium and potassium.\n\nIt is very healthy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an effective drink for rehydration that doesn\u2019t bring in the added sugars and the additives,\u201d said Dani Little, dietitian for the Whole Foods Market on Pearl Street in Boulder. \u201cA lot of rehydrating beverages have additives, whereas the coconut water \u2014 it\u2019s super clean.\u201d\n\nCoconut oil and milk, though, are receiving mixed reviews.\n\nCoconut fat is saturated, like the fat in lard and butter. The healthiest fats, those found in olive and canola oils, contain more monounsaturated fats, which do not raise LDL cholesterol and might even help lower it. Doctors and dietitians have warned people away from cholesterol-boosting saturated fats for years. Coconut fats are not an exception.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had clients who have added coconut oil to shakes and things like that, and their cholesterol has gone up significantly,\u201d said Jessica Crandall, a Denver dietitian who is president of the Colorado Dietetic Association. \u201cSaturated fat clogs your arteries and is not good for heart health. I was meeting with a cardiologist recently, and he said he doesn\u2019t advise (coconut oil) for any clients.\u201d\n\nThe fat issue is complicated by the types of fatty acids found in coconut, versus other saturated fats. While most other saturated fats contain \u201clong- chain\u201d fatty acids, most coconut fats are \u201cmedium-chain.\u201d\n\nThis is advantageous for coconuts because the medium-chain fatty acids are broken down more rapidly by enzymes, said Little. In general, she said, fats high in medium-chain fatty acids are more healthy than those laden with long-chain acids.\n\nIn addition, coconut fats are high in lauric acid, which many believe acts as an antimicrobial, helping prevent viruses, fungi and parasites.\n\nEven so, Little, a coconut enthusiast, doesn\u2019t recommend loading up on coconut fats. Instead of buying oils or supplements, just use the whole coconut.\n\n\u201cWhat we tend to do with our food supply is take the positive and squeeze it into a pill or jar and think that will take care of everything,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you focus on coconut oil, you lose out on the fiber and you are focusing on a concentrated source of calories. It\u2019s the whole coconut that needs to be talked about.\u201d\n\nEntrepreneurs are talking about the whole coconut these days. Some \u2014 those toiling to make money with coconut water \u2014 are worried about the coconut supply.\n\nCoconut water \u201cis much different from Red Bull or Vitamin Water,\u201d said John Craven, the founder of Bevnet.com, a trade publication for the beverage industry. \u201cIf they want to make more, they just build more factories.\u201d\n\nCraven describes the race to turn coconut water into a big market, like iced tea or energy drinks, as something akin to a gold rush.\n\n\u201cRight now, coconut water is all the rage,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the natural movement being in the forefront right now, the timing is right. In the past couple of years a couple of brands have figured out the right angle \u2014 electrolytes and hydration.\u201d\n\nCraven estimated the coconut-water market at about $100 million annually right now, but companies are doubling their sales year after year. By next year, he said, one company alone \u2014 Vita Coco \u2014 could do $100 million or more in sales. He predicted within a few years it will be a billion-dollar market.\n\nMammoth beverage companies like Coca-Cola, Dr Pepper Snapple Group, and PepsiCo have investments in coconut water. Grocers shelves add new coconut-water products regularly.\n\n\u201cDemand has increased exponentially, primarily in mainstream groceries like Walmart and Costco,\u201d said Arthur Gallego, a spokesman for the New York-based Vita Coco. \u201cIt\u2019s trickling down to the mass market.\u201d\n\nThe company is growing so quickly, he said, it had to hunt for coconuts from outside of Brazil, where it previously harvested most of its fruit. Now it also gets coconuts from Asia.\n\n\u201cThe volume is going through the roof,\u201d said Laura Sauls, a spokeswoman for Hermosa Beach, Calif.-based Zico. \u201cWe are seeing new competitors by the week.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the pure water that is exciting marketers.

Ketamine infusion therapy, the controversial treatment for depression, has been resisted by many physicians due to concerns about short-lived benefits, risks of addiction, and the lack of large scale studies. In contrast, this retrospective study of over three years of clinical experience, shows lasting benefits for many patients, with no apparent risk of addiction. Through a handful of ketamine infusions directed by Theodore Henderson, MD, PhD, refractory depression symptoms can be relieved significantly and persistently. Evidence points to the regeneration of brain cells as a critical mechanism for the relief of depression, as published in peer-reviewed journal Neural Regeneration Research, February 2016 issue.\n\nThe study, \"Practical application of the neuroregenerative properties of ketamine: real world treatment experience,\" addresses key points in the controversy surrounding the use of intravenous ketamine for the treatment of depression. Its findings stand in direct contrast to warnings from the American Psychiatric Association (APA).\n\nWhile controversial in academic settings, Dr. Henderson said his direct experience supports a different strategy for multiple-infusion treatment regimens and his clinical experience shows ketamine can invoke long-lasting effects often with less than six infusions.\n\n\"The wealth of clinical experience from treating hundreds of patients with ketamine has supplanted the preliminary data that emerged from the initial open-label and small double-blinded studies,\" said Dr. Henderson, who is a board certified psychiatrist, specializing in diagnosing and treating complex conditions, based in Denver, Colorado. He is also the co-founder of Neuro-Luminance Ketamine Infusion Centers.\n\nPatients in the study completed the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-SR), among other scales, and 80% showed persistent positive response to the ketamine infusions treatments.\n\nKetamine is a dissociative anesthetic in use since 1970's. Intravenous administration over a prolonged period of time is key to its persistent antidepressant benefit.\n\nDepression is associated with neuron loss, reduced synapse numbers, and dearborization of dendrites. Ketamine appears to potently induce mechanisms which reverse these neuro-degenerative processes. Citing over 60 published scientific research studies, the new research article also reviews the molecular mechanisms by which ketamine invokes a robust activation of the brain's own repair mechanisms. Another conclusion Dr. Henderson highlights is ketamine infusions can relieve refractory depression symptoms persistently, perhaps for years.\n\n\"Activation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) appears to have an important role in the antidepressant effects of ketamine. BDNF induces synaptogenesis, dendritic arborization, improved neuronal health, and neurogenesis. These processes likely underlie the persistent benefits of ketamine.\"\n\nDr. Henderson's findings challenge the oft-held beliefs that ketamine must be given frequently to have any benefit and that ketamine has no long-lasting benefit.\n\nDr. Henderson stated, \"Misconceptions about ketamine abound among psychiatrists, particularly related to possible chemical dependence problems. However, the neurobiological basis of its benefit for depression has nothing to do with causing addictive risk. Our patients get better after a few infusions and from there treatments can be discontinued.\" The study also challenges concerns about neurotoxicity and a recent hypothesis that patients must experience hallucinations during ketamine infusion in order to have an anti-depressant benefit.\n\nPlease visit Neuro-Luminance or call (855) 978-0808 for more information.", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The release doesn\u2019t define depression or give any sense of its prevalence or impact.

False positives are an initial finding of cancer that turns out to be benign based on additional testing. Interval cancers are those found between mammograms, either through additional tests or symptoms.\n\nThe researchers evaluated 12 years of data from 58,870 screening mammograms in 19,078 women with early-stage breast cancer and an equal number of mammograms in another 55,315 women who had never had breast cancer. The women were matched on such factors as age and breast density, a risk factor for cancer, with higher density increasing risk.\n\nWithin a year of the screening, 655 cancers were found in women with a breast cancer history and 342 in those without.\n\nMammograms had detected 76.5 percent of the cancers in women who had never had breast cancer and 65.4 percent in those who had previously had the disease. As for false positives, 1 percent of the women without a history of breast cancer were referred for biopsy but ended up being cancer-free, compared with 1.7 percent of those with a breast cancer history.\n\nThe interval cancer rate was 3.6 per 1,000 screenings in those with a history and 1.4 per 1,000 in those without, the investigators found.\n\nWomen with a history of breast cancer were also more likely to be called back for additional imaging or biopsies: 18 percent called back, compared with 8.3 percent of the others.\n\n\"I think it's mostly positive news,\" Miglioretti said. \"Of the ones that are missed, most of them are early stage.\" It points to the need, she said, for women to remain vigilant about screening after their breast cancer treatment -- and to report any symptoms to their doctor immediately.\n\nDr. William Audeh, medical director of the Samuel Oschin Cancer Center and the Wasserman Breast Cancer Risk Reduction Program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, described the findings as \"not at all surprising.\" He reviewed the study but was not involved in it.\n\nAfter surgery and radiation, he said, a woman's breasts have changed, and there is a greater chance that a radiologist will think that something is abnormal simply because of the changes. \"That helps explain the false positives,\" Audeh said.\n\nAnd though mammography did not catch all cancers in the women with a breast cancer history, the study still points out the value of the test, he said.\n\nRobert Smith, director of cancer screening for the American Cancer Society, agreed.\n\n\"Despite poorer performance compared with women without a prior history of breast cancer, overall screening mammography was effective at detecting the majority of breast cancer in women with a [history] at an early favorable stage, with the majority of tumors being diagnosed as ductal carcinoma in situ or stage 1,\" Smith said.\n\nA trend among cancer specialists, Audeh said, is to tailor follow-up for a woman who has had breast cancer.

It is produced when enzymes act to convert a precursor molecule, angiotensinogen. Lisinopril is a member of a drug family called ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors. Other examples of ACE inhibitors are benazepril (Lotensin), enalapril (Vasotec) and ramipril (Altace).\n\nReducing angiotensin production by giving ACE inhibitors can lower blood pressure. The same effect can be achieved with drugs that block the cell receptors through which angiotensin acts. Called angiotensin receptor blockers, these drugs have a greater protective effect against dementia than ACE inhibitors, the study found. Such drugs include candesartan (Atacand), irbesartan (Avapro), losartan (Cozaar) and valsartan (Diovan).\n\nIn the study, men taking an angiotensin receptor blocker had a 24 percent lower incidence of dementia than those taking other cardiovascular drugs. The risk was 19 percent lower for men taking ACE inhibitors. The risk was nearly halved for those taking both angiotensin-targeting drugs.\n\nIn men with Alzheimer's disease, use of an angiotensin receptor blocker reduced admission to nursing homes by half. Combined angiotensin medication therapy reduced nursing home admissions by two-thirds.\n\nWolozin said that it's not clear why the drugs would have a beneficial effect on the brain, but improved blood flow probably plays a role.\n\n\"If you get no blood to the brain, you're not going to think well,\" he said. \"Also, in brain cells there is more than one kind of angiotensin receptor. By blocking bad receptors, you are left with the good ones so that helps neurons become more resilient.\"\n\nBut the evidence is not sufficient to support routine use of angiotensin receptor blockers to prevent Alzheimer's disease, Wolozin said. The new report describes an observational study, one that lacks the strict controls that are needed for convincing proof.\n\n\"Any study like this is hypothesis-generating,\" he said. \"You only know for sure when you have done clinical prospective trials.\"\n\nHis advice for anyone considering angiotensin receptors blockers to reduce dementia risk: \"They should consult with their physicians.\" There are potential hazards, such as too-low blood pressure that can lead to damaging falls, Wolozin said.\n\nCaution was urged by Dr. Richard B. Lipton, vice chairman of neurology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, who has done work on the genetics of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThe angiotensin hypothesis makes sense, Lipton said, because improved blood flow to the brain helps nerve cells and reduces formation of Alzheimer's-related amyloid protein.\n\nBut there have been a number of observational studies implicating various molecules, including estrogens, in dementia, he said. \"The sequence is that when you do the randomized trial, you don't get the same effect,\" Lipton said.\n\nOn the other hand, such randomized trials usually include people who are close to having Alzheimer's disease, and \"it could be different if you gave the drugs earlier,\" Lipton said.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has more on blood pressure medications.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There is no overt disease-mongering of dementia in the story.

Smoking cigarettes causes 480,000 premature deaths each year due mainly to a two-fold risk of cardiovascular disease and a 20-fold risk of lung cancer. In a commentary published in the current issue of the American Journal of Medicine, researchers from the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine at Florida Atlantic University reassure clinicians and their patients that varenicline, whose brand name is Chantix, is a safe and effective way to achieve smoking cessation and that failure to use this drug has caused preventable heart attacks and deaths from cardiovascular disease.\n\nIn 2006, varenicline was approved as a safe and effective means to quit smoking and achieved permanent quit rates of approximately 25 percent. In 2009, however, varenicline received a black box warning by the FDA based on their adverse event reports of neuropsychiatric symptoms like depression and thoughts of suicide.\n\nThere were plausible alternative explanations including that nearly half of the subjects had psychiatric histories, 42 percent were taking psychotropic drugs and about 42 percent were suffering from depression. Nonetheless, since then, there has been a 76 percent decline in the number of prescriptions dispensed from a peak of about 2 million in the last quarter of 2007 to about 531,000 in the first quarter of 2014.\n\nIn their commentary, the FAU researchers emphasize that, until recently, the totality of randomized evidence on varenicline had been restricted to eight small trials, which did not demonstrate a hazard. The researchers caution that the reliable detection of small to moderate risks and benefits of drug therapies requires cogent data from large-scale randomized trials designed a priori to test the hypothesis.\n\nSuch a large randomized trial was recently completed that included both apparently healthy individuals as well as those with severe mental illness. The trial was conducted for 12 weeks on about 8,000 long-term smokers and included equal subgroups of those without as well as with psychiatric disorders. In subjects without psychiatric disorders, those treated with varenicline had less neuropsychiatric symptoms and in subjects without psychiatric disorders there were no increases in these symptoms. Both groups of participants assigned at random to varenicline achieved significantly higher abstinence rates at 12 weeks than those assigned to placebo, nicotine patch or bupropion. Just a few months ago, the FDA removed the black box warning from varenicline.\n\nThe commentary was coauthored by Dianna Gaballa, a fourth-year medical student; Joanna Drowos, D.O., M.P.H., an associate professor of integrated medical science and associate chair of the Department of Integrated Medical Science; and Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., Dr.P.H., the first Sir Richard Doll Professor and senior academic advisor to the dean, all in FAU's Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine.\n\n\"The existing totality of evidence suggests an urgent need to increase the use of varenicline in the general population as well as in those with serious mental illness who on average die about 20 years earlier than the general population, in part, because their smoking rates may be as high as 75 percent,\" said Hennekens.\n\nQuitting smoking significantly reduces risks of cardiovascular disease beginning within a matter of months and reaching the non-smoker status within a few years, even among older adults. For lung and other cancers, however, reductions do not even begin to emerge for years after quitting and, even after 10 years, quitters achieve death rates only about midway between the continuing smoker and non-smoker.\n\n\"For reducing risks of cardiovascular disease it's never too late to quit, but to reduce risks of cancer, it's never too early,\" said Hennekens.\n\nThe authors speculate that if use of varenicline had not plummeted by 76 percent following the black box warning in 2009, perhaps 17,000 premature deaths from cardiovascular disease may have been avoided each year during the last few years. Public health efforts and effective cessation treatments including behavioral counseling and medication have resulted in a 14 percent decrease in smoking in the U.S. while the rates are markedly increasing in developing countries.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heart disease is the leading killer among men and women causing approximately 600,000 deaths each year.\n\nAmong the numerous honors and recognitions Hennekens has received include the Ochsner Award for reducing premature deaths from cigarettes in 2014. From 1995 to 2005, Science Watch ranked him as the third most widely cited medical researcher in the world and five of the top 20 were his former trainees and/or fellows. In 2012, Science Heroes ranked Hennekens No. 81 in the history of the world for having saved more than 1.1 million lives.

Other effects included improving patients' physical quality of life, improving their insulin levels and ability to use glucose - which may reduce their risk for diabetes - and even altering the composition of their gut bacteria.\n\nThe study speaks both to the benefits of bariatric surgery and to the tremendous toll obesity takes on health. \"If you look at cancers in women, about a fifth of all cancer deaths would be prevented if we had women at normal body weight in the U.S.,\" said Susan C. Modesitt, MD, of the University of Virginia Cancer Center. \"When you're looking at obesity-related cancers, the biggest one is endometrial cancer, but also colon cancer, breast cancer, renal cancer and gall bladder cancer. We think about 40 [percent] to 50 percent of all endometrial cancer, which is in the lining of the uterus, is caused by obesity.\"\n\nThe study looked at 71 women with a mean age of 44.2 years and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 50.9. Women are considered obese at a BMI of 30 and morbidly obese at 40 (which is typically about 100 pounds over a woman's ideal body weight), yet almost a third of women presenting for bariatric surgery did not identify themselves as obese.\n\nThe study looked at the effects of bariatric surgery in a relatively short timeframe, one to three years after surgery. A total of 68 participants underwent the procedure; two opted out of the surgery, and another died of a heart condition prior to surgery. The effects of surgery on body weight were dramatic: Mean weight loss was more than 100 pounds.\n\nTen percent of study participants who had not had a hysterectomy showed precancerous changes in the lining of the uterus, and all of those resolved with weight loss. \"We're talking about small numbers, really tiny numbers\" of study participants, Modesitt said, noting one limitation of the study. \"So I could never say that effect is definitive, but it is suggestive, given that we know already the incredibly strong link between endometrial cancer and obesity.\"\n\nModesitt, of the UVA's Division of Gynecologic Oncology in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, was most surprised by the dramatic changes seen in the patients' metabolic profiles derived from the gut microbiome, the population of microorganisms living inside us. \"The study results demonstrate that there is a huge alteration, but I don't even know what to say about that, except it is really new and intriguing area to look at in the link between obesity and cancer. For example, before groundbreaking work by Dr. John Marshall at UVA in the past, no one knew that ulcers were from bacteria. Who knows what role the gut bacteria play in promoting obesity, but metabolic parameter/markers of the bacteria definitely changed after [study participants] lost weight.\"\n\nWhile the study speaks to the transformative effect bariatric surgery can have, Modesitt urged people to avoid gaining weight in the first place and for those seeking to lose weight to exercise and eat more healthily before turning to surgery. \"We really should be working on diet and exercise from the get-go in our entire society, starting with our children. And exercise does seem to be protective -- even if you don't lose all the weight, it absolutely has beneficial effects,\" she said. \"There are lots of studies showing if you exercise, it improves your insulin, your glucose, all of those sorts of things that go along with the cancer-causing effect.

Before researchers try a compound on humans, it\u2019s tested at labs in petri dishes and on animals, such as mice and monkeys. More often than not, these studies produce mixed data that don\u2019t tell researchers much about whether it is safe and effective for humans.\n\nFor some time, scientists have been searching for ways to cut down on the cost and failure rate of drug testing. Researchers at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University have developed a beautiful solution: Organs-On-Chips.\n\nThe clear and flexible polymer microchips are lined with human cells. Each one represents a different human organ system, such as lungs, heart and intestines. The institute\u2019s goal is to create 10 different organ systems that can be joined together by blood vessel channels to simulate human physiology on a microscale and provide a cheaper, more reliable way to test new drugs.\n\nThe sophisticated architecture of these organs-on-chips\u2014which are about the size of a thumb drive\u2014has also earned the Wyss Institute recognition in the art world with a Design of the Year award from the Design Museum and placement in the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s permanent collection.\n\n\u201cThe real power of this approach is that you have a window to the inner workings of life,\u201d says Don Ingber, founding director of the Wyss Institute and a professor of Vascular Biology and of Bioengineering at Harvard University. \u201cAnything you can ask at the molecular level, we could do in our chips.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, the team built and tested its first \u201corganoid\u201d chip to mimic the mechanical function of human lungs. It contains tiny channels separated by a porous membrane to create two distinct, hollow passageways\u2014one lined with human lung cells and the other with capillary blood vessel cells. Air is suctioned through the side channels to emulate breathing. Ingber and his team introduced bacteria into the chip\u2019s lung channel and white blood cells into the capillary channel. They observed that the white blood cells permeated the membrane and attacked the bacteria in the lung cell channel\u2014exactly what would happen in human lungs fighting off an infection.\n\nIn another experiment, the team at Wyss filled a chip\u2019s lung cell channel with interleukin 2, a chemotherapy drug known to cause pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs. When air entered the lung cell channel, the channel filled with fluid and then blood clots\u2014exactly what happens in the lungs of patients who develop this life-threatening condition. This proved the chips could provide real world information to scientists studying the effects of new drug compounds.\n\nThe project has received support from the National Institutes of Health and the FDA. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency also recently awarded the institute a $37 million grant to create chips representing nearly all systems in the body. Ingber says some scientists are interested in using the chips to conduct research that would be unethical if performed on people, such as studying the effects of gamma radiation on the human body.\n\nOf course, the chips have limitations. \u201cWe can\u2019t mimic consciousness; we can\u2019t mimic compression on a joint,\u201d says Ingber.\n\nDanilo Tagle, associate director for special initiatives at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, a division of the NIH, is spearheading a similar organ-on-chip project. He suspects that in the beginning the chips will be used to \u201ccomplement and supplement\u201d animal studies, but will eventually become routine practice. The chips will also provide researchers with information on dosing at a much earlier stage in drug studies\u2014particularly helpful because animals metabolize chemical substances at a different rate than humans. \u201cYou can go forward with a candidate drug with greater assurance and confidence that it will have the desired effect on humans,\u201d says Tagle. \u201cBiology is very complex.\u201d\n\nIncorporating the chips into drug testing could save millions of dollars and years of time on research. Some companies are already trying out the concept. Janssen Pharmaceuticals Company, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, is using a version of the chips to understand how blood clots in the lungs. The information is essential to reduce the risk for this side effect of oncology drugs.\n\nThough there still aren\u2019t enough data to prove the chips are reliable enough to put rodents out of a job, Ingber says it\u2019s only a matter of time; they hope to have them tested and ready for market in two years. \u201cThe FDA has been very supportive,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve told us if they are as good as animals that they would consider accepting data provided by a drug company from one of these models rather than an animal model.\u201d", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "This story addresses a new technology that can potentially improve the testing of new therapeutics.

Now, according to scientists at the University of Colorado, there is even evidence that the healthy fat can boost your chances of getting pregnant.\n\nThe study, presented at the American Society of Reproductive Medicine annual meeting, was in mice, so more research needs to be completed before omega 3 foods or supplements become part of treatment for infertility. But Dr. Malgorzata Skaznik-Wikiel, an obstetrician-gynecologist who led the study, is encouraged. She worked with a group of mice that are genetically bred to have healthy ratios of omega 3 fatty acids. These mice are born with the ability to bathe cells and tissues in omega 3 fats, so the team then looked at their egg development in the ovaries.\n\nWhat she found: The mice with the higher levels of omega 3 fatty acids seemed to have more precursors to egg cells than control mice with lower levels of the fat, meaning they had a larger reserve of eggs-to-be. These could then mature into a healthy egg that is fertilized and can lead to a live birth. When the ovaries were examined even further, Skaznik-Wikiel also found that the quality of the eggs were better among the animals with higher levels of omega 3s. Higher quality eggs improves the chances that the egg will be fertilized and develop into a live pup.\n\n\u201cBased on this study, it looks very encouraging that omega 3s can potentially improve fertility,\u201d says Skaznik-Wikiel. \u201cOur study shows that there may be some relationship between dietary factors and things like egg quality so one idea may be recommending supplementation with omega 3s to improve fertility.\u201d\n\nExactly how the healthy omega 3 fatty acids are helping the ovary to produce better quality eggs isn\u2019t clear yet. But other studies Skaznik-Wikiel has done with mice suggests that these fats may lower levels of inflammation that can adversely affect ovarian function.\n\nMore studies need to replicate and confirm the role that omega 3 fatty acids might play in fertility, but for now, Skaznik-Wikiel says that there isn\u2019t much harm in consuming more omega 3 fats.

On Monday, June 12, I took the train down to Washington to be hooked up while the annual meeting of the American Diabetes Association was in town.\n\nThe device, made by Medtronic MiniMed, is called the Paradigm Real-Time, a combination insulin pump and continuous glucose sensor. The sensor doesn\u2019t control the pump but allows a diabetic to make quicker, presumably better decisions. I\u2019d already been on a stand-alone MiniMed pump for a few years, but I found it only an incremental improvement over taking insulin by injection.\n\nLike the pump, the sensor requires injecting a tiny catheter (less than an inch long) into the midsection of the body, and changing it every three days to avoid infection. The sensor has a coated tip that measures the electrical conductivity of the interstitial fluid, the juice floating between fat cells right under the skin. As luck would have it, the conductivity is directly proportional to how much glucose is floating around in the juice.\n\nEven with the help of an expert trainer from MiniMed, I found that injecting the catheter took much more dexterity than injecting one for a pump. It has to be placed above the hip or the buttocks, which makes reaching it awkward, and then the wire leading from the sensor has to be connected to a transmitter that wirelessly sends the information to the pump.\n\nWhen everything was in, I had two catheters and the transmitter all taped to my body, plus the pump hanging on my belt. Kind of weird, but kind of cool, in a sci-fi way, and I remained thrilled at the prospect of seeing my first glucose reading.\n\nThen the waiting began. The sensor needs three hours to settle in before it can begin transmitting data. By late afternoon, when it was supposed to start, I got an error message instead. When I tried to recalibrate it a half-hour later, it still wasn\u2019t working right, so I had to remove it and inject a second one. It was after 9 p.m. before the second one finally began working.\n\nAt first, I was transfixed by the numbers as they were updated every five minutes. That night, however, the sensor kept beeping me awake, nearly every hour, warning that my glucose level was too high.\n\nI kept following the recommendations of the embedded calculator, taking only very small amounts of insulin to bring my sugar level down. But by morning, I was still high, so I followed my own usual guesstimate and took much more.\n\nTwo hours later, while attending a session at the diabetes association meetings, in which four experts talked about the new sensors, I heard mine beep again, this time warning me that my glucose level was plummeting. I quickly drank a juice box, and within minutes my numbers started leveling off. I had avoided my first low. All the hassles of the past 24 hours were forgiven. This bionic diabetic was in rapture.\n\nOver the next six weeks of testing, I came down to earth as I realized that while the sensor enabled me to drastically cut my usual number of lows, it did not eliminate them.\n\nThe main problem was that the sensor was simply not as accurate as a blood-glucose tester. MiniMed\u2019s studies show the sensor\u2019s accuracy can be off by as much as 18 percent. Another sensor, just approved by the F.D.A. and made by DexCom, is said by some researchers to be a bit more accurate, as is a third device, from Abbot, which has not yet been approved. But none are as accurate as a standard blood-sugar test.\n\nI also had three sensor catheters slip out and require early replacement, which would be especially annoying to anyone paying the $35 that each sensor costs; I wasn\u2019t, because MiniMed had supplied everything free for testing, but everybody else will, since the sensors are not yet covered by insurance. With each catheter intended to last just three days, the bill comes to $350 a month.\n\nBut the bottom line is that over the entire six weeks I had only a few lows that left me feeling woozy, the kind I used to put up with two or three times a week.\n\nOn July 24, my test period over, I felt like Mr. Magoo without his glasses.

They noted that dupilumab has also shown the ability to tame atopic dermatitis, or severe eczema, an allergic condition that is not well controlled by current treatments.\n\nResults of the 12-week asthma study are being presented on Tuesday at the annual scientific meeting of the American Thoracic Society in Philadelphia.\n\nThe medicine, if approved, could hold promise for patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma that is not well controlled by standard drugs.\n\n\u201cWe have been treating asthma with sort of Band-Aid therapies that didn\u2019t get at the underlying causes,\u201d Wenzel said in an interview, adding that dupilumab could be an important step in going to the root of the problem.\n\nThe drug works by simultaneously blocking proteins that have been linked to inflammation, interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13).\n\nWenzel, director of the Asthma Institute at the University of Pittsburgh, said other drugmakers have tested medicines that block one or both of the proteins, but without success.\n\nThe trial recruited patients with high levels of eosinophils, a biomarker that shows immune system cells called type 2 helper T cells (Th2 cells) associated with allergy and asthma have been activated.\n\nSuch patients were deemed likely to benefit from treatment.\n\nAll patients initially stayed on their standard asthma treatments, meaning medium-to-high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids, as well as long-acting beta agonists. But patients gradually tapered off on those drugs and were no longer taking either of them after 9 weeks.\n\nThroughout the Phase IIa trial, half the patients also received weekly injections of dupilumab, while half received placebo injections.\n\nAfter the ninth week, 25 percent of those on placebos had experienced exacerbations, a catch-all term that included the need to take a beta agonist, a decrease in lung function, the need for an oral or inhaled corticosteroid, or if the patient went to the hospital or emergency room for worsening asthma.\n\n\u201cBy end of the trial, after 12 weeks, 44 percent of those in the placebo group had exacerbations, compared with 5 percent of those on dupilumab,\u201d Wenzel said. That represented an 87 percent reduction in exacerbations, which was highly statistically significant.\n\nWenzel said dupilumab was well tolerated, with side effects similar to placebo. But she cautioned that longer trials are needed to fully assess the drug.\n\nRegeneron and Sanofi said standard drugs are unable to control asthma in 10 to 20 percent of patients. They estimate that inflammation caused by Th2 cells - the type of inflammation among patients they tested - affects up to 2.5 million people in the United States and up to 30 million worldwide.\n\nDupilumab has also shown strong hints of safety and effectiveness in two early-stage trials that involved 67 patients with atopic dermatitis. Larger studies are slated to begin later this year.\n\nAtopic dermatitis is inherited and involves patches of highly itchy skin on any part of the body. Patients, many of whom also have asthma and hay fever, have compared the sensation to having unending poison ivy.\n\n\u201cThis asthma data and the data we already have in atopic dermatitis really raises the possibility the scientific community has finally hit upon the key pathway across all these allergic diseases,\u201d George Yancopoulos, Regeneron\u2019s research chief, said in an interview.\n\nTrial results were also reported on Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, along with an editorial that said results of the study appeared \u201ccompelling\u201d at first glance and superior to those seen in previous studies of other asthma drugs.\n\nBut the editorial said effectiveness of dupilumab has been established in just a \u201climited subpopulation of patients with asthma\u201d because only 21 percent of those screened for enrollment in the study met its criteria.\n\n\u201cWe do not know whether dupilumab will be effective in other patient populations,\u201d the editorial said, including patients that stay on their standard therapies and who do not have high levels of eosinophils.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There is no disease mongering in this story.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Why should women bear the brunt of infertility testing?

It is estimated that about one in every 100 people in the UK has ASD, with more boys diagnosed with the condition than girls.\n\nScientists said their research found a link between ASD and damage to proteins in blood plasma. They found the most reliable of the tests they developed was examining protein in blood plasma, which found children with ASD had higher levels of the oxidation marker dityrosine (DT) and certain sugar-modified compounds called advanced glycation end-products (AGEs).\n\nGenetic causes are thought to be responsible for about a third of cases of ASD, while the rest are believed to be caused by a combination of environmental factors, mutations, and rare genetic variants. However, researchers believe their new tests could reveal yet-to-be-identified causes of ASD.\n\nThey also confirmed the previously held belief that mutations of amino acid transporters are a genetic variant associated with ASD.\n\nThe Warwick team worked with collaborators at the University of Bologna in Italy, who recruited 38 children who had been diagnosed with ASD along with a control group of 31 other children between the ages of five and 12. Blood and urine samples were taken from the children for analysis.\n\nThe Warwick team discovered there were chemical differences between the two groups. Working with a further collaborator at the University of Birmingham, the changes in multiple compounds were combined using artificial intelligence algorithm techniques to develop a mathematical equation to distinguish between ASD and healthy controls. The outcome was a diagnostic test better than any existing method.\n\nThey said the next steps were to repeat the study with further groups of children to confirm the good diagnostic performance and to assess if the test could identify ASD at very early stages, indicate how the ASD is likely to develop further to more severe disease, and assess if treatments were working.\n\nThe research was led by Naila Rabbani, reader of experimental systems biology at the University of Warwick, who said: \u201cOur discovery could lead to earlier diagnosis and intervention.

In two scenarios, participants spent a night being sleep-deprived in a lab and then spent 45 minutes in dim or bright light before a driving test. For a third test, people got a good nights\u2019 sleep at home and then went to the lab for 45 minutes of bright light exposure before a driving test.\n\nAfter sleep deprivation in the lab, five people exposed to dim light therapy got in car accidents during the driving simulations. None of the people who slept at home crashed, and neither did any of the sleep-deprived people who got bright light therapy before getting behind the wheel, the study found.\n\n\u201cWe experience severe sleepiness toward the end of the night shift, and this may overlap with our commute time,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Ralph Mistlberger of Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada.\n\n\u201cSleep deprivation makes this worse of course, and together with the clock, this conspires to impair our ability to sustain attention to task (e.g., driving), and avoid distraction, and react quickly to external stimuli like traffic lights, brake lights in front of you, road signs, etc,\u201d Mistlberger added by email.\n\nSleepiness is a leading risk factor for automobile accidents because it can make drivers less vigilant, slow reaction times and dull cognitive abilities, researchers note in Sleep Medicine.\n\nShift workers with chronic sleep deprivation also face an increased risk of accidents. Strategies like drinking coffee or soda, napping before a drive or blasting music or rolling down the windows in the car may help increase alertness behind the wheel, but none of these strategies is fool-proof.\n\nFor the current study, researchers wanted to see if bright light might help reduce driving impairments related to sleep deprivation.\n\nThey found participants had lower body temperatures after spending a sleep-deprived night in the lab, as well as longer reaction times and increased sleepiness.\n\nExposure to bright light didn\u2019t appear to improve reaction times or sleepiness. But light was associated with better driving.\n\nBeyond its small size, other limitations of the study include the reliance on lab conditions for sleep deprivation and light exposure, which may not match what shift workers would experience on the job, the authors note.\n\n\u201cThere is evidence that the use of bright light at the office (or even at home directly prior to beginning the work shift) may be beneficial in preventing sleep deprivation-related motor vehicle collisions,\u201d said Russell Griffin, a researcher at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\n\u201cThat said, there is not enough evidence to date to fully suggest the use of bright light therapy to avoid collision,\u201d Griffin added by email.\n\nThe proven way to avoid the effects of sleepiness on the road is to consistently get enough sleep, said Dr. Flaura Koplin Winston, a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania and the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\n\u201cDrowsy driving is perhaps the most under-recognized cause of serious crashes and sadly, the evidence is not there on how to counter it,\u201d Winston said by email.\n\nMore research is needed on the potential of bright light therapy to make exhausted drivers safer, said Dr. Donald Redelmeier, a researcher at the University of Toronto who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\nBut there are still things drivers can do now to stay safer on the road.\n\n\u201cSafety strategies while driving can include minimizing distractions, stopping at stop signs, respecting speed limits, yielding right-of-way, buckling a seatbelt, signaling all turns and not driving after drinking alcohol,\u201d Redelmeier said.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "Sleepy drivers are dangerous drivers, so this study focuses on a real risk.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "LONDON (Reuters) - Men who have a certain genetic variations that put them at higher risk of prostate cancer may benefit from regular screening for the disease, a study by British scientists found Friday.\n\nThe findings suggest that by narrowing the focus of prostate cancer screening to those whose genes put them at most risk, doctors would catch more cancers early as well as reducing the potential for costly and damaging overdiagnosis.\n\n\u201cAlthough these are early results, it appears that (prostate cancer) screening is reasonably accurate at predicting potentially aggressive prostate cancer among men at higher risk of the disease due to a genetic predisposition,\u201d said Ros Eeles, who led a research team from Britain\u2019s Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and Royal Marsden hospital.\n\nThe study found that the predictive value of screening these men \u2014 expressed as the number of cancers detected relative to the number of tissue samples taken \u2014 was 48 percent, far higher than the 24 percent achieved in population-wide screening.\n\nScreening for prostate cancer is controversial because the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests used cannot differentiate between men with aggressive cancer and men who would never have symptoms or need treatment, and this can lead to overdiagnosis.\n\nA study in the United States last year found that routine prostate cancer screening had resulted in more than a million being diagnosed with tumors who might otherwise have suffered no ill effects from them.\n\nThe ICR-led study is aiming to find out whether screening men who have genetic variants that increase their prostate cancer risk could lead to earlier diagnosis.

In contrast, the multicenter Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study tested the hypothesis that healthy and younger women would respond to menopausal hormone therapy more favorably.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic study used data from the Kronos study to determine the effects of menopausal hormone therapy shortly after menopause, during the critical window of rapid estrogen depletion \u2014 five to 36 months past menopause. Researchers investigated the brain amyloid deposition in 68 women ages 42 to 59 who participated in the Kronos trial during this critical window. The researchers used positron emission tomography, also known as a PET scan, to look for the brain amyloid deposits three years after the trial ended.\n\nOf the 68 women, 21 received estrogen via a skin patch, 17 received estrogen orally and 30 received a placebo. Amyloid deposition was lower in women who received the patch, compared to the placebo, and the effect was most apparent in women with the APOE e4 genotype.

This type of therapy increases levels of dopamine, a natural chemical in the body that sends signals to other nerve cells and can significantly decrease in cases of Parkinson's.\n\nThe medication also treats many of the symptoms associated with the disease such as tremors and poor muscle control.\n\n\"We found that those on a certain class of antidepressant, called tricyclics, didn't need the levodopa therapy until much later compared to those who weren't on that type of antidepressant medication,\" Collier said.\n\nCollier then began testing rats with the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline and found that it indeed was able to decrease the amount of abnormal protein that can build up in the brain. This protein, known as alpha-synuclein, can cause the brain's nerve cells to die when in a clustered state and is a hallmark sign of the disease.\n\nTo further back up his research, he enlisted the help of his colleague and co-author Lisa Lapidus, who in previous studies had already detected whether certain compounds could bind to alpha-synuclein and stop it from accumulating.\n\n\"Proteins are constantly moving and changing shape,\" said Lapidus, a professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy. \"By using a test tube model, we found that by adding nortriptyline to the alpha-synuclein proteins, they began to move and change shape much faster, preventing the proteins from clumping together. The idea that this clustering effect is controlled by how fast or slow a protein reconfigures itself is typically not a standard way of thinking in research on proteins, but our work has been able to show these changes.\"\n\nUnderstanding how these proteins can clump together could point researchers in new directions and help them find other possible drugs that could potentially treat Parkinson's.\n\n\"What we've essentially shown is that an already FDA-approved drug that's been studied over 50 years and is relatively well tolerated could be a much simpler approach to treating the disease itself, not just the symptoms,\" Collier said.\n\nCollier is already looking for funding for the next phase of his research and hopes to lead a human clinical trial using the drug in the future.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health, as well as the Michael J.

These compounds minimize one of the risk factors for cancer, inflammation within the body. People who have chronic inflammation because of chronic infection, autoimmune disease or conditions such as obesity have a higher cancer risk because of damage to normal cells.\n\nThe researchers first tested 142 natural compounds on mouse and human cell lines to see which inhibited prostate cancer cell growth when administered alone or in combination with another nutrient. The most promising active ingredients were then tested on model animals: ursolic acid, a waxy natural chemical found in apple peels and rosemary; curcumin, the bright yellow plant compound in turmeric; and resveratrol, a natural compound common to red grapes or berries.\n\n\"These nutrients have potential anti-cancer properties and are readily available,\" says Tiziani. \"We only need to increase concentration beyond levels found in a healthy diet for an effect on prostate cancer cells.\"\n\nThe new research paper also demonstrates how the plant-based chemicals work together.

It\u2019s not the first study to show a potential anticancer effect of aspirin and other similar painkillers \u2014 a class of medications known and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. Previous studies have found that aspirin users enjoyed a lower risk of colon cancer; a trial published earlier this year concluded that people who take a daily aspirin have as much as a 46% lower risk of colon, lung and prostate cancers, compared with non-users.\n\nIn the current trial, researchers looked at all cancer cases in the Danish Cancer Registry from 1991 to 2009 and compared this data against that of a prescription-drug database that recorded patients\u2019 histories of using aspirin, NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors, drugs that all work in similar ways to reduce inflammation and dull pain.\n\nOverall, 18,532 cases of skin cancer were included in the study. Each case was compared to 10 matched controls who did not develop the disease. Over the study period, people who filled more than two prescriptions for aspirin, NSAIDS or COX-2 inhibitors had a 13% lower risk of melanoma and a 15% lower risk of squamous cell carcinoma than those who filled fewer prescriptions, the researchers found.\n\nThe longer people took the drugs, and the higher the dose, the greater the anticancer benefit. Longer, higher-intensity use, for example, led to a 46% lower risk of melanoma, a 35% lower risk of squamous cell carcinoma and a 17% lower risk of basal cell carcinoma, the most common form of skin cancer in the U.S. The relationship held even after the researchers adjusted for potential confounders that could affect the risk of skin cancer, such as use of other medications. However, the researchers didn\u2019t have information on other key skin cancer risk factors like exposure to UV radiation.\n\nThe drugs are thought to counter cancer growth by suppressing inflammatory pathways and stimulating tumors\u2019 ability to expand and develop blood supplies.\n\n\u201cGiven the high skin cancer incidence and the widespread and frequent use of NSAIDs, a preventive effect of these agents may have important public health implications,\u201d the authors, led by Sigrun Alba Johannesdottir from Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark, wrote.\n\nIn the U.S., skin cancer is the most common form of cancer diagnosed, affecting more than 2 million people each year.

(One COX-2 inhibitor, Vioxx, was voluntarily pulled from the market by its maker in 2004 after it was linked to an increased risk of heart disease.)\n\nBut given the growing body of data linking aspirin use to lower cancer risk, the researchers say it may be worth factoring in the drugs\u2019 anticancer effects when patients and doctors discuss options for pain relievers. \u201cWe hope that the potential cancer-protective effect of NSAIDs will inspire more research on skin cancer prevention,\u201d Johannesdottir said in a statement. \u201cAlso, this potential cancer-protective effect should be taken into account when discussing benefits and harms of NSAID use.\u201d\n\nAlice Park is a writer at TIME.

It could be used in doctors\u2019 offices.\n\nRadiofrequency or microwave technology for breast cancer detection is not new, but what Zhipeng Wu, PhD, from Manchester\u2019s School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering has achieved is the speed of results and portability. The patented real-time radiofrequency scanner uses computer tomography and works by using the same technology as a mobile phone, but with only a tiny fraction of its power. Costs are reduced and the electronics fit into a case the size of a lunchbox.\n\nCurrent mammography testing works well for detecting breast cancer in women over 50 with results of up to 95% accuracy. The Manchester team says it is far less effective for younger women, where the detection rate could be as low as 60% for women under the age of 50. This group, the team says, accounts for 20% of all breast cancer cases.\n\nWhile mammography works on breast density, radiofrequency looks at contrasts between normal and diseased breast tissues. The breast is placed in a scanner cup and an image appears on screen. Tumors or other abnormalities show up in red.

Thirteen of the women taking the drug for an additional five years developed breast cancer in the opposite breast during the study, compared with 31 taking the placebo; 55 and 68, respectively, developed a recurrence of cancer in the original breast.\n\nFor any individual woman, the odds of developing \u201ccontralateral\u201d breast cancer \u2014 that is, in the opposite breast \u2014 are still lower than 200-to-1 per year.\n\nStill, said Dr. Richard Schilsky, who serves as the chief medical officer of ASCO and who was not involved in the study, \u201cthere\u2019s a substantial benefit\u201d to continuing aromatase inhibitors out to 10 years to lower the chance of cancer developing in the other breast.\n\nThe study did not continue long enough to discover whether the lower risk of developing cancer in the opposite breast translated into a lower risk of death.\n\nThe study, which was also published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine, was partially funded by Novartis, which sells letrozole \u2014 the aromatase inhibitor used in the trial \u2014 as the branded drug Femara. Several of the authors have received speaking fees or consulting payments from Novartis, AstraZeneca (which makes letrozole), and Pfizer (maker of the aromatase inhibitor exemestane).\n\nLetrozole is available as a generic for less than $100 a month.\n\nThe trial included 1,918 postmenopausal women who had what\u2019s called hormone-receptor positive breast cancer, in which the hormones estrogen or progesterone fuel the proliferation of cells. About two-thirds of breast cancers are hormone-receptor positive, and they have a good prognosis. Aromatase inhibitors block an enzyme that the body needs to produce estrogen.\n\nThe women had taken another breast cancer drug, tamoxifen, for several years and then were started on an aromatase inhibitor, which doctors usually prescribe for five years.\n\nAfter following the women for a median of just over six years, found Dr. Paul Goss of Massachusetts General Hospital and his colleagues, 95 percent of those taking letrozole for the additional five years remained free of breast cancer (meaning the disease had not returned in the original breast or developed in the opposite one). Of those taking an inert pill, or placebo, 91 percent did.\n\nPut another way, the risk of cancer returning in the original or the opposite breast was 34 percent lower in women on 10 years of letrozole compared with those who stopped after five. There was no difference in survival, however: 100 women in each group died during the study.\n\n\u201cThe reason this is a milestone trial is that it\u2019s the first to show that 10 years [on letrozole] is better than five,\u201d said Dr. Nicholas Robert, an oncologist with Virginia Cancer Specialists and a co-author of the study. But because the absolute benefits were not huge, and because the drug did cause side effects, it makes sense to consider this for women at the highest risk of a recurrence of breast cancer, he said.\n\nAromatase inhibitors cause side effects in some women, especially night sweats, hot flashes, and sexual dysfunction. Women receiving five more years of letrozole also had greater loss of bone in their hip, worse osteoporosis, and more fractures.\n\nExperts said the study was significant because some women and their doctors choose to continue aromatase inhibitors past the standard five years. There had been no research on whether that was beneficial.\n\nDr. Debra Patt, a breast cancer specialist at Texas Oncology who was not involved in the study, called the difference of a few percentage points in the risk of recurrence (95 percent vs. 91 percent) \u201csubstantial.

Currently, CT scans of the brain are the standard way of diagnosing TBI, but they can\u2019t pick up every case. And because the expose patients to radiation, doctors are often reluctant to use them on every patient, especially young children, who come to the emergency room with a head injury.\n\nBut in a study published in , scientists report on a promising blood test that could distinguish the more serious cases of TBI that require further evaluation. Led by Dr. Linda Papa, director of clinical research and an emergency physician at Orlando Regional Medical Center, the research team focused on two blood proteins that have already been linked to brain injury. Papa and her team expanded on that work by studying how levels of these two proteins, or biomarkers, change immediately after head trauma.\n\nThey collected blood from 584 people coming to the Orlando Regional Medical Center, which is a Level 1 Trauma Center, for trauma-related injuries. About half them had brain-related injuries, and half had other traumas, including broken bones and chest injuries. Papa wanted to test several things about the blood test, including whether they were specific to brain injuries or whether they changed during any trauma to any part of the body. All of the people had their blood drawn 19 times, starting at within four hours of their injury and up to 7 days later. By tracking changes in the levels of the two proteins over this time, Papa could see how they changed, and correlate that with the people\u2019s symptoms.\n\nMORE: Concussion Expert: Over 90% of NFL Players Have Brain Disease\n\nIn all people, regardless of the type of injury they had, the levels of the proteins, called GFAP and UCH-L1, rose within the first hour after the injuries. GFAP, which is specific to cells known as astrocytes that form a matrix for nerves in the central nervous system (which includes the brain and spinal cord), peak at 20 hours after the injury and then decline steadily but are still detectable seven days later. UCH-L1 is released by brain nerves when they\u2019re stressed, and its levels rise more rapidly immediately after injury and peak at eight hours.\n\nWhen Papa then looked just at people who showed signs of TBI on CT scans, she found that their levels of GFAP and UCH-L1 were significantly higher than those of people with other types of trauma, suggesting that the two markers can be relatively specific to TBI and not trauma in general.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to do any unnecessary procedures on people who don\u2019t need them,\u201d says Papa of using CT scans to distinguish people with more serious head injuries from those how just have hit their head but don\u2019t experience any symptoms. \u201cI don\u2019t think a blood will be the be-all and end-all but it would be a beautiful tool for us to have in the clinic to support a lot of our decision making.\u201d\n\nTesting for levels of UCH-L1, for example, might be helpful for emergency medical teams in an ambulance trying to assess whether a patient has any serious head injuries, since its levels peak in the hours immediately after a trauma. It might also help coaches or athletic trainers are sports events to determine which athletes who have had a concussion are able to return to the game and which, if they have higher levels of the blood marker, should not.\n\nMORE: A New Blood Test to Diagnose Concussions On The Field\n\nIn the emergency room, a blood test for UCH-L1 could also help doctors decide which patients should get a CT scan \u2014 the higher their levels of the protein are, the more likely they are to have TBI and would benefit from a scan, while those with lower levels probably don\u2019t need one.\n\nAnd because levels of GFAP tend to remain higher for many days, Papa says it might be useful in cases where patients don\u2019t come in immediately after a head injury, thinking they\u2019re okay, but see the doctor several days later because they\u2019re concerned. Even at that point, the study shows, GFAP levels might be higher than normal and therefore might indicate TBI and need for further tests.\n\n\u201cWe may not use these blood tests in a hundred percent of cases but probably in eighty percent of cases where there is a question mark, a blood test could definitely help,\u201d she says.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No obvious disease mongering in this story.

More Americans kill themselves than die from breast cancer.\n\nAs Dr.Thomas Insel, longtime head of the National Institute of Mental Health, prepared to step down from his job in October, he cited the lack of progress in reducing the number of suicides as his biggest disappointment. While the homicide rate in the U.S. has dropped 50 percent since the early 1990s, the suicide rate is higher than it was a decade ago.\n\n\"That to me is unacceptable,\" Insel says.\n\nIt hasn't been for lack of trying. The U.S. has a national suicide hotline, and there are suicide prevention programs in every state. There's screening, educational programs, and midnight walks to raise awareness. Yet over the past decade or so, the national suicide rate has increased. In 2003, the suicide rate was 10.8 per 100,000 people. In 2013, it was 12.6.\n\nAn effort that began in Detroit in 2001 to treat the most common cause of suicide \u2014 depression \u2014 is offering hope. With a relentless focus on finding and treating people with depression, the Henry Ford Health System has cut the suicide rate among the people in its insurance plan dramatically. The story of the health system's success is a story of persistence, confidence, hope and a strict adherence to a very specific approach.\n\nThat approach saved the life of a woman who prefers to be known only by her first name, Lynn. She agreed to share her medical history on the condition that we not use her full name to protect her privacy.\n\nLynn, who's now in her mid-50s, has had bipolar disorder, also known as manic-depressive illness, for nearly 30 years. The depressive part of her illness \"is like the pain of having a cancer,\" she says. About 15 years ago, she started getting irresistible urges to take her own life and she started making serious attempts \u2014 at times almost monthly.\n\n\"When I was in the depths of depression, I was being pulled and sucked into this black tunnel,\" she says. \"I was desperately trying to grab onto something to stop from being sucked in.\" Sometimes she couldn't find anything to hang on to. \"Those are the times when I finally let go and attempted suicide,\" she says.\n\nThe program that saved Lynn almost didn't get off the ground.\n\nFifteen years ago, suicide prevention care at Henry Ford, like in many places, was mostly reactive. When patients came in talking about suicide, health providers took notice. But little was done to find people before they reached that point.\n\nSome of the health providers in the psychiatric division decided they could do better. So they applied to a foundation for a grant to provide something they called \"perfect depression care\" for the 200,000 patients in the health system. The goal: zero suicides.\n\nThe mental health division failed to win the grant, but the health system went ahead with the proposed changes anyway.\n\nThe plan it developed is intensive and thorough, an almost cookbook approach. Primary care doctors screen every patient with two questions: How often have you felt down in the past two weeks? And how often have you felt little pleasure in doing things? A high score leads to more questions about sleep disturbances, changes in appetite, thoughts of hurting oneself. All patients are questioned on every visit.\n\nIf the health providers recognize a mental health problem, patients are assigned to appropriate care \u2014 cognitive behavioral therapy, drugs, group counseling, or hospitalization if necessary. On each patient's medical record, providers have to attest to having done the screening, and they record plans for any needed care.\n\nTherapists involve patients' families, and ask them to remove guns or other means of suicide from their homes. Clerks are trained to make sure that patients who need followup care don't leave without an appointment. Patients themselves come up with \"safety plans.\"\n\nLynn has two copies, one by her nightstand and one in her kitchen. Each lists things she can do when she feels depression coming on. She could sit on her balcony, or do some drawing or painting. The list includes her therapists' phone numbers. And there's a reminder that the feeling will pass \u2014 it has before.\n\nBefore the zero suicide plan went into effect, says psychiatrist Doree Ann Espiritu, acting head of the zero suicide program at Henry Ford, you might make a contract with a patient where the patient agrees not to commit suicide. Studies show it doesn't work very well, she says.\n\nToday, providers are trained to be comfortable asking their patients about suicidal thoughts. \"There is a fear among clinicians that if you ask questions about suicide, you are giving the patient an idea that this could be an option,\" says Espiritu, \"and if you ask about guns or pills, that you are giving them some hints on how they can carry out a plan.\" The Henry Ford therapists are trained to break that barrier.\n\nFor Lynn, the key was persistence \u2014 her therapists', and her own. \"I recall one time with my psychiatrist, who kept trying to encourage me and help me find ways of coping, and I can remember saying, 'I don't believe there's hope, I don't see it, I don't feel it, I need you to hold on to that for me because it's not there,' \" she recalls.\n\nHer therapists never gave up. \"There is no question that the message I got from Day 1 is that they knew they could help me, and they would help me,\" Lynn says. Over the years she's been in group therapy, day treatment, and, when things got bad, the emergency room.\n\nThe Henry Ford approach is catching on. A stream of visitors from U.S. health insurers and from the United Kingdom have made site visits. The Suicide Prevention Resource Center has run two zero suicide training academies for teams from health care systems based on the Henry Ford principles. Other health systems have adapted the plan, including Group Health Cooperative in Seattle and the behavioral health provider Centerstone in Tennessee.\n\nEspiritu started work at Henry Ford just as the program was starting, and she remembers the initial staff meetings: \"There was a lot of, 'How can you do this? How can you aim for zero? How can you expect your clinicians to be perfect and follow this protocol?' \" Some people didn't think it could be done, she says, or even attempted.\n\nStill, the health system went ahead, and the rewards were nearly immediate. Henry Ford epidemiologist Brian Ahmedani studies the numbers. In 2009, for those being actively treated for a mental health problem or substance abuse, \"we had a rate of zero per hundred thousand,\" he says. It's crept up to 20 per 100,000 per year, but that's still 80 percent lower than it was when the program began. The rate is five per 100,000 in the organization's general population, which is well below the national average and has remained steady despite an increasing rate of suicide statewide.\n\nThere's reason to think a full-bore effort to treat depression could reduce health costs, because untreated depression is associated with higher medical bills for chronic illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension. But there are training costs involved, and the Henry Ford system has had to keep its staffing up to be able to provide care for people who need it.\n\nOfficials at Henry Ford say they haven't analyzed the costs. But Centerstone has. The behavioral health provider in Nashville implemented the Henry Ford approach for nearly 200 patients who'd already made a suicide attempt. Reductions in emergency room visits and hospitalizations over the course of a year resulted in savings of more than $400,000.\n\nWhy push for zero, rather than just a reduction? \"Because if you say we're OK with five a year, one of those might be your brother or your friend,\" says Espiritu. \"We aim for zero because it reminds all of us of what we would want for ourselves.\" Maybe it is not possible, she says. But it is a goal.\n\nAnd as for Lynn, she doesn't consider herself cured. She says with the treatment she's received at Henry Ford, she's learned to live, even thrive, with bipolar disease. And she's alive. That, she says, makes her a big success story.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering here.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "In a remarkably rapid translation of laboratory research findings into a treatment with the potential to benefit patients, UC San Francisco scientists have successfully completed a Phase II clinical trial showing that an FDA-approved antihistamine restores nervous system function in patients with chronic multiple sclerosis (MS).\n\nIn light of previous laboratory studies of the antihistamine compound at UCSF, the researchers said, the drug most likely exerted its effect by repairing damage MS had inflicted on myelin, an insulating membrane that speeds transmission of electrical signals in the nervous system.\n\nThe drug tested in the trial, clemastine fumarate, was first identified as a candidate treatment for MS in 2013 by UCSF's Jonah R.

It's not a cure, but it's a first step towards restoring brain function to the millions who are affected by this chronic, debilitating disease,\" said the trial's principal investigator, Ari Green, MD, also Debbie and Andy Rachleff Distinguished Professor of Neurology, chief of the Division of Neuroinflammation and Glial Biology, and medical director of the UCSF Multiple Sclerosis and Neuroinflammation Center.\n\nChan and Green are co-directors of the UCSF Small-Molecule Program for Remyelination, and both are members of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences.\n\nThe new results are particularly notable, Chan said, because patients in the trial had suffered from MS symptoms caused by injury to myelin for years. \"People thought we were absolutely crazy to launch this trial, because they thought that only in newly diagnosed cases could a drug like this be effective -- intuitively, if myelin damage is new, the chance of repair is strong. In the patients in our trial the disease had gone on for years, but we still saw strong evidence of repair.\"\n\nMS is an autoimmune neurodegenerative disorder that affects nearly 2.5 million people worldwide. The disease strikes when the immune system attacks myelin, layers of fatty insulating membrane that surround nerve fibers. Unlike the rubber insulation around wires, however, myelin helps electrical signals in neurons move faster and more efficiently. As myelin damage continues over the course of the disease, neurons progressively lose their ability to reliably transmit electrical signals, resulting in progressive loss of vision, weakness, walking difficulties, and problems with coordination and balance.\n\nCurrent MS treatments aim to prevent the immune system from doing further harm, but none have been shown to repair damaged myelin. In both his 2013 research and in subsequent studies with a mouse model of MS, however, Chan and colleagues had demonstrated that clemastine fumarate promotes myelin regeneration and restores neural function, promising preclinical results that inspired the new study, known as the ReBUILD trial.\n\nBecause the visual system is often one of the first and most prominent parts of the brain to be affected in MS, and because there are well-established tools to measure the speed of neural transmission in the areas of the brain devoted to vision, the research team used a method known as visual evoked potentials, or VEPs, to assess clemastine's therapeutic effects in the trial.\n\nThe five-month Phase II trial enrolled 50 patients with relapsing but generally long-standing MS whose VEPs reflected preexisting deficits in neural transmission. The researchers showed flickering patterns on a screen to participants, and used electrodes placed over the brain's visual areas at the back of the head to gauge how long it took for the flickering signal presented to the eye to generate an electrical response that could be detected by the electrodes. The time from presentation of the pattern to the detection of the VEP is a measurement of how long it took for the signal to travel via nerve fibers from the retina, at the back of the eye, to the visual areas at the back of the brain.\n\nTo enhance the power of their study, the researchers used a \"crossover\" design: they divided the patient population in two and gave the drug, blinded to both participant and researcher, to one group, and a placebo to the other for 90 days; then they switched between the two groups, giving a placebo to the first group and the drug to the other for the next 60 days. This \"flip-flop\" technique gave the researchers the ability to compare patients to themselves -- a form of control that increased the statistical power of the study by nearly an order of magnitude, Green said.\n\nDuring the periods when each group was taking the drug, the neural signal from the eye to the back of the brain was significantly accelerated over the baseline measurements taken before the patients began the study. The effect persisted in the group that had switched to placebo, suggesting that durable repair of myelin had been induced by the drug.\n\nAlthough the research team could not directly observe evidence of rebuilding of myelin in trial participants using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Chan and Green said that this reflects a weakness of current MRI techniques as a tool for this purpose rather than evidence that myelin regeneration did not take place. \"We still don't have imaging methods that have been proven to be able to detect remyelination in humans,\" said Chan.\n\nThat myelin increases the speed of neural transmission is one of the most well-established concepts in neurobiology, and combined with the clear evidence from Chan's preclinical research showing that clemastine fumarate promotes myelin formation, myelin regeneration is the only plausible explanation for the VEP results, the authors said.\n\n\"This is the first step in a long process,\" Green said. \"By no means do we want to suggest that this is a cure-all. We want to ground-truth myelination metrics -- we're designing the crucible that's going to be used to test any future method for detecting remyelination.\"\n\nThe work was funded through generous support from the Rachleff Family.\n\nIn addition to Green and Chan, authors (all at UCSF) include Jeffrey M Gelfand, MD, MAS; Bruce A Cree, MD, PhD, MAS; Carolyn Bevan, MD; W.

One clever clarification was to point out the differences between myelin and rubber insulation around wires.\nWe rate this one Satisfactory.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The first year results, which are published today in The Lancet, also revealed that almost nine out of 10 people (86%) who lost 15kg or more put their Type 2 diabetes into remission. The study led by Professor Roy Taylor, from Newcastle University, and Professor Mike lean from Glasgow University, found that 45.6% of those who were put on a low calorie diet for three to five months and were able to stop their Type 2 diabetes medications. Importantly, long-term support by routine General Practice staff was given to help the paticipants maintain their weight loss. The trial, called DiRECT (Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial) and funded by Diabetes UK, recruited 298 people between the Newcastle and Glasgow University and builds on Professor Taylor\u2019s earlier pilot work. Professor Taylor, lead researcher of the DiRECT trial, said: \u201cThese findings are very exciting. They could revolutionise the way Type 2 diabetes is treated. \u201cThe study builds on the work into the underlying cause of the condition, so that we can target management effectively. \u201cSubstantial weight loss results in reduced fat inside the liver and pancreas, allowing these organs to return to normal function. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing from DiRECT is that losing weight isn\u2019t just linked to better management of Type 2 diabetes: significant weight loss could actually result in lasting remission.\"\n\nRemission was defined as having blood glucose levels (HbA1c) of less than 6.5% (48mmol/mol) at 12 months, with at least two months without any Type 2 diabetes medications. Of the 298 people recruited to take part in DiRECT, half received standard diabetes care from their GP, whilst the other half received a structured weight management programme within primary care. The programme included a low calorie, nutrient-complete diet for three to five months, food reintroduction and long-term support to maintain weight loss. Type 2 diabetes remission was found to be closely related to weight loss. Over half (57%) of those who lost 10 to 15kg achieved remission, along with a third (34%) of those who lost five to 10kg. Only 4% of the control group achieved remission. The findings have been presented at the International Diabetes Federation Congress in Abu Dhabi today by the lead researchers, Professor Taylor and Professor Mike Lean. Professor Lean said: \u201cPutting Type 2 diabetes into remission as early as possible after diagnosis could have extraordinary benefits, both for the individual and the NHS. DiRECT is telling us it could be possible for as many as half of patients to achieve this in routine primary care, and without drugs. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that people were really interested in this approach \u2013 almost a third of those who were asked to take part in the study agreed. This is much higher than usual acceptance rates for diabetes clinical trials.\"\n\nDiRECT is a two-year trial which aims to find an effective and accessible way to put Type 2 diabetes into remission for the long-term. The trial is delivered through GP practices across Tyneside and Scotland to find out if the benefits of a structured weight management programme can be felt in a real-life primary care setting. DiRECT also aims to understand why significant weight loss results in remission, to understand which groups might benefit in the future. Type 2 diabetes is a life-changing condition that progresses over time, which can have devastating consequences. Finding ways to put it into lasting remission could significantly reduce the cost of delivering diabetes care and treating serious complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney disease or stroke. Remission could transform the lives of millions of people living with or at risk of Type 2 diabetes. Isobel Murray, 65, from North Ayrshire, took part in DiRECT from 2014 to 2016. She was on the low calorie diet programme for 17 weeks and put her Type 2 diabetes into remission after the first four months. Over the two year trial, Isobel lost more than three and a half stone and no longer needs to take any diabetes medication. Isobel said: \u201cIt has transformed my life, I had Type 2 diabetes for two to three years before the study. \u201cI was on various medications which were constantly increasing and I was becoming more and more ill every day. When the opportunity came to go on the DiRECT study, I had absolutely no hesitation. \u201cWhen the doctors told me that my pancreas was working again, it felt fantastic, absolutely amazing. \u201cI don\u2019t think of myself as a diabetic anymore, I get all my diabetes checks done, but I don\u2019t feel like a diabetic. I am one of the lucky ones to have gone into remission.\u201d Diabetes UK has committed more than \u00a32.8 million to the DiRECT study. Recently, \u00a3300,000 has been committed so participants who wish to continue can be followed for up to three years and the full cost-effectiveness of this programme can be evaluated. The funding will provide further understanding around the longer term benefits, to see if a treatment of this kind could be offered to people with Type 2 diabetes in the future. Dr Elizabeth Robertson, Director of Research at Diabetes UK, said: \u201cThese first year findings of DiRECT demonstrate the potential to transform the lives of millions of people. \u201cWe\u2019re very encouraged by these initial results, and the building robust evidence that remission could be achievable for some people. \u201cThe trial is ongoing, so that we can understand the long-term effects of an approach like this. It\u2019s very important that anyone living with Type 2 diabetes considering losing weight in this way seeks support and advice from a healthcare professional.\u201d Whether putting Type 2 diabetes into remission can protect against diabetes-related complications later in life is not yet known, which is why it is important that those who achieve remission continue to receive health checks. More research is also needed to find out who could benefit most from treatments like this in the future, taking into account factors like ethnicity and duration of Type 2 diabetes.

That would be just as simple, and significantly more useful for readers. ", "answer": 1}, {"article": "George Burke has a talent for tossing back his daily cocktail \u2014 which contains vitamins, minerals, muscle-building compounds, some little-known research drugs and a microdose of LSD \u2014 in almost a single gulp. It\u2019s a weird but handy trick for someone who swallows 25 pills a day, most of them purchases off the Internet.\n\nBurke credits the regimen with giving him the cognitive edge he needs to thrive in California\u2019s Silicon Valley, where he\u2019s the co-founder of a food service that caters to athletes and fitness devotees.\n\nHe used to get his edge from Adderall, but after moving from New Jersey to San Francisco, he says, he couldn\u2019t find a doctor who would write him a prescription. Driven to the Internet, he discovered a world of cognition-enhancing drugs known as nootropics \u2014 some prescription, some over-the-counter, others available on a worldwide gray market of private sellers \u2014 said to improve memory, attention, creativity and motivation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like every tech worker in Silicon Valley is taking nootropics to get ahead,\u201d Burke acknowledges. \u201cIt\u2019s the few who are getting ahead who are using supplements to do that.\u201d\n\nThe word \u201cnootropic\u201d was coined in 1972 by a Romanian scientist, Corneliu Giurgea, who combined the Greek words for \u201cmind\u201d and \u201cbending.\u201d Caffeine and nicotine can be considered mild nootropics, while prescription Ritalin, Adderall and Provigil (modafinil, a drug for treating narcolepsy) lie at the far end of the spectrum when prescribed off-label as cognitive enhancers. Even microdosing of LSD is increasingly viewed as a means to greater productivity.\n\nBut when aficionados talk about nootropics, they usually refer to substances that have supposedly few side effects and low toxicity. Most often they mean piracetam, which Giurgea first synthesized in 1964 and which is approved for therapeutic use in dozens of countries for use in adults and the elderly. Not so in the United States, however, where officially it can be sold only for research purposes.\n\nPiracetam is well studied and is credited by its users with boosting their memory, sharpening their focus, heightening their immune system, even bettering their personalities. But it\u2019s only one of many formulations in the racetam drug family. Newer ones include aniracetam, phenylpiracetam and oxiracetam. All are available online, where their efficacy and safety are debated and reviewed on message boards and in podcasts.\n\nA number of companies now market nootropic \u201cstacks,\u201d or formulas, some of which include piracetam, herbal remedies, amino acids and citicoline, a naturally occurring brain chemical that can be taken orally as a supplement, intravenously or as a shot.\n\nBecause they are sold as nutritional supplements and natural products that refrain from making health claims, they avoid close government scrutiny.\n\nWhen Burke began ordering piracetam online five years ago, it arrived in baggies filled with white powder. \u201cIt was as if I was buying coke off the street,\u201d he recalls. These days, he buys his stack from Nootroo, a San Francisco company.\n\nBut self-experimenters such as Burke often don\u2019t restrict themselves to medication alone. Dedicated brain hackers, as they call themselves, are willing to exploit their own biology to try to sharpen their mind. Their methods include meditation, cold-water plunges, periodic fasting and high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets.\n\n\u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to maximize their cognitive ability? Who doesn\u2019t want to maximize their muscle mass?\u201d asks Murali Doraiswamy, who has led several trials of cognitive enhancers at Duke University Health System and has been an adviser to pharmaceutical and supplement manufacturers as well as the Food and Drug Administration. He attributes the demand to an increasingly knowledge-based society that values mental quickness and agility above all else.\n\nBut while some studies have found short-term benefits, Doraiswamy says there is no evidence that what are commonly known as smart drugs \u2014 of any type \u2014 improve thinking or productivity over the long run. \u201cThere\u2019s a sizable demand, but the hype around efficacy far exceeds available evidence,\u201d notes Doraiswamy, adding that, for healthy young people such as Silicon Valley go-getters, \u201cit\u2019s a zero-sum game. That\u2019s because when you up one circuit in the brain, you\u2019re probably impairing another system.\u201d\n\nEarly studies attributed a lot of short-term benefits to nootropics \u2014 so much so that in 1983, Russian scientists turned to phenylpiracetam to boost the physical and mental performance of cosmonauts during space flight.\n\nA 1999 study found that piracetam had beneficial effects on the hippocampal membranes of patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The hippocampus, an area of the brain that plays a key role in the formation of new memories, typically shows severe shrinkage with Alzheimer\u2019s. The idea that piracetam might reverse that effect was exciting.\n\nAlthough piracetam has a history of \u201crelatively few side effects,\u201d it has fallen far short of its initial promise for treating any of the illnesses associated with cognitive decline, according to Lon Schneider, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California. \u201cWe don\u2019t use it at all and never have.\u201d\n\nAs for newer nootropic drugs, there are unknown risks. \u201cPiracetam has been studied for decades,\u201d says cognitive neuroscientist Andrew Hill, the founder of a neurofeedback company in Los Angeles called Peak Brain Institute. But \u201csome of [the newer] compounds are things that some random editor found in a scientific article, copied the formula down and sent it to China and had a bulk powder developed three months later that they\u2019re selling. Please don\u2019t take it, people!\u201d\n\nFor Burke and other brain hackers, the evidence for nootropics is strong enough.\n\nBurke, who begins each morning with a Bulletproof coffee \u2014 a rich brew of caffeine with dollops of butter and coconut oil \u2014 has created a San Francisco meetup group called Peak Performance \u201cto teach all my friends in the tech space about life hacks so they can kick a--better every day.\u201d\n\nLast spring, 100 people showed up at a Peak Performance event where psychedelic psychologist James Fadiman said the key to unleashing the cognition-enhancing effects of LSD \u2014 which he listed as less anxiety, better focus, improved sleep, greater creativity \u2014 was all in the dosage. He recommended a tenth of a \u201cparty dose\u201d \u2014 enough to give you \u201cthe glow\u201d and enhance your cognitive powers without \u201cthe trip.\u201d\n\nBurke says he definitely got the glow. \u201cThe first time I took it, I was working on a business plan. I had to juggle multiple contingencies in my head, and for some reason a tree with branches jumped into my head. I was able to place each contingency on a branch, retract and go back to the trunk, and in this visual way I was able to juggle more information.\u201d\n\nNot all brain hacking involves taking a pill, though.\n\nNootrobox, a San Francisco company that markets a nootropic mix of vitamins, minerals and amino acids, promotes fasting as a way to energize brain and body.\n\n\u201cWe stumbled upon fasting as a way to optimize cognition and make yourself into a more efficient human being,\u201d says Manuel Lam, an internal medicine physician who advises Nootrobox on clinical issues. He and members of the company\u2019s executive team have implanted glucose monitors in their arms \u2014 not because they fear diabetes but because they wish to track the real-time effect of the foods they eat.\n\n\u201cFasting forces your body to deplete its glucose storage and trains it to look inside for fuel,\u201d Lam enthuses. \u201cIt\u2019s like being strapped to a solar panel. The sun is always shining on you.\u201d\n\nNootrobox employees are encouraged to fast every Tuesday, then meet for breakfast on Wednesday at a local diner. Founded by two Stanford University computer graduates, the company has initiated an international fasting group on Facebook; at last count, there were 3,500 members.\n\nResearch on animals has shown that intermittent fasting \u2014 limiting caloric intake at least two days a week \u2014 can help improve neural connections in the hippocampus and protect against the accumulation of plaque, a protein prevalent in the brains of people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Research has also shown that intermittent fasting helped reduce anxiety in mice.\n\nMark Mattson, chief of the Laboratory of Neurosciences at the National Institute on Aging, has overseen a lot of the animal studies on fasting and is impressed with the evidence \u2014 so much so that he has personally adopted a regimen of intermittent fasting.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s pretty conclusive evidence from animal studies that intermittent fasting is beneficial for brain function and resistance to aging from neurogenerative diseases,\u201d he says.\n\nFasting has been deployed since the ancient Greeks to fast-track learning. As Plato is said to have stated, \u201cI fast for greater physical and mental efficiency.\u201d The philosopher Pythagoras reportedly demanded that his students fast 40 days before attending his lectures.\n\nFar easier to take a pill.\n\nLooking for an edge\n\nVinh Ngo, a San Francisco family practice doctor who specializes in hormone therapy, has become familiar with piracetam and other nootropics through a changing patient base. His office is located in the heart of the city\u2019s tech boom and he is increasingly sought out by young, male tech workers who tell him they are interested in cognitive enhancement.\n\nNgo has experimented with piracetam himself (\u201cThe first time I tried it, I thought, \u2018Wow, this is pretty strong for a supplement.\u2019 I had a little bit of reflux, heartburn, but in general it was a cognitive enhancer. . . . I found it helpful\u201d) and the neurotransmitter DMEA (\u201cYou have an idea, it helps you finish the thought. It\u2019s for when people have difficulty finishing that last connection in the brain\u201d).\n\nBut he has also seen patients whose propensity for self-experimentation to improve cognition got out of hand. One chief executive he treated, Ngo said, developed an unhealthy predilection for albuterol, because he felt the asthma inhaler medicine kept him alert and productive long after others had quit working. Unfortunately, the drug ended up severely imbalancing his electrolytes, which can lead to dehydration, headaches, vision and cardiac problems, muscle contractions and, in extreme cases, seizures.\n\n\u201cThere is that culture here [in Silicon Valley] that relies on being smarter than your own self,\u201d Ngo says. \u201cPeople want to find an edge over their competitor \u2014 that\u2019s how they got their position in the first place. I\u2019m trying to give them a little more wiggle room \u2014 but in a safe way.\u201d\n\nHe says he screens his patients for addiction and cardiovascular problems and creates individual treatment plans based on their health histories and blood tests.\n\nThere\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach. \u201cI don\u2019t have a rubber stamp for everyone, and not everyone is a candidate\u201d for cognitive enhancement, says Ngo, who requires that his patients sign waivers acknowledging possible health risks in taking nootropics.\n\nIf, for example, someone decides to go on medication \u2014 be it Adderall, albuterol or piracetam \u2014 the patient must understand that there is a risk for high blood pressure and heart problems.\n\n\u201cI want to empower them,\u201d Ngo says, but \u201cthere\u2019s a fine line between empowering them to make their own health decisions and staying healthy.\u201d\n\nSmart drugs are here.

That makes it sounds like \u201cnormal\u201d people are in some way deficient.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The drug, finasteride, is available as a generic for about $2.00 a day, and millions of men safely take it now to shrink their prostates, its approved use.\n\nWith finasteride, as many as 100,000 cases of prostate cancer a year could be prevented, said Dr. Eric Klein, director of the Center for Urologic Oncology at the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nDr. Howard Parnes, chief of the prostate cancer group at the National Cancer Institute\u2019s division of cancer prevention, also is convinced. \u201cThere is a tremendous public health benefit for the use of this agent,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile it might seem convoluted to offer a drug to prevent the consequences of overtreatment, that is the situation in the country today, others say. Preventing the cancer can prevent treatments that can be debilitating, even if the cancers were never lethal to start with.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the bind we\u2019re in right now,\u201d said Dr. Christopher Logothetis, professor and chairman of genitourinary medical oncology at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. \u201cMost of the time, treatment wouldn\u2019t help and may not be necessary. But the reality is that people are being operated on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are trying to avoid a diagnosis to avoid a prevention whose value is disputed,\u201d he said. With finasteride, Dr. Logothetis added, \u201cwe\u2019re trying to overcome our other sins.\u201d\n\nOther experts say, Not so fast. Finasteride might not make much of a difference in the death rate because so few men die from prostate cancer. What the drug\u2019s proponents are advocating is taking a drug to somehow compensate for what many believe is the nation\u2019s overzealous diagnosis and treatment of the disease.\n\nDr. Peter Albertsen, a prostate cancer specialist at the University of Connecticut, explains: While 10 percent of men 55 and older find out they have prostate cancer, the cancer is lethal in no more than 25 percent of them. So if finasteride reduced the prostate cancer\u2019s incidence by 30 percent, about 7 percent of men would get a cancer diagnosis and approximately 1.8 percent instead of 2.5 percent would have a lethal cancer.\n\n\u201cFinasteride might make a difference but only in a very small subset of men,\u201d Dr. Albertsen said.\n\nAnd, he adds, the study did not look for a decline in death rates, and it is unlikely that any study ever will \u2014 it would take too long and be too expensive. Yet the ultimate goal of prevention is to save lives. It remains an assumption that finasteride would have much impact on the minority of prostate cancers that, despite early detection and treatment, still kill.\n\nFinasteride blocks the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, a hormone active mostly in the prostate and the scalp, and that all prostate cancers need to grow.\n\nThe drug is available from Merck & Company, as Proscar, and from six companies as a generic to shrink the prostate in older men whose prostates can enlarge, making urination difficult.\n\nResearchers say it turns out that shrinking the prostate also may be good for cancer detection by making it easier to find all tumors, including the most aggressive.\n\n\u201cThe data are compelling,\u201d said Dr. Peter Scardino, chairman of the department of surgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, a convert who originally thought the drug was dangerous. \u201cFinasteride has to be recognized as the first clearly demonstrated way to prevent prostate cancer with any medication or any oral agent at all.\u201d\n\nFinasteride has had its ups and downs. Its chronicle began in 1993, with the start of a study sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and involving 19,000 men. Half took finasteride pills; the rest a placebo. In March 2003, 15 months before the study\u2019s scheduled end, its directors halted it abruptly. The reason was that the results were overwhelmingly compelling \u2014 men taking the drug were not getting prostate cancer.\n\nYet despite that note of triumph, a troubling finding emerged. The study was designed to look for a reduction in the overall prostate cancer rate. And that is what it found. But, as Dr. Scardino pointed out in an editorial five years ago in The New England Journal of Medicine that accompanied the study, it appeared that 6.4 percent of the men who took the drug got fast growing, ominous-looking tumors. In contrast, such tumors were found in 5.1 percent, of men who took the placebo.\n\nThe concern was that the drug might be preventing cancers that never spread. At the same time, finasteride might actually be causing aggressive cancers that can kill.\n\nIt would, of course, be the worse possible outcome. Dr. Scardino\u2019s editorial warned healthy men not to take finasteride.\n\nThat seemed to leave the drug dead. The study researchers, though, wondered if that conclusion was correct. Maybe, they thought, by shrinking the prostate, the drug was just making it easier to find aggressive tumors.\n\nWhen doctors do a biopsy for prostate cancer, they probe the gland with a needle, hoping to find cancer cells. But prostate cancer grows as little nests and an aggressive cancer will appear as dangerous-looking cells in some clusters and less dangerous in others. A smaller prostate means a doctor is more likely to hit upon cancer nests and more likely to find aggressive-looking cells.\n\nThe researchers had a way to learn if they were correct. Most of the men in the study who had cancer \u2014 aggressive or not \u2014 chose to be treated and many had their prostates removed. A pathologist could carefully examine every one of those 500 prostates and compare the kinds of cancers found at surgery to those initially diagnosed at biopsy.\n\nIt took years, but the analysis showed the hypothesis was right. Now, two groups of independent researchers conclude, in papers in the current issue of Cancer Prevention Research, that finasteride decreases the risk of having any tumor at all \u2014 large or small, fast growing or slow growing, by the same amount \u2014 nearly 30 percent.\n\nWith this new analysis, many prostate cancer specialists, including Dr. Scardino, say their view of the drug has completely changed. The study actually found that finasteride protects against both lethal and less dangerous tumors and could cut prostate cancer risk by nearly a third.\n\nEven the effect on smaller tumors has important implications, said Dr. Ian M. Thompson, Jr., the study\u2019s principal researcher and a urologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio.\n\n\u201cThe cancers that were prevented were the ones men are having surgery and radiation for today,\u201d Dr. Thompson said.\n\nNow, though, prostate cancer specialists have a new problem: How can they change the drug\u2019s image?\n\nDrug companies are unlikely to be instrumental, Dr. Thompson and others say, because finasteride\u2019s patent has expired, giving companies little incentive to apply to the Food and Drug Administration to market it as a cancer preventative. Without F.D.A. approval, finasteride cannot be advertised as preventing cancer and insurers may not pay for it.\n\nBut doctors can prescribe drugs for other purposes at their discretion and Dr. Parnes said that men and their doctors may be persuaded to try it.\n\nIn the meantime, GlaxoSmithKline, which has a patented drug, Avodart, to reduce the size of men\u2019s prostates, has a study asking whether its drug can prevent prostate cancer. If it can, and the drug agency approves Avodart for cancer prevention, doctors and patients may have to decide between a generic drug used off-label or a more expensive brand-name drug that does much the same thing.\n\nSome leading prostate specialists, like Dr. Scardino, say they are recommending that men who worry about prostate cancer take finasteride.\n\nHe also ponders taking it himself. \u201cI regularly think, Why don\u2019t I take it? Why wouldn\u2019t every man take it?\u201d Dr. Scardino said. He hasn\u2019t done so yet, partly because those years of concern about the drug took a toll.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the difficulty of adjusting to something that originally had a bad reputation,\u201d Dr. Scardino explained.\n\nDr. Thompson has no such fears.\n\nHe is at no particular risk for prostate cancer, but, he reasons, taking finasteride is not that different than taking a statin for a slightly elevated cholesterol level.\n\n\u201cImagine the marathoner with no family history of heart disease, who\u2019s skinny, doesn\u2019t smoke and has normal blood pressure,\u201d Dr. Thompson says. \u201cShould he take a statin? The amount of benefit he\u2019ll get is not much, but his risk reduction still is 25 or 30 percent.\u201d\n\nDr. Thompson knows what he will do about finasteride.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 54,\u201d he said. \u201cThe men in the study were 55 and older. So I\u2019ll start taking it next year.\u201d", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "Having experts in the field talk about medicating all men instead of providing them with some understanding of the magnitude of the risk seems like disease mongering.

It's a mind-controlled robotic arm that has pressure sensors in each fingertip that send signals directly to Copeland's brain.\n\nThe scientists published details of their work online Thursday in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\n\"It's a really weird sensation,\" Copeland, now 30, says in a video made shortly after he first tried the system. \"Sometimes it feels, kind of, like electrical and sometimes it's more of a pressure.\" But he also describes many of the sensations coming from his robotic hand as \"natural.\"\n\nWhen Copeland touches an object with the robotic hand, he can tell which finger the sensation is coming from and whether an object feels hard or soft, says Robert Gaunt, a bioengineer and assistant professor in the Department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\n\"But we're really not at the point where we could, say, get him to feel the difference between silk and burlap,\" Gaunt says.\n\nThe success represents an advance that is \"absolutely critical in terms of making prosthetics useful,\" says Mike McLoughlin, an engineer at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.\n\nMcLoughlin is part of a team at Hopkins that developed the Modular Prosthetic Limb that Copeland is using. The research at both Hopkins and in Pittsburgh is supported by the government's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.\n\nFor several years now, people have been able to control robotic arms using thoughts alone. But they have relied entirely on vision to know whether the arm is going in the right direction or grasping an object with the proper amount of force.\n\nThat makes it very challenging to perform simple tasks like grasping a foam coffee cup without crushing it, McLoughlin says.\n\n\"Without sensory feedback, somebody would have to actually have to look at the prosthetic, look at the cup, start to close the hand, (and) visually see the cup is starting to deform,\" he says.\n\nRestoring Copeland's sense of touch was a painstaking process, but the Pittsburgh team knew it was possible.\n\n\"His hand has been disconnected from his brain because of his spinal cord injury,\" Gaunt says. \"But the brain hasn't lost its ability to feel.\"\n\nSo the team began looking for a way to send touch sensations directly to Copeland's brain. The first step was to monitor his brain activity using a technique called magnetoencephalography.\n\n\"We were able to see the parts of his brain that became active when he was watching videos of a hand being touched,\" Gaunt says.\n\nNext, the researchers placed tiny electrodes in Copeland's brain that could stimulate the areas corresponding to each finger. Then they waited for the brain to heal, as it adjusted to the presence of the electrodes.\n\nIt was several weeks before the team was able to send the first tiny pulse of electricity to Copeland's brain. \"When it finally happened, he just very calmly said, 'Yep, I felt it on my index finger,' \" Gaunt recalls. \"But in the background I was breathing a sigh of relief and other people were cheering.\"\n\nOf course, mind-controlled robots are still years away from consumer applications, McLoughlin says. At the moment, they are still too expensive, too bulky and too finicky to be used outside a laboratory setting. And there's no good way to control them without implanting electrodes in the brain.\n\nStill, the ability to receive touch sensation from a robotic arm has the potential to help not only thousands of people who are paralyzed, but also people with a wide range of physical disabilities, McLoughlin says. For example, robots that provide sensory feedback could eventually help a disabled person cook a meal or clean up things at home.\n\n\"We're on the verge of something here that's going to transform lives,\" he says.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There was no disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "(CNN) -- A new study released Thursday suggests mammograms might not be as effective in reducing deaths from breast cancer in women over 50 as previously thought.\n\nThe study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, analyzed data from more than 40,000 women with breast cancer.\n\nIt concluded the availability of mammography screening corresponded with a reduction in the rate of death from breast cancer, \"but the screening itself accounted for only about a third of the total reduction.\"\n\nThe study involved women in Norway between ages 50 and 69.\n\nResearchers from Norway and Harvard University compared the death rates from breast cancer in four groups: one group of women from 1996 through 2005 who were living in Norwegian counties with screening; another group in the same time period who were living in counties without screening; and two similar groups from 1986 through 1995.\n\n\"Among women in the nonscreening group, there was an 18 percent reduction in the rate of death from breast cancer, as compared with the preceding 10-year period, presumably as a result of increased breast-cancer awareness, improved therapy, and the use of more sensitive diagnostic tools,\" the findings state. \"Among women in the screening group, there was a 28 percent reduction in mortality from breast cancer during the same period.

But her dreams of having a family were real and she began to be concerned as she got older about her chances of having a baby.\n\n\u201cI knew starting a family was a few years off,\u201d said Gold. \u201cI was very career-minded and very focused and had relationships throughout my 20s and early 30s, but still wasn't in that forever relationship.\u201d\n\nWomen are born with a finite number of eggs: they start out with roughly one to two million in their ovaries. Once a woman hits puberty the number drops to 300,000 and by age 30 the amount decreases by 90 percent. In her mid-30\u2019s Alyssa worried how many eggs she had left.\n\nTurns out there\u2019s a simple blood test that could tell her.\n\nFor years, it\u2019s been a staple in fertility clinics; it\u2019s officially called the Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) test. Some doctors are now offering it as an option to healthy women to assess what they call their ovarian reserve.\n\nIt\u2019s now being called the \u201cbaby deadline test.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are some young, healthy women who are living their lives in shape and taking very good care of themselves who might not know that their reserve strength of their ovaries is lower than it should be.\u201d said Dr. Joshua Hurwitz a reproductive endocrinologist and infertility specialist with Reproductive Medical Associates of Connecticut. \u201cIt's a question of having the knowledge and awareness of keeping your options open.\u201d\n\nThe test is a simple blood analysis that usually costs less than $100. It measures the amount of AMH circulating in a women\u2019s bloodstream. This hormone is released by follicles in the ovaries and predicts the amount of possible eggs a woman has. The higher the result the more eggs, the lower the result the fewer eggs. The test doesn\u2019t measure the quality of the eggs and it\u2019s not a guarantee of fertility. The test has traditionally been offered to women who are struggling to get pregnant and helps assess the possible next steps, such as getting pregnant sooner or freezing eggs.\n\nFor Alyssa Gold, the AMH test was a wakeup call. At her regular gynecology visit, Gold took the AMH test and received news she didn\u2019t wanted to hear but it helped her take the next right step for her.\n\n\u201cI took the AMH test and I'm glad I did because the results were not what I was hoping them to be,\u201d said Gold. \u201cMy tests were really below normal and that was an indicator to me that I needed to move ahead with taking control of my fertility at that time and doing something, which was egg freezing.\u201d\n\nGold finished her graduate studies, and soon after met her future husband. She is now happily married, and at age 38, thinking about starting a family soon. She\u2019s grateful to the Baby Deadline Test for giving her that option.\n\n\u201cCompletely fortunate that I was able to get the information and make that decision that there is this medical technology out there to help me in that way,\u201d said Gold. \u201cIf I had waited until I met my husband and we were trying now to have a child it would be a very different story.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven the best AMH level in the world is not a guarantee for someone going forward or even right now but they are good indicators for fertility,\u201d said Hurwitz. \u201cThere's no way you should lose hope, there's so many things we can do these days and starting early enough we can use this information to keep options open, no matter what the result is you're going to be okay.\u201d", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story\u00a0referred to the AMH test as the \u201cbaby deadline test,\u201d implying a woman\u2019s fertility span is\u00a0a disease that must be\u00a0detected and dealt with early, years before she might want to get pregnant.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the injectable drug Siliq (broadalumab) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults.\n\nBecause of an association with suicidal thoughts and behaviors, Siliq will be sold with a \u201cblack box\u201d warning and should be considered only for patients whose psoriasis has not responded\u2014or has stopped responding\u2014to phototherapy or to other systemic medicines taken orally or via injection.\n\nPlaque psoriasis is an autoimmune condition that causes cells to build up on the surface of the skin, forming thick red patches and flaky silver-white scales. Current treatment options for psoriasis include topical treatments (like corticosteroids) phototherapy (using an ultraviolet light box or a laser) and systemic drugs\u2014delivered via a pill, an injection or an IV infusion\u2014that work throughout the body.\n\nSiliq is unique because it binds to the receptor of a protein called interleukin-17, a known contributor to inflammation. By blocking the receptor from being activated, it keeps the body from receiving signals that can fuel inflammatory responses and psoriasis progression. Two other psoriasis drugs currently on the market work similarly, but instead bind to the protein itself.\n\nThis small difference is significant, says Dr. Richard Fried, a member of the National Psoriasis Foundation medical board, since responses to drug treatments can vary dramatically from person to person. \u201cHaving another agent in our armamentarium that works by a different mechanism is a welcome addition and may prove beneficial to many psoriasis suffers,\u201d he says in an email. (Fried says he has no involvement with the drug or the drug company.)\n\nIn the three clinical trials considered for drug approval, more than 50% of patients who used Siliq achieved total skin clearance\u2014the ultimate goal of psoriasis treatments\u2014within a year. The most common side effects of the drug were joint and muscle pain, headache, fatigue, diarrhea, throat pain, nausea, flu, low white blood cell count, fungal infections and reactions at the injection site.\n\nThe drug also comes with a more serious warning, as well. In a total of six clinical trials totaling about 6,200 participants, six suicides were reported by people receiving Siliq. People with a history of suicide attempts or depression had an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior.\n\nBecause of these events, the labeling for Siliq will include a Boxed Warning, and the drug will only be available through a restricted REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program. In order to prescribe it, doctors must be certified with the program and must counsel patients about this risk. Patients must also agree to seek medical attention should they experience new or worsening mood changes, anxiety or suicidal thoughts.\n\nA causal association between Siliq and increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior has not been established. Fried, a dermatologist and clinical psychologist, points out that psoriasis itself can be associated with mental health problems.\n\n\u201cEffective treatment has consistently shown reduction in the incidence and severity of depression and reduced likelihood of suicide,\u201d says Fried. He adds that the data on Siliq suggests that it is not only effective in treating psoriasis, but that many patients experience improvement in anxiety and depression, as well.\n\nSiliq, like other psoriasis medications, also affects the immune system. It can raise patients\u2019 risk of infections and shouldn\u2019t be used by people with certain chronic conditions, such as Crohn\u2019s disease or active tuberculosis infections. People should also avoid immunizations with live vaccines while being treated with Siliq.\n\n\u201cPatients and their health care providers should discuss the benefits and risks of Siliq before considering treatment,\u201d said Dr. Julie Beitz, director of the Office of Drug Evaluation III in the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in an agency press release.\n\nThe drug\u2019s recommended dosage schedule is an injection once a week for the first three weeks, followed by an injection every other week.

A nationwide survey by the National Institutes of Health found that 28 percent of adults in the U.S. are heavy drinkers or drink more than is recommended.\n\nYet, most heavy drinkers don't get the help they need.\n\n\"The biggest problem we have in the field is that less than 10 percent of individuals with an alcohol use disorder get any treatment whatsoever,\" says George Koob, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.\n\nPart of the challenge, researchers say, is that many drinkers don't realize that a medicine long used to help people addicted to opioids quit their drug habit can help alcoholics and other heavy drinkers cut back, too.\n\n\"I thought my only option was AA,\" John tells NPR. We've agreed to use only his middle name; disclosing his trouble with alcohol publicly, he says, would jeopardize his business.\n\nHe's a 47-year-old professional who says he started out as a social drinker \u2014 a few beers with his softball team after a game. But he sank into a deep depression after several deaths in his family, and sought \"solace in the bottle,\" he says.\n\n\"I wanted to numb my thoughts,\" says John.\n\nHe'd often start with hard liquor in the morning, John says, and it wasn't uncommon to have eight drinks or more before the end of the day.\n\nHe worked from home, so he was able to mask the problem for a while. But eventually his wife confronted him.\n\n\"She had come home and I was rushing to hide a glass and she was furious with me,\" he recalls. \"Just absolutely furious.\"\n\nHe went to see Paula DeSanto, a therapist and director of Minnesota Alternatives, in Spring Lake Park, Minn. The center provides outpatient mental health and substance use treatment services.\n\n\"I would say John's story is not unique,\" DeSanto tells us. \"A lot of people are reluctant.\"\n\nSometimes, traditional treatments \u2014 such as residential rehab or a 12-step program like Alcoholics Anonymous \u2014 \"can [lead to] a significant disruption in their lives,\" she explains. \"There's stigma, shame and embarrassment.\"\n\nDeSanto suggested a different approach to John. To help work through the loss and grief he was feeling, counseling can help, she told him. She also recommended he try naltrexone, a prescription drug.\n\n\"Naltrexone is an effective medication for the treatment of alcohol use disorders,\" says Koob. He points to a recent meta-analysis published in the journal Addiction that concluded that naltrexone helped reduce heavy drinking and cravings for alcohol.\n\nThe analysis included data from 64 clinical trials in which people were given either the medication or a placebo pill to test the effectiveness of the treatment. The analysis also found that another drug, acamprosate, is effective at helping people who have already stopped drinking to maintain abstinence, perhaps partly by easing the physical and emotional cravings experienced by heavy drinkers who quit.\n\nSo, how does naltrexone work? The drug seems to curb the euphoric and sedative effects of opiates in the brain. Alcohol is known to activate some of the same receptors in the brain that opioids do, and studies find that by tempering the pleasure from alcohol, naltrexone can help people drink less.\n\n\"It blunts the effects of alcohol,\" says Koob. \"People [who use naltrexone] will say they have a drink, and it's not doing much for them.\"\n\nThat was exactly John's experience. After taking the naltrexone pill, he didn't get the buzz he was used to getting, so didn't want to keep drinking. \"I actually didn't feel the alcohol's effects,\" he says. \"It was startling.\"\n\nIt's now been about five months since he started taking the medication. He has not stopped drinking completely, but says he has cut way back.\n\n\"This is helping me,\" John says. \"I can go out with friends and not worry that I'm going to end up inebriated or sloppy.\"\n\nAccording to the findings of a recent review, both naltrexone and acamprosate, are safe, cost-effective and efficacious. But they are substantially underused, according to the review.\n\nMany physicians are \"unaware that there are medications to treat alcohol use disorders,\" says Koob. His institute is stepping up efforts to work with the medical community on that front, he says, and is also touting Rethinking Drinking, a website aimed at consumers that offers the latest research-based information on a range of treatment options.\n\nAny health care provider who is licensed to prescribe medicine can prescribe naltrexone \u2014 not just mental health professionals or addiction specialists. As as long ago as 1997, a published study showed that treatment of alcohol dependence with naltrexone by primary care doctors can be effective; follow-up research has confirmed that the primary care approach not only works, but makes treatment much more accessible.\n\nAccording to the NIAAA, \"patients can now receive effective alcohol treatment from their primary care doctors or mental health practitioners by combining the newer medications with a series of brief office visits for support.\"\n\nNaltrexone is certainly not a cure-all, researchers say. And it won't help everyone who has a drinking problem \u2014 especially if the disorder is severe.\n\n\"I use these medications as an adjunct to therapy, and group [sessions] and 12-step meetings\" says Dr. Jeffrey Hsu, a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University who is certified in addiction medicine. He says that when used alone the medicines are only modestly effective.\n\nBut there's good evidence that the combination of counseling and drugs such as naltrexone can help people cut back on drinking, or move toward abstinence.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story may inadvertently overstate the portion of the population that is a candidate for treatment with this drug. The story says that 28% of the adult population are heavy drinkers or drink more than is recommended.

However, naltrexone is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe alcohol use disorder, formerly \u201calcohol dependence,\u201d and not for drinking more than is recommended or heavy drinking. So undoubtedly, the pool of drinkers who might benefit from this drug is smaller than the 28% figure cited in the story.\nThis is a close call. A careful reader will be able to tell that the drug isn\u2019t an option for more than a quarter of the adult population (as the 28% figure might suggest).

The report, he added, might quell the craze.\n\n\u201cI think this will have an impact on a lot of primary care providers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 14-member expert committee was convened by the Institute of Medicine, an independent nonprofit scientific body, at the request of the and Canadian governments. It was asked to examine the available data \u2014 nearly 1,000 publications \u2014 to determine how much vitamin D and calcium people were getting, how much was needed for optimal health and how much was too much.\n\nThe two nutrients work together for bone health.\n\nBone health, though, is only one of the benefits that have been attributed to vitamin D, and there is not enough good evidence to support most other claims, the committee said.\n\nSome labs have started reporting levels of less than 30 nanograms of vitamin D per milliliter of blood as a deficiency. With that as a standard, 80 percent of the population would be deemed deficient of vitamin D, Dr. Rosen said. Most people need to take supplements to reach levels above 30 nanograms per milliliter, he added.\n\nBut, the committee concluded, a level of 20 to 30 nanograms is all that is needed for bone health, and nearly everyone is in that range.\n\nVitamin D is being added to more and more foods, said Paul R. Thomas of the Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health. Not only is it in orange juice and milk, but more is being added to breakfast cereals, and it now can be found in very high doses in supplement pills. Most vitamin D pills, he said, used to contain no more than 1,000 international units of it. Now it is easy to find pills, even in places like , with 5,000 international units. The committee, though, said people need only 600 international units a day.\n\nTo assess the amounts of vitamin D and calcium people are getting, the panel looked at national data on diets. Most people, they concluded, get enough calcium from the foods they eat, about 1,000 milligrams a day for most adults (1,200 for women ages 51 to 70).\n\nVitamin D is more complicated, the group said. In general, most people are not getting enough vitamin D from their diets, but they have enough of the vitamin in their blood, probably because they are also making it naturally after being out in the sun and storing it in their bodies.\n\nThe American Society for Bone and Mineral Research and other groups applauded the report. It is \u201ca very balanced set of recommendations,\u201d said Dr. Sundeep Khosla, a endocrinologist and the society\u2019s president.\n\nBut Andrew Shao, an executive vice president at the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade group, said the panel was being overly cautious, especially in its recommendations about vitamin D. He said there was no convincing evidence that people were being harmed by taking supplements, and he said higher levels of vitamin D, in particular, could be beneficial.\n\nSuch claims \u201care not supported by the available evidence,\u201d the committee wrote. They were based on studies that observed populations and concluded that people with lower levels of the vitamin had more of various diseases. Such studies have been misleading and most scientists agree that they cannot determine cause and effect.\n\nIt is not clear how or why the claims for high vitamin D levels started, medical experts say. First there were two studies, which turned out to be incorrect, that said people needed 30 nanograms of vitamin D per milliliter of blood, the upper end of what the committee says is a normal range. They were followed by articles and claims and books saying much higher levels \u2014 40 to 50 nanograms or even higher \u2014 were needed.\n\nAfter reviewing the data, the committee concluded that the evidence for the benefits of high levels of vitamin D was \u201cinconsistent and/or conflicting and did not demonstrate causality.\u201d\n\nEvidence also suggests that high levels of vitamin D can increase the risks for fractures and the overall death rate and can raise the risk for other diseases. While those studies are not conclusive, any risk looms large when there is no demonstrable benefit.

Uridine, which is produced by the liver and kidneys, is also found in some foods as a part of RNA, which helps make protein in the body.\n\nThese nutrients, along with other proteins, are essential for making brain-cell membranes that form synapses. To be effective, all three compounds must be given together, the researchers said.\n\nNearly all patients drank the nutrient cocktail consistently throughout the study, and there were no serious side effects, the researchers reported.\n\nTo show the drink's effect on the brain, patients underwent electroencephalography (EEG) throughout the trial. During the study, the brains of those taking the drink shifted from patterns of dementia to more normal ones, the researchers found.\n\nSince EEG patterns reflect the activity of synapses, this result suggests that synaptic function increased with treatment, the researchers said.\n\nAn earlier study found that patients with more advanced Alzheimer's did not benefit from Souvenaid, most likely because brains cells had already been lost so new synapses couldn't develop, Wurtman said.\n\nThere are as yet no plans to market Souvenaid, so the cost hasn't been established, company spokesman William Green said.\n\n\"Souvenaid is a test product in development, which is still undergoing clinical trials,\" Green said. \"No plans for the introduction of Souvenaid to the market -- either in Europe or the U.S. -- have been confirmed. It is probable that any introduction would take place first in Europe.\"\n\nAn ongoing study will evaluate the product over two years. If it appears to have a positive effect, then it may be something that could benefit patients even before definitive symptoms of Alzheimer's appear, Wurtman said.\n\nThies, of the Alzheimer's Association, is very cautious about the benefits of Souvenaid.\n\n\"Medical foods do not have a requirement for FDA premarket approval, but they do have a requirement for having a scientific foundation and some evidence of efficacy,\" he said. \"But they don't have the kind of data we would find for a medication.\"\n\nThat makes it difficult to make a clear-cut statement about the value of the product, he said.\n\n\"There isn't a clear diet that prevents you from getting Alzheimer's disease or improves your memory,\" Thies said.\n\nIn addition, medical foods for Alzheimer's most likely won't be covered by insurance, he said.\n\n\"You are making a judgment without the protections you have when dealing with a medication,\" Thies said. \"You're going to be making a decision using your own funds and we would advise anybody to make sure they understand what the product offers and make sure they understand what it's going to cost.\"\n\nFor more about Alzheimer's disease, visit the Alzheimer's Association.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There was no disease-mongering of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The controversy over when a woman should get mammograms is about to heat up again.\n\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of experts whose members are appointed by the federal government, issued a final set of recommendations late Monday saying that women between the ages of 50 and 74 should get routine screening once every two years. The task force's guidelines are important because insurers and government programs often follow the panel's recommendations in deciding whether to cover certain preventive services.\n\nThe task force's final recommendation is likely to be controversial because some other groups say the screening should start earlier. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, for example, recommends that regular screenings begin at age 40, while the American Cancer Society calls for women to start yearly screening at age 45 and then move to screening every two years starting at age 55.\n\nCongress has sided with proponents of earlier screening. Last month, in anticipation of Monday's release of the task force\u2019s final recommendation, lawmakers took preemptive action: It directed insurers to ignore the task force's latest guidelines and, instead, to rely on its 2002 recommendation. That called for annual mammograms to begin at 40. As a result of the congressional action, women in their 40s will continue to be able to get annual mammograms at no cost.\n\nThe differences over when to start regular screening reflect the growing concern that the benefits of mammograms may have been oversold, and that they don't outweigh the anxiety and potential harm caused by over-diagnosis and false positives from the tests.\n\n[In major shift, these guidelines scaled back breast cancer screening for women in their 40s]\n\nThe debate over when to start regular screening involves only women of \"average risk\" who don't have specific risk factors for breast cancer such as the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic mutations or a family history of the disease. They're also not aimed at diagnostic mammography, which takes place once a woman has a symptom such as a lump. The screening recommendations are not binding on doctors, hospitals or insurers.\n\nIn releasing its final recommendations, the task force confirmed an earlier guidance it issued that said screening mammography had the greatest benefit for women ages 50 to 74. For women in their 40s, the likelihood of benefit is less and the potential harms are proportionally greater, it said. The most serious potential harm is unneeded treatment for a type of cancer that would not have become a threat to a woman's health during her lifetime.\n\nThe congressional action, which was included in the recently enacted spending law, has drawn criticism from some experts.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Congress thinks it's perfectly acceptable, even preferred, for a scientific document from 14 years ago to guide coverage policy on screening for breast cancer in women,\u201d says Kenneth Lin, a Georgetown University family medicine doctor who teaches preventive and evidence-based medicine.\n\nPart of the problem is the common perception that women deserve free mammogram coverage and that the scientific community is basing its decision on cost or rationing, said Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University law professor and expert on public health.\n\nFran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, said the task force's guidelines for women in their 40s \u2014 that they should discuss whether to get mammograms with their doctors and make individual decisions \u2014 come closest to following the evidence accumulated over the past three decades. Women should trust that process, she said.\n\nDespite the decades of marketing of mammography to women, \"women are capable of understanding the complexities of the issue, evaluating the evidence and making their own health decisions,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\"At some point we will have to decide that we are not going to pay for interventions that lack a high level of medical evidence,\" she said. \"At this time, what does concern us very much are attempts by Congress to interfere with the makeup and process of the US Preventive Services Task Force.\"\n\nThe task force first suggested in 2009 that breast cancer screening begin at 50 instead of 40, touching off enormous criticism. In 2010, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, which required that certain preventive services be provided for free \u2014 if those services got a strong recommendation from the task force. But it included an amendment that effectively directed insurers to use the 2002 recommendations for mammograms. That meant that women who were 40 and older could get mammograms at no cost.\n\nIn April 2015, the task force came out with its latest draft guidance, basically reaffirming its 2009 recommendations that the greatest benefit of mammography screening is for women between 50 and 74.\n\nWorried that millions of women under 50 could lose their free annual mammogram coverage if the guidelines became final, several health-care groups, including ACOG, the American College of Radiology and the Susan G. Komen Foundation, lobbied Congress to block that from happening.\n\nLanguage was included in the spending bill that says any recommendations of the task force related to breast cancer screening, mammography and prevention refers to those \u201cissued before 2009.\u201d\n\nSen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) was among the lawmakers who pushed for the language to be included. In a statement, she said her number one priority was to ensure that women can get mammograms if they and their doctors decide it's the right thing to do. \"This means making sure that cost is not a deterrent to care,\" she said.\n\nSeveral groups that lobbied for congressional action said in a statement last month that the task force recommendations conflict with those of other organizations. This results in confusion and puts more than 22 million women at risk of losing of losing insurance coverage for mammograms.\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nThe simple way doctors can make patients feel understood\n\nHow cancer will affect Americans in 2016: in seven charts\n\nOmega 3 is still good for the brain.

Of those, more than 13,000 had elective C-sections. All of the women had previously had C-sections.\n\nMore than one-third of the surgeries performed during that time happened at 37 or 38 weeks. Babies born at 37 weeks were twice as likely to have breathing problems, infections or to stay in intensive care than babies born a week later.

Those whose mothers took the fish oil supplements during pregnancy sustained a higher body mass index (BMI) from the age of 1 to 6 years.\n\nHowever, the higher BMI was not due to a higher percentage of fat, but rather to higher percentages of lean muscle and bone mass, the researchers found.\n\nAt age 6, children whose mothers took fish oil supplements while pregnant had a 395 grams higher total mass, 281 grams higher lean mass and 10 grams higher bone mineral content than children whose mothers who took olive oil during pregnancy, the findings showed.\n\n\"The body composition at age 6 years in children given fish oil supplementation was characterized by a proportional increase in lean, bone and fat mass, suggesting a general growth-stimulating effect,\" the researchers, who were led by Hans Bisgaard, from the University of Copenhagen, wrote in the report.\n\nHowever, the findings only showed an association and did not prove that fish oil pills caused healthier growth in children.\n\nAccording to Dr. Jill Rabin, co-chief of the division of ambulatory care, Women's Health Programs-PCAP Services at Northwell Health, in New Hyde Park, N.Y., \"In pregnancy and beyond, adequate intake of fish is important for normal human development, and this paper certainly adds to the literature.\"\n\nBut Rabin, who was not involved in the study, did add a few caveats about the findings.\n\nThe population studied was relatively homogenous, and \"the [body mass] findings were not the object of the study (wheezing or asthma in children was the primary objective), growth was a secondary finding,\" Rabin explained. \"Certainly, however, this solid paper adds to the literature and paves the way for additional research on this interesting topic.\"\n\nThe report by Bisgaard and colleagues was published online Sept. 4 in the BMJ.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics has more on healthy growth.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering here.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "THURSDAY, Jan. 11, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Injecting a calcium-based cement into the bones of some people with knee or hip pain could help them avoid joint replacement surgery, Ohio State University doctors say.\n\nThe calcium phosphate cement flows into the spongy inside portion of the bone, filling in microfractures and other damaged areas, and it hardens in about 10 minutes' time, said Dr. Kelton Vasileff, an orthopedic surgeon at the university's Wexner Medical Center.\n\nThe cement braces the bruised or injured joint bone from the inside, Vasileff explained, and eventually is replaced by new bone as part of the body's natural healing process.\n\nThe procedure, called subchondroplasty, has been available to people with knee problems for years, Vasileff said. Now he and his colleagues are testing to see whether hip patients also can benefit from it.\n\nIt is much less invasive than a knee or hip replacement, and typically is performed on an outpatient basis, Vasileff said.\n\nThe procedure involves a smaller incision than joint replacement surgery, so there's less risk of infection, and a quicker recovery time that means fewer of the side effects associated with being bedridden, Vasileff said.\n\nHowever, subchondroplasty is only feasible in a narrow range of patients. Those with full-blown bone-on-bone arthritis or joint pain caused by damage to the cartilage and ligaments will get little to no relief from the procedure, Vasileff said.\n\n\"People who have significant arthritis where the cartilage itself is damaged and thinned, this isn't going to fix the arthritis,\" Vasileff said. \"But there are some people who may have some issues with the bone and mild arthritis.

But ketamine has not been tested in a large clinical trial, and all evidence of its antidepressant effects has come from anecdotes and small studies of fewer than 100 patients. Now, in the largest study of its kind, researchers at Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at University of California San Diego mined the FDA Adverse Effect Reporting System (FAERS) database for depression symptoms in patients taking ketamine for pain. They found that depression was reported half as often among the more than 41,000 patients who took ketamine, as compared to patients who took any other drug or drug combination for pain.\n\nThe study, published May 3 in Scientific Reports, also uncovered antidepressant effects for three other drugs typically used for other purposes -- Botox, the pain reliever diclofenac and the antibiotic minocycline.\n\n\"Current FDA-approved treatments for depression fail for millions of people because they don't work or don't work fast enough,\" said senior author Ruben Abagyan, PhD, professor of pharmacy. \"This study extends small-scale clinical evidence that ketamine can be used to alleviate depression, and provides needed solid statistical support for wider clinical applications and possibly larger scale clinical trials.\"\n\nAbagyan led the study with pharmacy students Isaac Cohen and Tigran Makunts, and Rabia Atayee, PharmD, associate professor of clinical pharmacy, all at Skaggs School of Pharmacy.\n\nThe FAERS database contains more than 8 million patient records. The research team focused on patients in the database who received ketamine, narrowing their study population down to approximately 41,000. They applied a mathematical algorithm to look for statistically significant differences in reported depression symptoms for each patient.\n\n\"While most researchers and regulators monitor the FAERS database for increased incidences of symptoms in order to spot potentially harmful drug side effects, we were looking for the opposite -- lack of a symptom,\" Cohen said.\n\nThe team found that the incidence of depression symptoms in patients who took ketamine in addition to other pain therapeutics dropped by 50 percent (with an error margin less than 2 percent) compared to the patients who took any other drug or drug combination for pain. Patients who took ketamine also less frequently reported pain and opioid-associated side effects, such as constipation, as compared to patients who received other pain medications.\n\nAccording to Abagyan, it is possible that another factor common to patients taking ketamine was driving the antidepressant effect, such as the fact that ketamine also relieves pain. That's why they compared ketamine patients with patients taking other pain medications. That control group eliminated the possibility that people who take ketamine have less depression because they have less pain. Abagyan says it's still possible, though unlikely, the effect could be due to a still unidentified confounding factor.\n\nThree other drugs with previously under-appreciated antidepressant effects also emerged from this analysis: Botox, used cosmetically to treat wrinkles and medically to treat migraines and other disorders; diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID); and minocycline, an antibiotic.\n\nAfter the diclofenac finding, Abagyan and team went back and looked at ketamine patients who did not also take NSAIDs and compared them to patients who took any other combination of drugs for pain except NSAIDs. Depression rates in patients taking ketamine remained low.\n\nThe researchers hypothesize that the antidepressant effects of diclofenac and minocycline may be due, at least in part, to their abilities to reduce inflammation. For Botox, the potential mechanism for reducing depression is less clear. The team is now working to separate Botox's beauty effects (which could indirectly make a person feel better emotionally) and its antidepressant effects. To do this, they are first using FAERS data to determine if collagen fillers and other cosmetic treatments similarly affect depression rates.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, more than 300 million people experience depression worldwide. If not effectively treated, depression can become a chronic disease that increases a person's risk of mortality from suicide, heart disease or other factors.

In a recent research paper, published in the open access journal BioDiscovery, Dr. Madalene Heng, Clinical Professor of Dermatology at the David Geffen School of Medicine, stresses that use of topical curcumin gel for treating skin problems, like burns and scalds, is very different, and appears to work more effectively, when compared to taking curcumin tablets by mouth for other conditions.\n\n\"Curcumin gel appears to work much better when used on the skin because the gel preparation allows curcumin to penetrate the skin, inhibit phosphorylase kinase and reduce inflammation,\" explains Dr Heng.\n\nIn this report, use of curcumin after burns and scalds were found to reduce the severity of the injury, lessen pain and inflammation, and improve healing with less than expected scarring, or even no scarring, of the affected skin. Dr. Heng reports her experience using curcumin gel on such injuries using three examples of patients treated after burns and scalds, and provides a detailed explanation why topical curcumin may work on such injuries.\n\nCurcumin is an ingredient found in the common spice turmeric. Turmeric has been used as a spice for centuries in many Eastern countries and gives well known dishes, such as curry, their typical yellow-gold color. The spice has also been used for cosmetic and medical purposes for just as long in these countries.\n\nIn recent years, the medicinal value of curcumin has been the subject of intense scientific studies, with publication numbering in the thousands, looking into the possible beneficial effects of this natural product on many kinds of affliction in humans.\n\nThis study published reports that topical curcumin gel applied soon after mild to moderate burns and scalds appears to be remarkably effective in relieving symptoms and improved healing of the affected skin.\n\n\"When taken by mouth, curcumin is very poorly absorbed into the body, and may not work as well,\" notes Dr. Heng. \"Nonetheless, our tests have shown that when the substance is used in a topical gel, the effect is notable.\"\n\nThe author of the study believes that the effectiveness of curcumin gel on the skin - or topical curcumin - is related to its potent anti-inflammatory activity. Based on studies that she has done both in the laboratory and in patients over 25 years, the key to curcumin's effectiveness on burns and scalds is that it is a natural inhibitor of an enzyme called phosphorylase kinase.\n\nThis enzyme in humans has many important functions, including its involvement in wound healing. Wound healing is the vital process that enables healing of tissues after injury. The process goes through a sequence of acute and chronic inflammatory events, during which there is redness, swelling, pain and then healing, often with scarring in the case of burns and scalds of the skin. The sequence is started by the release of phosphorylase kinase about 5 mins after injury, which activates over 200 genes that are involved in wound healing.\n\nDr. Heng uses curcumin gel for burns, scalds and other skin conditions as complementary treatment, in addition to standard treatment usually recommended for such conditions.", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There is no disease mongering in the news release.

Results of the technique, called deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS), will be presented Sunday at ENDO 2017, the Endocrine Society's 99th annual meeting in Orlando, Fla.\n\nThis study expands on the researchers' previous finding that dTMS reduced food cravings and induced weight loss in obese individuals. Unlike deep brain stimulation, dTMS does not need an operation or implantation of electrodes. Instead, an electromagnetic coil is placed on the scalp and sends magnetic pulses to stimulate specific deep regions of the brain. Currently approved in the U.S. for treating major depression, dTMS is being studied in some countries for the treatment of other neuropsychiatric disorders, especially addiction.\n\n\"We need new safe and effective therapies for obesity,\" said principal investigator Livio Luzi, M.D., professor and head of endocrinology at the IRCCS Policlinico San Donato and the University of Milan in Milan, Italy. \"Despite numerous preventive and therapeutic interventions, none has stopped obesity from reaching epidemic proportions.\"\n\nAn underlying cause of obesity may be an impaired gut microbiota composition, an imbalance in the complex mix of beneficial and harmful microorganisms that inhabit the digestive tract. Luzi said scientists now know that an impaired gut microbiota can alter the brain's signals for appetite and satiety, or fullness. He and his co-workers studied whether dTMS could improve the gut microbiota composition in obese persons and, if so, by what underlying mechanisms.\n\nIn their study, funded by the Italian Ministry of Health, the investigators recruited three men and 11 women, ages 22 to 65, with obesity as shown by a body mass index (BMI) of 30 to 45 kg/m2. They randomly assigned the study subjects to two groups for five weeks to receive 15 sessions--three times per week--of either dTMS (to the insula and prefrontal cortex deep in the brain) or a sham stimulation as a control. Before and at the end of treatment, subjects provided stool samples for microbiota analysis.\n\nThe research team also measured blood levels of glucose (sugar), insulin, pituitary gland hormones and neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine. Pituitary hormones play a key role in regulating appetite, and recent research shows that norepinephrine and other neurotransmitters affect microbiota composition, Luzi said.\n\nAfter five weeks of treatment, subjects receiving dTMS lost more than 3 percent of their body weight and more than 4 percent of their fat--significantly more than controls did, Luzi reported.\n\nResults of the fecal analysis demonstrated that, after five weeks, dTMS-treated subjects had greatly increased quantities of several beneficial bacterial species with anti-inflammatory properties, such as are found in healthy people. The control group, however, had no clinically relevant alterations in their microbiota composition, Luzi said. He also reported that changes in the abundance of other bacterial species correlated with improvement of metabolic and hormonal parameters, including glucose, insulin, several pituitary hormones and norepinephrine.\n\n\"These changes suggest a beneficial effect of dTMS on both weight loss and change in microbiota composition,\" Luzi said. \"Our research shows the innovative ability of dTMS in exerting anti-obesity effects through alteration of the gut-brain axis.\"\n\nEndocrinologists are at the core of solving the most pressing health problems of our time, from diabetes and obesity to infertility, bone health, and hormone-related cancers.

According to the recently released 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, small shifts in food choices can make a big difference; including a shift from solid fats to oils, like the oil in fresh avocados. On the heels of this advice, a new meta-analysis (considered the best evidence and an unbiased overview of the body of knowledge on a specific topic), published in the Journal of Clinical Lipidology, adds to the growing body of research that supports the use of avocados in lieu of solid fats (and foods that have higher saturated fat content) to significantly change lipid profiles.\n\nThe research, \"Impact of avocado-enriched diets on plasma lipoproteins: A meta-analysis,\" conducted at the University of the Pacific and independently funded , looked at 10 unique avocado studies with 229 participants, assessing the impact of avocados on cholesterol levels. Researchers found avocado consumption (1 to 1.5 per day) significantly reduced total cholesterol (TC), \"bad\" low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides (TG) when they were substituted for sources of saturated fat. Additionally, avocado consumption did not impact \"good\" high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL). However, the optimal amount of avocado and frequency of use needs further evaluation along with the nutritional similarities and differences between other different MUFA sources. Larger trials looking at the impact of avocados on major adverse cardiovascular events are warranted. (See conclusion of study)\n\n\"Interestingly, our results indicate that even healthy subjects with a relatively normal baseline TC (100 to 240 mg/dL), LDL-C (75 to 150 mg/dL), and TG (50 to 175 mg/dL) had significant reductions,\" says Sachin Shah, PharmD, corresponding author and expert in cardiovascular health.\n\nAs we head into American Heart Health Month (February) it's important to remind people that they have the power to help control their risk factors for developing heart disease by exercising regularly, knowing cholesterol levels and keeping them under control and maintaining a healthy weight. Cardiovascular disease is responsible for one out of every four deaths; it is the number 1 killer of American women and men, and it is a leading cause of disability.\n\n\"Fresh avocado, as part of a balanced diet, and as a cholesterol-free substitute for solid fats, can help be part of the solution for maintaining normal cholesterol levels,\" says Nikki Ford, PhD, Director of Nutrition, Hass Avocado Board. \"Beyond their naturally good fats, avocados are also a delicious way to boost fiber (8 percent of DV) and fruit intakes, both of which are under consumed in American diets.\"\n\nThe Hass Avocado Board (HAB) continues to be a leader in educating health professionals and consumers on the benefits of avocados. HAB recently created a series of simple, quick to prepare interactive meal makeovers to show people how to make small shifts in their diets by substituting fresh avocados for other foods or ingredients higher in saturated fats.\n\n\"This study supports the body of research showing the many benefits that fresh avocados have to offer when consumed in everyday healthy eating plans,\" says Emiliano Escobedo, Executive Director, HAB. \"Through our nutrition research program, established in 2010, we are committed to increase awareness and improve understanding of the unique benefits of avocados to human health and nutrition.

He's a professor of medicine and director of Vanderbilt University's heart clinical research program in Nashville.\n\nPeople with heart failure often take a combination of drugs, Lenihan said. These include medications to lower blood pressure and diuretics to help remove excess fluid that builds up as a result of the heart's labored pumping ability. In addition, some people have implanted defibrillators or pacemakers.\n\nEven with all these options, the death rate among these patients is \"unacceptably high,\" Lenihan said.\n\nHeart failure, a condition where the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs, is among the leading causes of death worldwide. A significant number of heart failure patients don't respond well to current treatments, particularly those patients whose left lower heart chamber, which pumps blood into the arteries, is weak, Lenihan said.\n\nCimaglermin acts as a growth factor for the heart, helping it repair itself following injury, Lenihan said. Specifically, it binds to the HER2 and HER4 receptors on the surface of heart cells that are important for cellular repair and survival, he explained.\n\nResearchers have tried using stem cells to repair heart muscle in much the same way, he said, but these efforts have not been effective. \"You don't see any sustained effect,\" he added.\n\nA phase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness. Before cimaglermin could be used to treat patients, it must prove its worth in a series of progressively larger and challenging trials and then be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The process can take several years. Based on these preliminary findings, larger trials are being planned, Lenihan said.\n\n\"This drug, although still in an experimental phase, might be an important way to improve heart function in patients with heart failure,\" he said.\n\nFor the study, Lenihan and his colleagues randomly assigned 40 patients to get an infusion of cimaglermin or a placebo.\n\nCompared with patients who received a placebo, patients given a high dose of cimaglermin had a sustained increase in the heart's ability to pump blood. The improvement lasted 90 days, with the maximum increase in heart function reached in 28 days, the researchers found.\n\nThe most common side effects were headache and nausea directly after receiving the drug. One patient who received the highest dose of cimaglermin developed abnormal liver function, which cleared up over a two-week period, Lenihan said.\n\nThe study was funded by Acorda Therapeutics, the maker of cimaglermin, and the report was published online Dec. 26 in the journal JACC: Basic to Translational Science.\n\nDr. Nanette Bishopric is a professor of medicine at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and the author of an accompanying journal editorial. \"There haven't been breakthrough treatments for heart failure for a long time,\" she said.\n\nCimaglermin, however, may be such a drug, she said. \"It's a remarkable thing that you could give a drug once and have it affect heart function three months later -- it's really extraordinary,\" she said.\n\nEvery drug currently used to treat heart failure has to be given daily or several times a day to get it to work, Bishopric said. \"And when you stop taking it, it stops working,\" she said.\n\nDespite the encouraging results of this first trial, a lot more testing will be needed before cimaglermin can be considered a standard treatment for heart failure, Bishopric said.\n\n\"These findings need to be replicated in larger trials, and you have to be able to predict whether improved heart function from cimaglermin will help people live longer and feel better,\" she noted.\n\nFor more on heart failure, visit the American Heart Association.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story doesn\u2019t commit disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Some doctors are raising concerns about a new cancer-treatment device that uses electrical jolts to zap tumors but that hasn't been through a large clinical trial to prove it's safe and effective in people.\n\nThe device, called NanoKnife, is currently being used in about 13 U.S. hospitals including Baptist Health Medical Center in Little Rock, Ark., University of Louisville, and Shands Hospital/University of Florida in Gainesville, Fla.

Measuring non-HDL and apoB provides a more accurate assessment for cardiovascular risk, as they account for the total 'bad cholesterol' found in the blood.\n\n\"The findings are most important for populations at high risk for cardiovascular disease, such as Type 2 diabetics, who have normal levels of LDL cholesterol, but elevated levels of non-HDL or apo B,\" said Dr. Vladimir Vuksan, research scientist and associate director of the Risk Factor Modification Centre of St. Michael's. \"Barley has a lowering effect on the total bad cholesterol in these high-risk individuals, but can also benefit people without high cholesterol.\"\n\nHigh cholesterol and diabetes are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease and stroke, historically treated with medications. However, Dr. Vuksan's research and work focuses on how dietary and lifestyle changes can reduce these risk factors.\n\n\"Barley's positive effect on lowering cholesterol is well-documented and has been included in the Canadian strategy for reducing cardiovascular risk,\" said Dr. Vuksan. \"Health Canada, the FDA and several health authorities worldwide have already approved health claims that barley lowers LDL cholesterol, but this is the first review showing the effects on other harmful lipids.\"\n\nDespite its benefits Dr. Vuksan said barley is not as well-established as some other health-recommended foods -- such as oats. Barley consumption by humans has fallen by 35 per cent in the last 10 years. Canada is one of the top five world producers of barley -- almost 10 megatonnes per year -- but human consumption accounts for only two per cent of the crop yield, with livestock making up the other 98 per cent. \"After looking at the evidence, we can also say that barley is comparably effective as oats in reducing overall risk of cardiovascular disease\" said Dr. Vuksan.\n\nBarley is higher in fibre, has twice the protein and almost half the calories of oats, which are important considerations for those with weight or dietary concerns.\n\nDr. Vuksan said barley can be enjoyed in a variety of ways.

In the eight-week trial, researchers found significant reductions in signs of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein and other blood markers.\n\n\u201cCurcumin is the active ingredient of the famous spice turmeric and has a long history of culinary and medicinal use in the Asian countries,\u201d said the study\u2019s senior author Amirhossein Sahebkar.\n\n\u201cTwo key effects of curcumin that account for most of the therapeutic effects of this compound are its strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties,\u201d said Sahebkar researcher at the Mashhad University of Medical Sciences in Iran, in an email.\n\nThese properties of curcumin have been shown in several animal studies, he noted, but there have been relatively few studies in people. So his team designed a randomized controlled clinical trial to see if short-term use of a curcumin supplement could reduce inflammation in people with metabolic syndrome, a cluster of risk factors for heart disease.\n\nHaving a large waistline, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, low levels of HDL (good) cholesterol and high levels of triglycerides, are among the factors that make up metabolic syndrome. People with three or more of these classic traits are at higher than average risk of developing heart disease or diabetes or both.\n\nInflammation is also emerging as a feature of metabolic syndrome, Sahebkar\u2019s team writes in the journal Clinical Nutrition. They set out to see if curcumin supplements could at least roll back that risk factor by enrolling 117 participants who had been diagnosed with metabolic syndrome for their study.\n\nHalf were given pills containing one gram of curcumin powder, and the other half were given similar looking pills with no curcumin inside. All the participants took the supplements every day for eight weeks.\n\nAt the beginning of the study and again at the end, the researchers measured levels of three blood markers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein (CRP), which even on its own has been linked with heart disease risk.\n\nThey found that the people who took curcumin had improved blood levels of all three biomarkers as well as reduced fasting blood sugar and hemoglobin A1c, a measure of long-term blood sugar levels. The comparison group had higher glucose and levels of one of the inflammation markers, and no changes in the other markers.\n\nThe study team also analyzed data from eight previous studies and confirmed that curcumin had shown a significant reduction of CRP concentrations in a total of 281 patients.\n\n\u201cThe findings of our studies, along with clinical findings reported by other groups, indicate the usefulness of daily use of curcumin supplement for the prevention and treatment of several diseases,\u201d Sahebkar said.\n\nThe researchers didn\u2019t examine the effect of curcumin on any diseases, and it was a fairly brief study, so it\u2019s not clear what the long-term implications may be they caution in their report.\n\nThe study was funded by the Clinical Trial Research Center in Tehran and the Iran National Science Foundation. One of the authors is CEO of Sabinsa Corporation and Sami Labs Ltd, manufacturers of curcumin supplements.\n\nSahebkar said most of the clinical benefits reported for curcumin have been achieved when curcumin was added to a standard drug therapy regimen, and patients should be careful not to replace their prescribed drugs with curcumin without prior consultation with their physician.\n\n\u201cCurcumin is a very safe natural supplement, and there is no severe adverse event associated with its use, even at high doses,\u201d Sahebkar said.\n\nHowever, owing to limited safety information, pregnant and lactating women should avoid using this supplement, Sahebkar said.\n\n\u201cIn addition, patients with malabsorption syndrome, gall bladder problems, gastric ulcer, bleeding problems as well as those who are undergoing surgery, and those who have a history of hypersensitivity to herbal products should be cautious and consult with their physician before taking this supplement,\u201d Sahebkar said.\n\nSahebkar added that he is often asked about the possibility of using turmeric instead of pure curcumin supplements.\n\n\u201cWhilst turmeric is known to have several medicinal properties, and its regular use in diet is strongly suggested, it cannot be regarded as an equivalent substitution of curcumin,\u201d he said.\n\nSahebkar said turmeric contains very low quantities of curcumin, usually less than 5 percent, and curcumin has a very low absorption in its raw form, usually less than one percent of raw curcumin is absorbed when taken orally.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story makes clear that inflammation is a risk factor for heart disease, rather than equating it to heart disease.

But now the Food and Drug Administration has evaluated the safety of the second generation of silicone implants and the results are mixed.\n\nAn FDA report, released in late June, says silicone implants are generally safe. But complications from implants are frequent \u2014 things like hardening of the skin around the implant; ruptured, wrinkled, or lopsided implants; scarring, pain and infection.\n\nAs many as half of patients will need to have additional surgeries or have the implants removed in the first decade.\n\nIt also turns out that the longer a woman has the implants, the more likely she is to experience these complications.\n\nTake Kate Marion. She had silicone implants for breast augmentation in her late 20s. Just shy of two decades later she noticed something unusual.\n\n\"When I was crossing my left arm across my body \u2014 for instance, to put lotion on my right arm \u2014 I would make a little noise from my armpit, the way little boys do when they stick their hand in their armpit and pump their arm up and down,\" Marion says. \"A little tooty noise.\"\n\nAn MRI showed both her implants had burst. Her doctor immediately recommended removing them, which she did. Marion hasn't suffered any apparent harm from her ruptured implants, and she even confesses to having an occasional twinge of regret that she didn't have them replaced when she had the old ones removed. But ultimately she decided she didn't want to go through more surgery.\n\n\"Well, how long would these next ones last? I would be in my 60s when I had to do this again, and who wants to have surgery unnecessarily when you are 60 something?\" says Marion.\n\nAlthough the long-term effects of silicone in the body are still uncertain, many plastic surgeons don't see the leaking of modern implants as a health concern.\n\n\"The actual silicone that's within the implants is inert. So if the silicone gel leaks, it doesn't travel through the body, it doesn't cause systemic problems. So the MRI is really detecting a cosmetic concern,\" says New York City plastic surgeon Matthew Schulman.\n\nBut there have been more serious outcomes. Annette Knecht got silicone implants in 1991 following a double mastectomy. For years afterward she felt ill, suffered multiple bouts of pneumonia, had trouble breathing and pain in her chest. Doctors reassured her it wasn't her implants.\n\n\"We had a CT scan done, and it showed OK \u2014 everything looked fine, so we didn't worry about it,\" says Knecht.\n\nBut no one ever told her to get an MRI \u2014 something the FDA now recommends that women with silicone implants get every few years. As it turned out, Knecht's implants had leaked; a biopsy found silicone in her lymph nodes and in her lungs. She is currently disabled and awaiting a lung transplant \u2014 all, she says, for vanity.\n\n\"We're about four generations removed from those implants,\" says Schulman, the plastic surgeon. He explains that implants have undergone big changes since the early 1990s, when Knecht received hers. Back then they contained a runny liquid silicone.\n\n\"The silicone implants of today are what we call a cohesive gel \u2014 it's essentially like a jelly. So the jelly may ooze a little bit, but it will not run out like an oil,\" says Schulman.\n\nSid Wolf of the nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen is among critics who point out that the data in the FDA report sample just a fraction of the nearly 400,000 women who receive breast implants each year. Moreover, that data are limited to just the last two or three years \u2014 not enough, Wolf says, to make any real claims about the long-term safety of the implants.\n\n\"There is a huge deficiency of long-term data at a time when we know that the longer these devices are in, the more problems ... occur,\" says Wolf.\n\nStill, there are plenty of satisfied customers among the nearly 400,000 women who receive breast implants each year. Not only have the number of women choosing breast implants for augmentation risen by nearly 40 percent in the last decade, Schulman says that in his practice, 80 percent of them are choosing silicone over saline. What's more, he says few of them follow the recommendations to get routine MRIs to screen for leaks.\n\nSchulman says that the rates of complications for silicone implants are roughly the same as for saline \u2014 though he feels these complications can be minimized by choosing an experienced surgeon.

Just under a third of women taking flibanserin got over their sexual distress and/or lack of sexual desire (vs. about a fifth of women taking placebo pills).

Breast cancer treatments that have shown the best results for for disease free survival include chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or both. For younger women still hoping for children, these treatments can cause devastating short-term or long-term loss of menstrual periods, and loss of fertility. While many women choose to preserve the option of having children by storing eggs before cancer treatment, the process can be costly and difficult.\n\nItalian researchers conducted a phase three study that included 281 women with breast cancer, aged 18 to 45 years and who had not experienced menopause. Patients were randomly selected to be treated with chemotherapy alone or with chemotherapy and triptorelin, a drug, called a GnRH analogue, that prevents the ovaries from releasing eggs. The researchers followed the women for one year after they had finished chemotherapy.\n\nAmong the women who had not received triptorelin, the rate of early menopause was 25.9%.

They can be carried out with a smaller incision using minimally invasive surgery, but they are only suitable for people whose ligaments inside the knee are strong.\n\n\n\nResearchers from the Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS) publishing in the BMJ Open journal found that the less invasive procedure was being used less than it could be.\n\nThe main reason for the surgery is osteoarthritis.

Because about 90 percent of the patients were Mormons, a faith that encourages its members to fast for one day a month, the doctors expected to find a relatively high rate of regular fasting among the study participants.\n\nThe researchers found that people who fasted regularly had a 58 percent lower risk of coronary disease compared with those who said they didn\u2019t fast, according to the report presented at the American College of Cardiology conference in New Orleans this week.\n\nThe study showed only an association between fasting and better heart health, which means it\u2019s possible that fasting may not have a direct effect but might just be more common among people who are healthier to begin with. Devout Mormons, for instance, abstain from alcohol, smoking and caffeine, which are all factors that could affect heart health.\n\nBut the researchers say the findings are important because they affirm the results of an earlier, larger study, published in 2008 in The American Journal of Cardiology, that found a similar association between fasting and heart disease among 448 patients.\n\n\u201cThe first study we did was not a chance finding,\u2019\u2019 said Dr. Benjamin D.

The scientists used blood tests before and after the fasting period to look at a number of different metabolic markers. Among other changes, they found that levels of human growth hormone, or HGH, surged after fasting \u2014 increasing 20 times in men and 13 times in women. The hormone is released by the body in times of starvation to protect lean muscle mass and trigger the body to start burning fat stores.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot more to be done to fill in the research on the biological mechanism,\u2019\u2019 Dr. Horne said. \u201cBut what it does suggest is that fasting is not a marker for other healthy lifestyle behaviors. It appears to be that fasting is causing some major stress, and the body responds to that by some protective mechanisms that potentially have a beneficial long-term effect on risk of chronic disease.\u201d\n\nDr. Horne noted that patients shouldn\u2019t take up fasting without discussing it first with their doctor.

Although ACE inhibitors were developed 10 years earlier, both types of drugs showed similar effects in the analysis, challenging previous findings that suggest ACE inhibitors have greater benefits.\n\nAccording to the new analysis, published online Jan. 4 in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings, the only difference between the medications is that ARBs are more easily tolerated.\n\n\"There has been debate for many years over the safety and efficacy of ACE inhibitors compared to ARBs, with many of them using an 'ACE inhibitor-first' approach, with ARBs regarded as less effective,\" study author Dr. Sripal Bangalore said in a medical center news release.\n\n\"We believe that our study ends the debate and gives physicians the option to prescribe either drug for their patients,\" added Bangalore, an associate professor in the division of cardiology, in the department of medicine at NYU Langone.\n\nBoth ARBs and ACE inhibitors interfere with the function of a hormone called angiotensin II, which regulates blood pressure, but they do this in different ways, the study authors said.\n\nAngiotensin II restricts blood flow through vessels, raising blood pressure. ACE inhibitors prevent the body from making angiotensin II, while ARBs prevent the hormone from doing its job by taking its place on the surface of blood vessels, the researchers explained.\n\nPrevious studies have suggested that older ACE inhibitors are more effective than ARBs. But, this latest analysis attributed that difference to changes in the standard of care over the decade between trials of the two types of drugs, greater emphasis on quitting smoking, and wider use of cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins.\n\nHowever, when trials were conducted at similar times, one drug was not more effective than the other, the findings showed.\n\n\"This is the first time that we have a clear and consistent message from the three buckets of trials of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, all of which show that there is no outcome difference between the two agents, except for better tolerability of ARBs,\" Bangalore said.\n\n\"The results of our analysis are especially important for patients, given that many ARBs are now also generic, which reduces their costs,\" he added.\n\nFor more about blood pressure drugs, visit the American Heart Association.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "This story does not appear to commit disease-mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Researchers have developed a score that predicts an individual's risk of dying within 5 years for people aged between 40 and 70 years old in the UK, according to new research published in The Lancet.\n\nThe score, which uses measures that can be obtained by simple questionnaires without any need for physical examination, such as self-rated health and usual walking speed, could be used by individuals to improve awareness of their health status, and by doctors to identify high-risk individuals for further treatment, say the authors.\n\nIndividuals can calculate their personalised 5-year mortality risk and what the study authors call an 'Ubble age' [1]?the age where the average mortality risk in the population is most similar to the estimated risk of the individual?through an online questionnaire, using the dedicated interactive website [2]. The site was developed with Sense About Science [3], a UK charity that that equips people to make sense of scientific and medical claims in public discussion.\n\n\"The Ubble website allows anybody in the UK between forty and seventy years old to calculate their 'Ubble age' and their risk of dying within the next five years compared to the general population, using a simple set of a dozen or so questions,\" says study co-author Professor Erik Ingelsson from Uppsala University, Sweden. \"This is the first study of its kind which is based on a very large study sample, and is not limited to specific populations, single types of risk, or requiring laboratory testing.\" [4]\n\nTo create the score, Professor Ingelsson and Dr Andrea Ganna, from the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, analysed data collected between 2006 and 2010 from nearly half a million adults aged between 40 and 70 years from the UK Biobank [5]. They used a statistical survival model to assess the probability that 655 specific demographic, lifestyle, and health measurements could predict death from any cause and six specific causes, in men and women separately.\n\nThe results allow researchers to compare the predictive ability of a large number of health-related risk factors which were formerly studied separately and using different populations, although the predictive ability of risk factors does not necessarily imply they are causally related to the risk of dying.\n\nFor example, the research shows that self-reported information, such as usual walking pace and illness and injuries in the past 2 years, is generally a stronger predictor of death and survival than biological measurements, such as pulse rate and blood pressure. Surprisingly, self-reported walking pace is a stronger predictor of death risk in both men and women than smoking habits and other lifestyle measurements.\n\nSelf-rated overall health [6] emerged as the single most powerful predictor of death in men, and previous cancer diagnosis the strongest predictor in women (see figure 1 of the Article). When excluding individuals with serious diseases or disorders, smoking habits were the strongest predictors of mortality from any cause (figure 3).\n\nUsing these findings, the researchers then developed an easy-to-calculate risk score for an individual's risk of dying in the next 5 years, based on the most predictive self-reported information, including 13 questions for men and 11 for women. The performance of the score was validated in 35810 participants enrolled at two Scottish centres which were not used to develop the score, and was found to have around 80% accuracy in men and women (table 2). UK life tables and census information were used to calibrate the score for the overall UK population.\n\nAccording to study co-author Dr Ganna, \"The fact that the score can be measured online in a brief questionnaire, without any need for lab tests or physical examination, is an exciting development. We hope that our score might eventually enable doctors to quickly and easily identify their highest risk patients, although more research will be needed to determine whether it can be used in this way in a clinical setting. Of course, the score has a degree of uncertainty and shouldn't be seen as a deterministic prediction. For most people, a high risk of dying in the next five years can be reduced by increased physical activity, smoking cessation, and a healthy diet.\" [4]\n\nWriting in a linked Comment, Simon Thompson and Peter Willeit from the University of Cambridge in the UK say, \"One appealing aspect of the website is the representation of an individual's estimated 5 year mortality risk as what the authors call \"Ubble age\" (the age where the average risk in the population is most similar to the estimated risk of the individual); this concept is similar to that of heart age developed for communicating cardiovascular risk. Whether this will help individuals improve self-awareness of their health status, however, or only lead to so-called cyberchondria, is a moot point.

On Thursday, an FDA advisory panel is expected to review Qnexa, made by Vivus, from a combination of phentermine and topiramate. It helped patients in clinical trials lose as much as 13 percent to 15 percent of body weight.\n\nFDA briefing documents posted online Tuesday acknowledged Qnexa's effectiveness in helping patients lose weight, but said the review panel should take into account a number of potential nervous system and psychiatric side effects, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe third new drug is Orexigen Therapeutic's Contrave, which is a combination of the antidepressant Wellbutrin and the addiction drug naltrexone.\n\nFor the lorcaserin study, Smith's team randomly assigned 3,182 obese or overweight people to lorcaserin or placebo. Patients took lorcaserin twice a day for a year and also took part in diet and exercise counseling.\n\nAfter one year, 47.5 percent of those taking lorcaserin had lost 5 percent or more of their body weight. \"That's about 20 pounds,\" Smith said.\n\nAmong those taking the placebo, only 20.3 percent had achieved that amount of weight loss, the researchers found.\n\nAfter the first year, people taking lorcaserin were randomized to lorcaserin or placebo for an additional year. Among people who stayed on lorcaserin, 67.9 percent were able to maintain the weight loss they had seen in the first year. Among those who were switched to a placebo, 50.3 percent were able to maintain their weight loss, Smith's group reported.\n\nSmith's team noted that for those taking lorcaserin, there was no increase in heart valve problems as had been seen with the discredited diet drug Fen-Phen. However, common side effects included headache, dizziness and nausea.\n\nDr. Arne Astrup, from the department of human nutrition at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark and author of an accompanying journal editorial, said that \"the trial on lorcaserin provides evidence of a safe weight-loss medication, that seems to provide benefits in terms of reducing risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\"\n\nAlso, it does not have the same problems as the previous weight-loss drugs, Fen-Phen (Phentermine), Acomplia (rimonabant) or Meridia (sibutramine), which had been associated with heart problems, he said.\n\n\"If weight-loss drugs are tailor-made to hit only the right receptor, based on physiological knowledge, it seems to be possible to develop weight-loss medications that do not possess any serious adverse effects,\" Astrup added.\n\nHowever, one expert was not sold on this new drug.\n\n\"What's most impressive about this two-year clinical trial is how unimpressive it is,\" said Dr. David L. Katz, director of the Prevention Research Center at Yale University School of Medicine.\n\nNearly half of the people dropped out in the first year, he pointed out, and by year two, more than half the remainder had also dropped out.\n\n\"Among those who remained, lorcaserin produced relatively modest weight loss when combined with diet and exercise counseling, and that weight loss was maintained in over half of the participants only so long as they kept taking the drug. And the paper made no mention of the costs attached to long-term pharmacotherapy,\" Katz added.\n\n\"This close look at lorcaserin reaffirms that better daily use of feet and forks holds far greater promise for meaningful, sustainable and affordable weight control than pharmacotherapy,\" Katz said.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, lorcaserin will be reviewed by an FDA panel in September, and Contrave will be reviewed in December.\n\nFor more on losing weight, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The second sentence begins, \"A potential player in fighting the obesity epidemic.\" That is the sole reference to the problem of obesity, and, although it contributes to the framing of\u00a0obesity as a disease that needs medication versus a risk factor for disease that can be altered with lifestyle changes, it doesn\u2019t quite register as disease mongering.

It is an autoimmune disorder, in which the immune system attacks the thyroid gland.\n\nCertain immune-system signaling molecules also target other tissues in the body, including in the eyes, which causes their bulging appearance, sometimes known as Graves\u2019 eyes. About 30 percent of people with Graves\u2019 disease develop mildly bulging eyes, and 2 to 5 percent develop severe bulge. This eye condition usually lasts one to two years and often improves on its own, according to NIDDK.\n\nTeprotumumab blocks one of these immune signaling molecules, so researchers wanted to see what effect it might have on the eyes of Graves\u2019 patients with moderate to severe bulge.\n\nThe study \u201cincluded some of the worst cases imaginable and we\u2019re now wondering whether the drug might find expanded utility in much-less-severe disease,\u201d Smith told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.\n\nBy week 24, the response rate was 69 percent with the drug and 20 percent with placebo. Among those who completed therapy, the rates were 79 percent and 22 percent, respectively.\n\nMore people who received the drug had sizeable reductions in disease activity and reductions of 3 mm or more in eye bulge compared to the placebo group, the researchers note.\n\nHowever, while only 10 percent of patients who received the drug had double vision before the study, that rose to 50 percent by 24 weeks.\n\nHigh blood sugar was also a key side effect in participants who already had diabetes, the study team notes, but adjusting diabetes medications solved that problem.\n\nThe typical treatment for Graves\u2019 eyes is glucocorticoids, which are not always effective and also have side effects, the study team notes.\n\nThe drug, also known as RV001 or R1507, has been developed by Genmab and Roche. River Vision Development Corporation licensed the drug from Roche. On Monday, Horizon Pharma announced that it was acquiring River Vision, which paid for the new study.\n\nSmith said FDA approval could come sometime in 2018. Enrollment in a follow-up trial is expected to begin within six weeks.\n\nThe duration of response to the autoimmune inflammatory disease, along with the quick response to initial therapy, suggests fewer infusions may be just as effective, \u201cbut future studies will sort that out,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThe researchers also cautioned that the study only included volunteers with active disease of recent onset so \u201cthe potential of teprotumumab in benefiting patients with milder, less active, or stable disease was not assessed.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2qSTjSn New England Journal of Medicine, online May 3, 2017.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No apparent disease mongering here.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "University of Pennsylvania researchers have identified what may be a more effective way to help people quit smoking. About 70 percent of smokers give up the daunting effort during the first week of trying.\n\nThe researchers, led by Caryn Lerman, a professort of psychiatry, divided 1,246 subjects into slow metabolizers of nicotine and normal metabolizers of the addictive chemical, based on the length of time it took for them to rid their bodies of the drug. The ratio of two metabolites, or byproducts, of the body's processing of nicotine allows easy identification of the two groups. The metabolite is found in blood and saliva.\n\nThe results of the comparison showed that slow metabolizers did just as well on a nicotine patch or the drug varenicline (marketed as Chantix), a drug that works on the nicotine receptors in the brain. But the patch costs less and has fewer side-effects than varenicline (including nausea, difficulty sleeping and abnormal dreams), so the researchers concluded that slow metabolizers should be put on the patch.\n\nNormal metabolizers of nicotine, meanwhile, had more success with varenicline because they tend to rid their systems of nicotine faster, limiting the effectiveness of the patch. Varenicline contains no nicotine.\n\n\"The slower metabolizers, they do very well with the patch. And they get no incremental benefit from varenicline,\" Lerman said in an interview. \"Why spend the money?

In a new clinical trial, scientists show that a daily dose of probiotic Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium bacteria taken over a period of just 12 weeks is enough to yield a moderate but significant improvement in the score of elderly Alzheimer's patients on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scale, a standard measure of cognitive impairment.\n\nProbiotics are known to give partial protection against certain infectious diarrheas, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, eczema, allergies, colds, tooth decay, and periodontal disease. But scientists have long hypothesized that probiotics might also boost cognition, as there is continuous two-way communication between the intestinal microflora, the gastrointestinal tract, and the brain through the nervous system, the immune system, and hormones (along the so-called \"microbiota-gut-brain axis\"). In mice, probiotics have indeed been shown to improve learning and memory, and reduce anxiety and depression- and OCD-like symptoms. But prior to the present study there was very limited evidence of any cognitive benefits in humans.\n\nHere, the researchers, from Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, and Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran, present results from a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial on a total of 52 women and men with Alzheimer's between 60 and 95 years of age. Half of the patients daily received 200 ml milk enriched with four probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. casei, L. fermentum, and Bifidobacterium bifidum (approximately 400 billion bacteria per species), while the other half received untreated milk.\n\nAt the beginning and the end of the 12-week experimental period, the scientists took blood samples for biochemical analyses and tested the cognitive function of the subjects with the MMSE questionnaire, which includes tasks like giving the current date, counting backwards from 100 by sevens, naming objects, repeating a phrase, and copying a picture.\n\nOver the course of the study, the average score on the MMSE questionnaire significantly increased (from 8.7 to 10.6, out of a maximum of 30) in the group receiving probiotics, but not in the control group (from 8.5 to 8.0). Even though this increase is moderate, and all patients remained severely cognitively impaired, these results are important because they are the first to show that probiotics can improve human cognition. Future research, on more patients and over longer time-scales, is necessary to test if the beneficial effects of probiotics become stronger after longer treatment.\n\n\"In a previous study, we showed that probiotic treatment improves the impaired spatial learning and memory in diabetic rats, but this is the first time that probiotic supplementation has been shown to benefit cognition in cognitively impaired humans,\" says Professor Mahmoud Salami from Kashan University, the senior author of the study.\n\nTreatment with probiotics also resulted in lower levels of triglycerides, Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL), high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) in the blood of the Alzheimer patients, and likewise a reduction in two common measures (called \"Homeostatic Model Assessment\", HOMA-IR and HOMA-B) of insulin resistance and the activity of the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.\n\n\"These findings indicate that change in the metabolic adjustments might be a mechanism by which probiotics affect Alzheimer's and possibly other neurological disorders,\" says Salami. \"We plan to look at these mechanisms in greater detail in our next study.\"\n\nWalter Lukiw, Professor of Neurology, Neuroscience and Ophthalmology and Bollinger Professor of Alzheimer's disease at Louisiana State University, who reviewed the study but was not involved in the research, said: \"This early study is interesting and important because it provides evidence for gastrointestinal (GI) tract microbiome components playing a role in neurological function, and indicates that probiotics can in principle improve human cognition. This is in line with some of our recent studies which indicate that the GI tract microbiome in Alzheimer's is significantly altered in composition when compared to age-matched controls, and that both the GI tract and blood-brain barriersbecome significantly more leaky with aging, thus allowing GI tract microbial exudates (e.g. amyloids, lipopolysaccharides, endotoxins and small non-coding RNAs) to access Central Nervous System compartments.\"\n\nThe study is published in the open-access journal Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience.", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The news release essentially does the opposite of disease mongering.

But few of those suicide survivors get the follow-up care they need at a time when they are especially likely to attempt suicide again.\n\nNow, a study shows that a simple intervention conducted by staff in emergency departments can reduce the risk of future attempts. The intervention involves creating a safety plan for each patient and following up with phone calls after discharge.\n\n\"It reduced the odds of suicidal behavior by half,\" says Barbara Stanley, a psychologist at Columbia University and the lead author of the study. \"That's a phenomenal difference.\"\n\nThe study, which was published Wednesday in JAMA Psychiatry, included 1,200 patients at five Veterans Affairs hospitals around the country. The findings offer a way for hospitals and clinics to help reduce the rising numbers of death by suicide across the country.\n\n\"When someone goes to the emergency room for a suicide attempt, they are at risk of another suicide attempt for the next three months,\" says Stanley. \"It's like a ticking time bomb.\"\n\nThis is the first large-scale study of the Safety Planning Intervention, which Stanley and her group developed in 2008 and which has been adopted at hospitals and clinics around the country. It can be provided by a physician, a nurse or a social worker and requires very little training.\n\n\"The interesting thing about the Safety Planning Intervention is that it is a relatively brief intervention and can be used in a lot of different [health care] settings,\" says Brian Ahmedani, director of behavioral health research at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, who wasn't involved in the new study.\n\nMany health care systems are starting to think about ways to prevent suicide, he says. That's because, as his own work has shown, almost 83 percent of people who die by suicide make a health care visit in the year before their death. Yet only 50 percent of those people have been diagnosed with a mental illness.\n\nThe intervention studied by Stanley and her group starts in the ER or a clinic, before the suicidal patient is released. First, a health care professional talks with the patient and tries to understand that person's warning signs for a suicide attempt.\n\n\"If they've grappled with being suicidal, they know what their warning signs are,\" says Stanley. For example, she says, someone might say, \" 'I find that I'm staying in my room, not answering the phone, not answering texts, not answering emails.' That could be a warning sign.\" Others might have repeated thoughts that they're not worthy.\n\nThe next step is for the patient \u2014 with help from the clinician \u2014 to come up with a set of coping strategies to help get through moments of intense suicidal ideation.\n\nFor most people, this intense state only lasts from a few minutes to a couple of hours, she says.\n\nThe coping strategy could be something as simple as playing video games, watching TV or talking to a loved one.\n\nIf people contemplating suicide can distract themselves with something they enjoy doing, they can bypass that narrow window during which suicidal thoughts can overpower them, notes Stanley. \"For suicidal people, the passage of time is their friend,\" she says.\n\nThe provider also tries to persuade patients to remove or distance themselves from their means of suicide. For example, if they own a gun, they should lock it away or give it to someone who can keep it away from them. \"If you make it really hard to use whatever means you were going to use, time passes and you give a chance for suicidal thoughts to subside,\" she says.\n\nSafety planning includes follow-up phone calls with the patient \u2014 the first call is made within 72 hours of being discharged from the ER. The provider asks the patient how the safety plan is being used and helps revise it if needed. The provider also makes sure the patient sees a mental health care provider for long-term care. A provider keeps calling until the patient has had a second appointment with a therapist or counselor.\n\nThat follow-up is key, says Julie Goldstein Grumet, a psychologist at the Zero Suicide Institute at the Education Development Center, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit.\n\n\"People often fall off and they don't follow up on their referrals,\" she says. \"And the times during these transitions from acute care settings is one of the highest risk times of suicides.\"\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, Stanley's team looked at five VA emergency departments across the country that used it and compared the outcomes with four VA emergency rooms that simply discharge patients after stabilizing them.\n\nAmong the nearly 1,200 people who received the intervention, half as many people had made suicide attempts (or had come very close) as those in the control group. In other words, the intervention had nearly halved the risk of suicide in the six months after discharge. Two-thirds of the people in the treatment group had used their safety plans, and they were also twice as likely to get follow-up mental health treatment when compared with the control group.\n\n\"The study is incredibly important ... because it shows brief interventions work,\" says Goldstein Grumet.\n\nRick, a father in Missouri, says a safety plan may have saved his 12-year-old daughter's life. (NPR is leaving off his last name to protect his daughter's privacy.)\n\nIn September 2017, she came very close to taking her own life. When he found out about this from her school principal the next day, Rick rushed her to the ER at Mercy Hospital Jefferson. \"The whole process was overwhelming, because you have your 12-year-old who's wanting to end her life,\" Rick says. \"And she'd not shared any of that with us.\"\n\nThe hospital wasn't part of the new study but was also using a safety planning intervention as part of its efforts to prevent suicides.\n\n\"The crisis counselor did such an amazing job of setting up a safety plan that my daughter felt comfortable with,\" he says.\n\nHe says his daughter didn't want to talk to him or her mother about her struggles, but she agreed to communicate with them in other ways. During times when she felt her urge to take her own life coming back, she agreed to watch TV with her mother or call or text her father.\n\nRick says she usually sends a specific emoji when she is having a bad day. And he responds by distracting her with something completely different.\n\nHe says she also agreed to use a crisis help line if things escalated.\n\n\"It was something that she could follow through with,\" he says. \"It gave her some confidence and it gave me some confidence.\"\n\nHe says the plan has helped his daughter get through her suicidal phase and even slowly open up to her parents.\n\n\"That's what is so powerful about a safety plan,\" says Ahmedani. \"The patient is the author of their safety plan, but it's guided by a provider.\"\n\nAs part of the 2012 National Strategy For Suicide Prevention, many health care providers have adopted the approaches to prevention outlined in the Zero Suicide Initiative, which includes safety planning based on previous evidence showing it works.\n\nWhile safety planning has begun to be used across the country, it ought to be adopted universally, says Goldstein Grumet.\n\n\"It is a brief intervention that hospital workers, primary care staff, outpatient behavioral health, can all be trained in to utilize,\" she says.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States overall and suicide rates have increased by more than 30% in half of U.S. states since 1999.

For most people, they start to grow in between ages 17 and 25. They're thought to crowd out other teeth or cause tooth decay, which is why many dentists and oral surgeons think it's better to just nip those problems in the bud and take them out as a preventative measure.\n\nBut there's a serious debate between dentists and oral surgeons: should they preemptively remove someone's wisdom teeth if the patient doesn't have any symptoms?\n\nSimply put, there's no right answer. It comes down to what you, as a patient, want. Here's what you need to know to figure that out.\n\nDentists and oral surgeons are fighting over wisdom teeth\n\nDentists and oral surgeons agree across the board that there's cause to remove wisdom teeth if a patient is in pain or if there are signs of disease popping up, like tooth decay or infection. That's an obvious choice. But taking out wisdom teeth when there aren't any symptoms is where the professionals get into it.\n\nMany dental professionals stick with a watch and wait approach with wisdom teeth to avoid surgery if possible. \"Many people don\u2019t have adequate space in their jaw for the teeth to come into full position, but that alone isn\u2019t justification of having them all removed,\" says Dr. Scott Tomar of University of North Carolina's School of Dentistry. Tomar says that as a dentist he feels the risks of complication, including infection and hitting nerves during surgery, outweigh any benefits of preventative removal.\n\nIn 2007, oral surgeon Dr. Jay Friedman called the preventative removals a public health hazard in the American Journal of Public Health. The American Public Health Association has sided with this argument since 2008, when it formally opposed the preventative removal of wisdom teeth. (The same thing happened with tonsils, which doctors no longer remove just to get rid of the chance of infection later on.)\n\nAmericans spend an estimated $3 billion a year having their wisdom teeth removed\n\nSome doctors, though, still see preventative oral surgery as being two steps ahead of the problem. If you're going to need your wisdom teeth out eventually, why not have them removed when you're younger and are more likely to recover more easily? Some think of removing the wisdom teeth early on as a way to lessen the crowding of other teeth\n\n\"You might not have symptoms now, but you can't assume it's gonna be that way for the rest of your life,\" says Dr. Ray White, an oral surgeon working at University of North Carolina. Rather than let the teeth cause problems later on, many oral surgeons remove them.\n\nBut a 2012 Cochrane review of randomized clinical trials found there's no evidence that removing wisdom teeth will prevent or reduce crowding of other teeth down the line. And a different Cochrane review found that watching and waiting can \"may reduce the number of surgical procedures by 60 percent or more.\n\nThe question comes down to which side of the fence medical professionals fall on\n\nIt's worth noting that oral surgeons make a good chunk of their paychecks by removing wisdom teeth, so there is a financial incentive involved.\n\n\"Are there people gaming the system? Sure. You don't get paid much for not doing anything,\" White says. \"But I'd hope we can get past that.\"\n\nThe American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial surgeons says, \"There is no pat answer, cookbook recipe, or flow chart that is universally accepted regarding the decision making process\" in these cases. So the question comes down to which side of the fence medical professionals fall on, and what works best for their patients.\n\nThe risks and benefits of removing your wisdom teeth\n\nThere's a chance that if you opt not to have your wisdom teeth taken out, they might be fine for the rest of your life.\n\nThere's also a chance that they'll need to come out later. If that's the case, you can't always plan for it. Opting to have them removed gives patients time to plan around the procedure, which leaves people out of commission for about three days.\n\nBut inconvenience isn't the only risk. \"The risk for complications increases as people get older, and the duration of disability after the operation gets longer as people get older,\" says oral surgeon Dr. Thomas Dodson.\n\nIn some cases, the extraction can be more painful if you wait, Dodson says. That's because the tooth is easier to remove if its roots aren't fully developed.\n\nThe common risks related to the surgery include poor wound healing, infection, pain, and uncontrolled bleeding. Nerve injury, in rare cases of wisdom teeth removal, can leave people with permanent numbness around the face and mouth, according to the APHA.\n\nAmericans spend an estimated $3 billion a year having 10 million wisdom teeth removed, according to the American Public Health Association. That's a hefty bill for something we may or may not need. How much it costs depends on how the molars are situated.

After their weight had stabilized, each participant followed one of three different diets for four weeks. Participants were fed food that was prepared for them by diet experts. The dieters were admitted to the hospital four times for medical and metabolic testing.\n\nThe diets had the same number of calories, but the fat, protein and carbohydrate content varied. Those diets:\n\u2022A low-fat diet which was about 20% of calories from fat and emphasized whole-grain products and fruits and vegetables.\n\u2022A low-carb diet, similar to the Atkins diet, with only 10% of calories from carbohydrates. It emphasized fish, chicken, beef, eggs, cheese, some vegetables and fruits while eliminating foods such as breads, pasta, potatoes and starchy vegetables.\n\u2022A low-glycemic index diet, similar to a Mediterranean diet, made up of vegetables, fruit, beans, healthy fats (olive oil, nuts) and mostly healthy grains (old-fashioned oats, brown rice). These foods digest more slowly, helping to keep blood sugar and hormones stable after the meal.\n\nFindings, published in this week's Journal of the American Medical Association: Participants burned about 300 calories more a day on a low-carb diet than they did on a low-fat diet. \"That's the amount you'd burn off in an hour of moderate intensity physical activity without lifting a finger,\" says senior author David Ludwig, director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Children's Hospital.\n\n\"Participants burned 150 calories more on the low-glycemic index diet than the low-fat diet. That's about an hour of light physical activity,\" he says.\n\nThe reason for the low-carb advantage is unclear, he says.\n\n\"We think the low-carb and low-glycemic index diets, by not causing the surge and crash in blood sugar, don't trigger the starvation response. When the body thinks it's starving, it turns down metabolism to conserve energy,\" he says.\n\nThe authors note a downside to the low-carb diet: It appears to raise some risk factors for heart disease.\n\nLudwig says that restricting carbohydrates over the long term may be hard for many people. If you're trying to lose weight, \"you can get a jump start with a low-carb diet, but over the long term, a low-glycemic index diet may be better than severely restricting carbohydrates.\"\n\n\"The low-glycemic index diet seems to be the happy medium,\" says Cara Ebbeling, associate director of the Obesity Prevention Center. \"It didn't slow metabolism as much as the low-fat diet, and it didn't seem to have some of the negative effects on cardiovascular disease risk.\"\n\nOn a low-glycemic index diet, you would avoid highly processed carbs such as white bread, white rice, many snack foods, prepared breakfast cereals, sugary desserts and sugary beverages, she says.\n\nExperts had different responses to the findings.\n\nGeorge Bray, an obesity researcher at Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge who has also studied this topic and who wrote the accompanying editorial in JAMA, says that other studies \"show that you can do well on any diet as long as you stick to it. Adherence is the major key for weight loss and maintenance. There is no magic in any diet.\"\n\nEric Westman, a Duke University researcher who has conducted several studies on the low-carb diet and is co-author of The New Atkins for a New You, says this study documents that the \"lower the carbohydrates, the better the metabolic effects. People burn more calories if they eat fewer carbohydrates.\"\n\nMarion Nestle, a nutrition professor at New York University, says longer studies conducted among people in their own environments, not with such controlled meals, have shown \"little difference in weight loss and maintenance between one kind of diet and another.\" More research is needed to show that interesting results like these are applicable in real life, she says.\n\n\"In the meantime, if you want to lose weight, eat less.\"", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease-mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "It may seem strange to fight bacteria with more bacteria, but it could lead to a long-term solution for eczema patients\n\nEczema is the most common skin disease worldwide. People suffering from it often deal with a lifetime of painful symptoms. A new clinical trial is testing a natural treatment that researchers hope will provide a long-term solution for those dealing with the dry, itchy and painful skin that comes with chronic eczema. The trial uses a cream containing beneficial bacteria to fight harmful bacteria on the skin. While it may seem counterintuitive to treat bacteria with more bacteria, experts say this approach seeks to restore the natural microbial balance of healthy skin.\n\n\"There are over 1,000 species of bacteria that all live in balance on healthy skin, some that even produce natural antibiotics. However, we know that eczema patients lack the beneficial bacteria needed to kill Staph aureus, harmful bacteria that can worsen eczema,\" said Donald Leung, MD, head of the Division of Pediatric Allergy & Immunology at National Jewish Health.\n\nTo fight harmful bacteria, researchers isolate beneficial bacteria from our skin and grow it in a lab. It is then applied to eczema patients' skin as a lotion twice a day for a week. Bacterial DNA from patients' skin is then analyzed in a lab to determine if the cream effectively reduced the amount of bad bacteria present.\n\n\"Ideally, we want to eliminate all staph aureus from the skin of eczema patients,\" said Leung. \"What the cream does is help the skin gain back its natural balance and create that barrier needed to keep it healthy.\"\n\nResearchers hope that using the bacteria-infused cream will offer a long-term solution where other treatments fall short. Powerful antibiotics are commonly prescribed for eczema, but they kill good bacteria on patients' skin along with the bad. Creams containing corticosteroids are also often prescribed to eczema patients, but they come with harsh side effects, and patients usually can't tolerate them for long periods of time.\n\n\"The worst symptom of eczema is the itching and the scratching, and the more you scratch, the more it spreads. It can be very painful,\" said Cassandra Rodriguez, 33, who has struggled with eczema all her life.\n\nCassandra has tried just about every cream and medication on the market, and says when she learned about the clinical trial, she was on board to give it a try.\n\n\"The trial coordinator explained that it's like a probiotic for your skin,\" said Rodriguez. \"You hear all these things about good bacteria for your gut, so it seemed like a promising idea to apply that same concept to the skin.\"\n\nCassandra's son also has eczema, and she's hoping this research will lead to an effective treatment so that he won't have to suffer with the pain and embarrassment of the disease for as long as she has. \"He's little now, but dealing with eczema as a teen and an adult is really difficult,\" said Rodriguez. \"If there were something on the market that could help him and help everyone suffering with eczema every day, that would be amazing.\"\n\nExperts say there is more research to be done, but that the goal of the trial is to discover the best combination of bacteria to clear eczema from the skin and then make it available to patients as a prescription cream. The next steps involve testing those different combinations, ensuring they're safe and conducting a longer trial to see if the benefits of bacterial cream can truly provide a permanent solution for eczema patients.\n\nNational Jewish Health is the leading respiratory hospital in the nation.

According to the report in The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics, this highly sensitive test has the potential to be personalized to recognize mutations unique to any individual cancer.\n\n\"For monitoring patient tumors, only a handful of blood tests are available which are limited to only several types of cancers. Nearly all cancer patients require monitoring by whole body imaging, which can be costly, complex, and time-consuming. In contrast, molecular tests like the one we have developed will enable patients to be monitored at every visit, and thus have the potential for quickly tracking cancer growth and spread. Moreover, the test's rapid turnaround and relatively low cost, especially compared to next-generation DNA sequencing, provide a potential opportunity for universal monitoring of more patients than is currently done,\" explained lead investigator Hanlee P.

Five patients were previously diagnosed with colorectal cancer and one with cholangiocarcinoma.\n\nAfter generation of customized mutation detection assays, the researchers were able to identify tumor-derived circulating DNA from three out of six patients. In one patient, the assay was able to show the presence of three different mutations.

But a team from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City said the technology could help identify cases where prostate cancer has spread to the bone.\n\nRadiotracers work by injecting a small amount of a compound tagged with a radionuclide into patients. Using positron emission tomography -- also known as a PET scan -- doctors are then able to better visualize tumors and tumor spread.\n\nIn studies involving mice with prostate cancer, the researchers had the radiotracer hone in on prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the same prostate cancer marker used in the PSA test. They found that the PSA gravitated to tissues containing prostate cancer that had already grown resistant to standard hormone-based therapies.\n\nThe study also revealed the radiotracer could help identify cases where prostate cancer had spread to the bone. The researchers pointed out traditional bone scans are unable to differentiate between malignant and nonmalignant lesions.\n\nThe findings were to be presented Saturday at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting in Chicago, and are also being published in Cancer Discovery.\n\nIf used on people, the researchers claimed that the radiotracer might someday help doctors \"personalize\" treatment strategies for prostate cancer and better manage the disease.\n\n\"The ultimate goal is to be able to predict the response of patients to new and existing therapies at an early stage, thereby personalizing their treatment and improving outcomes,\" Michael J.

Similar programs have been used to treat depression, but this may be the first one tested to prevent it, the researchers say.\n\nOnline programs for mental health problems can be as effective as face-to-face treatment and offer some advantages: Low cost, available at any time and customizable. But they're not panaceas.\n\nIn this experiment, half of the participants were asked to do six half-hour-long exercises that were based on cognitive behavioral therapy and problem-solving therapy, which are techniques commonly used for in-person therapy.\n\nIn the cognitive behavioral therapy, participants were asked to identify positive activities they used to engage in and then are asked to actively plan those activities again. At the next session, participants reflect on their experiences.\n\nFor the problem-solving therapy, people were asked to create a list of the things that matter most to them in their lives and brainstorm on how to incorporate those things into daily life. They next were asked to categorize problems and worries into \"manageable\" and \"unmanageable\"; the main focus in problem-solving therapy is to tackle those problems that are considered manageable.\n\nBoth cognitive-behavioral therapy and problem-solving therapy are intended to change negative thinking in order to alter mood and behavior.\n\nAfter completing each exercise, participants in the intervention group received written individualized feedback from an online trainer. The trainers did not offer any therapeutic advice, only motivation and encouragement to continue the exercises. Participants also could repeat the online sessions as often as they liked.\n\nThe control group received information about depression but was under no obligation to read it.\n\nThe study, which was conducted by researchers from Leuphana University in Lueneburg, Germany, recruited 406 people with subthreshold depression, which is defined as having some symptoms of depression but not enough to be diagnosed with major depressive disorder. It was published Tuesday in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nOf the 406 participants that began the study, 335 completed the telephone follow-up at the end of 12 months. Twenty-seven percent in the intervention group experienced depression compared with 41 percent in the control group.\n\nIt is unclear if the people who went on to develop major depressive disorder had experienced it before. Lead author Claudia Buntrock, a PhD candidate in clinical psychology at Leuphana, says that because the study only tracked participants' mental health over the course of 12 months, the long-term effectiveness of the intervention is unknown.\n\nIt's also not clear if this kind of program could be scaled up. It took the trainers about 30 minutes to provide feedback for each session, and they also stayed in touch with participants via instant messaging, Buntrock says.\n\nOther experiments with online therapy have found that people didn't continue it if it wasn't guided by an actual human. One reason could be that when people are depressed, they can have a hard time getting motivated to do things.\n\n\"More studies are needed to evaluate the preventive effects of unguided web-based interventions on the onset of major depressive disorder,\" Buntrock wrote in an email. Still, Buntrock seems pleased with the results, especially since the German insurance company BARMER GEK that sponsored the trial is now providing it to its customers.\n\n\"I was surprised by the big response to our study,\" Buntrock wrote. \"And of course, I'm surprised about what happens now; that a health insurance company offers the intervention to its members.

The study, published this month in The Lancet Oncology, is the first to show a positive impact from checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy drugs on this disease.\n\nMalignant pleural mesothelioma is a rare and aggressive cancer that represents about 90 percent of all malignant mesothelioma cases. It's primarily caused by the inhalation of asbestos, a fiber commonly found in some forms of insulation, vinyl floor tiles, and other material. Tumors form in the pleura, a thin membrane of cells that line the lungs and chest wall. Most patients survive less than a year. This poor prognosis is partially due to the fact that most patients are not diagnosed until they are already at a late stage of the disease. The standard first-line therapy treatment involves chemotherapy, and currently there is no approved second-line therapy.\n\n\"There have been a lot of studies looking at different drugs, but researchers have not seen positive results,\" said the study's lead author Evan Alley, MD, PhD, chief of Hematology and Medical Oncology at Penn Presbyterian Hospital. \"But we've found this new class of drugs, checkpoint inhibitors, seems to be more effective than what's been available in the past.\"\n\nCheckpoint inhibitors are a class of drugs designed to free the body's immune system to fight back against cancer. Pembrolizumab, in particular, has been used to treat melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and in some cases, head and neck cancers.\n\nAlley and his team presented data from KEYNOTE-028, an ongoing trial involving 13 different research sites in six different countries all looking at the effect of pembrolizumab on patients with advanced malignancies, including malignant pleural mesothelioma. The study evaluated 25 patients with pleural mesothelioma, all of whom were over the age of 18 and had either already been treated with chemotherapy or were unable to receive it. Patients who had already received another checkpoint inhibitor were not included in the study.\n\nBeginning with the first enrollees two years ago, doctors gave each patient a dose of pembrolizumab every two weeks. The tumor reduced in size in 14 of those patients. On average, patients went about six months without their disease progressing, and overall survival was about 18 months. Fourteen patients passed away during the study, while four were still undergoing treatment as of the study's writing.\n\n\"Most patients who receive a second-line therapy have a life expectancy of about six or seven months, so to have four patients still ongoing at two years is very encouraging,\" Alley said.\n\nThe most common side-effects reported were fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, and dry mouth.\n\n\"One great sign in this study is that none of the patients had to stop treatment because of side-effects,\" Alley said. \"Some had temporary stoppages, but they were able to continue. The drug appears to be well-tolerated.\"\n\nThere are multiple studies going on right now to confirm these findings, which the authors note is a necessary step before the drug can become a standard second-line therapy. \"This study provides evidence that some patients can have long-term disease control with this drug, which we haven't seen before,\" Alley said. \"We need to better understand what we can do next to make immunotherapy more effective for more patients.\"\n\nAlley said there are already plans for trials that will test combination therapies, which will utilize pembrolizumab in conjunction with other treatments. Those studies are expected to launch later this year, including two at Penn.\n\nThe study was funded by Merck, which manufactures pembrolizumab.

The test is administered like a tuberculin skin test (TST), and results are interpreted by measuring the size of the skin induration two or three days later.\n\nThe TST is the most commonly used test to detect TB infection, with about 50 million tests worldwide each year, according to the World Health Organization. The test is easy to administer but produces too many false positives to achieve the WHO's goal of reducing TB deaths by 95 percent and new cases by 90 percent by 2035, Dr. Ruhwald said.\n\nIntroduced a decade ago, IGRAs have high specificity, producing few false positives, but require blood samples and complicated lab work, which has limited their widespread use. There is also a dramatic price difference between the two diagnostic tests. According to Dr. Ruhwald, a TST costs about $2; an IGRA is 20 to 40 times more expensive depending on setting.\n\nIn the first clinical trial, Dr. Ruhwald and colleagues conducted a double-blinded study of C-Tb in 979 participants enrolled at 13 clinical trial sites in Spain. Participants, all adults, ranged in TB status from presumed uninfected through intermediate and high risk of latent TB to active disease.\n\u2022 Both C-Tb and the IGRA had a specificity of 97 percent.\n\u2022 C-Tb was highly concordant to IGRA in 95 percent of study participants.\n\u2022 The specificity of C-Tb, unlike the TST, was not impacted by the BCG vaccine, the partially effective vaccine that many residents in the developing world receive. TST specificity in this group was only 62 percent.\n\u2022 The sensitivity of C-Tb was comparable to the IGRA in confirmed TB cases (77 percent vs. 81 percent), indicating similar abilities to detect infection.\n\nIn the second double-blinded trial, researchers were primarily concerned with testing how accurate C-Tb was in HIV-positive patients and in young children--populations in which the accuracy of the TST and the IGRA is known to be compromised. The study, conducted in South Africa, enrolled 1,090 participants, including 299 patients with HIV and 402 children as young as 28 days.\n\u2022 Among participants with HIV, the ability of all three tests to detect TB infection was diminished, though the C-Tb appeared more robust in HIV-infected participants with low CD4 T cell counts.\n\u2022 Among children under 5, C-Tb was comparable with the other two tests in identifying those infected.\n\nDr. Ruhwald said another advantage of C-Tb is that the measurement of infection, a 5mm or larger induration, is universal across patients with different risk factors, including HIV infection. With TST, the size of the induration is often adjusted to increase its accuracy in measuring infection in different patient populations.\n\nRegulatory approval for C-Tb is currently being sought and Statens Serum Institute is actively seeking a commercial partner for marketing of C-Tb. The cost of a C-Tb test is to be determined; however, it is expected to be significantly less than an IGRA.\n\nDiagnostic Accuracy of the Novel C-Tb Skin Test for Latent M.tuberculosis Infection; Results from Two Phase III Clinical Trials \n\nM.

C-Tb combines the field friendliness of the PPD-based Tuberculin Skin Test (TST), with the high specificity of the interferon gamma release assays (IGRA).\n\nThis presentation outlines the results from two recently completed phase III trials (TESEC-05 and -06). The results have not previously been published or presented.\n\nThe TESEC-06 trial included 979 participants from 13 clinical trial sites in Catalonia, Galicia and Basque Country (Spain) with various risk profiles of M.tuberculosis infection. The TESEC-05 trial included 1090 participants with symptoms of TB and 100 endemic controls from Cape Town (South Africa).\n\nIn both trials C-Tb and TST were administered in a double-blinded fashion to one or the other forearm. Skin indurations were read 2 to 3 days later. A reading ?5mm was considered positive for the TST and C-Tb (cut off preset in phase II). Blood for IGRA testing (Quantiferon, QFT-GIT) was drawn prior to skin testing.\n\nThe safety profile of C-Tb was acceptable and not different from TST. Test specificity was assessed in 212 presumed unexposed Spanish controls. Here, C-Tb had comparable specificity to QFT-GIT (both 97%, p=1.0, and there was no impact of BCG vaccination). By contrast, previous BCG vaccination subverted TST specificity [62% (67/108) in BCG vaccinated compared to 95% (99/104) in BCG unvaccinated persons; (p<0.001)]. Sensitivity of C-Tb and QFT-GIT was comparable in patients with confirmed TB [77% (235/307) vs 81% (250/307); p=0.08]. In contacts, mirroring the findings with QFT-GIT, there was a strong trend in increasing C-Tb test positivity with M. tuberculosis exposure (figure 1). The impact of age and HIV infection on C-Tb, TST and QFT reactivity was assessed in 1090 individuals with symptoms suspect of TB disease, analysis is ongoing and will be included in the presentation.\n\nThese phase III trial results demonstrate that C-Tb is safe, has comparable diagnostic performance to QFT-GIT and addresses the problem of false positive TST results in BCG vaccinated persons.\n\nThe field-friendliness and high specificity offered by the C-Tb test could allow for improved targeted treatment of M. tuberculosis-infected persons in also in resource-constrained settings, where IGRAs are too complicated to implement.", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The release does not commit disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "If you're one of the estimated 27 million Americans with osteoarthritis, you're probably all too familiar with the feeling of aching, swollen, or stiff knees.\n\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen may relieve those painful symptoms in most patients.

The researchers in Switzerland reviewed the existing studies and concluded that viscosupplementation was associated with an increase in these and other adverse events.\n\nDr. Richmond, who has independently reviewed the same research when the AAOS was drafting their recommendations to treat osteoarthritis of the knee, argues that despite infrequent instances of those side-effects, viscosupplementation remains a solid treatment choice for some patients.\n\n\"This is most effective in relatively younger patients, 40 to 50 to 60 year olds, and...in people with mild to moderate forms of the disease,\" says Richmond. \"This is not a first line treatment, but it's a reasonable treatment in those people who have been appropriately screened.\"\n\nThe authors of the study discourage patients from getting this treatment.

Williams said her daughter went to sleep in a crib with cushiony bumpers, stuffed animals and an added blanket beneath the fitted sheet and never woke up. She said the coroner determined the bedding caused the death.\n\nShe now uses a box with her son, Bryce, though he\u2019s getting a little too big for it.

Each box comes filled with a mattress, fitted sheet, onesie and diapers.\n\nThe Baby Box Co. is also handing out the boxes in Minneapolis, Phoenix and San Francisco, with the goal of expanding to all 50 states.

Baby Box University, Baby Box Co.\u2019s educational platform, maintains a website that coordinates the educational component of the program.\n\nThe idea for baby boxes started in Finland in the 1930s, and is tied to a sharp drop in sudden infant deaths, according to Dr. Kathryn McCans, a pediatrician who chairs New Jersey\u2019s Child Fatality and Near Fatality Review Board. The boxes provide a clutter-free sleep space that has been shown to reduce accidental and unexpected deaths, she said.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the U.S. rate of sudden unexpected infant deaths has been declining since the 1990s when public health officials began recommending parents put infants to sleep on their backs. About 3,700 sudden unexpected infant deaths were reported in the country in 2015.\n\nThe boxes are a new idea for many Americans.\n\n\u2018\u2018The thought of putting the baby in a box, I was like \u2018wow that\u2019s weird,\u2019\u2019\u2019 said Dolores Peterson, of Camden, New Jersey, who became a first-time mom recently and was among the first to bring home a box.\n\nPeterson\u2019s daughter, Ariabella, just turned 3 months old. She said the program was eye-opening for how much information she learned about how to prevent sudden unexpected infant death.\n\nMcCans says the complimentary items like diapers and onesies are nice, but the more important objective behind the boxes is bringing down infant deaths and grounding parents on safe sleep practices: Place babies on their backs to sleep; Don\u2019t use bumpers in cribs; Keep stuffed animals and blankets out of infants\u2019 sleep spaces; Avoid sleeping in the same bed as infants.\n\n\u2018\u2018No one brings their baby into bed with them because they want their baby to die,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018They do it because they want to be nurturing and they are, but it\u2019s not safe.\u2019\u2019\n\nTo get the boxes, prospective moms can register through babyboxuniversity.com, watch a handful of videos on sleep safety and pass a quiz.

Livingston, a professor and surgeon at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.\n\nThe average weight loss seen with either gastric bypass or duodenal switch will improve or reverse obesity-related ills like diabetes, sleep apnea and knee arthritis, according to Livingston, who wrote an editorial published with the study.\n\nSo for those medical conditions, it probably wouldn\u2019t matter if a person lost 100 pounds or 150 pounds over two years.\n\nBMI is a measure of weight relative to height. A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal weight, and above 30 is obese.\n\nThe patients in the current study were a fairly healthy group despite having a BMI of 50 or more.\n\nAfter two years, those who\u2019d had a duodenal switch showed a greater improvement in their cholesterol levels. But those levels were near-normal (in both groups) to begin with, Livingston noted.\n\nThat begs the question, he said, of whether the extra weight loss \u201cactually accomplished anything.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S., where about 220,000 people underwent weight-loss surgery in 2009, gastric bypass is the most common form chosen.\n\nDuring gastric bypass, the upper portion of the stomach is stapled off to create a smaller pouch that restricts the amount of food a person can eat at one time. The surgeon also creates a bypass around the rest of the stomach and a portion of the small intestine, which limits the body\u2019s absorption of food.\n\nDuodenal switch is more extensive. The surgeon removes part of the stomach, and the remaining \u201csleeve\u201d-like stomach is attached to the final section of the small intestine; that puts even greater limits on the body\u2019s absorption of calories and nutrients.\n\nBoth surgeries carry the long-term risk of nutritional deficiencies, and people need to take supplements and carefully monitor their diets for a lifetime afterward.\n\nBut the risks of nutrient deficiencies are greater with duodenal switch, and include some not seen with gastric bypass, Livingston pointed out.\n\nSome people, for instance, may have severe calcium and vitamin D loss leading to weak and fragile bones. Other problems include severe protein deficiency and night blindness caused by vitamin A deficiency (which is also reversible with extra vitamin A treatment).\n\nIn this study, three of the 29 duodenal switch patients developed protein malnutrition, two developed night blindness, and one had a severe iron deficiency that needed to be treated with iron infusions.\n\nLivingston said his advice to people considering weight-loss surgery is to avoid duodenal switch. \u201cIt\u2019s just not a good operation,\u201d he asserted.\n\nBut he also questioned the value of weight-loss surgery, in general, for severely obese people who do not have medical conditions that stand to improve or resolve after surgery.\n\nIn general, experts say that surgery could be an option for anyone with a BMI of 40 or higher; that translates, roughly, to a man who is at least 100 pounds overweight or a woman who is 80 pounds overweight.\n\nLivingston said he thinks more caution is in order when a very obese person is otherwise healthy.\n\nAlong with the risks of surgery, he said, there is still uncertainty about whether it actually lengthens people\u2019s lives. Some studies have suggested it might, but not all.\n\nIn a study recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Livingston and his colleagues found no survival advantage among severely obese patients who\u2019d undergone weight-loss surgery versus those who hadn\u2019t.\n\nThe study involved 850 U.S. veterans who underwent some form of weight-loss surgery, at an average age of about 50, and more than 41,000 vets who had only non-surgical care. There was no evidence that surgery improved longevity over the next seven years.\n\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t even know if there\u2019s a survival benefit,\u201d Livingston said.\n\nThat, he added, makes the risks of duodenal switch seem even less worthwhile.\n\nBut according to Sovik, duodenal switch might be appropriate for some superobese patients.\n\nIn the U.S., he said, about one in three weight-loss surgery candidates have a BMI of 50 or higher. And studies suggest that a sizable percentage of those people will still have a BMI higher than 40 after gastric bypass.\n\nIn this study, one-quarter of gastric bypass patients still had a BMI that high two years after surgery \u2014 versus none of the duodenal switch patients.\n\nMore extensive monitoring after duodenal switch, Sovik noted, can help detect and manage side effects.\n\nHe pointed out, though, that larger, longer-term studies are still needed to show whether the extra weight loss with duodenal switch ultimately improves severely obese patients\u2019 health and extends their lives.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "This story does a good job of probing territory that is under-explored in most media accounts about obesity treatment.

Sometimes a heart attack or stroke is the very first symptom. About 750,000 Americans have a heart attack every year.\n\nDr. Charalambos Antoniades of Britain\u2019s University of Oxford and colleagues reported Wednesday that they have developed a new imaging method that detects inflamed fat cells as they are transforming into the inflamed, hardened plaques that clog up arteries.\n\n\u201cOur new method also allows detection of those small but inflamed artherosclerotic plaques in our heart arteries that are prone to rupture, therefore are about to cause a heart attack,\u201d Antoniades told reporters in a telephone briefing.\n\nIf the method holds up, doctors could start patients on drugs such as statins far earlier than they do now \u2014 in time to save them from ever developing serious heart disease, the researchers report in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\nRelated: New Test Detects Heart Disease Risk, Especially for Black Women\n\nIt\u2019s not just the fat cells that lead to heart disease, the No. 1 cause of death in the United State.

They measure cholesterol, blood pressure and heart rate, they test the electrical signals that keep the heart beating and they may also run imaging tests to check for clogged arteries.\n\nBut by the time a narrowed artery shows up on a standard scan, \u201cit's likely to be already too late to intervene and reverse the narrowing in the artery that has already occurred over many years,\u201d Channon said.\n\n\u201cBy detecting those individuals who don't have narrowing in their heart arteries, but they are in the process in developing them because the arteries are inflamed, we may be able to intervene early enough to prevent heart disease.\u201d\n\nThat's why surgeons do heart bypasses.

But within 40 minutes of receiving a ketamine injection, their depressive symptoms improved; the effect persisted for at least three days.\n\nRight now, medications available for treating either major depression or bipolar illness can take weeks, or even months, to work, notes Dr. Carlos A. Zarate Jr. of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, one of the researchers on the study.\n\nAnd as a person waits for their medications to kick in, he added, they will continue to have difficulty working and coping with social and family life; they may even be having thoughts of suicide. \u201cWe want to alleviate the suffering and get them back to their life,\u201d he said.\n\nZarate and his colleagues had previously demonstrated that ketamine shots helped some patients with treatment-resistant unipolar depression, meaning they did not cycle through manic episodes. In the new study, they gave patients with bipolar illness ketamine or a placebo on two test days two weeks apart.\n\nAll of the patients were on lithium or valproate - two drugs commonly used for bipolar illness - but had not responded to treatment. Nearly all were unemployed, Zarate and his team note, and two-thirds were on psychiatric disability.\n\nCompared to placebo, patients showed significant improvement in mood within 40 minutes of receiving the ketamine infusion, using a common depression rating scale. Symptom improvement peaked two days after the injection, but remained significantly greater than for placebo for three days.\n\nSeventy-one percent of the patients responded to ketamine, meaning they had at least a 50 percent improvement in their depressive symptoms. Six percent responded to placebo.\n\nSide effects included anxiety, \u201cfeeling woozy or loopy,\u201d headache, and dissociative symptoms, meaning a temporary sense of disconnection from reality, although there were no serious adverse events. By developing more specifically targeted drugs, Zarate noted, it may be possible to treat patients effectively while avoiding these symptoms.\n\nKetamine appears to work by \u201cresetting\u201d the way nerve cells process glutamate, a brain chemical key for learning, memory, and other functions, according to Zarate. The problem in bipolar illness and depression, he explains, doesn\u2019t appear to be that a person has too much or too little glutamate; instead, it\u2019s likely that the way their neurons release and take up the chemical is out of whack.\n\nFirst introduced in 1962, ketamine is used legally in both human and veterinary medicine as an anesthetic. It\u2019s also a drug of abuse, at much higher doses than those used in Zarate\u2019s research; while patients in the current study received about 50 milligrams during a 40-minute period, a dose too low to induce anesthesia, recreational users of ketamine, known as \u201cSpecial K,\u201d may take hundreds of milligrams per week.\n\nIn 1999, US regulators classified ketamine as a Schedule III controlled substance, meaning it has the potential for abuse but is also useful medically.\n\nKetamine could improve treatment of bipolar illness and depression in a variety of ways, Zarate said; for example, as a means to jump-start standard drug treatment, or as an anesthetic before ECT. \u201cIt\u2019s opened the floodgate of many different directions of research, and all of them are quite encouraging,\u201d said Zarate, who along with a co-author has filed for a patent on the use of ketamine in depression. Those rights would be assigned to his employer, the National Institutes of Health.\n\nEfforts are already underway in Europe to develop guidelines for how ketamine should be used and prescribed to treat bipolar illness and depression, the researcher said.\n\nIn the US, research is continuing on the drug, he added, and some physicians are likely trying the drug in their patients with bipolar illness or depression who aren\u2019t helped by standard treatments.

Less obvious symptoms include depression, insomnia, anxiety, fatigue and constipation.\n\nNeurological disorders that mimic the symptoms of Parkinson's disease are called atypical parkinsonism disorders.\n\nMany doctors cannot tell whether a patient has Parkinson's disease or atypical parkinsonism.\n\n\"This can be very challenging, especially during the early stages of the diseases and if the responsible doctor is not a neurologist specialized in movement disorders,\" said Dr. Oskar Hansson, lead author of the new study, a neurologist and an associate professor at Lund University in Sweden.\n\nNon-specialists \"do not really know exactly what questions to ask the patient and the special signs to look for,\" Hansson wrote in an email. Yet patients with atypical disorders \"usually have a much worse prognosis, with faster disease progression, (with) more disabling symptoms\" than Parkinson's patients, so early identification is crucial.\n\nThe correct diagnosis is also key to treatment since \"most patients with atypical parkinsonism disorders do not respond well to dopamine-targeting medications\" that are usually prescribed for Parkinson's patients, Hansson said.\n\nHansson and his colleagues developed a blood test that is, essentially, a variation on an existing test capable of detecting neurofilament light chain protein in spinal fluid. This protein is a component of nerve cells, and when these cells die, it can be detected in both spinal fluid and blood.\n\nBecause spinal fluid is not easily obtained by a primary care doctor, this diagnostic test is not very useful, so Hansson developed a blood test and investigated its accuracy in the new study.\n\nWhen validating a new biomarker for disease, \"one should always analyze at least two different (groups of patients and controls) to make sure that the results are reproducible,\" said Hansson, who added that participants should also include both early- and late-stage patients established at different clinics.\n\nAll told, a total of 244 people with Parkinson's and 79 healthy volunteers serving as a comparison group participated in Hansson's study, along with 181 patients with atypical parkinsonism disorders.\n\nOf these, 88 patients had multiple system atrophy, which impairs the body's involuntary functions such as heart rate, blood pressure and digestion.\n\nSeventy patients had progressive supranuclear palsy, which affects movement, walking, balance, speech, swallowing, vision, mood and thinking.\n\nAnd 23 patients had corticobasal degeneration, which causes decreased movement on one side of the body, muscle rigidity, tremor and a disconnection between thought and action.\n\nTesting these participants, the researchers found that nerve protein levels ranged higher in people with atypical parkinsonism and lower in patients with Parkinson's disease as well as the healthy volunteers. However, the test cannot distinguish between the different atypical disorders, which doctors must rely on symptoms to diagnose.\n\nBlood test accuracy is defined based on sensitivity, the percentage of positives that are correctly identified, and specificity, the percentage of negatives that are correctly identified. In Sweden, the blood test had a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 91%, while in the United Kingdom, sensitivity was 80% and specificity 90%. For early-stage study participants, generally, sensitivity was 70% and specificity was 80%.\n\nOverall, the blood test showed equal accuracy as the spinal fluid test when diagnosing Parkinson's or an atypical parkinsonism disorder, in both early and later stages of disease.\n\nHansson imagines that blood-based tests will be used in the future \"in the diagnostic work-up of patients with parkinsonism by most doctors who are not very specialized with these movement disorders.\" He also believes the test will be used by specialists for Parkinson's patients who \"do not exhibit a very typical symptomatology\" or do not respond as expected to treatment.\n\nThough atypical parkinsonism conditions look very similar to Parkinson's at first, they \"have a different underlying molecular cause,\" according to Bronstein, and so it is important to recognize them early in order to treat them properly. \"Disease-specific therapies are now in trials, so accurate diagnosis is essential in determining if these new treatments work,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Dr. Paul Wright, chairman of neurology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, New York, and Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York, the importance of this study is that it brings to light that there are new biomarker tests that can delineate between these neurological diseases.\n\n\"A lot of time, people come in and say they or a family member has a tremor, and they believe it's Parkinson's disease,\" said Wright, who also was not involved in the study. This early assumption may impede diagnosis of a less recognized atypical parkinsonism condition.\n\nOr a patient has \"horrible blood pressure fluctuations,\" Wright said, and no obvious tremor or rigidity symptoms, so a doctor suspects a heart condition. Instead, the cause is multiple system atrophy, a neurodegenerative disease. Though other symptoms will show up eventually and help in diagnosing the patient, in the meantime, the patient will be receiving the wrong medicines.\n\nAn accurate blood test, then, would be good news in these situations.\n\n\"It's a lot more reassuring to a patient to say 'we're just going to take a blood test to check for a few things,' \" Wright said. \"It's much easier and less anxiety-provoking for patients than taking a spinal tap.\"\n\nUp until now, many diseases have been diagnosed based on symptoms, with patients asking, \"How do you know I have this?\" Meanwhile, doctors are not always correct, Wright said. This is true even of Parkinson's, which is diagnosed based on symptoms, a patient's history, neurological exams, a patient's response to medicine and, in some cases, brain imaging tests.\n\nStill, Wright is hopeful and believes a biomarker test for Parkinson's \"will be down the line. ... In general, researchers are looking for biomarkers of disease.\"\n\nSpecialists and sub-specialists are available only in big cities, Wright said, and access to a simple blood test would enable a correct diagnosis in a primary care office.\n\n\"We always assume there's luxury,\" Wright said. \"But that's not really what's real in most of the country.\"", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story does not disease monger, and it did a nice job describing how common these atypical diseases are, compared to Parkinson\u2019s disease.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Are lung cancer scans really ready for prime time?\n\nNews that annual CT lung scans can reduce the risk of lung cancer death among former and current heavy smokers was celebrated by national heath officials this month. A major government study found the screening scans saved the life of one person for every 300 current or former smokers who were scanned.\n\nBut now cancer and screening experts are worried that the limited findings will be used by private screening centers to promote the test to a broader group than was studied. That, in turn, could lead to thousands of unnecessary lung scans, causing excess radiation exposure and unnecessary biopsies and surgery.\n\nDr. Otis W. Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, said he was stunned to hear a radio advertisement for an Atlanta screening center cite the study just a few days after the government had announced the results. The wording of the ad seemed to be aimed at a broad group, ranging from heavy smokers to women who had never smoked, Dr. Brawley said.\n\n\u201cWe really need to weigh the harms associated with screening,\u201d he said. \u201cThe scientific community still needs to digest this. To take a trial that involves people at high risk for lung cancer and to extrapolate it and say it\u2019s good for people with intermediate or low risk is not appropriate.\u201d\n\nThe study, called the National Lung Screening Trial, focused on a specific high-risk group: 53,000 current and former heavy smokers, aged 55 to 74, who had smoked for at least 30 pack-years. That means someone who smoked one pack a day for 30 years, two packs a day for 15 years or three packs a day for at least 10 years would qualify for the study.\n\nFormer smokers who had accumulated 30 pack-years were included only if they had stopped smoking within the previous 15 years.\n\nThe smokers and former smokers were given either annual CT lung scans or chest X-rays. Compared with conventional X-rays, the CT, or computed tomography, scans create a detailed three-dimensional image of the lungs. The study was stopped when it was found that the scanning group had a 20 percent lower risk of dying from lung cancer than those being screened with X-rays.\n\nBut the early results also showed a downside of scanning: one of every four lung scans showed an abnormality, which often led to additional worry, radiation exposure from follow-up scans and, sometimes, lung biopsies and even risky surgery. But because the study was stopped early, a full analysis of the harms caused by screening scans is still months away.\n\nReading the scans is tricky because harmless nodules can be misinterpreted as suspect lesions. In the study, even experienced radiologists at major cancer centers had a high rate of false positives, suggesting that the rate would be even higher in the real world.\n\n\u201cThere is a learning curve to reading spiral CTs,\u201d Dr. Brawley said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that some radiologists might be early in that learning curve and some patients may be harmed because of it.\u201d\n\nWhile the study found a benefit to scanning a specific group of high-risk smokers, that doesn\u2019t mean other groups will get the same benefit, says Dr. Peter B. Bach, a pulmonologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. In lower-risk groups, for instance, it\u2019s likely that thousands of people would need to be exposed to the risks of screening before a single life was saved. And it\u2019s possible that many of those scanned unnecessarily could be seriously harmed.\n\n\u201cThe aggregate harms to all the people\u2019s lives who are not saved have to be taken into account,\u201d Dr. Bach said. \u201cEven in these highly controlled settings, about 1 percent of the people had surgery or a part of their lung removed for something they thought was cancer and it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nLow-dose CT scans expose patients to about the same radiation levels as mammograms.\n\nFor now, most consumers who want a scan will have to pay for it themselves, although it is expected that insurance companies eventually will approve scanning for those in high-risk groups. (Medicare officials have indicated that they will soon reconsider paying for the screening tests.) The government has estimated the cost at about $300 a scan, but some centers may charge $1,000 or more.\n\nThe day the government announced the study results, Westside Medical Imaging of Beverly Hills, Calif., issued a press release saying that the study \u201cshould once and for all settle the controversy\u201d about whether CT lung scans save lives.\n\nIn the release, Dr. Norman E. Lepor said the scans were an \u201cindispensable\u201d part of annual exams for patients who have smoked for 10 years.\n\nIn an interview, Dr. Lepor said that he only offers lung scans to those at high risk, and that he turns people away who are at low risk but want the scan anyway because \u201cthey just want to know.\u201d\n\nDr. Lepor said it would be \u201cimprudent\u201d not to incorporate the latest study data into his practice right away.\n\n\u201cThere are people who, with good conscience and their take of the data, say it\u2019s not ready for prime time, and there are people who look at the same data and they come to other conclusions,\u201d Dr. Lepor said. \u201cThis is not the first study that has supported screening.

Use our submission form or ask @juliaoftoronto on Twitter.\n\nIs running really a better form of exercise than walking, given that running can lead to more injuries?\n\nAt Vox, I sit near health reporter Sarah Kliff, who trains for half-marathons and triathlons with a casualness most people reserve for grocery shopping. But Sarah\u2019s also suffered with plantar fasciitis and a stress fracture. At times, she's hobbled around in running shoes for months because everything else hurt too much, and even sported a big blue brace on her left leg to help cushion the tiny cracks in the bones of her foot brought on from too much wear and tear.\n\nIn many ways, Sarah is a perfect case study in how to think about the benefits and risks of running versus walking. Running has greater health benefits than walking (Sarah is super fit), but it also carries a much bigger risk of injury (see Sarah\u2019s foot brace).\n\n\n\nSo which effect dominates? To find out, I first searched for \"randomized control trials\" and \"systematic reviews\" on running, walking, and exercise at PubMed health (a free search engine for health research) and in Google Scholar. I wanted to see what the highest-quality evidence \u2014 trials and reviews are the gold standard \u2014 said about the relative risks and benefits of these two forms of exercise.\n\nIt was immediately apparent that running can lead to more injuries, and the risk goes up as running programs get more intense. Studies have found that runners have significantly higher injury rates than walkers (one study found that young men who run or jog had a 25 percent higher risk of injuries than walkers), and that ultramarathoners are at an even greater risk. The main running-related injuries include tibia stress syndrome, Achilles tendon injuries, and plantar fasciitis.\n\nOverall, more than half of people who run will experience some sort of injury from doing so, while the percentage of walkers who will get hurt is around 1 percent. Interestingly, it seems you can walk pretty much endlessly without any increased risk of hurting yourself.\n\nThat running hurts people shouldn't be surprising. As this study described, \"Running produces ground reaction forces that are approximately 2.5 times body weight, while the ground reaction force during walking is in the range of 1.2 times body weight.\" You're also more likely to trip and fall while running than you are during a walk.\n\nJogging even 5 to 10 minutes per day can reduce the risk of death from all causes I also learned about some of the incredible health benefits of going fast: Even five to 10 minutes per day of jogging at around 6 miles per hour can reduce the risk of death from cardiovascular disease and other causes. Joggers have been found to live longer than non-joggers even after adjusting for other factors \u2014 a difference of 3.8 years for men and 4.7 years for women.\n\nThat said, research has found that walking carries significant health benefits, as well. Some studies suggest that you can extend your life and stave off disease by simply walking \u2014 and the more, the better.\n\nAll this research, while illuminating, didn\u2019t offer up any clear conclusions on whether running or walking was better for you overall. So I asked some of the world\u2019s leading researchers in this area. Their conclusion? You need to consider the trade-offs.\n\n\"Running moderately prolongs life more than walking does,\" said Peter Schnohr, a clinical cardiologist who has researched many aspects of exercise and health. The key word there is \"moderately.\" Schnohr warned of the emerging research that doing a lot of endurance exercise over the long term (like triathlon training) can lead to heart problems. Overall, there's a U-shaped association between running and mortality, he said. Too little isn't helpful for health, but too much might be harmful.\n\n\n\n \"The most favorable regimen is two to three running days per week, at a slow or average pace\"\n\n\"The most favorable [regimen] is two to three running days per week, at a slow or average pace,\" Schnohr advised. \"Running every day, at a fast speed, more than 4 hours per week is not as favorable.\" And for those who don't like running, he noted, \"Fast walking, not slow, also prolongs life. I can\u2019t tell how much.\"\n\nDutch researcher Luiz Carlos Hespanhol pointed out that in general, running simply delivers health benefits more efficiently than walking does. This study, for example, found that five minutes of running per day is as beneficial as 15 minutes of walking. Hespanhol also said that after one year of training just two hours a week, runners lose weight, reduce their body fat, lower their resting heart rates, and drive down their blood serum triglycerides (fat in the blood). There's even evidence that running can have positive effects on tension, depression, and anger.\n\nEven so, Hespanhol wasn't a total cheerleader for running. A good walking regimen can have similar benefits, he noted. So on running versus walking, it really depends on your values and preferences: \"One could choose walking instead of running as a mode of physical activity based on injury risks, since walking is less risky than running,\" he explained. Or alternatively: \"One could choose running because the health benefits are larger and come faster, in a shorter period of time.\"\n\nTo recap: Running improves your health more efficiently than walking does and has greater health benefits per time invested. But even a small amount of running carries more injury risk than walking. And a lot of running (i.e., ultramarathon training) can well be harmful, while the same is never true for walking.\n\nWhere does this leave us? All the exercise researchers seemed to agree on one thing: that the best exercise routine is the one you'll actually do. So the answer to the running versus walking question will probably vary from person to person. If you prefer one over the other, stick with that. And if you still can't decide, Hespanhol suggested this: \"Why not do both \u2014 running and walking \u2014 in order to get the best of each?\"\n\nSend your questions to Julia via the submission form or @juliaoftoronto on Twitter.

How you live your life... has a real impact on how quickly your condition can decline.\"\n\nIf the findings are confirmed by larger studies, they could vastly improve the ability to detect dementia in middle age.\n\nAnd the scans would be \"well set up for routine testing,\" according to Chiesa. \"It's very easy to do, and it's very quick to do.\"\n\nWhen healthy, arteries around the heart can regulate the blood being pumped from the organ, ensuring that it flows smoothly and at a constant rate to the brain.\n\nBut damage to the arteries means blood flows more aggressively and irregularly through vessels and into the brain, which can damage its network of blood vessels and cells. Over time, the researchers believe this led more frequently to cognitive decline in participants in the study.\n\n\"What we do know is that the blood supply in the brain is incredibly important, and that maintaining a healthy heart and blood pressure is associated with a lower risk of developing dementia,\" said Carol Routledge, Director of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK, who was not involved in the research.\n\nVascular dementia is directly caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, and this can also play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease, studies have found. Those two conditions make up the vast majority of cases of dementia.\n\nDementia is an umbrella term used to describe symptoms related to the loss of brain function. Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia make up the vast majority of cases.\n\nIn the United States, the condition is the sixth biggest cause of death among all adults, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while in the UK it has overtaken heart disease as the leading cause of death, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nThe study's findings have been met with cautious optimism by dementia organizations.\n\n\"Getting a diagnosis of dementia can be time consuming and quite frustrating for many people, so it's promising that earlier indicators of cognitive decline are in development,\" said Paul Edwards, Director of Clinical Services at Dementia UK.\n\nBut he added that focus should also be paid to dementia sufferers after their diagnosis, saying: \"The elephant in the room is the lack of support for people and their families once they get a diagnosis of dementia.\"\n\nThere is currently no cure for dementia, though medication can be used to temporarily treat its symptoms.\n\n\"Often, a diagnosis is made and then people are sent home with no information, no follow-up appointments and no clue about what is going to happen next.\"\n\nMore research is needed to determine whether neck scans should become a part of routine testing for dementia.\n\n\"While these findings are interesting, as the full data from this research is yet to be published it is difficult to assess how useful this kind of scan could be,\" said Routledge.\n\nRoutledge added that current evidence shows that not smoking, only consuming alcohol within recommended limits, staying active, monitoring cholesterol levels and eating a balanced diet can all help with the health of the heart and brain.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering here.

This year, 4,400 patients are expected to undergo surgery to replace arthritic or injured ankles with artificial joints made of metal alloys and lightweight plastic, according to industry estimates.\n\nFour models are commonly used in the United States, with Food and Drug Administration approval. And demand is expected to grow as more and more baby boomers hobble into their 60s and 70s with debilitating ankle pain.\n\nAnkle replacement has been around for three decades, but it has been slow to catch on. Problems with early devices left surgeons and patients wary. The operation is complex, and many foot and ankle surgeons lack experience. While Medicare pays for ankle replacement, many private insurers do not.\n\nEach year about two million Americans visit the doctor for ankle pain from arthritis or fracture. An estimated 50,000 people a year experience end-stage ankle arthritis, in which the ankle cartilage has worn away completely, causing painful bone-on-bone contact and some level of disability.\n\nUntil lately, such patients have had only one surgical option: ankle fusion surgery, in which the worn-out part of the joint is removed and the bones are permanently locked together with screws and plates. The procedure usually relieves pain, but the patient loses mobility in the ankle, leading to changes in gait and, ultimately, additional wear and tear and arthritic pain in other parts of the ankle. About 25,000 ankle fusions were performed in the United States last year.\n\nAndrew Keaveney, now 73, shattered his ankle in a fall from a truck while hanging flags as an American Legion volunteer. Surgery repaired the broken bones, but he continued to have severe pain.\n\nDoctors suggested ankle fusion, but he found a surgeon who offered total ankle replacement. He had the operation in December 2008, and now he says the ankle is \u201c99 percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore the surgery, I couldn\u2019t sleep at night,\u201d said Mr. Keaveney, of Locust Valley, N.Y. \u201cNow I\u2019m able to climb ladders.

Radnay, an associate at the Insall Scott Kelly Institute for Orthopedics and Sports Medicine in New York City and on Long Island, says he is now a \u201cbig believer\u201d in ankle replacement for certain patients.\n\n\u201cFor an ankle replacement you have to be a little more picky in who you select for those cases,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t tell you how many patients come in, and I mention this option they don\u2019t even know exists.\u201d (Dr. Radnay, who says he has performed more than 100 ankle replacements using an Inbone device from Wright Medical Group of Arlington, Tenn., is now a paid consultant to the company, helping to gather data on long-term success rates.)\n\nThe ideal patient is around 60 years old and of normal weight, although doctors consider older patients, depending on their health. People with diabetes may not be good candidates because they may risk complications as a result of poor blood circulation.\n\nDr. Jonathan T. Deland, chief of the foot and ankle service at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan, said that while the devices had improved, he remained cautious about offering the operation. (Dr. Deland is helping to develop a new ankle replacement device for Zimmer of Warsaw, Ind., which may be submitted for F.D.A. approval this year.)\n\n\u201cThe big concern about ankle replacement is how often do they fail and how often do they loosen,\u201d he said.\n\nComplications can include slow healing, as well as infection. Severe complications are rare, but they can result in amputation. Still, Dr. Deland said, \u201cwe\u2019re getting fewer and fewer failures.\u201d\n\nThe new models require that less bone be removed, so the bone to which the device is affixed is stronger. In addition, instruments used to guide surgeons in aligning the artificial joint have improved. Dr. Deland cited data showing that for some recent models, 90 percent of ankle replacements were still in place after an average of eight and a half years.\n\nThough the four devices in common use have technical differences in design and in how they are implanted, doctors say the choice of device matters far less than the experience of the surgeon. The procedure is among the most difficult that foot and ankle surgeons perform, and one of the biggest challenges is getting proper alignment of the replacement joint.\n\nDr. Brian Donley, an orthopedic surgeon who is director of the foot and ankle center at the Cleveland Clinic, says patients should always ask their doctor to disclose any financial interest in a device. (He performed the first United States operation using the Salto Talaris device from Tornier of Minneapolis, and receives consulting fees from the company.)\n\nEven with a successful implantation, patients should not necessarily expect to have the same ankles they did at 18. They should not try to return to activities like basketball and distance running. But golf and walking, and sometimes even skiing, are typically allowed.\n\n\u201cMy happiest patients I have in my practice are my ankle replacement patients,\u201d Dr. Donley said. \u201cThey are so appreciative about how their life has been changed.

It significantly raises the risk of stroke.\n\nPatients in the Medtronic-sponsored trial who underwent the cryoablation procedure \u2014 which involves using a catheter to freeze away the heart tissue where the problem originates \u2014 was just as safe as drugs used to treat the condition and far more effective, meeting the study\u2019s primary goal of eliminating atrial fibrillation one year after the procedure.\n\nDubbed Stop-af, the Medtronic trial showed that almost 70 percent of patients who had cryoablation remained free of the condition after one year, compared with just 7 percent of patients who received drug therapy, according to data presented at the American College of Cardiology meeting in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cThis is the best data we have at this point in support of cryoablation (to treat atrial fibrillation),\u201d said Dr. Douglas Packer of Mayo Clinic, the lead investigator of the study.\n\nOver 3 percent of patients treated by cryoablation experienced a serious condition \u2014 a narrowing of the pulmonary vein in 7 out of 228 patients, one of whom required another procedure to widen the vein.\n\nDamage or irritation to the nerve that controls the diaphragm was reported in 11 percent of the cryoablation procedures, but none of the cases was considered serious, with 98 percent resolved by the 12-month follow-up.\n\nComplications related to the atrial fibrillation itself were also monitored. During the follow-up period, 97 percent of patients who got the procedure and 92 percent of the drug therapy patients did not suffer heart attack, stroke or death.\n\nLess than 1 percent of patients treated with cryoablation were hospitalized for a recurrence of the disease, compared with 6 percent in the drug group.\n\nPatients in the pilot study had advanced atrial fibrillation and tended to have other medical problems, such as high blood pressure, diabetes or coronary artery disease,\n\nPacker, who also led the pilot study, dubbed Cabana, acknowledged that the main limitation of this study was its small size, but said it lays the foundation for a larger one.\n\nHe said the larger study, which will include 180 centers, is currently enrolling patients.\n\nAnti-arrhythmic drugs eliminate atrial fibrillation in about half of all patients but can have adverse side effects.\n\nCryoablation is an alternative that is growing in popularity.

(July 17, 2017) - Moffitt Cancer Center researchers launched a first of its kind study comparing the long-term benefits of radiation therapy in women with breast cancer either before surgery (neoadjuvant) or after surgery (adjuvant). Their study, published in the June 30 issue of Breast Cancer Research, found that patients who have neoadjuvant radiation therapy have a significantly lower risk of developing a second primary tumor at any site.\n\nThe majority of patients who have early stage breast cancer have surgery to remove their tumor or a complete mastectomy. Surgery is commonly followed by radiation therapy, which has been shown to increase relapse-free survival. However, in some cases, patients may require neoadjuvant radiation therapy to decrease the size of the tumor before surgery. Currently, there are no studies that have analyzed the long-term effects of neoadjuvant radiation therapy on breast cancer patients.\n\nMoffitt researchers compared the overall survival and the time to diagnosis of a second tumor, if any, of 250,195 breast cancer patients who received either neoadjuvant or adjuvant radiation therapy. They analyzed patient outcomes from a National Cancer Institute (NCI) registry database of cancer incidence and survival rates in the United States. They included female patients in the analysis who were diagnosed between 1973 and 2011 with early-stage breast cancer. The analysis included 2,554 women who received localized neoadjuvant breast radiation therapy before surgery and 247,641 women who received localized adjuvant breast radiation therapy after surgery.\n\nThe researchers discovered that among the breast cancer patients who tested positive for the estrogen receptor (ER) biomarker, patients who had neoadjuvant radiation therapy had a significantly lower risk of developing a second primary tumor than patients who had adjuvant radiation therapy. This was true for patients who underwent both partial and complete mastectomies. The researchers found that delaying surgery due to neoadjuvant radiation therapy was not a detriment to survival.\n\nA number of recent studies have suggested that radiation therapy may re-educate and stimulate the immune system to target cancer cells. \"The observed benefit of neoadjuvant radiation therapy aligns with the growing body of literature of the immune activation effects of radiation, including shrinking of untreated metastases outside the radiation field,\" explained Heiko Enderling, Ph.D., associate member of Moffitt's Integrated Mathematical Oncology Department.\n\nThese data are promising, but randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the benefit of neoadjuvant radiation therapy. \"Historic data indicate that disease-free survival is significantly increased when radiation therapy is applied before surgery rather than after surgery, especially for ER-positive patients. These findings are worthy of a prospective clinical trial to confirm potential benefits of neoadjuvant vs. adjuvant radiation, and to identify the potential contribution of radiation-induced immunity to vaccinate against future disease,\" said Enderling.\n\nThe study was supported by funds received from the American Cancer Society and the DeBartolo Family Personalized Medicine Institute Pilot Research Awards in Personalized Medicine.\n\nMoffitt is dedicated to one lifesaving mission: to contribute to the prevention and cure of cancer.

By looking at additional beneficial side-effects of the treatments, the researchers were able to show that there was a significant antidepressant effect from the drugs compared to a placebo based on a meta-analysis of seven randomised controlled trials. Meta-analyses of the other types of clinical trials showed similar results.\n\nWhen we are exposed to an infection, for example influenza or a stomach bug, our immune system fights back to control and remove the infection. During this process, immune cells flood the blood stream with proteins known as cytokines. This process is known as systemic inflammation.\n\nEven when we are healthy, our bodies carry trace levels of these proteins - known as 'inflammatory markers' - which rise exponentially in response to infection. Previous work from the team found that children with high everyday levels of one of these markers are at greater risk of developing depression and psychosis in adulthood, suggesting a role for the immune system, particularly chronic low-grade systemic inflammation, in mental illness.\n\nInflammation can also occur as a result of the immune system mistaking healthy cells for infected cells and attacking the body, leading to autoimmune inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and Crohn's disease. New types of anti-inflammatory drugs called anti-cytokine monoclonal antibodies and cytokine inhibitors have been developed recently, some of which are now routinely used for patients who respond poorly to conventional treatments. Many more are currently undergoing clinical trials to test their efficacy and safety.\n\nThe team of researchers carried out a meta-analysis of these clinical trials and found that the drugs led to an improvement in the severity of depressive symptoms independently of improvements in physical illness. In other words, regardless of whether a drug successfully treated rheumatoid arthritis, for example, it would still help improve a patient's depressive symptoms. Their results are published today in the journal Molecular Psychiatry.\n\nDr Golam Khandaker, who led the study, says: \"It's becoming increasingly clear to us that inflammation plays a role in depression, at least for some individuals, and now our review suggests that it may be possible to treat these individuals using some anti-inflammatory drugs. These are not your everyday anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, however, but a particular new class of drugs.\"\n\n\"It's too early to say whether these anti-cytokine drugs can be used in clinical practice for depression, however,\" adds Professor Peter Jones, co-author of the study. \"We will need clinical trials to test how effective they are in patients who do not have the chronic conditions for which the drugs have been developed, such as rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease. On top of this, some existing drugs can have potentially serious side effects, which would need to be addressed.\"\n\nDr Khandaker and colleagues believe that anti-inflammatory drugs may offer hope for patients for whom current antidepressants are ineffective. Although the trials reviewed by the team involve physical illnesses that trigger inflammation - and hence potentially contribute to depression - their previous work found a connection between depression and baseline levels of inflammation in healthy people (when someone does not have an acute infection), which can be caused by a number of factors such as genes and psychological stress.\n\n\"About a third of patients who are resistant to antidepressants show evidence of inflammation,\" adds Dr Khandaker. \"So, anti-inflammatory treatments could be relevant for a large number of people who suffer from depression.\n\n\"The current approach of a 'one-size-fits-all' medicine to treat depression is problematic. All currently available antidepressants target a particular type of neurotransmitter, but a third of patients do not respond to these drugs. We are now entering the era of 'personalised medicine' where we can tailor treatments to individual patients. This approach is starting to show success in treating cancers, and it's possible that in future we would use anti-inflammatory drugs in psychiatry for certain patients with depression.\"\n\nThe research was mainly funded by the Wellcome Trust, with further support from the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.\n\nKappelmann, N et al.

Every year 4.9 million babies are born with a birth defect worldwide and one in four pregnant women suffer a miscarriage in Australia. In the vast majority of cases the cause of these problems has remained a mystery. Until now.\n\nThis breakthrough, led by Professor Sally Dunwoodie from the Victor Chang Institute, has identified a cause of recurrent miscarriages as well as heart, spinal, kidney and cleft palate problems in newborn babies.\n\n \n\n\u201cThe ramifications are likely to be huge. This has the potential to significantly reduce the number of miscarriages and birth defects around the world, and I do not use those words lightly,\u201d says Professor Dunwoodie.\n\nThe landmark study found that a deficiency in a vital molecule, known as NAD, can prevent a baby\u2019s organs from developing correctly in the womb.\n\nNicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is one of the most important molecules in all living cells. NAD synthesis is essential for energy production, DNA repair and cell communication. Environmental and genetic factors can disrupt its production, which can cause a NAD deficiency.\n\nWorld first research at the Victor Chang Institute has found that this deficiency can be particularly harmful during a pregnancy as it can cripple an embryo when it is forming.\n\n\u201cNow, after 12 years of research, our team has also discovered that this deficiency can potentially be cured and miscarriages and birth defects prevented by taking a common vitamin,\u201d Professor Dunwoodie revealed.\n\nAt the heart of the paramount discovery is the dietary supplement vitamin B3, also known as niacin. Scientists at the Victor Chang Institute have discovered simply boosting levels of this nutrient during pregnancy can potentially prevent recurrent miscarriages and birth defects.\n\nVitamin B3 is required to make NAD and is typically found in meats and green vegetables as well as vegemite. However, a recent study[i] found that despite taking vitamin supplements at least a third of pregnant women have low levels of vitamin B3 in their first trimester, which is the critical time in organ development. By the third trimester, vitamin B3 levels were low in 60% of pregnant women. This indicates pregnant women may require more vitamin B3 than is currently available in most vitamin supplements.\n\nUsing a preclinical mouse model, scientists at the Victor Chang Institute investigated the effect of vitamin B3 on developing embryos. The results were astounding.\n\nBefore vitamin B3 was introduced into the mother\u2019s diet, embryos were either lost through miscarriage or the offspring were born with a range of severe birth defects. After the dietary change, both the miscarriages and birth defects were completely prevented, with all the offspring born perfectly healthy.\n\nThis discovery is akin to the revolutionary breakthrough made last century that confirmed folic acid supplementation can prevent spina bifida and other neural tube defects in babies. As a result, consumption of folic acid has been adopted by expectant mothers worldwide, and the addition of folate to our food supply has led to a 70% decrease in the number of babies born with neural tube defects.\n\nAccording to the Executive Director of the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, Professor Robert Graham, the implications are profound.\n\n\u201cJust like we now use folate to prevent spina bifida, Professor Dunwoodie\u2019s research suggests that it is probably best for women to start taking vitamin B3 very early on, even before they become pregnant. This could change the way pregnant women are cared for around the world,\u201d said Professor Graham.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this breakthrough will be one of our country\u2019s greatest medical discoveries.

CNN Films Presents:\" Glen Campbell ... I'll Be Me ,\" Saturday, November 7, at 8 p.m. ET.\n\n(CNN) Over the years, resveratrol, an antioxidant found in grapes, chocolate and red wine, has been touted as a possible antidote to Alzheimer's disease, cancer, diabetes and many other conditions. Now, the first study in people with Alzheimer's suggests that the compound, when taken in concentrated doses, may actually have benefit in slowing progression of this disease.\n\nResearchers at 21 medical centers across the United States looked at the safety and effectiveness of taking high doses of resveratrol in an experimental pill -- equal to the amount found in 1,000 bottles of red wine -- in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's.\n\nThe researchers looked at several biomarkers of Alzheimer's, and found that people who took up to four pills a day for a year had higher levels of amyloid-beta proteins in their spinal fluid than those who took a placebo (control) pill.\n\nAlthough accumulation of amyloid-beta in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, patients actually have lower levels of this protein outside of the brain. The study finding suggests that resveratrol could help change the balance from amyloid-beta buildup in the brain to circulating protein in the body.\n\nEven if concentrated forms of resveratrol pills like the kind used in this study were available, it's too soon to recommend going out and getting some just yet.\n\n\"The study is encouraging enough that we should certainly go ahead and do a [larger] clinical trial because we showed that it is safe and does have significant effects on Alzheimer's biomarkers,\" said Dr. R. Scott Turner, professor of neurology at Georgetown University Medical Center and lead investigator of the study, which was published on Friday in the journal Neurology.\n\nThe main goal of the current study, which included 119 patients, was to find out whether high doses of resveratrol could be safe. The only small concern they found was that patients taking resveratrol lost about two pounds during the one-year study, and weight loss is already a problem with Alzheimer's, Turner said. In comparison, the control group gained about 1 pound.\n\nMuch more research is needed\n\nThe study was not big enough to answer some important questions, such as whether patients taking resveratrol actually had lower levels of amyloid-beta plaques in their brain, and most importantly, whether they experienced less decline in their mental faculties.\n\nA large, phase 3 clinical trial getting at these issues could start in as soon as a year, Turner said. (The current study was a phase 2 trial, typically meant to evaluate safety and get an early look at efficacy of a new drug.)\n\nEven for the relatively small number of participants in the study, the researchers did see indication that resveratrol could improve cognition. Patients in this group had slight improvements in their ability to carry out daily tasks, such as remembering to brush their teeth. And anecdotally, patients who took resveratrol told the researchers that they felt like they were maintaining their mental ability. (Neither the participants nor the researchers knew who was taking resveratrol and who was taking placebo.)\n\n\"To really get a better feel of how effective this could be you really need to do larger studies for longer periods of time (such as several years),\" said James A. Hendrix, director of global science initiatives at the Alzheimer's Association, a research and advocacy organization. \"Other potential therapies we've had had some early exciting results and then they didn't pan out in later trials,\" he added.\n\nIf resveratrol does pan out in further research, it may add to the medications that are currently available, such as Aricept and Exelon, which slow, but do not halt, progression of the disease, Hendrix said.\n\nUltimately, it will probably be a combination of several drugs, as well as diet, exercise and social and mental stimulation that help stave off the rapid mental decline that is often associated with Alzheimer's, he added.\n\nAntioxidant may be most effective in combination\n\nThis is one of the first studies to look not only at these biomarkers, but also the metabolites of resveratrol in spinal fluid, to show that resveratrol is probably getting into the brain, said Dr. Giulio M. Pasinetti, who is the Saunders Family Chair and professor in neurology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. However, he added that changes in biomarkers may not necessarily lead to mental and behavioral improvements, which larger studies will address.\n\nIn addition, resveratrol on its own might not end up working as well as a combination of resveratrol and other polyphenol compounds found in red wine, grape juice and grape seed extract, which could help people at risk of Alzheimer's and those who already have mild symptoms, Pasinetti said.\n\nThe current study used high doses of resveratrol to increase the chances that enough of the compound got into the brain to have an effect. But for now, the best way to get resveratrol is probably through diet. One glass of red wine a day could help those with mild Alzheimer's, \"but no more than that,\" Turner said.\n\nThere is probably little benefit in taking currently available resveratrol supplements, even if they claim to contain levels similar to the ones used in this study. \"The things that are on the market are not regulated, and you don't know how much is in them,\" Turner said. \"There could be 500 milligrams, which is what they advertise [researchers gave participants in the study four 500 milligram pills a day] or there could be zero,\" he said.\n\nPrevious research has suggested that people who consume diets rich in resveratrol do not have lower rates of cancer, heart disease and other conditions.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering here.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Jan. 4, 2013 -- A new study from Australia may offer a new way of identifying people at risk of glaucoma years before vision loss happens. Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. But because vision damage often occurs gradually, most people with the eye disease do not realize they have it until a good deal of their sight has been lost. If caught early, though, there are medications and procedures that may help treat glaucoma. In the study, researchers were able to predict who was at increased risk of developing the eye disease with some accuracy by measuring blood vessel thickness in the retinas of study participants using a computer-based imaging tool. Those with the narrowest vessels at the beginning of the study were four times more likely to have developed glaucoma a decade later.\n\nAbout 3 million Americans and 60 million people worldwide have glaucoma, and the numbers are projected to rise over the next few decades as the population ages. The disease involves damage to the optic nerve, which relays images from the retina to the brain. Early detection is key, but without regular eye exams, most people don\u2019t know they have a problem, says ophthalmologist Andrew Iwach, MD. He is the executive director of the Glaucoma Center of San Francisco and an associate clinical professor of opthalmology at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cWe call this disease a \u2018thief of vision\u2019 because most people with it have no idea that they have lost sight until it is too late to bring it back,\u201d Iwach says.\n\nIn the study, researchers from the University of Sydney followed nearly 2,500 adults, aged 49 and older, for 10 years. None of the participants had glaucoma when they entered the study. Compared with the group as a whole, those people who were diagnosed with the eye disease during the following decade were older, had higher blood pressure, and were more likely to be female. The researchers concluded that measuring retinal-vessel narrowing could help identify people at risk for glaucoma. But they added that blood pressure and other factors that can contribute to vessel size would need to be considered.

Malignant cells had spread throughout her body.\n\nSurgeons removed affected lymph nodes but within months tumors appeared in her liver, breast, skull and other lymph nodes. \"My oncologist said this is going to kill you and you need to think about preparing for that,\" Anderson says.\n\nTwo years ago, she gained access to an experimental immune-enhancing treatment in clinical trials at Providence Cancer Center in Portland. Called ipilimumab, it unleashes an all-out immune system attack on cancer cells. At first, the injections caused only side-effects: widespread itching, fatigue, and diarrhea. Worse, Anderson says, \"I could feel the tumors getting bigger. They felt hot to me.\"\n\nThen after several months the tumors began to shrink. After one year, the once palpable tumors were no longer detectable in diagnostic scans. While far from a cure, the treatment is the first to improve survival in people with melanoma that has spread, or metastasized, says Dr. Walter Urba, director of cancer research at the Providence Cancer Center. Urba is a co-author of the\n\non ipilimumab published in the New England Journal of Medicine Saturday.\n\nSuccess in a cancer as deadly and difficult to treat as advanced melanoma is raising hopes that the treatment may also prove useful in staving off other tumors, including lung and prostate cancer. Drug companies are racing to develop competing versions of the immune-enhancing therapy, an antibody produced through genetic engineering.\n\n\"I would not be here today without it,\" says Anderson, who is undergoing a second round of treatment for resurgent tumors. \"It's given me time with my kids, my husband, my family \u2013 and it's been quality time.\"\n\nMelanoma is a rare skin cancer, but accounts for most of the 66,000 annual deaths from skin cancer worldwide. If caught early, before cancer cells break off and spread, surgery can stop melanoma. But most people diagnosed after melanoma has metastasized die within a year.\n\n\"For years and years, we've been looking for an effective therapy,\" Urba says.\n\nIpilimumab, nicknamed Ippy, is one of the first antibody-based therapies that use the body's immune defenses to destroy cancer cells. The antibodies bind to a specific protein studding the surface of T cells, immune system cells that seek and destroy virus-infected and cancerous cells. The surface protein works like a switch, inactivating T cells after a few days to prevent the immune system from running amok and destroying healthy tissue. The antibodies temporarily jam the switch, allowing T cells to continue attacking cancer tissue for weeks or months \u2013 for as long as patients continue to receive injections of the engineered antibody.\n\nMore than 600 melanoma patients took part in the ipilimumab clinical trial at 125 cancer centers in 13 countries. All patients had inoperable cancers with widespread tumors after conventional treatment. Some patients received ipilimumab alone, others it combined with a cancer vaccine called gp100, and a third group received only the cancer vaccine.\n\nIpilimumab appeared to double survival compared with the gp100 vaccine alone. After one year, nearly half of patients given ipilimumab alone or in combination remained alive, compared with one quarter of patients given only the vaccine. After two years, 24 percent of patients treated with ipilimumab were alive, 22 percent of patients treated with the combination, while survival dropped to 14 percent among patients treated with the vaccine alone.\n\n\"Some of the people are now out 44 months and still remain free of disease,\" Urba says.\n\nSerious side effects also became clear. Nearly two-thirds of patients on ipilimumab experienced side effects caused by over-active immunity, such as severe itching, intestinal irritation and diarrhea. Researchers linked 14 deaths to the study drugs, half caused by immune-system reactions.\n\nStill, the study stands as \"a major landmark in cancer immunotherapy,\" says Dr. Bernard Fox, president of the International Society for Biological Therapy of Cancer. He says the results highlight the potential for using the same approach to treat other cancers. Already, early studies in patients with lung cancer and prostate cancer have produced positive, though inconclusive results.\n\n\"There is no reason it can't be applied to any of the common tumor types,\" Urba says. \"They all have antigens on their surface that T cells can recognize.\" Ongoing trials are testing ipilimumab with other cancer drugs, in different doses and against different cancers.\n\nDrug company Bristol-Myers Squibb told investors the drug could gain regulatory approval as early as next year and become available to cancer patients in 2012. Ipilimumab was developed by Medarex, a New Jersey company owned by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Other drug companies are at work on competing versions of the immune-enhancing antibody therapy.\n\nFor now, federal regulators have authorized\n\nto people who have serious or immediately life-threatening, inoperable melanoma that has spread, who have no alternative treatment options, and whose physicians believe the drug is appropriate.

Neoptolemos, of the Cancer Research U.K. Liverpool Cancer Trials Unit at the University of Liverpool in England, and colleagues.\n\nThe study authors noted that, currently, the prognosis for pancreatic cancer is very poor, with a five-year survival rate of less than 5 percent. Surgery to remove cancerous tissue can boost the odds to as much as 10 percent, however, and there is active search underway to improve a patient's chances even more by adding in additional chemotherapy following surgery.\n\nThe pool of nearly 1,100 patients that the researchers focused on were part of the large European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer trial that took place across 159 pancreatic cancer centers located in Europe, Canada, Australasia and Japan.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2007, the participants were divided into one of two six-month chemotherapy groups: one receiving fluorouracil and folinic acid post-surgery and the other receiving gemcitabine.\n\nAfter nearly three years of treatment, the researchers found almost no difference between survival rates in the two groups.\n\nThose who received fluorouracil and folinic acid chemotherapy had lived an average of 23 months. At the one- and two-year markers, survival rates for that group was approximately 78.5 and 48 percent, respectively.\n\nAt the three-year mark, patients on the gemcitabine regimen achieved an average survival rate of 23.6 months. One- and two-year survival rates were 80 and 49 percent, respectively, the investigators found.\n\n\"In conclusion, gemcitabine did not result in improved overall survival compared with fluorouracil plus folinic acid in patients with [surgically removed] pancreatic cancer,\" the authors concluded in their report.\n\nHowever, the team did observe one appreciable difference: patients on gemcitabine were less likely to experience serious side effects as a result of their chemotherapy treatment than those on the fluorouracil/folinic acid treatment (7.5 percent versus 14 percent).\n\nDr. Michael Choti, a professor of surgery and oncology at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, described the study as \"important,\" but he does not believe it will alter the current approach to post-surgical chemotherapy.\n\n\"Really in the scope of things following major surgery, both are fairly tolerable regimens, and this study doesn't necessarily change the pattern of use in terms of choosing post-operative therapy,\" Choti said.\n\n\"But the point is that pancreatic cancer is a terrible disease, and really just a minority of patients are candidates for surgery. And even for those, unfortunately 75 to 80 percent of those will go on to recur even after the surgery appears to be successful. So, indeed, there has been a strong interest in giving the best additional therapy possible,\" Choti added.\n\n\"So this is not a revolutionary finding, but it's part of an effort to look at what we have and even to find newer regimens with more combinations of drugs,\" he noted. \"And that's exactly what's already underway, as we search for more aggressive and more successful treatments.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more information on pancreatic cancer.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story does not engage in disease-mongering.

Statins include widely used medications such as Crestor, Lipitor and Zocor.\n\n\"For high-risk people, those with heart disease or [who] have had a stroke who are taking a standard dose of a statin, further reduction in LDL cholesterol will give them extra benefit,\" said Dr. Colin Baigent of the Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit at University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, who was involved in both studies. This applied even if the patients already had low levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or \"bad\") cholesterol, he noted.\n\nThe reports are published in the Nov. 9 online edition of The Lancet.\n\nIn the first study, researchers at Oxford and the University of Sydney in Australia collected data from studies on 170,000 patients who took part in 26 trials. This type of review, called a meta-analysis, gathers data from various studies to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nAmong these trials, five compared high doses of statins with regular doses and the other 21 studies compared people taking statins with people not taking the drugs.\n\nThe researchers found that in trials comparing statin doses, taking high-dose statins reduced the odds of having a stroke by an additional 15 percent, compared to the usual doses of statins.\n\nSpecifically, there was a 13 percent reduction in heart-related death or heart attack, a 19 percent reduction in the need for a new heart operation and a 16 percent reduction in stroke, the researchers found.\n\nWhen they did an updated analysis of the 21 trials, first major cardiovascular events (such as heart attack and stroke) were lowered by a \"highly significant\" 22 percent for a 1.07 millimole per liter (mmol/L) reduction of LDL cholesterol.\n\nTaking all 26 trials together, deaths were reduced by 10 percent for 1 mmol/L in reduction of LDL cholesterol, with no significant effect on deaths from stroke or other vascular causes.\n\nIn addition, there were no significant effects of statins on deaths due to cancer or other non-vascular causes, and no excess risk of cancer, even at low LDL cholesterol concentrations.\n\nThe second study is a randomized trial called the Study of the Effectiveness of Additional Reductions in Cholesterol and Homocysteine (SEARCH), led by professor Jane Armitage, also a scientist at the CTSU in Oxford.\n\nThis trial looked at the benefits of statin therapy with 80 milligrams (mg) versus 20 mg simvastatin (Zocor) among 12,000 heart attack survivors.\n\nThe study was supported by a grant from Merck (manufacturer of the simvastatin).\n\nOver almost seven years of follow-up, those taking the higher dose statin had greater reductions in LDL cholesterol compared with those taking the lower dose.\n\nThe reduction in LDL cholesterol from the higher dose ended up decreasing the risk of a major cardiac event by 6 percent, the researchers found, although the statistic in itself was not clinically significant.\n\nThe researchers noted that the higher dose of Zocor (simvastatin) did result in a risk of a muscle disease 10 times higher than that associated with the lower dose. The muscle disease, known as myopathy, can cause pain, weakness, and in its rare but most severe form, destruction of the muscle tissue leading to kidney failure. Researchers found that two cases of myopathy occurred with the low dose and 53 cases with the higher dose.\n\nResearchers also found that rhabdomyolysis -- the most severe form of the muscle disease associated with statins -- was diagnosed in seven participants given 80 mg of Zocor (simvastatin), compared to none who were given 20 mg of simvastatin. Two died within a few weeks of developing the disorder, with one cause of death mentioning the muscle disorder as a contributing factor.\n\nResearchers also found that seven participants had creatine kinase levels higher than 40 times the upper limit of normal -- a possible indicator of kidney damage. For this reason, they noted that the incidence of severe muscle disease on 80 mg of Zocor might be an \"underestimate.\"\n\nBaigent noted this side effect is one associated with Zocor, but taking lower doses of other, more powerful statins may alleviate the problem. \"There are newer ways of increasing LDL cholesterol reduction by using the newer, more potent statins such a Lipitor or Crestor,\" he said. (All statins carry the risk of myopathy, but lower dosages are associated with a reduced risk.)\n\nBernard M.Y. Cheung, from the University of Hong Kong and coauthor of an accompanying journal editorial, said that \"people who are at risk from heart attacks and strokes should have their LDL-cholesterol lowered intensively.\"\n\nTheir doctors should consider prescribing a statin, either at a high dose or using a more powerful statin, he said.\n\n\"If you are at risk from a heart attack or stroke, either because you have had these conditions before or because you have the risk factors for them, you should be considered for intensive treatment to lower the LDL cholesterol,\" Cheung said.\n\n\"If your blood cholesterol is raised but you do not have other risk factors for heart disease and stroke, then your doctor may well decide that you do not need to take any drugs to lower cholesterol,\" he said. \"But if you are at risk from those diseases, you would need intensive treatment to lower LDL cholesterol, even if your LDL cholesterol level is not very high,\" he added.\n\nCommenting on the studies, Dr. Gregg Fonarow, American Heart Association spokesman and professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that \"despite the proven benefits of LDL cholesterol-lowering with statin therapy, many physicians have been reluctant to prescribe and patients reluctant to take higher doses of more potent statin medications due to concerns about side effects or safety.\"\n\nLowering LDL cholesterol by 50 to 60 percent with potent statins such as atorvastatin at 80 mg or rosuvastatin at 20 to 40 mg lowers the risk of major cardiovascular events by 50 to 60 percent, he said.\n\n\"Most patients tolerate higher doses of more potent statins equally well as lower doses of less potent statins,\" Fonarow said. \"Millions of patients with or at high risk of cardiovascular disease, who would derive additional cardiovascular protection from higher doses of more potent statins, are not currently treated with these agents.

Software that analyzes a patient\u2019s face for signs of disease could help clinicians better diagnose and treat people with genetic syndromes.\n\nSome older attempts at facial analysis relied on large, clunky scanners \u2014 a tool better suited to a lab, not the field. Now, in the era of smartphones, such efforts have a whole new promise. Face2Gene, a program developed by Boston-based startup FDNA, has a mobile app that clinicians can use to snap photos of their patients and get a list of syndromes they might have.\n\nMeanwhile, Muenke and his colleagues at the NIH last month published an important advance: the ability to diagnose disease in a non-Caucasian face.\n\nIt\u2019s a promising preliminary sign. But if facial recognition software is to be widely useful for diagnoses, software developers and geneticists will need to work together to overcome genetics\u2019 systemic blind spots.\n\nThe algorithms in general work on the same principles: measuring the size of facial features and their placement to detect patterns. They\u2019re both trained on databases of photographs doctors take of their patients. The NIH works with partners around the world to collect their photos; FDNA accepts photos uploaded to Face2Gene.\n\nBut they differ in a key way: Whereas the algorithm the NIH uses can predict if someone has a given genetic disorder, the Face2Gene algorithm spits out not diagnoses, but probabilities. The app describes photos as being a certain percent similar to photos of people with one of the 2,000 disorders for which Face2Gene has image data, based on the overall \u201clook\u201d of the face as well as the presence of certain features. However, the app won\u2019t give clinicians a yes or no answer to the question of, \u201cDoes my patient have a genetic disorder?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s intentional. Face2Gene is meant to be more like a search engine for diseases \u2014 a means to an end.\n\n\u201cWe are not a diagnostic tool, and we will never be a diagnostic tool,\u201d said FDNA CEO Dekel Gelbman.\n\nDrawing that bright line between Face2Gene and \u201ca diagnostic tool\u201d allows FDNA to stay compliant with FDA regulations governing mobile medical apps while avoiding some of the regulatory burden associated with smartphone-based diagnostic tools.\n\nThe algorithm the NIH uses \u2014 developed by scientists at Children\u2019s National Health System in Washington, D.C., \u2014 seems to work pretty well so far: In 129 cases of Down syndrome, it accurately detected the disorder 94 percent of the time. For DiGeorge syndrome, the numbers were even higher: It had a 95 percent accuracy rate across all 156 cases.\n\nFace2Gene declined to provide similar numbers for their technology. \u201cSince Face2Gene is a search and reference informational tool, the terms sensitivity and specificity are difficult to apply to our output,\u201d Gelbman cautioned.\n\nBut there\u2019s one big stumbling block for both of them, a problem that has dogged medical genetics for decades: Data for non-white populations is sorely lacking.\n\n\u201cIn every single textbook, the ones we had [when I trained] in Germany and the major textbooks here in the US, there are photos of individuals of northern European descent,\u201d Muenke said. \u201cWhen I told this to my boss, he said there have to be atlases for children from diverse backgrounds. And there aren\u2019t. There just aren\u2019t.\u201d (Today there is that resource, based on Muenke and the NIH\u2019s work.)\n\nSo diagnosing diseases from a face alone presents an additional challenge in countries where the majority of the population isn\u2019t of northern European descent, because some facial areas that vary with ethnic background can often overlap with areas that signify a genetic disorder. Eventually, the software will also have to be able to tackle people with mixed ethnic backgrounds, too. \u201cWe have thought about it but haven\u2019t gone there yet,\u201d Muenke said.\n\nFor example, children with Down syndrome often have flat nasal bridges \u2014 as do typically developing African or African-American children. Across different races and ethnicities of children there were only two reliable identifiers that could be used to diagnose Down syndrome \u2014 the angles between landmark points on the child\u2019s nose and eye, according to a paper Muenke and Marius Linguraru at Children\u2019s National published with their colleagues earlier this year. All of the other \u201ctypical\u201d features weren\u2019t significantly more likely to show up when children were compared to ethnically matched controls.\n\nIn fact, using a Caucasian face as a reference can sometimes be the least representative choice. \u201cOne of the findings that I\u2019m very interested in [in] our recent study was that the population that we found to be most different from the others, in terms of facial patterns characteristic of DiGeorge syndrome, was the Caucasian population,\u201d Linguraru said.\n\nTo continue to fix this problem, both the NIH and Face2Gene need help from more researchers who can upload more patients\u2019 faces \u2014 but that\u2019s easier said than done. Confirming a suspected disorder with genetic tests is standard practice today, and there are no genetic labs based in Africa registered in the NIH\u2019s Genetic Testing Registry. Asia and South America are also relatively underserved.\n\nThose numbers also reflect the general patterns of distribution for medical geneticists. \u201cMost practitioners are located in North America and Europe,\u201d Gelbman said. Nigeria, for example, doesn\u2019t have a single medical geneticist in the entire country.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that might change, with time and effort. In addition to his work as a researcher, Muenke directs a program that brings health care professionals from developing countries to the US for a month-long crash course in medical genetics. (The program is funded by the NIH\u2019s Fogarty International Center; President Trump eliminated funding for the center in his 2018 \u201cskinny\u201d budget proposal announced in March.)\n\nFor now, both algorithms have shown that they can handle a diverse patient set. FDNA scientists published a paper in January showing that their algorithm could better identify Down syndrome after being trained with a more diverse set of faces, and Muenke and Linguraru have also published papers this year demonstrating their algorithm\u2019s ability to identify genetic disorders correctly in children across a variety of ethnic backgrounds.\n\nAs both groups work on recruiting more researchers, they are also working to push their tech forward. FDNA is working on establishing partnerships with pharmaceutical companies to start their commercial outreach. In theory, these partnerships could contribute to precision medicine efforts or help companies develop new therapies for rare diseases.\n\nMeanwhile, Linguraru has his eyes on eventual FDA approval for the algorithm the NIH has used.

Brachytherapy also has fewer side effects such as radiation burns.\n\n\"That reduces the potential harm to surrounding organs behind the breast tissue. That was a huge factor in me choosing to do the brachytherapy,\u201d said Cheryl McCartney, 51, a Chouteau Elementary School principal who had brachytherapy done in 2006 at Cancer Treatment Centers of America in Tulsa.\n\nMcCartney had no side effects and remains cancer-free.\n\nThe typical radiation treatment for breast cancer involves about six weeks of daily \"external beam radiation\u201d that treats the entire breast. Not all communities offer radiation treatment, so women often must travel to receive it. Because of the burden, doctors say, many choose to have mastectomies instead.\n\n\"It's a lot shorter, and it's obviously convenient,\u201d said Dr. Doug Kelly, a radiation oncologist with Cancer Treatment Centers. For many women, family and work obligations make a commute to receive treatment a challenge. \"They really have a hard time coming in for six weeks,\u201d he said.\n\nThe shorter treatment duration encouraged McCartney to have brachytherapy. Her first oncologist suggested the traditional approach. After seeking a second opinion, she had the needle method done without having to miss work. She returned twice a day for treatment.\n\n\"It did not disrupt my schedule that week,\u201d she said.\n\nCancer Treatment Centers was among the first to adopt brachytherapy for breast cancer patients a decade ago, Kelly said.\n\n\"Now it's becoming more common and almost standard,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nAlthough there are no large-scale national results, doctors say studies have shown brachytherapy to be as effective as traditional radiation therapy.\n\nOU Physicians Radiologist Dr. Ozer Algan said a national study of brachytherapy's effectiveness compared to treating the entire breast is underway, but it will be several years before results are published.\n\nHowever, he said, \"I think it is becoming more popular, both from a physician perspective but also from a patient perspective. I think most patients want to get their treatment done as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nAlgan said he doesn't extol one technique over the others; all are acceptable depending on the patient.\n\nIn the multiple-catheter method, a doctor places 10 to 20 \"needles\u201d about one centimeter apart around the tumor cavity, and a machine inserts the radioactive pellet. The procedure requires a hospital stay, at the end of which the needles and pellets are removed. Women can then return to work.\n\nIn the balloon-catheter method, also known as Mammosite, a doctor inflates a balloon in the tumor cavity, and a catheter delivers the radioactive pellet.\n\nAlthough standards depend somewhat on doctors' preferences, candidates for breast brachytherapy typically have early-stage tumors with a margin of healthy tissue around the tumor site after removal and minimal or no migration of cancer cells to nearby lymph nodes.\n\n\"You're hopefully killing any stray cancer cells,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nBrachytherapy remains a mainstay of prostate cancer treatment. Oklahomans had some 2,510 new cases of prostate cancer this year.\n\nOU Physicians Urologist Dr. Puneet Sindhwani said doctors are diagnosing prostate cancer earlier; they aren't seeing the advanced-stage or \"hybrid\u201d cancers they saw 15 or 20 years ago.\n\n\"More and more patients are opting for brachytherapy. More and more physicians are offering brachytherapy,\u201d he said.\n\nBecause the prostate is small and tiny shifts in position can make accurately targeting tumors difficult, OU Physicians has software and a real-time machine that allow doctors to place the seeds exactly where they are needed.\n\nWithout the software, doctors must plan where to place the tiny pellets and then recreate the position of the prostate. The computer calculates radiation exposure to nearby nerves and tissue, which is important because overexposure can cause erectile dysfunction and other problems.\n\n\"A five-millimeter distance will make you either overexposed or underexposed,\u201d he explained.\n\nSindhwani has been performing the procedure with the new equipment for about three months.\n\nAlthough long-term data are unavailable, results have been positive.\n\n\"At present time, it seems like they are doing very well,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 50 to 150 pellets become inert metal after losing their radioactivity.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The article does not exaggerate the consequences of the cancer itself or of either treatment.

Tens of thousands of patients a year undergo the procedure \"off-label,\" however, paying around $5,000 out-of-pocket, based on the claims of doctors who say it can cure everything from Alzheimer's to autism.\n\nNational Institutes of Health officials say they launched the study because there has never been any evidence that the practice is effective or safe.\n\nIn a presentation Sunday, doctors said the trial found a small overall benefit to chelation, mainly because it prevented heart problems in people with diabetes.\n\nElliott Antman, chair of the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions program committee, praised NIH for doing the study.\n\n\"Kudos for funding a trial that says, 'OK, if people are lining up to have this done, let's let it undergo rigorous clinical trials,'\" Antman said in an interview before the results were unveiled.\n\nIn a statement after the study was presented, Antman, a cardiologist at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, added, \"Intriguing as the results are, they are unexpected and should not be interpreted as an indication to adopt chelation therapy into clinical practice.\"\n\nYet some doctors say the study was far from rigorously performed, and so badly run that its marginally positive results are meaningless.\n\nCardiologist Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic, one of the USA's most respected heart experts, says he's concerned the study will encourage more patients to get off-label chelation instead of taking proven medications or making lifestyle changes that clearly have been shown to reduce heart disease.\n\n\"This study has the potential to be extremely dangerous,\" Nissen says.

We need to understand whether the signal is true, or whether it occurred by chance.\"\n\nThe trial, known as the Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy, or TACT, has been dogged by accusations of safety and ethical problems from its beginnings 10 years ago.\n\nThe study was temporarily halted in 2008 because of concerns over ethics and patient safety. An investigation by the federal Office for Human Research Subject Protections, which is charged with protecting patients, found that patients may not have been properly informed of chelation's risks.\n\nIn response to such concerns, researchers revised their consent forms \u2014 the documents that explain a study's risks and benefits to patients \u2014 which had failed to mention the risk of death in chelation therapy.\n\nFederal officials also ordered researchers to notify patients that the drug they were receiving had never been approved for lead poisoning, as implied in the consent form, and that the Food and Drug Administration had taken the study drug off of its list of approved medications.\n\nStephen Kopecky, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist who participated in the trial, says he's also concerned about the reliability of its findings.\n\nThe overall benefits were very small, with 26.5% of those randomly assigned to chelation experiencing a cardiovascular problem, compared with 30% of those randomly assigned to a placebo infusion. Even more concerning, that benefit passed the bar for statistical significance \u2014 the standard for judging whether a result is real or a fluke \u2014 by only 0.001.\n\nFurther analysis showed the benefits were limited to those with diabetes, rather than for patients overall.\n\nUnder the best of circumstances, that's not a strong result, says anesthesiologist Kimball Atwood of Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Massachusetts, who has followed the study from its beginning.\n\nThis study's findings are even more questionable, however, Kopecky says, because patients who got chelation had lower bad cholesterol levels than the placebo group at the start of the trial. That could explain most of their reduced risk for a second heart attack, says Kopecky, president of the American Society for Preventive Cardiology.\n\nIn addition, 30% of patients stopped getting their assigned treatments, and 17% withdrew their consent, preventing doctors from including their data or even contacting them to see if they were still alive, Kopecky says.\n\nThat large of a dropout rate \u2014 which is normally no more than about 3% \u2014 could skew the study's findings, Kopecky says.\n\n\"That's a big concern any time a study shows a benefit on something that's not highly regulated by the FDA,\" Kopecky says.\n\nKopecky also acknowledges that there's no known biological basis for why removing metals from the blood would help heart disease. \"That is a million-dollar question,\" he said.\n\nMore than half the trial sites were led by doctors who practice chelation, says Paul Armstrong, a professor of cardiology at the University of Alberta, chosen to discuss the study on a panel at the heart meeting.

For those who just can\u2019t give up grains (or regular eating), a new study indicates that being less restrictive is actually better for your waistline.\n\nRelated: How to Lose Weight and Keep it Off? Eternal Dieting Vigilance\n\nResearchers from The University of Tasmania in Australia found that breaking up with your diet for two weeks could lead to more weight loss\u2014and help you keep it off, too.\n\nFor the small study just published in the International Journal of Obesity, the team enlisted 51 obese men from the ages of 25 to 54 years old. All participants had maintained their current weight for six months leading up to the study and did not exercise regularly. One group of men followed the diet, which reduced calorie consumption by about one-third of their individual needs, for 16 weeks straight. The experimental group stuck to the eating plan for two weeks, before ditching the diet for two weeks. They repeated the cycle until they had also dieted for 16 weeks; however, in their case, each bout of restriction was followed by a period of eating enough calories for weight maintenance.\n\nAt the end of the study, the men following the intermittent diet plan lost 47 percent more weight than the control group. And while it\u2019s common to regain a few pounds after returning to previous eating habits, the two-week dieters kept the pounds off, maintaining a nearly 18-pound loss six months after the study.\n\nKrista Varady, an outside researcher who studies intermittent fasting (not the same as intermittent dieting) and weight loss at the University of Illinois, believes the results were significant.\n\n\"I was really impressed that they still saw almost a two kilogram weight loss during that last period at the end of the four months,\" she tells Newsweek. \"At that point we see almost zero weight loss,\" she explains of her own research. \"Somehow they\u2019re kind of keeping the body on its toes.\"\n\nThis trick may help combat the dreaded weight loss plateau that plagues dieters looking to lose those last five pounds.

Because these tests, while 80 percent accurate, carry a 1 percent to 2 percent risk of miscarriage, only about one in 10 pregnant women opts for them, he said.\n\nThe new test eliminates the risk of miscarriage, Patsalis said.\n\nIt also can identify Down syndrome in the 11th week of pregnancy, early enough for a woman to end her pregnancy if she chooses, Patsalis said.\n\nAlthough Down syndrome varies in severity, it usually causes some intellectual impairment and distinguishing facial features. Heart defects and other health problems are also common, according to the March of Dimes. Older mothers are more likely to give birth to Down syndrome babies.\n\nPeople with Down syndrome, also known as Trisomy 21, carry three copies of chromosome 21, instead of two.\n\nFor the study, published online March 6 in Nature Medicine, Patsalis and his colleagues took blood samples from pregnant women and mothers of Down syndrome and healthy babies. In each case, the test quickly pinpointed the chromosomal variation, identifying 14 Down syndrome cases and 26 normal fetuses, the study authors said.\n\nIf larger clinical trials confirm the results, the test could become standard practice, Patsalis said. \"The cost is much lower than the invasive procedures,\" he said. \"We estimate we can introduce this to clinical practice in a couple of years.\"\n\nDr. Brian Skotko, clinical fellow in genetics at Children's Hospital Boston and a spokesman for the National Down Syndrome Society, said this study has widespread implications for the incidence of Down syndrome.\n\nWith this new test, women will know if their baby has Down syndrome even before they look pregnant, Skotko said. \"So they will be able to make a very personal decision without anyone realizing it,\" he said.\n\nNoting that most of his Down syndrome patients say they lead fulfilling lives, Skotko said, \"The overwhelming majority of family members say they can't imagine their life without their family member with Down syndrome.\"\n\nFor more information on Down syndrome, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A new study has found that consumption of omega-3 fatty acids from fish is associated with a reduced risk for one kind of colon polyp, but only in women.\n\nAnimal studies have suggested that omega-3 fatty acids may have anti-cancer effects, but the results from human epidemiological studies have been inconclusive.

People have this internal self-healing ability.\"\n\nAn outside expert, however, said the study is too limited in size and scope to allow conclusions as to whether meditation really reduces risk of death or disease.\n\nThe new study focused on Transcendental Meditation. Originally from India, it is not associated with any particular religion or philosophy. It is thought to produce alpha brain waves that occur in deep relaxation. According to the Maharishi Foundation, more than 5 million people worldwide practice this type of meditation.\n\nThe research focused on blacks because they are at a higher risk than whites of having heart attacks and strokes and dying from heart disease, Schneider said. He added, however, that meditation would work as well among whites and other populations.\n\n\"Other studies have been done among whites and the results are similar,\" he said.\n\nThe report was published in the Nov. 13 issue of the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes. The study was sponsored by the Maharishi University of Management and funded by the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.\n\nFor the study, Schneider's team randomly assigned 201 black Americans with heart disease either to a Transcendental Meditation stress-reducing program or health education class about lifestyle modification in diet and exercise.\n\nAlmost 60 percent of the participants were taking cholesterol-lowering drugs. Forty-one percent of the meditation group took aspirin, as did 31 percent of the health education group; 38 percent of the meditation group and 43 percent of the health education group smoked, the researchers noted.\n\nParticipants' average body-mass index -- a measurement of body fat based on height and weight -- was 32, which is considered obese.\n\nMeditation consisted of sitting with eyes closed for about 20 minutes twice a day. The goal was to rest while remaining alert.\n\nAfter more than five years of follow-up, the researchers found those who meditated saw significant reductions in blood pressure and anger compared to those receiving health education. In addition, 20 people in the medication group had a heart attack or stroke or died, compared with 32 in the health education group.\n\nBoth groups increased exercise and drank less. For those who meditated, there was a trend toward reduced smoking; however, this was not statistically significant.\n\nLearning how to do Transcendental Meditation isn't inexpensive. An initial 10-hour course runs about $1,500 when taught by nonprofit groups, and there is continued lifetime follow-up, Schneider said.\n\nAnd it's not something you can learn by yourself. \"You've got to have a teacher right there in front of you teaching according to experience,\" he said. \"So it's only learned live.\"\n\nTranscendental Meditation is not generally covered by health insurance, he said. \"One of the reasons we did the study is because insurance and Medicare calls for citing evidence for what's to be reimbursed,\" Schneider said. \"This study will lead toward reimbursement. That's the whole idea.\"\n\nBut a cardiology expert said that although the study adds to evidence supporting meditation, it doesn't prove a cause-and-effect relationship between the practice and better health outcomes.\n\n\"Transcendental Meditation has been reported to have health benefits and has been evaluated in a number of studies,\" said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nSome studies have suggested favorable effects on cardiovascular risk factors whereas others studies have been inconclusive, he said.\n\nEven though the findings in this study were statistically significant, the new study was too small to be conclusive, Fonarow said.\n\n\"In addition, since this study was conducted at a single center and the primary [change in heart attack, stroke and death] was not statistically significant without adjustment for other factors, more studies and replication of these findings are needed,\" he said.\n\nFor more information on heart disease, visit the American Heart Association.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease-mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Scientists working for Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet have used artificial intelligence to determine a person\u2019s risk of having a heart attack from their retinal scan.\n\nThe method\u2014detailed in a paper published on Monday in the Nature journal Biomedical Engineering\u2014involves analyzing blood vessels in an area of the eye called the retinal fundus.\n\nThe researchers from Verily, formerly known as Google Life Sciences, developed the algorithm in the hope of making accurate assessments of patients\u2019 cardiovascular health more quickly and easily than current methods.\n\nTraining deep-learning models on data from more than a quarter of a million patients, the scientists were able to predict the cardiovascular risk factors that were not previously thought to be present in retinal fundus images.\n\nThe risk factors include the person\u2019s gender, smoking status, blood pressure and age\u2014estimated to within four years of the patient\u2019s actual age.\n\n\u201cMost cardiovascular risk calculators use some combination of these parameters to identify patients at risk of experiencing either a major cardiovascular event or cardiac-related mortality within a pre-specified time period, such as 10 years,\u201d the paper states.\n\n\u201cHowever, some of these parameters may be unavailable\u2026We therefore explored whether additional signals for cardiovascular risk can be extracted from retinal images, which can be obtained quickly, cheaply and non-invasively in an outpatient setting.\u201d\n\nRead more: Can smartphones replace your GP?

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which generally combines estrogen plus progestin, is very effective. But after the initial findings of the Women\u2019s Health Initiative study showed that HRT can increase the risk of breast cancer, stroke and other serious problems, many women stopped using it.\n\nAs reported in the journal Menopause, in 2013 and 2014 Davis and her team analyzed survey responses from nearly 1,500 women ages 40 to 65.\n\nSeventeen percent were having moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, and 18 percent reported moderate to severe sexual symptoms.\n\nBut most were not receiving any kind of treatment. Only 11 percent reported use of HRT, and less than 1 percent were using any type of therapy that didn\u2019t involve hormones.\n\nThe women who did use hormones were mostly taking pills containing estrogen, rather than preparations that are absorbed into the skin and that are potentially safer, the researchers found.\n\n\u201cExtrapolating our findings to 3.7 million Australian women aged 40 to 64 years, we found that 455,000 women are likely to have moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, with most women (385,000) remaining untreated,\u201d they write.\n\nIn addition, very few women were receiving vaginal estrogen therapy for sexual symptoms. Vaginal dryness is common with menopause and affects sexual functioning. Vaginal estrogen preparations are very safe and effective for this problem but were prescribed to less than 5 percent of the women, the authors say.\n\nWhy are so few women being treated?\n\n\u201cOverall, there is the uncertainty of women and of doctors as to what the options are, what is and is not safe, and of the safe options - what and how to prescribe them,\u201d Davis said.\n\nThere is also, she said, a complete lack of understanding that for most women, these symptoms are not fleeting.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t \u2018grin and bear it for a few months\u2019 and it will all pass, as many women suffer severe symptoms for five-plus years,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen and doctors simply are not aware that symptoms can last this long.\u201d\n\nFinally, many women don\u2019t realize that non hormonal options can be safe and effective, she added.\n\nDr. Wulf H.

There are no drugs to treat the condition, which typically sets in around the age of two, and many families have tried intensive training of their children by therapists, with mixed results. Pact instead trained the parents to help their children.\n\nProf Jonathan Green at the University of Manchester, who led the study published in the Lancet medical journal, said they had not found the cure for autism, but he and his team believed it had great potential and hoped it would be widely adopted.\n\n\u201cThe advantage of this approach over a direct therapist-child intervention is that it has potential to affect the everyday life of the child,\u201d he said. \u201cOur findings are encouraging, as they represent an improvement in the core symptoms of autism previously thought very resistant to change.\n\n\u201cThis is not a cure, in the sense that the children who demonstrated improvements will still show remaining symptoms to a variable extent, but it does suggest that working with parents to interact with their children in this way can lead to improvements in symptoms over the long term.\u201d\n\nThe trial involved 152 children aged two to four. The families visited a clinic twice a week for six months, where parents were videoed with their children and a box of toys. Autistic children might not interact with their parents at all, but when eventually a child did offer a toy or made a noise that could be interpreted as a request, the incident was rerun on video and the parent encouraged to respond. If the child offered a toy, the parent reciprocated. If the child said a word, the parent repeated it and added something. The practice was repeated at home every day.\n\nThe therapy continued with the parents for the next six months with less intensity. At the end of the first year, the researchers could see the children had improved, but the most dramatic development was seen at the follow-up six years later. At the start of the trial, 50% of those in the control group who did not get the therapy and 55% of those who did were assessed as severely autistic. The children in the intervention group, though, got better. The proportion assessed as severe in the control group was 63% by the end of six years, compared with 46% in the intervention group.\n\nOther experts applauded the work. \u201cI can see why these researchers are excited,\u201d said Dorothy Bishop, professor of developmental neuropsychology at the University of Oxford. \u201cThese results at follow-up are pretty consistent in showing the benefit of this early intervention for autism across a range of measures. My impression is that this is an intervention that reduces the severity of autistic symptoms, rather than curing autism. Nevertheless, for parents of children with autism, even a modest reduction would be worthwhile.\u201d\n\nDr Max Davie, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said it offered \u201ca hugely cheering message for families\u201d, while Uta Frith, emeritus professor of cognitive development at University College London, called it \u201ca remarkably positive story, because the intervention itself was neither intensive nor invasive\u201d.\n\nThe absence of any hope, as well as the very sudden regression in children\u2019s behaviour, led many parents to believe in the discredited theory of Andrew Wakefield that the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine was the cause of autism.\n\n\u201cParents commonly tell us that they fight for a diagnosis but when they finally get it the cupboard is bare, with little information or tailored support available to them,\u201d said Dr James Cusack, director of science at the charity Autistica. \u201cToo often, parents fall victim to the false claims of charlatans who prey on desperate families. These results look promising for the many thousands of parents who want to find early interventions for their children based on solid science.\u201d\n\nThe researchers said children\u2019s communication with their parents was improved at the end of the six years. The parents said there were also improvements in relations with other children, in social communication and in repetitive behaviours. But there was no change in child anxiety, challenging behaviours or depression in the autistic children and they would still need a lot of support while growing up.\n\nAbout 1% of children and young people are affected by autistic spectrum disorder, which ranges from mild to severe. The lifetime costs to the UK, which include health, social care and education costs as well as productivity losses, are estimated at \u00a31m to \u00a31.5m per child and between $1.4m and $2.4m in the United States.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There was no disease mongering, although the article should have made clearer that the study was conducted on children with a severe form of autism and did not involve children elsewhere on the \u201cspectrum.\u201d", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Welcome to Dear Julia, a weekly column where readers can submit everyday health questions on anything from the science of hangovers to the mysteries of back pain. Julia Belluz will sift through the research and consult with experts in the field to figure out how science can help us live happier and healthier lives.\n\nHave a question? Use our submission form or ask @juliaoftoronto on Twitter.\n\nWhat's the difference between Tylenol, Advil, and aspirin? Which is the best to take for pain?\n\nI used to take acetaminophen (usually referred to by its brand name, Tylenol) for the occasional headache or sore muscle, mostly because that's what we used in my house growing up. I didn't think much about whether it was more or less effective than any other type of over-the-counter pain reliever, and I suspect the same is true for many folks. Acetaminophen, after all, is the most popular over-the-counter painkiller worldwide.\n\nSo I was surprised when I found out there's a huge gap between how pain researchers think about this drug and how the public does. More specifically, every researcher I contacted for this piece said some variation of what Andrew Moore, a pain researcher at Oxford University, told me: Tylenol doesn't actually work that well for pain. To be more exact, he said, \"I can't imagine why anybody would take acetaminophen.\"\n\nMoore has done a number of systematic reviews on over-the-counter pain medications, looking at all the available evidence to figure out which ones work best for various problems. I asked him to describe the overall success rates for the most common three: acetaminophen (like Tylenol), ibuprofen (like Advil), and aspirin.\n\nLike all good evidence-based medicine thinkers, he was able to provide a very practical answer: \"If you\u2019re talking about aspirin in doses of 500 to 1,000 mg or two tablets, 30 percent of people get relief from acute pain. For acetaminophen at doses of 500 to 1,000 mg, about 40 percent have a success. For ibuprofen, in its normal formulation at something around 400 mg or two tablets, about 50 percent have success.\"\n\nNow, Moore was referring here to acute pain that strikes after a specific event, like a surgery, a cut, or a burn, but his message was simple: Ibuprofen seems to work best, followed by acetaminophen, and then aspirin.\n\nFor ongoing (or chronic) pain \u2014 a sore lower back, say, or the kind of degenerative arthritis that typically develops with age \u2014 ibuprofen still outperforms acetaminophen.\n\n\"WE FOUND THAT [TYLENOL] IS INEFFECTIVE ON BOTH PAIN AND DISABILITY OUTCOMES FOR LOW BACK PAIN\" A 2015 systematic review of high-quality evidence, published in the BMJ, found that acetaminophen didn't seem to help most sufferers of chronic low back pain, and that it barely alleviates pain in people with osteoarthritis. As the researchers wrote, \"We found that [acetaminophen] is ineffective on both pain and disability outcomes for low back pain in the immediate and short term and is not clinically superior to placebo on both pain and disability outcomes for osteoarthritis.\"\n\nA limitation of the study is that the evidence on acetaminophen was mainly for acute low back pain, but as the University of Leeds's Philip Conaghan explained, \"There is very little long-term data [on chronic back pain], and if a drug doesn't work in the acute problem, it seems unlikely to work in the chronic phase \u2014 though back pain may be even more complex than osteoarthritis pain.\"\n\nThe study also noted that patients on acetaminophen \"are nearly four times more likely to have abnormal results on liver function tests compared with those taking oral placebo.\"\n\nOther studies, like this well-designed randomized control trial of people with knee pain, have similar conclusions: Acetaminophen doesn't perform as well as ibuprofen, and it's linked to higher rates of liver problems. (Ibuprofen also has potential side effects; more on that below.)\n\nSo what about the occasional headache? What works best for that?\n\nIt turns out this is another fascinating problem area for pain researchers. Moore has looked at all the evidence for what he calls \"infrequent tension headaches\" and found \"it is surprising how poor [the research] is and how little it tells us.\" Either the outcomes in studies are badly defined, the studies have too few participants to say anything concrete, or many people in the studies actually seem to have chronic headaches as opposed to the ordinary ones the researchers are allegedly studying.\n\n\"Most people would say, if you look at the data, take an ibuprofen tablet,\" Moore said. \"Acetaminophen is just not a very good analgesic [pain reliever], yet it\u2019s the go-to drug because it\u2019s thought to be safe.\"\n\nAnd that's where things get even more interesting: Acetaminophen isn't actually that safe.\n\n\"We always thought [acetaminophen] was safe, but there are increasing signals of accidental overdose in people who are regularly using it for chronic pain, and some liver toxicity,\" explained Conaghan, who has studied adverse events data related to this popular drug.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2003, acetaminophen was the leading cause of acute liver failure in the US. There are also hundreds of related deaths every year \u2014 though keep in mind that millions of people take drugs with acetaminophen, so these more extreme side effects are rare (especially if you're only taking them in small doses occasionally). Still, for the drug's minimal pain-killing benefits, the risks may not be worth it. \n\n\n\n\"Don't believe that just because something is over-the-counter, it\u2019s safe,\" Conaghan added. (He advised people to see their doctor if they're taking any of these painkillers for more than a few days \u2014 particularly if they're on other drugs already.)\n\n\"[Tylenol] is an old drug, obsolete, and should be avoided altogether\"\n\nKay Brune, a professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Germany's Friedrich-Alexander University who has also studied the toxicity of painkillers, was even more direct in his thoughts on acetaminophen: \"It's an old drug, obsolete, and should be avoided altogether.\"\n\nAspirin is safer than acetaminophen, he said, though to be used as a pain reliever it requires much higher doses \u2014 which can have side effects like stomach upset. Aspirin also interferes with blood coagulation for days after taking it. \"If you take one gram of aspirin,\" Brune explained, \"you're at risk of bleeding for another four days.\" This is why aspirin has its place as a protective agent against strokes and heart attacks for people at a higher risk.\n\nIbuprofen doesn't have these two problems \u2014 it's less toxic than the others in the doses that give people pain relief. But it has other side effects. \"Ibuprofen puts people at risk of bleeds in the gastrointestinal tract and kidney damage \u2014 so it's not free of risk,\" said Brune. Using it in high doses also seems to raise blood pressure and increase the risk of heart attack and stroke \u2014 one reason the Food and Drug Administration recently warned people should only use ibuprofen (and other \"nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,\" or NSAIDS, like naproxen) for short periods of time and in small amounts.\n\n\n\nI asked Brune about what he'd suggest for the occasional headache or sore muscle. \"Taking 400 mg of ibuprofen won't cause measurable harm,\" he answered. \"Of all drugs we have available, for most indications, it's also the most effective one.\"\n\nIs acetaminophen good for anything?\n\nIf the research community seems to have sided with ibuprofen for pain, is acetaminophen good for anything?\n\n\n\nYes. There are some groups of people with health complications who shouldn't take ibuprofen. For example, patients with kidney, gastric, cardiovascular, or bleeding problems may need to avoid NSAIDS like ibuprofen, so doctors might suggest Tylenol in these cases. \n\n\n\nThere's also some evidence that NSAIDS may increase the risk of psychosis and cognitive impairment in the elderly, so doctors may avoid prescribing these drugs for older patients. And Tylenol is generally considered safer than Advil or aspirin for pregnant women.\n\n\n\nFever is another area where acetaminophen can help, said Moore. According to one systematic review, acetaminophen seems to be safe for treating very young kids with fever, and you can give children as young as 3 months old acetaminophen, whereas you need to wait until kids are at least 6 months old to safely treat them with ibuprofen. This may help to explain the popularity of drugs like Tylenol for kids.\n\nBut a final caveat here: If your child is older than 6 months, it's not all that clear that acetaminophen outperforms ibuprofen for reducing fevers, and the same is true for adults.

Symptoms include fever, cough, and rapid breathing. Chest X-ray is considered the test of choice for diagnosing pneumonia in children, but the WHO estimates three-quarters of the world's population does not have access to radiography.\n\nInvestigators conducted a randomized controlled trial in the pediatric Emergency Department at The Mount Sinai Hospital comparing lung ultrasound to chest X-ray in 191 children from birth to 21 years of age. The patients were randomly assigned into an investigational arm (received a lung ultrasound and if the physician needed additional verification, a chest X-ray) and a control arm (received a chest X-ray followed by a lung ultrasound). Researchers found a 38.8 percent reduction in chest X-rays in the investigational arm compared to no reduction in the control arm, with no missed pneumonia cases and no increase in any other adverse events.\n\nThe research team was led by James Tsung, MD, MPH, Associate Professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine and Department of Pediatrics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and former clinical fellow Brittany Pardue Jones, MD, who's currently Assistant Professor in the Department of Pediatrics at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.\n\n\"Ultrasound is portable, cost-saving and safer for children than an X-ray because it does not expose them to radiation,\" says Dr. Tsung. \"Our study could have a profound impact in the developing world where access to radiography is limited.\"\n\nFurthermore, the reduction in chest X-rays in the investigational arm resulted in an overall cost savings of $9,200, and length of stay in the Emergency Department was decreased by 26 minutes.\n\n\"In the era of precision medicine, lung ultrasound may also be an ideal imaging option in children who are at higher risk for radiation-induced cancers or have received multiple radiographic or CT imaging studies,\" says Dr. Tsung.\n\nAs more and more handheld ultrasound machines come to market, these results suggest that lung ultrasound has the potential to become the preferred choice for the diagnosis of pneumonia in children. Further research is needed to investigate the impact of lung ultrasound on antibiotic use and stewardship.\n\nThe Mount Sinai Health System is an integrated health system committed to providing distinguished care, conducting transformative research, and advancing biomedical education.

MicroRNAs influence protein activities throughout the body, and they are easily measured in biofluids, including blood, cerebrospinal fluid and saliva, according to the authors.\n\nDr. Steve Hicks, senior author of the study and an assistant professor of pediatrics at Penn State College of Medicine, said the \"five microRNAs in saliva could predict with approximately 85% accuracy which concussed children would have symptoms one month later. In comparison, standard survey measures that are typically used in clinics were approximately 65% accurate.\"\n\nThe study was funded in part by Quadrant Biosciences, a biotech company that hopes to bring a saliva test for concussion to market in the next 12 to 24 months, Hicks said.\n\n\"It's frustrating for both parents and physicians that we can't accurately and objectively predict how long a child's concussion symptoms might last, what those symptoms are likely to consist of and when it might be safe for them to return to sports or school,\" said Hicks, who, as a practicing pediatrician, has routinely cared for kids with concussions.\n\nFor the study, Hicks and his co-authors looked at 52 patients between the ages of 7 and 21, with an average age of 14.\n\nMicroRNA expression was measured in saliva spit into a cup by the patients, who had been injured mostly in sports or car accidents, when they arrived at Penn State Hershey Medical Center for an evaluation. Of the 52, 30 had prolonged symptoms and 22 had short-term symptoms of mild traumatic brain injury.\n\n\"We found three microRNAs that were highly associated with specific symptoms one month after injury, such as headache, fatigue and memory difficulties,\" Hicks said. He added that creating an actual test for use by doctors will require collaboration on the part of researchers.\n\n\"Fortunately, the technology required to measure saliva RNA is already employed in medicine; we use it to check patients for upper respiratory viruses in our hospitals and clinics every day,\" Hicks said. \"Modifying this approach for patients with concussions could potentially provide a rapid, objective tool for managing brain injury.\"\n\n'Way too early to know'\n\nHowever, the editorial authors, Dr. William P. Meehan III of Micheli Center for Sports Injury Prevention at Boston Children's Hospital in Massachusetts and Dr. Rebekah Mannix of Brain Injury Center at Boston Children's Hospital, noted that \"the relatively small sample size in this study requires larger-scale studies to determine the reliability\" of the results.\n\nFor example, they noted that the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications is common among those with more severe injury. In the study, those who had used anti-inflammatory medications were the ones with longer-term symptoms. Possibly, then, the drugs may be a potential 'confounding' variable, they wrote, meaning that medication may influence test results and symptoms, adding an element of confusion to the study and its possible interpretation.\n\nStill, \"the findings are promising, representing potential biomarkers for the diagnosis, recovery, and prognostic assessment of a sport-related concussion.\"\n\nDr. Jeffrey Kutcher, a neurologist and National Director of The Sports Neurology Clinic at The CORE Institute, said that \"work like this is important because it does provide potential for tests that can be helpful in the clinical setting.\"\n\n\"I think the main caveat is, this is way too early to know what this type of tool can do for us,\" added Kutcher, who was not involved in the new research. \"The main reason is that there's a difference between simply having a brain that experiences force and being concussed.\"\n\nThe saliva biomarker may be showing that neurons experienced force and not that a there is a concussion, with which the brain cannot perform its typical functions within a normal range, he said: \"I would hesitate to assign too much potential groundbreaking science.\"\n\nOther biomarkers, including blood, are being investigated as potential concussion tests, he said, though \"nothing is at this stage or beyond this.\"\n\nThere are also tools that look at the electrical networks that brains form, he said, disclosing that he is consulting for a company working on one such technology. A patient undergoes an electroencephalogram while doing a cognitive task, and the EEG records how the brain responds.\n\n\"By actually (measuring) the brain network activity directly, you can look at really what is the functional health of the brain,\" he said.\n\nIn addition, some scientists are exploring functional MRI techniques to look at the metabolic function of different areas of the brain to gain insight into concussion, he said.\n\nHicks said he and his colleagues are collaborating with others to examine saliva biomarkers in adult athletes and members of the armed services.\n\n\"Because the markers we identified in this study are not correlated with patient age, we are hopeful they may be applied in adult populations, as well,\" he said.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story does not commit disease-mongering.

BioSure UK has begun selling a $45 take-home HIV test that lets customers prick their fingers, smear the blood on a testing stick, and get their HIV results within 15 minutes.\n\nBioSure\u2019s test goes beyond any of the at-home tests available on the U.S. market, which are either not as fast or not as accurate. When asked if any test similar to BioSure\u2019s new take-home test was in development, Tara Goodin, a press officer for the Food and Drug Administration, said: \u201cThe FDA cannot confirm the existence of or comment on any current/pending product applications.\u201d\n\nThe FDA has approved two take-home HIV tests, but neither has all the strengths of the BioSure test. The Home Access HIV-1 Test System lets patients collect blood at home, but it must then be sent to a clinic for testing. (Users get their results by calling the company.) OraQuick, on the other hand, is an oral-based at-home test that does let users see their results immediately, but it has an 8.3 percent chance of a false negative. (In contrast, BioSure\u2019s blood test has a much lower 0.2 percent chance that a person who is really HIV positive will test negative.)\n\nBoth countries have tried to make it easier to be tested. The United Kingdom\u2019s National Health Service offers free HIV testing. In the United States, the Affordable Care Act designates HIV testing as a preventive service, meaning that all insurers must cover it without charging a co-pay.\n\nBut if the goal is to let patients test as accurately as possible at home, the United States is falling behind.\n\nThe two countries have roughly comparable rates of undetected HIV infections, although they use different methods to make those estimates. In the U.K., Public Health England, a division of the Department of Health, began testing anonymized blood samples that had been collected for other reasons. It adjusted the raw data to mirror the demographics of the U.K. as a whole and estimated that in 2012, 22 percent of all residents with HIV were undiagnosed.\n\nThe United States, meanwhile, uses new later-stage HIV cases to estimate who must have been infected but undiagnosed four years earlier. In a 2012 study, researchers estimated that in 2008, approximately 20 percent of all HIV-positive people in the United State were undiagnosed.\n\nThat suggests that both countries still face serious gaps in diagnosis. The British test will probably make it easier for people to be screened for the first time and will allow people to re-screen themselves more frequently. (There is a lag of about three months between initial HIV infection and the point at which it is detectable.)\n\nA sizable fraction of the undiagnosed may be people who have been tested, just not recently enough. In a 2008 study of British men who frequented commercial gay venues, 42 percent of the men who tested positive for HIV had never been diagnosed with HIV. This wasn\u2019t because they had never been screened; 81 percent of the undiagnosed men had been tested for HIV previously. Sixty-two percent of these previously screened men erroneously believed themselves to be HIV-negative.\n\nAdopting some version of the British at-home test could help Americans who have already been tested keep up their screening schedule. There\u2019s a benefit in regular screening, even for patients who don\u2019t wind up connecting with a doctor.\n\nIn a small British study of 98 gay and bisexual men who were newly diagnosed as HIV-positive, the use of condoms after the diagnosis doubled relative to the rates of use pre-diagnosis (31 percent to 61 percent of respondents). And because the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections declined for these men, after the diagnosis, the scientists had reason to believe the self-reports of condom usage were accurate.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s new at-home HIV test won\u2019t reach all the undiagnosed or guarantee that the people who test positive wind up receiving the care they need from a doctor, but letting people check their status quickly and accurately is likely to produce cascading positive effects, as HIV-positive people find it easier to seek care for themselves, warn past partners about exposure, and reduce risk for future partners.

But the therapy worked vastly better than University of Pennsylvania researchers David L. Porter, MD, Carl H. June, MD, and colleagues had dared to hope.\n\n\"Our results were absolutely dramatic. It is tremendously exciting,\" Porter tells WebMD. \"These kinds of outcomes don't come around very often. We are really hopeful that we can now translate this into treatment for much larger numbers of patients and apply this technique to other diseases and to many more patients.\"\n\nExcitement is spreading as oncologists learn about the findings. \"I think it is a big deal,\" says Jacque Galipeau, MD, professor of hematology and medical oncology at Emory University Winship Cancer Center. Galipeau was not involved in the Porter study.\n\n\"Here's this guy, the handwriting is on the wall, any hematologist will tell you he is a goner -- this guy was essentially cured,\" Galipeau tells WebMD. \"These genetically engineered cells did what everyone in the field has tried to do for 20 years. The man probably had kilograms of disease in his body, and the cells mopped it up completely.\"\n\nThe treatment uses a form of white blood cells called T cells harvested from each patient. A manmade virus-like vector is used to transfer special molecules to the T cells. One of the molecules, CD19, makes the T cells attack B lymphocytes -- the cells that become cancerous in CLL.\n\nAll this has been done before. These genetically engineered cells are called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. They kill cancer in the test tube. But in humans, they die away before they do much damage to tumors.\n\nWhat's new about the current treatment is the addition of a special signaling molecule called 4-1BB. This signal does several things: it gives CAR T cells more potent anti-tumor activity, and it somehow allows the cells to persist and multiply in patients' bodies. Moreover, the signal does not call down the deadly all-out immune attack -- the feared \"cytokine storm\" -- that can do more harm than good.\n\nThis may be why relatively small infusions of the CAR T cells had such a profound effect. Each of the cells killed thousands of cancer cells and destroyed more than 2 pounds of tumor in each patient.\n\n\"Within three weeks, the tumors had been blown away, in a way that was much more violent than we ever expected,\"June says in a news release.

But there's a catch often not understood by those who undergo the procedure: Once they lose the weight the surgery helps them lose, there may be more surgery to come -- surgery that is costlier and riskier and that requires a longer recovery time than the original operation.\n\nThe reason: excess skin. An obese person who loses weight quickly will lose the fat but not the skin that once enveloped the fat. The arms, thighs, abdomen, breasts, all lose texture and sag.\n\n\"It's as if a very, very large person all of a sudden had all the air let out, as if [he] were a doll,\" says Richard A. D'Amico, chief of the Department of Plastic Surgery at Englewood Hospital and Medical Center in Englewood, N.J.\n\nThe solution: plastic surgery to remove the extra skin, a set of procedures known as body contouring.\n\nAs bariatric surgery has grown more common (some 144,000 such procedures were performed in the United States in 2004, more than double the number in 2002), D'Amico says, patients seeking body contouring have \"started to show up in plastic surgeons' offices in large numbers.\" Last year more than 68,000 patients underwent body contouring after bariatric surgery, 77 percent more than five years ago, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.\n\nBarbara Baez of Fort Worth was part of that increase. Within a year of having weight loss surgery in 2003, she lost about 150 pounds; her blood pressure dropped to normal levels and the swelling in her legs decreased. She felt healthier and began exercising more. Friends told her she looked great. But, she says, \"nobody saw what was underneath.\"\n\nHer abdomen drooped so much that it got the way of her workouts. \"Exercise was a problem because you have this bouncing skin, and it's uncomfortable.\"\n\nIntense discomfort that interferes with activity is a common problem after bariatric surgery, says plastic surgeon Sarah Holland, an instructor at Columbia University Medical Center in New York -- and it can be almost constant. The skin, she says, \"has been irreparably damaged by the stretch [and it] doesn't shrink down like the rest of the body does. So it just hangs.\" In addition, she says, \"Their clothes don't fit very well because there's no place to put the extra skin.\"\n\nMany patients get chronic infections from skin rubbing against skin, and develop open wounds in the folds of flesh.\n\nFrom the skin rubbing together against her thighs, she developed bacterial and fungal infections. \"I would have bandages on me all the time. It was very painful. Just walking was painful. I had hygiene problems.\" Eventually, Baez says, \"I realized that I would need to have the skin removed.\"\n\nHer doctors never warned her this might be necessary, she says. That's not uncommon, says D'Amico. There are no guidelines requiring bariatric surgeons to warn their patients, although recently professional societies of plastic surgeons and bariatric surgeons have begun holding seminars to discuss the idea.\n\nBaez waited about a year before she started searching for a plastic surgeon. That should be the norm, says Holland. Patients should be at a stable weight for at least a month, she adds, to make sure that they've \"lost all the weight they're going to lose.\"\n\nWhile the surgical techniques used in contouring operations have been around for decades, bariatric patients present \"a unique challenge\" to plastic surgeons, says D'Amico. \"Contouring the low abdomen in somebody who has lost 250 pounds is a bigger technical effort than doing a tummy tuck on a 130-pound woman who's just had a couple of pregnancies.\"\n\nBody contouring operations are often longer and more complex than bariatric surgery, involving potentially more blood loss and shifts of fluids, and a painful healing period that can extend over weeks or months. Like all major surgery, it also carries risks of infection and problems with anesthesia.\n\n\"It's a radical procedure,\" warns Baez, who had her contouring work done last August. \"It was much more invasive than my initial surgery.\"\n\nThe American Society of Plastic Surgery (ASPS) has formed a task force -- D'Amico is a co-chair -- to alert doctors to the higher risks involved and teach them new techniques. \"It's been a hot topic at all the national conferences over the last couple of years,\" says Holland.\n\nSome body contouring patients may require several procedures -- one for the thighs, one for the arms and so on. To manage pain and prevent long periods under anesthesia, most patients have the procedures done in stages over a series of weeks or months.\n\nBecause the surgery is still relatively new, there are few studies of complication rates. A small study published in January in the Annals of Plastic Surgery showed 27 percent of patients in one practice had complications including wound infections, fluid collections called seromas, collections of blood under the skin called hematomas and death of fat cells. To help prevent seromas, special tubes are left inside the body, connected to small plastic drains on the outside. The tubes may have to remain in place for as long as three weeks.\n\nSome contouring doesn't work so well the first time around. Gavin Dry, a Seattle plastic surgeon wrote last month in a Plastic Surgery newsletter, \"I have seen a dramatic increase in the number of [surgical] revisions required by massive-weight-loss patients.\" He blamed the rise in do-over surgeries on increased demand for body contouring procedures and surgeons who \"lack adequate experience.\"\n\nBody contouring also leaves long, visible scars: hip to hip, knee to groin, elbow to armpit. \"There's no way to cut out skin without leaving a scar,\" Holland says. \"We can work on improving the scars, improving healing, but we can't eliminate the scars.\"\n\nAfter a long and painful recovery, Baez was left with what she describes as \"huge scars\" on her thighs, extending from \"three inches above the knee all the way to the groin, underneath the buttocks, and the front as well.\" It's a trade-off, she says. \"You trade the scars for the better quality of life.\"\n\nBaez says she couldn't appreciate how much skin was removed from her thighs because, even weeks after the surgery, the scars were \"so red, so puffy -- it was not a pretty outcome.\"\n\nThe cost of contouring can run into the tens of thousands of dollars, depending on how many procedures are needed. Most insurers pay for bariatric surgery, but they often consider contouring to be cosmetic, rather than medically necessary, and thus not covered under their policies.\n\n\"We spend ridiculous amounts of time trying to get this surgery approved by insurance companies,\" says Holland. Only about 25 percent of the cases her department submits get approved.\n\nBaez was initially turned down by her insurer, despite her recurrent infections and open wounds. Baez appealed. \"I knew I had a medical problem,\" she says, along with plenty of pictures to prove it and a thick medical file. Ultimately, she won her case. \"Be prepared for a battle,\" she advises, and \"document, document, document.\"\n\nSeven weeks after surgery, Baez concluded the pain and effort had been worth the result: an end to the recurrent skin infections in her thighs and abdominal folds. Six months out, she remains pleased with her flatter stomach and her better quality of life. She still recalls her reaction when her doctor showed her before-and-after pictures and photos of the skin that had been removed from her stomach. \"Did I really have that much skin?\" \u00b7\n\nRanit Mishori, a family medicine resident at Georgetown University/Providence Hospital, wrote recently for the Health section about the growth in the use of cochlear implants.

He ate a low-fat diet, did yoga, lifted weights and walked three brisk miles a day.\n\nSo mystery and grief hung heavy when he collapsed from a cardiac arrest Jan. 6 inside the Teutonia M???erchor club on the North Side.\n\nFor 15 minutes, the 58-year-old McKees Rocks borough manager was a goner. \"He was dead -- D-E-A-D -- dead,\" said Dr. Jerome E. Granato, Mr. Beck's cardiologist and medical director of Allegheny General Hospital's Coronary Care Unit.\n\nBut in a happy turn of fate, in large part due to a new therapy offered at AGH, Mr. Beck was revived and now is doing amazingly well.\n\nTwo and a half months after his cardiac arrest -- a disease that kills 250,000 people each year -- he has returned to work part-time at McKees Rocks with plans soon to return full time. He is walking 45 minutes each day with plans soon to return to a full hour.\n\nReasons abound for such startling success after an often-fatal episode. He's physically fit. Several people at the club provided quick cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The ambulance service was close by and transported him without delay to AGH only blocks away.\n\nBut most surprising, he shows no diminished mental capacity after being lost to the world for 15 drama-filled minutes. For those who do survive cardiac arrest, brain damage often occurs, doctors say.\n\nWhich brings us to that new therapy at AGH. When Mr. Beck reached the emergency room that Saturday night, doctors gave him what might be described as the big chill.\n\nFor 24 hours, his body temperature was kept at 91 degrees Fahrenheit, which put him in a state of hibernation. That slowed his metabolism and reduced his need for oxygen in his brain and internal organs.\n\nReducing the oxygen need protects the brain and other organs and lowers the incidence of brain, kidney and other organ damage.\n\nIn the emergency room, AGH doctors followed established hospital criteria and inserted a cooling catheter into the femoral vein in his groin area to cool the blood as it pumped bodywide. It caused Mr. Beck's body temperature to drop almost 8 degrees below the normal 98.6.\n\nThroughout the procedure he remained sedated to prevent shivering. He was unaware his body was on ice.\n\nTwo days later, Dr. Granato saw progress in Mr. Beck, even though he eventually had to fight through a serious case of aspiration pneumonia.\n\nHis near full recovery has made him poster man for hypothermia's success in preserving brain and organ function in cardiac arrest patients.\n\nA heart attack can prompt cardiac arrest -- a situation in which the heart rhythm goes chaotic, making it quiver rather than beat, Dr. Granato said. The heart quits pumping blood, leaving vital organs depleted of oxygen -- a situation that can cause significant damage to the brain, kidneys and other organs, or death if quick emergency action is not taken.\n\nBut an electrolyte imbalance caused by dehydration, influenza or other health problems that deplete the system of potassium, magnesium and other minerals also can cause cardiac arrest. That's most likely what happened to Mr. Beck, whose heart arteries were clear. Despite the cardiac arrest, his heart was the picture of health, Dr. Granato said.\n\nDuring a cardiac arrest, he said, all organs are deprived of oxygen for a period of minutes to a half hour. The quivering or chaotic heartbeat, known as fibrillation, must be corrected with an electrical shock via a defibrillator. Once oxygen returns to the brain, further damage can occur.\n\nClinical trials showed a 20 percent increase survival with hypothermia, Dr. Granato said. There are now calls for paramedics to use the cooling procedure in the field en route to the hospital. But an entire institution must adopt the protocol to make it successful.\n\nThe American Heart Association has approved the procedure in the wake of extensive overseas clinical trials.\n\nBut putting the therapy into practice in many hospitals has been slow.\n\nUPMC Presbyterian does about 50 hypothermic therapies a year, said Dr. Clifton Callaway, assistant professor of emergency medicine. He said a doctor at Mercy Hospital also is using the therapy on patients.\n\nOut of every 100 cardiac arrests they respond to, city paramedics succeed in getting 30 to the hospital.\n\nOf those, only seven or eight will be discharged from the hospital, he said. But that number is one or two higher than would occur without hypothermic therapy.\n\n\"We believe the people who do go home have fewer neurological problems that impair the quality of life,\" Dr. Callaway said.\n\nThe percentage increase of survival could translate nationwide into tens of thousands of saved lives each year.\n\nFor now, Dr. Callaway said, there's an upswing in hospitals using the therapy and in two years it will be more routine. City doctors who perform the therapy are collegial in promoting its use.\n\nDr. Ankur Doshi, AGH emergency medical specialist, agreed the brain-protecting therapy \"is a well-established procedure all patients should get if they are in a coma\" after a cardiac arrest.\n\nDr. Ashis Tayal, an AGH stroke neurologist, said trials are under way to use the therapy to help stroke victims.

In other words, even if the dog had been given away for adoption just before the woman gave birth, the healthy microbiome exchange could still take place.\n\nThe study also showed that the immunity-boosting exchange occurred even in three birth scenarios known for reducing immunity, as shown in Kozyrskyj's previous work: C-section versus vaginal delivery, antibiotics during birth and lack of breastfeeding.\n\nWhat's more, Kozyrskyj's study suggested that the presence of pets in the house reduced the likelihood of the transmission of vaginal GBS (group B Strep) during birth, which causes pneumonia in newborns and is prevented by giving mothers antibiotics during delivery.\n\nIt's far too early to predict how this finding will play out in the future, but Kozyrskyj doesn't rule out the concept of a \"dog in a pill\" as a preventive tool for allergies and obesity.\n\n\"It's not far-fetched that the pharmaceutical industry will try to create a supplement of these microbiomes, much like was done with probiotics,\" she said.\n\nThe study, funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Allergy, Genes and Environment Network (AllerGen NCE), was published in the journal Microbiome, along with an editorial in Nature.", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There is no obvious disease mongering here, but the release might plant the suggestion that if readers don\u2019t own a dog and don\u2019t expose their infant to dog-related bacteria, then they may be exposing their children to a greater risk of some form of allergy or even obesity later on.

Yet Dr. Bertin has recently changed the way he talks about medication, offering parents a powerful argument. Recent research, he says, suggests the pills may \u201cnormalize\u201d the child\u2019s brain over time, rewiring neural connections so that a child would feel more focused and in control, long after the last pill was taken.\n\n\u201cThere might be quite a profound neurological benefit,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nA growing number of doctors who treat the estimated 6.4 million American children diagnosed with A.D.H.D. are hearing that stimulant medications not only help treat the disorder but may actually be good for their patients\u2019 brains. In an interview last spring with Psych Congress Network, an Internet news site for mental health professionals, Dr. Timothy Wilens, chief of child and adolescent psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital, said \u201cwe have enough data to say they\u2019re actually neuroprotective.\u201d The pills, he said, help \u201cnormalize\u201d the function and structure of brains in children with A.D.H.D., so that, \u201cover years, they turn out to look more like non-A.D.H.D. kids.\u201d\n\nMedication is already by far the most common treatment for A.D.H.D., with roughly 4 million American children taking the pills \u2014 mostly stimulants, such as amphetamines and methylphenidate. Yet the decision can be anguishing for parents who worry about both short-term and long-term side effects. If the pills can truly produce long-lasting benefits, more parents might be encouraged to start their children on these medications early and continue them for longer.\n\nLeading A.D.H.D. experts, however, warn the jury is still out.\n\n\u201cSometimes wishful thinking gives us hope that the impressive short-term relative benefits of medication over other treatments will persist beyond childhood, but I haven\u2019t seen it,\u201d said James Swanson, director of the Child Development Center at the University of California at Irvine. Dr. Swanson, a co-author of a landmark federally funded study, the Multimodal Treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, said that follow-up research found overall improvement but no greater long-term benefits after three years for children who were treated with medication compared to those who weren\u2019t. One possible reason, as the report noted, was that many children refuse to continue taking medication after a year or so, something most parentsof such children well know.\n\nResearch has shown that the brains of people with A.D.H.D. on average look and function differently than those who don\u2019t have the disorder, particularly when it comes to processing two important neurotransmitters: dopamine and norepinephrine. For most people with A.D.H.D., stimulants can temporarily boost focus, motivation and self-control by increasing the availability of these chemical messengers. The question is whether these effects can last once the drugs have left the bloodstream.\n\nIn arguing for \u201cnormalization,\u201d Dr. Wilens cited a major review in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry in late 2013, which looked at 29 brain-scan studies. Although the studies had different methods and goals, the authors said that, together, they suggested that stimulants \u201care associated with attenuation of abnormalities in brain structure, function, and biochemistry in subjects with A.D.H.D.\u201d\n\nBut other A.D.H.D. experts challenge this conclusion. Dr. F. Xavier Castellanos, director of research at the New York University Child Study Center, called assertions that stimulants are neuroprotective \u201cexaggerated,\u201d adding: \u201cThe best inference is that there is no evidence of harm from medications \u2013 normalization is a possibility, but far from demonstrated.\u201d\n\nA.D.H.D. is an exceptionally controversial diagnosis, with particular controversy zeroing in on researchers, including Dr. Wilens himself and some of the authors of the 2013 report he cited who have received financial support from pharmaceutical firms. In an email, Dr. Wilens said he had not received \u201cany personal income\u201d from the pharmaceutical industry since 2009.\n\nAs several experts noted, a major impediment to determining the long-term impacts of A.D.H.D. medication is that a \u201cgold-standard\u201d study would require researchers to assign children randomly to groups that either received medication or didn\u2019t. Such a practice has been deemed unethical due to the widespread belief that the medication can help struggling children, at least in the short-term.\n\nAnd other research has raised new concerns. One peer-reviewed 2013 study co-authored by Dr. Swanson suggested that the stimulants may change the brain over time so as to undermine the long-term response to the medication and even exacerbate symptoms when people aren\u2019t taking them.\n\nDr. Peter Jensen, the former associate director of child and adolescent research at the National Institute of Mental Health, cautioned that parents should not try to force children with A.D.H.D. to take medication when they don\u2019t want to, adding that \u201cmost kids don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\nDr. Jensen, who now heads the REACH Institute, a national nonprofit organization concerned with children\u2019s mental health, once surveyed 100 parents of sons and daughters in their 20s who had been diagnosed with A.D.H.D., asking what made the most difference.\n\n\u201cEighty percent of them said \u2018Love your child.

Two studies reported nearly 80% of Freespira-treated patients were panic attack free at 12 months post-treatment. Two additional studies reported that patients with mixed anxiety disorders and low exhaled CO2 at baseline were less responsive and/or discontinued treatment with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or Acceptance Commitment Therapy.\n\nEarly data from a fifth study reported on Freespira treatment for patients with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Ninety percent of patients in this study experienced a significant improvement in PTSD symptoms at two months and six months post-treatment.\n\nSymposium Chair David Tolin, Ph.D., Director of Anxiety Disorders Center, The Institute of Living, and Adjunct Professor of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, commented, \"Studies of the Freespira treatment have shown that this innovative approach to treating patients suffering from panic symptoms and panic attacks not only significantly reduces or eliminates these symptoms in approximately 80% of patients, but also results in meaningful reduction in health costs.\"\n\nDebra Reisenthel, CEO of Palo Alto Health Sciences, added, \"Patients with panic symptoms and panic attacks have 3-5 times higher medical costs than patients without panic due to higher utilization of medical resources, including ED visits, physician visits and prescription drugs.\"\n\nFreespira is both easy to use and effective. Once a licensed healthcare provider authorizes the treatment and after a single training session, the patient uses Freespira at home, performing two 17-minute breathing sessions a day over a four-week period, after which the treatment is complete. The peer-reviewed published multi-center Freespira clinical trial, presented by Dr. Tolin, demonstrated that 71% of patients were panic attack free immediately after treatment and 79% of patients were panic attack free 12 months post-treatment.\n\nAbout Freespira\n\nFreespira is an FDA-cleared, drug-free, four-week at-home treatment for panic attacks and other panic symptoms. Treatment is authorized and completed under the supervision of a licensed healthcare provider. Freespira is clinically proven to reduce or eliminate panic attacks and other symptoms of panic disorder, a mental health condition in which debilitating anxiety leads to life-altering avoidance behaviors. Individuals with panic chronically hyperventilate, even when not experiencing a panic attack. This abnormal breathing pattern has been shown to exacerbate attacks. Freespira works by training the patient to stabilize respiration rate and exhaled carbon dioxide levels, which reduces or eliminates panic attacks.\n\nAbout Palo Alto Health Sciences, Inc.\n\nPalo Alto Health Sciences, Inc. is a privately held digital therapeutic company revolutionizing behavioral healthcare with evidence-based, non-invasive, drug-free solutions. Their first product, Freespira, is an FDA-cleared treatment for individuals suffering from panic disorder, panic attacks and other symptoms of panic. In the United States, over 6.7 million adults annually suffer from panic disorder; panic attacks affect a total of 27 million adults in the U.S. every year and are a common component of other anxiety disorders.\n\nFreespira is commercially available throughout the U.S. To learn more, visit http://www.freespira.com or contact info@pahealthsciences.com.", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There was no disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A new study from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden shows that short-course preoperative radiotherapy combined with delayed surgery reduces the adverse side-effects of rectal cancer surgery without compromising its efficacy.

Preoperative radiotherapy was gradually introduced in the early 1990s, with a consequent improvement in prognosis for people with rectal cancer and reduction in the risk of local recurrence.\n\n\"Back then we showed that preoperative radiotherapy reduces the risk of local recurrence by over 50 per cent for patients with rectal cancer,\" says principal investigator Anna Martling, senior consultant surgeon and professor at Karolinska Institutet's Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery. \"Thanks to our results, radiotherapy is recommended to many rectal cancer patients.\"\n\nHowever, radiotherapy can cause adverse reactions and the optimal radiotherapeutic method and the interval between it and the ensuing surgery have been mooted.

Patients in the trial, whose blood sugar levels have remained near normal for five to eight years, take about one-third less insulin than they did before, reducing their risk of hypoglycemia, in which insulin lowers blood sugar to dangerously low levels.\n\nThe experimental treatment, a decades-old generic vaccine for tuberculosis called bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), seems to alter both cellular metabolism and the immune system, said Dr. Denise Faustman of Massachusetts General Hospital, senior author of the study published Thursday in npj Vaccines. \u201cThis cheap, old vaccine is lowering blood sugar to levels never achieved before,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile the results, from only nine patients, must be replicated in a larger study, said Dr. Joseph Bellanti of Georgetown University Medical Center, \u201cif what they found is true, they really have something here.\u201d Bellanti, who was not involved in the research, said the study\u2019s eight-year follow-up and use of a placebo control arm made him \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that two doses of the BCG vaccine \u201ccan decrease levels of A1c,\u201d a measure of blood glucose that predicts the likelihood of serious complications such as stroke and kidney failure.\n\nJDRF (formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation), the Joslin Diabetes Center, and several university diabetes centers all declined to speak about Faustman\u2019s results. She has been a voice in the diabetes wilderness for nearly two decades, angering the establishment diabetes community by pursuing low-tech research very different from more popular approaches, such as embryonic stem cells and immunosupression.\n\nCritics have gone so far as to send letters to newspapers that covered her work apologizing to patients \u201con behalf of Dr. Faustman\u201d for \u201chaving their expectations cruelly raised.\u201d She has also struggled for funding, receiving much of her research support from the private Iacocca Family Foundation, rather than in federal grants.\n\nIn Faustman\u2019s Phase 1 clinical trial, three participants with type 1 diabetes received two doses of BCG vaccine, a month apart. After the vaccine showed signs of effectiveness, an additional six patients were vaccinated five years ago, and 111 more recently. The new paper and a presentation scheduled for a meeting of the American Diabetes Association this weekend focus on the patients who have been followed for more than five years.\n\nAll of those patients who received BCG had a statistically significant change in hemoglobin A1c. A normal level is below 6. In the vaccinated patients, A1c levels fell from an average of 7.36 before the first dose to 6.18 after five years, holding almost steady at 6.65 in the eighth year. In patients receiving a sham injection, levels showed almost no change from their initial levels of 7.10: 7.07 in the fifth year and 7.22 in the eighth.\n\n\u201cWe wanted it to be good, but we didn\u2019t know it would be this good,\u201d Faustman said.\n\nAll of the patients remain on insulin, she said, but less of it. They are also able to monitor their blood sugar less frequently, which can be several times an hour. (The standard of care is a continuous glucose monitor, in which a probe is inserted into the abdomen, plus an insulin pump.) \u201cIf we can gradually move people to where they can control their blood sugar, their minute-to-minute lifestyle can improve dramatically,\u201d Faustman said.\n\nThe A1c reductions could also bring significant health benefits. Every 10 percent drop, research shows, reduces complications such as stroke and heart attack by about one-third. The BCG vaccine lowered A1c levels 9 percent to 16 percent.\n\nThe new paper describes how the BCG vaccine, which has been used for nearly 100 years against tuberculosis and is considered extremely safe, might affect diabetes.

It alters the immune system so as to increase levels of T regulatory cells; T regs keep other immune cells in check, including those that attack the pancreas\u2019s insulin-making cells \u2014 the root cause of type 1 diabetes. In addition, BCG alters metabolism so cells consume higher levels of glucose, drawing more of it out of the blood, in a process called aerobic glycolysis.\n\n\u201cThe clinical effects and the proposed mechanism demonstrated are exciting and add to the emerging consensus that the BCG vaccine can have a lasting and valuable impact on the immune system,\u201d said Dr. Mihai Netea of Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, who was not involved in the study.\n\nA Phase 2 clinical trial of BCG is currently underway at Mass.

Waxman, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of New Mexico who led the revision of the guidelines. \"More testing is not always more intelligent testing.\"\n\nThe change comes amid sharp controversy over new recommendations from a federal task force that women wait until age 50 before they begin having routine mammograms and that women age 50 to 74 scale back to getting the exams routinely every two years.\n\nOfficials said the release of two sets of guidelines in the same week was coincidental, but the new cervical cancer screening recommendations could fuel the firestorm over mammograms, an issue that has become embroiled in the debate over health-care reform. The Obama administration distanced itself from the breast exam guidelines announced Monday by a federal task force, saying the panel does not set government policy or determine what services are covered by the government.\n\nWhite House aides said the political team leading the fight to pass health-care reform first heard about the upcoming report -- which the panel approved in March -- in the past two weeks, and viewed it as one of many potential headaches that opponents could use to attack the reform efforts.\n\n\"There's something about health reform and guidelines that makes people think they're telling women to do less screening to save money,\" said Cindy Pearson of the National Women's Health Network, a Washington-based advocacy group. \"But we don't have any concerns that women are being asked to give up something that is helpful. These recommendations are sound,\" she said.\n\nSeveral experts said a backlash against those guidelines could be less likely because of a variety of factors: There is greater scientific agreement about the risks and benefits of cervical cancer testing than mammography, which involves a less common and less politically charged disease; the changes in the recommendations are less dramatic; and the guidelines were issued by a private medical group and not a government-appointed task force, they said.\n\n\"I can certainly understand why people are concerned about linking these -- it's clear we're going to have to carve billions out of the health-care system,\" said Thomas Herzog, chairman of gynecologic oncology at Columbia University New York Presbyterian Hospital, speaking on behalf of ACOG. \"Where's the money going to come from? But in this case, if anything, we're taking money out of our own pockets.\"\n\nThe American Cancer Society, which has led the opposition to the mammography guidelines issued by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, was involved in the discussions leading up to the Pap test guidelines and will consider them in reevaluating its own recommendations, an official said.\n\n\"We are persuaded that the guidelines are really consistent with the evidence,\" said Robert Smith, the society's director of cancer screening.\n\nThe National Cervical Cancer Coalition, a patient advocacy group, endorsed the recommendations.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story does nothing to exaggerate the prevalence or severity of cervical cancer.

And, when suspected trouble foods were reintroduced into the diet, two-thirds of the children experienced a relapse in symptoms.\n\n\"A strictly supervised restricted elimination diet is a valuable instrument to assess whether ADHD is induced by food,\" wrote the study authors. \"We think that dietary intervention should be considered in all children with ADHD, provided parents are willing to follow a diagnostic restricted elimination diet for a five-week period, and provided expert supervision is available,\" they concluded.\n\nResults of the study are published in the Feb. 5 issue of The Lancet.\n\nADHD is a common childhood disorder, according to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). Children with ADHD have trouble paying attention, focusing and can be hyperactive. Parents have long suspected that sugary foods might be a culprit in inducing symptoms, but there's not a lot of evidence to support this theory, according to the NIMH. However, food additives and preservatives have recently been singled out as possibly having an effect on children's behavior, though the evidence isn't yet conclusive.\n\nSince some children have negative physical reactions to certain foods -- such as eczema, asthma and gastrointestinal problems -- that affect different organ systems, it has been suggested that foods may also affect the brain in a way that results in adverse behavior, according to information in the study.\n\nTo test this theory, the researchers recruited 100 children from Belgium and the Netherlands. The children were between the ages of 4 and 8, and all had been diagnosed with ADHD. Most of the children were boys.\n\nThe children were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group was placed on the restrictive elimination diet, and the other group served as a control group and received advice on healthy eating.\n\nThe restrictive diet began with a diet called the \"few foods diet,\" which includes just rice, meat, vegetables, pears and water. The researchers then complemented this diet with certain foods, such as potatoes, fruits and wheat. The restrictive diet lasted for five weeks.\n\nDuring the next four weeks, kids in the restricted diet group received two food challenge diets, in which certain foods were reintroduced into the diet. The researchers selected foods that were considered both low- and high-IgG foods.\n\nIgG is an antibody made by the immune system that some alternative medicine practitioners believe is linked to food hypersensitivities; however, IgG testing is controversial among many mainstream physicians and even some naturopaths, according to background information in the study.\n\nSome complementary medicine practices test for IgG and recommend eliminating foods high in IgG, explained Dr. Jaswinder Ghuman, who wrote an accompanying editorial in the same issue of the journal.\n\nForty-one children completed the restrictive phase of the diet. Of those, 78 percent had a reduction in their ADHD symptoms, compared with no improvement in the controls. Nine children (22 percent) didn't respond to the diet. On an ADHD symptom scale that ranges from 0 to 72 points, with a higher score indicating more severe symptoms, the average reduction was 24 points, according to the study.\n\nThirty children who had shown a response on the restrictive diet went on to the challenge test. Nineteen of those children had a relapse in symptoms on the challenge test. What's more, it didn't appear to matter if the children with challenged with a low- or high-IgG food.\n\n\"Measuring IgG levels in kids doesn't seem helpful,\" Ghuman said, but it does look as if the elimination diet may help some children.\n\n\"If parents have noticed that a child's behavior seems to get worse with certain foods, it may be worth considering,\" said Ghuman, who is an associate professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at the University of Arizona in Tucson.\n\n\"But, for this diet to work, you have to be very consistent with it, and you have to pay attention to nutrition. It should be done under the supervision of a primary care doctor, and if possible, a dietician,\" she advised.\n\nGhuman said that this study doesn't answer a number of questions, such as whether or not the elimination diet reduces symptoms long-term. And, she added, that clinical practice shouldn't be changed based on the results of one study.\n\nDr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York in New Hyde Park, echoed Ghuman's concerns.\n\n\"Since none of the children stayed on the diet beyond five weeks, it is hard to know if this dietary intervention offers sustained benefit,\" he said, adding, \"Since it is more difficult to enforce restricted diets in older children, this approach may not be suitable for the majority of older children with ADHD.\"\n\nAdesman also pointed out that this study is only applicable to children with ADHD, not to children who had ADD without the hyperactivity component.\n\nLearn more about ADHD from the National Institute of Mental Health.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "This story does not engage in disease mongering.

The additional benefit in terms of body composition came as a surprise for the research team.\n\n\"We were very intrigued by the higher lean mass, the possibility that vitamin D can help infants to not only grow healthy skeletons but also healthy amounts of muscle and less fat,\" said Hope Weiler, one of the study's authors and Director of the Mary Emily Clinical Nutrition Research Unit at McGill University.\n\nFor the first time, a connection was made between the benefits of achieving healthy vitamin D status during a baby's first 12 to 36 months and how muscle mass develops. The researchers achieved this by following up on a 2013 study in which 132 infants in Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, were given a vitamin D3 supplement at one of four different dosages between the ages of 1 month and 12 months.\n\nThe new study confirmed the importance for the development of strong bones of a vitamin D supplement of 400 IU/day during a baby's first year. This amount is in line with current Canadian health guidelines. The researchers found that higher doses did not provide any additional benefit -- at least not in terms of bone development.\n\nBut the body scans used to assess bone density also allowed the team to measure the children's muscle and fat mass. While there were no significant differences in body composition across the different dosage groups, the researchers found children who had vitamin D stores above the threshold recommended by the Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) averaged around 450 grams less body fat at 3 years of age.\n\nVitamin D supplementation is routinely recommended for babies until they can get an adequate amount through their diet. The skin synthesizes vitamin D when exposed to sunlight, making supplementation all the more important where long winters reduce the opportunity for this to happen. In addition, Health Canada advises parents and caregivers to avoid direct sunlight and avoid use of sun block creams in young infants.\n\nFurther analysis also indicated a correlation between lean muscle mass and the average level of vitamin D in the body over the first three years of a child's life. The only other factor found to make a significant difference to the children's amount of body fat was their level of physical activity.\n\n\"Vitamin D supplementation trial in infancy: body composition effects at 3years of age in a prospective follow-up study from Montr\u00e9al\", by T.

To complicate matters, many migraine sufferers can also experience severe bouts of nausea and vomiting.\n\nAnother expert described the problem this way.\n\n\"I've had some patients where the nausea and vomiting was so bad they couldn't even swallow a pill,\" said Nancy Waltman, a nurse practitioner with the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Nursing, Lincoln Division.\n\nA nasal spray is available, as is an injection, but many patients aren't comfortable with these options, Khan and Waltman noted.\n\nKhan said the Zecuity patch is \"simple, efficient and can deliver the exact amount of dosage with minimal variability.\"\n\nThe patch is attached to the upper arm or thigh, and when the patient pushes a button the drug is delivered through the skin. Zecuity, which is battery-operated, delivers 6.5 milligrams of sumatriptan over the course of about five hours and can relieve nausea, as well as reduce sensitivity to light and sound.\n\nNuPathe Inc., which makes Zecuity, hopes to have the patch on the market later this year.\n\nResearch involving 800 patients ultimately led to the approval of Zecuity. One study found that 18 percent of patients using the patch were headache-free after two hours, compared with 9 percent of those using an inactive placebo. About half achieved a reduction in their headache after two hours, compared with 29 percent of those using the placebo.\n\nAnd 84 percent of patients using the patch were relieved of their nausea, compared with 63 percent of those in the placebo group, according to a company news release.\n\nThe most frequent side effects were pain at the site of application along with tingling, itching, warmth and discomfort.\n\nPatients with heart disease or who are using antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors should also be careful when taking sumatriptans, said Waltman, who added that she thought the patches \"are wonderful.\"\n\nOne concern, though, is cost, Waltman cautioned.\n\nIt's not clear how much the patches will cost, but the class of medications known as triptans can be expensive, as much as $300 a month (although sumatriptan now has a generic version), Waltman said.\n\nIn general, though, \"the more options that are available to migraine headache patients, the better,\" Waltman said. \"Migraine patients tend to be underdiagnosed and undertreated and inappropriately treated.\"\n\nNuPathe CEO Armando Anido told Bloomberg News, \"We anticipate the product will be available for sale in the fourth quarter of this year.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Library of Medicine has more about migraines.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "Two thoughts give us pause as we think about this criterion.\nThe story didn\u2019t explore or reference the claim, made by an expert source, that \u201cMigraine patients tend to be underdiagnosed and undertreated and inappropriately treated.\u201d While this pinged on our disease-mongering radar, the available epidemiologic evidence does appear to support this contention. But the story didn\u2019t reference that evidence.\nThe other, broader question is how often migraine suffers need alternatives to pills.

Many studies have documented the lower risk of various cancers among people who eat more fresh produce, and avoid things like red and processed meat.\n\nBut the majority of those studies have focused on adults, and it\u2019s becoming clear that many of cancer\u2019s drivers start early in life, with genes and even with childhood exposures to potential carcinogens.\n\nTo investigate this further, Maryam Farvid, a research associate at Massachusetts General Hospital and a visiting scientist at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, and her colleagues decided to study how diet during adolescence might affect cancer risk. In a study reported in the , they plumbed the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, a massive survey of nurses who filled out questionnaires on their diet and were followed for various health outcomes, including cancer.\n\nAbout half of the 90,000 women who participated in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study also answered questions about their typical diet while they were teens. Those who reported eating nearly three servings of fruit a day on average had a 25% lower risk of developing breast cancer than those who ate half a serving of fruit.\n\nMORE: With Early Breast Cancer Treatment, Less May be More: Studies\n\nCertain fruits seemed to confer the biggest protection against breast cancer \u2014 apples, bananas and grapes were associated with the greatest reduction in risk while kale and oranges in adulthood also contributed to reduced breast cancer risk.\n\nFarvid says that apples, bananas and grapes contain fiber, which could help to lower cancer risk; they are also high in flavonoids, which act as antioxidants to combat damage to cells that can trigger abnormal growth. Kale and oranges are high in vitamin C, another antioxidant.\n\nMORE: Mediterranean Diet With Olive Oil Linked to Lower Breast Cancer Risk\n\n\u201cThis study underscores the importance of what a young girl eats for her future health,\u201d says Farvid. \u201cThis study also has an important message for schools and the need to provide students with the opportunity to consume more fruits and vegetables as part of the school meal program.\u201d\n\nFarvid wasn\u2019t able to document a strong relationship between vegetables and lower breast cancer risk, but says that may be because the study wasn\u2019t powered enough to detect an effect.\n\nThe findings are among the first to look at how diet during adolescence can affect health later, and highlights the importance of establishing healthy habits from a young age, especially since many of the chronic diseases occur over many years and get rooted early in life.\n\nThe results also underscore the importance of eating whole fruit, rather than fruit juice. In the study, Farvid and her team could not find any significant relationship between fruit juice and breast cancer risk; that may be because fruit\u2019s anti-cancer effects may have to do with the fiber found in the whole fruit, which is stripped out of juice. In the latest Dietary Guidelines for Americans, however, government nutritionists equated servings of whole fruit with fruit juice. \u201cWe recommend whole fruit and not fruit juice,\u201d says Farvid, \u201cbecause maybe one of the most important ways that fruit decreases risk of breast cancer is through fiber, and even natural fruit juice often has no fiber in it.\u201d\n\nIn another study also published in the , a separate group of researchers found that among 22,000 Danish women, those who added two alcoholic drinks a day on average increased their risk of developing breast cancer by 30% over five years. The added risk of cancer, however, was counterbalanced by a lower risk of heart disease.\n\nTaken together, the results show how critical diet can be in modulating risk of breast cancer. While challenging, changing diet can be a relatively easy way to alter a woman\u2019s breast cancer risk equation, beginning even at a young age.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering here.", "answer": 1}]
