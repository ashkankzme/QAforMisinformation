[{"article": "Boston, MA-- The investigational drug abaloparatide-SC (subcutaneous) may help increase bone mineral density in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and reduce their risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures, new industry-sponsored research suggests. The results of the pre-specified subgroup analysis within the ACTIVE clinical trial will be presented Friday, April 1, at ENDO 2016, the annual meeting of the Endocrine Society, in Boston.\n\nAccording to lead study author Felicia Cosman, MD, osteoporosis specialist and Medical Director of the Clinical Research Center at Helen Hayes Hospital, Senior Clinical Director of the National Osteoporosis Foundation and Professor of Medicine at Columbia University, who is a consultant to Radius Health, Inc., in Waltham, Massachusetts, \"Abaloparatide-SC increased bone mineral density in both the spine and hip and reduced the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures consistently in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis regardless of their baseline patient characteristics, including age, bone mineral density, and whether or not they had prior fractures.\"\n\nThe researchers investigated patients enrolled in the randomized, double-blind, comparative, multicenter international phase 3 ACTIVE trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 80 micrograms of abaloparatide-SC in preventing fractures in otherwise healthy, ambulatory, postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Osteoporosis was defined broadly, using both BMD criteria as well as recent history of nonvertebral fracture and confirmed prevalent vertebral fracture on x-ray. Overall, 2,463 patients between 49 and 86 years of age were randomized to one of three treatment arms for 18 months: double-blind 80 micrograms of abaloparatide-SC, blind-matched placebo, or open-label 20 micrograms of subcutaneous teriparatide (an FDA-approved prescription drug known to increase bone density and strength).\n\nAt 18 months, abaloparatide-SC significantly increased bone mineral density from baseline at the lumbar spine by 9.2%, the total hip by 3.4% and the femoral neck by 2.9%, compared with placebo. Abaloparatide-SC also reduced new vertebral fractures by 86%, nonvertebral fractures by 43%, clinical fractures by 43%, and major osteoporotic fractures by 70% compared with placebo after 18 months of treatment. The drug also reduced major osteoporotic fractures by 55% compared with teriparatide and increased bone density to a greater extent in the hip region compared with teriparatide.\n\nThe authors found that the risk of new vertebral or nonvertebral fractures dropped consistently among the participants taking abaloparatide-SC, irrespective of their baseline risk factors; and they found an increase in bone mineral density by abaloparatide in each of the baseline risk subgroups.\n\nThe data suggest that abaloparatide appears to be an effective treatment for a broad group of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.\n\nThe study was funded by Radius Health, Inc.\n\nEndocrinologists are at the core of solving the most pressing health problems of our time, from diabetes and obesity to infertility, bone health, and hormone-related cancers.

The mammogram advice led some Republicans to predict that such recommendations would lead to rationing.\n\nSenator Tom Coburn, a Republican from Oklahoma who is also a physician, said in an interview that he would continue to offer Pap smears to sexually active young women. Democratic proposals to involve the government more deeply in the nation\u2019s health care system, he said, would lead the new mammography, Pap smear and other guidelines to be adopted without regard to patient differences, hurting many people.\n\n\u201cThese are going to be set in stone,\u201d Mr. Coburn said.\n\nSenator Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Democrat and longtime advocate for cancer screening, said in an interview: \u201cAnd this Pap smear guideline is yet another cut back in screening? That is curious.\u201d Mr. Specter, who was treated for Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma in 2005 and 2008, said Congress was committed to increasing cancer screenings, not limiting them.\n\nRepresentative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, said that the new guidelines would have no effect on federal policy and that \u201cRepublicans are using these new recommendations as a distraction.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaking such arguments, especially at this critical point in the debate, merely clouds the very simple issue that our health reform bill would increase access to care for millions of women across the country,\u201d she said.\n\nThere are 11,270 new cases of cervical cancer and 4,070 deaths per year in the United States. One to 2 cases occur per 1,000,000 girls ages 15 to 19 \u2014 a low incidence that convinces many doctors that it is safe to wait until 21 to screen.\n\nThe doctors\u2019 group also felt it was safe to test women less often because cervical cancer grows slowly, so there is time to catch precancerous growths. Cervical cancer is caused by a sexually transmitted virus, human papillomavirus, or HPV, that is practically ubiquitous. Only some people who are exposed to it develop cancer; in most, the immune system fights off the virus. If cancer does develop, it can take 10 to 20 years after exposure to the virus.\n\nThe new guidelines say women 30 and older who have three consecutive Pap tests that were normal, and who have no history of seriously abnormal findings, can stretch the interval between screenings to three years.\n\nIn addition, women who have a total hysterectomy (which removes the uterus and cervix) for a noncancerous condition, and who had no severe abnormalities on previous Pap tests, can quit having the tests entirely.\n\nThe guidelines also say that women can stop having Pap tests between 65 and 70 if they have three or more negative tests in a row and no abnormal test results in the last 10 years.\n\nThe changes do not apply to women with certain health problems that could make them more prone to aggressive cervical cancer, including H.I.V. infection or having an organ transplant or other condition that would lead to a suppressed immune system.\n\nIt is by no means clear that doctors or patients will follow the new guidelines. Medical groups, including the American Cancer Society, have been suggesting for years that women with repeated normal Pap tests could begin to have the test less frequently, but many have gone on to have them year after year anyway.\n\nDebbie Saslow, director of breast and gynecologic cancer for the American Cancer Society, said professional groups were particularly concerned because many teenagers and young women were being tested and then needlessly subjected to invasive procedures.\n\nIn addition, Dr. Saslow said, doctors in this country have been performing 15 million Pap tests a year to look for cervical cancer in women who have no cervix, because they have had hysterectomies.\n\nDr. Carol L. Brown, a gynecologic oncologist and surgeon at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, said the new guidelines should probably not be applied to all women, because there are some girls who begin having sex at 12 or 13 and may be prone to develop cervical cancer at an early age.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned that whenever you send a message out to the public to do less, the most vulnerable people at highest risk might take the message and not get screened at all,\u201d Dr. Brown said.\n\nDr. Kevin M. Holcomb, an associate professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital, said that when he heard the advice to delay Pap testing until 21, \u201cMy emotional response is \u2018Wow, that seems dangerous,\u2019 and yet I know the chances of an adolescent getting cervical cancer are really low.\u201d\n\nAs with the new mammogram recommendations, women may not readily give up a yearly cancer test.\n\n\u201cFor people who\u2019ve been having the testing regularly every year, it\u2019s a big emotional change to test less frequently and there\u2019s this fear of \u2018Oh my gosh, I might be missing something,\u2019 \u201d said Ivy Guetta, 49, of Westport, Conn., who plans to continue with annual Pap tests. Ms. Guetta has three daughters, ages 17, 14 and 8, and at the moment, she would not encourage them to wait until they turn 21.\n\nJen Jemison, 24, a legal assistant from Babylon, N.Y., said she thought she began getting Pap smears when she was about 18, but said that if she had been aware that the procedure for treating precancerous lesions could lead to premature births, she would have waited until she turned 21.\n\nOn the other hand, Ms. Jemison said that now that she is over 21, \u201cI would still go every year\u201d for the Pap test.\n\n\u201cOne of my cousins had cervical cancer, so that\u2019s in my head too,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d rather get it checked out regularly than have to worry about that.\u201d", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story adequately compares the two guidelines. \nBut it failed to compare the options\u2013and consequences to patients\u2013of getting screened and not getting screened.\u00a0 ", "answer": 0}, {"article": "THURSDAY, April 14, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- In the latest research to test the concept of an artificial pancreas for the management of type 1 diabetes, British researchers report that they were able to improve blood sugar control and reduce the risk of dangerous low blood sugars overnight.\n\nAn analysis of pooled data showed that the overall time that plasma glucose levels were in target \"increased by a median 28 percent\" with the artificial pancreas, said the study's lead author Roman Hovorka, a principal research associate at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom.\n\nHovorka's team is one of several working to produce an effective artificial pancreas, also known as a closed loop system or closed loop delivery.\n\nAn artificial pancreas combines existing diabetes management technology -- insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors -- with a sophisticated computer algorithm that tells these devices what to do when blood sugar levels are rising or falling.\n\nThe closed loop insulin delivery system, for example, computes insulin doses and administers them according to glucose levels detected by a sensor. The hope is that an artificial pancreas will closely mimic the way the human pancreas normally releases insulin in response to food or stress.\n\nAn effective artificial pancreas has the potential to vastly improve the lives of people with type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. The autoimmune attack destroys so many beta cells that someone with type 1 diabetes can no longer produce the insulin the body needs.\n\nInsulin is a hormone that's essential for the body to use sugar as fuel. Without replacement insulin, people with type 1 diabetes couldn't survive. But, replacing insulin isn't easy.\n\nWhile too little insulin can be deadly, too much insulin can also cause serious problems, and in the worst case, coma and death. Replacing insulin is a delicate balancing act, requiring constant blood sugar monitoring.\n\nPrevious research suggests that in a 24-hour period, the average person with type 1 diabetes spends about 10 hours with blood sugar levels too high, and about an hour a day with blood sugar levels too low, according to Aaron Kowalski, assistant vice president for treatment therapies at the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.\n\nThe current study included 24 people with type 1 diabetes and challenged an artificial pancreas prototype in two different real-life scenarios. The first trial was meant to mimic a night of eating at home, while the second trial was designed to simulate an evening out, including drinking alcohol, which can unpredictably lower blood sugar levels.\n\nFor the eating-in portion of the randomized study, 12 of the study volunteers were assigned to consume a medium-sized meal (60 grams of carbohydrates) at 7 p.m., and then another half were placed on the artificial pancreas program during the night, while the other half maintained their standard insulin pump therapy. Several weeks later, the participants came back for another meal and switched overnight regimens.\n\nThe second arm of the trial simulated a meal out. The other 12 volunteers were given a larger meal (100 grams of carbohydrate) at 8:30 p.m., and were dispensed white wine along with their meal. As with the other trial, half were managed with the artificial pancreas while the others used conventional insulin pump therapy.\n\nBoth groups were monitored twice overnight in each study.\n\n\"For the eating-in scenario, overnight closed loop delivery increased the time plasma glucose levels were in target by a median 15 percent,\" said Hovorka. For the eating out scenario, the average time good blood sugar control was increased was 28 percent on average. And, when combined, the average increase in blood sugar control was 22 percent, according to the study.\n\nOf greater concern to most people with type 1 diabetes is the ability to avoid low blood sugars while they're sleeping. The study found no serious low blood sugar events after midnight. There were four instances of severe hypoglycemia, but the researchers attributed three of them to insulin administered prior to the start of the study in the evening.\n\nResults were published online in the British Journal of Medicine on April 14.\n\nAlthough an accompanying journal editorial noted that the artificial pancreas is still \"in its infancy,\" some experts were cheered by the findings.\n\n\"This study is more good news, and we're seeing an evolution of more and more sophistication in this closed loop study,\" said Kowalski. \"What we're doing now is pressing these systems in real situations with the goal of getting to the next step of testing at home,\" he added.\n\nHovorka said his team is working on developing a home trial now, and hopes to begin home trials by the end of the year.\n\nLearn more about type 1 diabetes from the Nemours Foundation.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "There was nothing in the story about current treatment approaches for reducing the risk of renal failure.

Cut It Out (Surgically)\n\nAt 32, it just didn't make sense that Daniel Sheiner was exhausted literally from the moment he woke up. \"It didn't get any better over the course of the day, and I knew that was not normal,\" Sheiner says.\n\nSheiner is a software designer and programmer. His job suffered as a result of his fatigue.\n\n\"I would miss conversations,\" Sheiner says. \"I would ask a question that had already been answered.\"\n\nSheiner suspected he had sleep apnea because it ran in his family. But he was not overweight, which is the biggest risk factor for the disorder \u2014 some 60 percent to 90 percent of patients diagnosed with apnea have a body mass index, or BMI, over 28.\n\nA sleep study confirmed Sheiner had one of the worst cases of apnea his doctors had ever seen. After trying a number of different treatments, his doctors finally tried a surgery using robots to treat his stubborn apnea \u2014 with positive results.\n\nAccording to Erica Thaler, an ear, nose and throat surgeon at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Sheiner's sleep study found that he woke up about 112 times every hour. That meant Sheiner stopped breathing for at least 10 seconds about two times every minute.\n\nSleep apnea is a chronic and common sleep disorder. People with this condition stop breathing while sleeping.\n\nLike Sheiner, they often find themselves suddenly and repeatedly gasping for breath during the night. Their airway is clogged, sometimes because their tonsils and tonsilar tissue in the back of their throat are enlarged.\n\nThis was exactly the case for Sheiner.\n\n\"Daniel's obstruction was both at the level of the soft palate and at the back of the tongue,\" Thaler says. \"He had very large tonsils, but his tonsil tissue was also enlarged in the palate area and also at the back of his tongue.\"\n\nSheiner was put on a nighttime breathing machine. In bed he wore a face mask, which was connected to a tube that was connected to a device that pumped air into his nose and mouth.\n\nThe Continuous Positive Airway Pressure machine, or CPAP, as it is often referred to, works for about half of all patients who try it. It can be cumbersome, Thaler says.\n\nBut Sheiner was extremely committed to trying it. In fact, he tried a number of different types of machines, but none of them worked.\n\nSo Thaler suggested a type of robotic surgery currently used to remove cancerous tumors at the back of the throat. Thaler was starting to perform it on sleep apnea patients, to remove tonsils and excess tissue.\n\n\"What the robot allows you to do is get into a small, confined space without using hands,\" Thaler says. \"Human hands are huge, and robot hands are tiny, and yet they can do exactly the same thing if you control them remotely.\"\n\nSo, about a year ago, Thaler performed surgery on Sheiner, removing both his tonsils and excess tissue. Sheiner is one of only about a half-dozen patients to have this robotic surgery for apnea.\n\nAfter surgery, Sheiner says, \"it was a whole new life.\" He had energy, an ability to focus and get things done. \"I find myself solving problems much more quickly and more confidently.\"\n\nHe's exercising at the gym three times a week, lifting weights. He is also starting to experiment with recipes and cooking, something he had absolutely no energy or interest in doing before the surgery.\n\nSurgery Not For Everyone\n\nThe surgery Sheiner had isn't right for everyone. Rashmi N. Aurora is a sleep specialist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. She is also chairwoman of the Standards of Practice Committee of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.\n\n\"I wouldn't send a middle-age obese man for surgery as their first option,\" Aurora says. \"I would say let's lose the weight; let's use CPAP and see a nutritionist; let's avoid the alcohol and let's see how you do.\" The apnea can probably be taken care of with these noninvasive techniques, she says, and invasive surgery can be avoided.\n\nBut when she sees a young, thin person with severe apnea, Aurora says, surgery might be the answer.\n\n\"The upper airway starts with the nose and mouth and runs down to the vocal chords, so there's a lot of room for obstruction to occur,\" Aurora says. Some patients may require surgery to remove the uvula or the tonsils or excess tissue, or all of them, she says. Then, there's surgery to remove blockage in the nasal passage.\n\nOftentimes, Aurora says, patients need a series of surgeries to completely treat apnea. And even then, success rates aren't high; they're effective only 20 to 30 percent of the time.\n\nThe only surgery proved effective more than 90 percent of the time is a significant and highly invasive surgery. Maxillomandibular advancement, or MMA, involves literally slicing the jaw in half and moving it forward in order to widen the patient's airway.\n\nFor patients with recessed chins, small jaws and airways narrowed by facial structure, this might be the surgery for them. But it can take nearly a year to recover, and many patients opt not to have it.\n\nThe \"new\" CPAP machines are more sophisticated, Aurora says. They're less cumbersome, less noisy and can actually \"sense\" the magnitude of blockage and adjust air pressure being blown into the nose or mouth, she says. Noninvasive measures are always the first lines of defense, she says.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "Gold stars for NPR finding someone to talk knowledgeably about the alternatives and risks.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - People who took a newer type of pain pill over a three-year period were less likely to develop polyps that could lead to colorectal cancer \u2014 but at the expense of a higher risk of heart problems, new study findings report.\n\nAnd when participants stopped taking the pain pill Celebrex (celecoxib) out of concerns over side effects, they eventually developed more polyps than people who had remained on an inactive, or placebo, drug throughout the study.\n\nSo should people concerned about their risk of colorectal cancer consider Celebrex?\n\n\u201cThe findings in this study don\u2019t necessarily make that decision any easier,\u201d said Dr. Andrew Chan of Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, who did not participate in the research.\n\nThe study, published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, received financial support from Pfizer, which sells Celebrex.\n\nThis is not the first study to suggest Celebrex and similar drugs \u2014 known as COX-2 inhibitors - may reduce the risk of developing colon cancer, he said, but people need to balance that potential benefit with the higher risk of cardiovascular complications.\n\nAs a result, he said he suspects most people would choose to rely on regular colonoscopies to catch the disease in its early stages, rather than take a potentially risky drug for years.\n\nBut to people who have no underlying cardiovascular problems and a particularly high risk of colon cancer - they were diagnosed with it before perhaps, or have a strong family history - regular screening may not be enough, Chan noted.\n\n\u201cSo for those patients, they might consider taking a drug like this,\u201d he said.\n\nColorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in men and women, and strikes 1.2 million people each year.\n\nOther research has provided signs that COX-2 inhibitors, which block the COX-2 enzyme that causes inflammation, could also prevent colorectal cancer, as well as lung cancer in heavy smokers.\n\nHowever, most COX-2 inhibitors ran into safety issues a few years after their approval, and now only Celebrex remains on the U.S. market. At a cost of several dollars per day, depending on dosage, it is much more expensive than older pain relievers such as ibuprofen.\n\nDuring the study, Dr. Nadir Arber of Tel Aviv University and his colleagues reviewed data collected from 1,561 people with a history of colorectal cancer. More than half had received Celebrex for approximately 3 years, before concerns over the increased risk of cardiovascular problems caused researchers to discontinue the study.\n\nThe scientists then followed the people willing to continue the research for another 2 years, noting who developed new polyps, including advanced polyps with features that suggest they\u2019re more likely to become cancerous. Approximately half of the people who started the study agreed to continue.\n\nNot surprisingly, Celebrex users were more likely to develop cardiovascular problems, including a 66 percent higher risk of serious cardiac disorders. But over the total 5-year period, people who took Celebrex were also less likely to develop new and advanced polyps than people who took a placebo.\n\nSpecifically, new polyps were found in 58 percent of people on placebo, and only 51 percent on Celebrex.\n\nHowever, during the 5th year of the study alone, after the trial had been over for 2 years, 27 percent of Celebrex users developed new polyps, versus only 16 percent of people who had been on placebo - translating to a 66 percent higher risk among those who previously took Celebrex. Those who had been on Celebrex were also more likely to develop advanced polyps during that final year.\n\nThis rebound in risk actually makes biological sense, Chan told Reuters Health. If COX-2 inhibitors protect against colon cancer by blocking an enzyme pathway, when that blockage is released, the disease could occur \u201cpotentially at higher levels than had you never been on the drug in the first place,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, the results are \u201cvery promising,\u201d Arber told Reuters Health by e-mail, adding he is now working to identify people who could benefit from the drug without experiencing the side effects.\n\nOnly half of the people who originally agreed to participate in the study remained after 5 years, and it\u2019s unclear how this might affect the results, noted Chan, whose own research suggests aspirin could prevent deaths from colorectal cancer.\n\nHowever, for a study that lasts this long, \u201cthose are acceptable numbers,\u201d noted Arber.\n\nIf patients asked him whether they should take celecoxib to prevent colorectal cancer, Arber would tell them \u201cno,\u201d he added. \u201cThey should speak with their doctor.\u201d", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story notes that most people should rely on colonoscopies to find colorectal cancer in its early stages rather than take a risky drug to prevent it.

But on Oct. 23, the F.D.A. granted authority for the drug to be used in emergencies for patients hospitalized with H1N1 flu who cannot take or do not benefit from Tamiflu or Relenza.\n\nBefore that, peramivir had been available only through a more cumbersome \u201ccompassionate use\u201d procedure. Of the 32 patients who received the drug that way, 29 were still alive, BioCryst said in late October.\n\nAlthough there are still questions about peramivir\u2019s true effectiveness, some critics say the government moved too slowly to make the drug available, and that even now, access is too restricted. For each patient, doctors must call an 800 number or fill out a form on a Web site run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

While some clinical trials showed the drug had an effect in resolving flu symptoms, others did not show statistically significant differences between peramivir and either a placebo or Tamiflu.\n\nThe question for both investors and federal authorities is how much more of the drug BioCryst can sell. So far, the order has been far less than some investors had hoped, though the price of the order announced Thursday was higher than expected.\n\nDr. Lurie, the federal official, said there had been 237 requests to use the drug since the emergency use authorization was granted nearly two weeks ago. Many doctors want to provide the treatment for 10 days instead of the recommended 5, she said, so the 10,000 courses the government ordered might actually treat as few as 5,000 patients.\n\nThe government has the right to buy up to 30,000 more treatment courses at the same price.\n\nBioCryst says it will have perhaps 40,000 more treatment courses available within a few weeks, and a total of 120,000 by the end of the year.

Stonehouse, the company\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview Thursday.\n\nShionogi, a Japanese drug company with licensing rights from BioCryst, ran its own clinical trials and this week applied for approval to sell the drug in Japan as a treatment for everyday flu, in competition with Tamiflu.\n\nBut in the United States, BioCryst plans to try to win approval for treatment only of hospitalized patients. It is now beginning phase 3 trials \u2014 the last stage before seeking F.D.A. approval.\n\nVirtually all the money to develop the drug comes from $180 million in grants from the Department of Health and Human Services. Yet the company gets to keep as profit anything it makes from selling the drug to the federal government or to other governments. Mr. Stonehouse defended the price of the drug, saying it would save the health system money by getting patients out of intensive care earlier. \u201cThe cost of being in the I.C.U. and on a ventilator is extremely high,\u201d he said.\n\nBut peramivir will soon have competition. The federal government said late Thursday that it had also ordered 10,000 treatment courses each of intravenous versions of Tamiflu and Relenza, with options to buy 30,000 more courses of each.\n\nThose drugs could not be used, however, until they received emergency use authorizations from the F.D.A.\n\nThe government is paying an average of only $450 a course for those other drugs \u2014 only one-fifth of what it is paying for peramivir.\n\nRight now, Dr. Lurie said, peramivir is the only drug that can be used intravenously so the government had to pay a high price. \u201cI would say that one of the things that happens in the market when you have competition is that the price drops.\u201d", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "\n\n\nThe story makes clear that the approved antiviral flu drugs are Tamiflu and Relenza.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A commonly-prescribed multiple sclerosis (MS) infusion medication linked to a rare but serious side effect is safer to use when dosing intervals are extended, according to a new study led by MS specialists NYU Langone Health.\n\nThe new research showed that extending dosing of natalizumab from every 4 weeks to every 5 to 12 weeks significantly reduced the risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare but potentially fatal brain infection.

Patients who test JCV antibody-positive are typically either told to not to start natalizumab, or have had treatment stopped after two years, when risk was deemed to be too high.\n\nThe new study, however, reports safety data through up to 72 months, or 6 years, when the extended dosing regimens were applied, with risk reduction for PML as high as 94 percent.\n\nResearchers reviewed data on all patients who have been exposed to JCV who are enrolled in TOUCH, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-mandated Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program for natalizumab that requires manufacturers to document all uses of a medication to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. Since the optimal extended dose schedule is not known, researchers chose to look at the data in multiple ways, with the primary definition looking at extended dose history in the last 18 months, the secondary definition looking at extended dose occurring at any time in the dosing history, and for tertiary definition looking primarily at how extended dose history affects PML risk. The results showed clinically and statistically significant risk reductions with all definitions.\n\nThe new study did not look at drug efficacy comparing extended to standard doses. However, previous research led by Dr. Zhovtis-Ryerson's group found extending the dose up to 8 weeks did not negatively affect the medication's efficacy in a retrospective sample of 2,000 people. The authors are planning prospective efficacy studies of extended dose natalizumab.\n\nNatalizumab is manufactured by Biogen Idec and Elan, and sold under the name Tysabri\u00ae. Biogen provided the researchers access to their data and statistical support.\n\nOther infusion disease-modifying therapies approved to treat MS include the drugs alemtuzumab and ocrelizumab. Oral and injectable medications are also prescribed.\n\nThe study was carried out in collaboration with Biogen and academic collaborators from NYU School of Medicine's Division of Biostatics, University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, and Rocky Mountain Multiple Sclerosis Clinic in Utah.\n\nIn addition to Dr. Zhovtis-Ryerson, Ilya Kister, MD, associate professor of neurology, Judith D.

The medication used in the FAME 2 trial consisted of a combination of aspirin, cholesterol-lowering and blood pressure-lowering drugs as required by current treatment guidelines.\n\nPCI is a minimally-invasive procedure where modern stents - small tubular metal scaffolds coated with medication - are inserted into an artery using a small catheter to widen a narrowed blood vessel in the heart. PCI is commonly used to treat sudden blockages of a coronary artery that cause a heart attack. In situations where the heart's arteries narrow less suddenly and do not cause a heart attack but induce chest pain during exercise - a condition known as stable coronary artery disease - it has remained unclear whether PCI in addition to medication was better than medication alone in preventing future heart attacks.\n\n\"Currently, the standard practice in North America is to prescribe medication to patients with stable coronary artery disease and avoid PCI,\" said Dr. Peter J\u00fcni, Director of the Applied Health Research Centre (AHRC) at the Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute of St. Michael's Hospital, who is a senior author on the study. \"Our results pose the question: Would a large portion of patients benefit from early PCI in addition to medication?\"\n\n\"We used pressure measurements inside the heart arteries to find coronary arteries that should be widened,\" said Dr. Bernard De Bruyne, an interventional cardiologist at the Cardiovascular Center Aalst in Belgium and the Principal Investigator of the trial. \"With these measurements we were able to identify patients who would benefit from PCI in addition to medication.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization reports that every year, 17.7 million people die from cardiovascular diseases, which is an estimated 31 per cent of all deaths worldwide. Coronary artery disease is the most common type of heart disease in North America and Europe, and is a serious health problem worldwide. It occurs when the coronary arteries become narrow and hardened due to the build-up of cholesterol rich plaques in the blood vessels. While the FAME 2 trial showed that PCI reduced urgent hospital admissions and revascularizations and likely reduced heart attacks, it did not provide evidence for a difference between PCI and medication alone in the prevention of deaths.\n\nThe trial was initially sponsored by St. Jude Medical, a global medical device company, until the three-year follow-up. The subsequent two years of follow-up have been academically driven, organized the by the academic steering committee of the study. Nineteen sites across Europe and North America participated in the five-year follow-up.\n\n\"Our trial over its entire follow-up shows us that the longer you observe these patients, the more pronounced the benefits of the initial PCI become,\" said Dr. J\u00fcni, who is also a Canada Research Chair and a Professor of Medicine at the University of Toronto.\n\nWhile Drs. J\u00fcni and De Bruyne agree there is more research to be done using modern PCI technology, this five-year follow-up offers evidence that PCI has the potential to provide long-term benefits to patients with stable coronary artery disease.\n\nThe FAME 2 trial was supported by St. Jude Medical.

So much metformin is taken in the United States \u2014 some 72 million prescriptions were written for it in 2013 \u2014 that a recent study found higher trace levels of it (presumably from the urine of people taking it) in Lake Michigan than of any other drug, including caffeine.\n\nBut Price, a science and medical reporter in Oakland, Calif., doesn\u2019t have Type 2 diabetes. She has Type 1, the far less common form of the disease, which requires lifelong treatment with insulin, to compensate for her body\u2019s failure to produce enough of the hormone. However, she had read studies indicating that metformin combined with insulin might help Type 1 diabetics, too. Moreover, the drug was being studied in clinical trials as a way to lower the risk of cancer, heart disease and dementia \u2014 not just for diabetics, but for everyone.\n\nFor Price, there was yet another possible benefit \u2014 as a treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome, an endocrine disorder that doctors thought might explain the difficulty she and her husband had had conceiving.\n\nSure enough, a month and a half after she had started taking metformin pills and even as she was enjoying the benefits of better blood-sugar control, Price became pregnant, eventually giving birth to a girl.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still taking metformin along with my insulin,\u201d said Price, 36, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes 14 years ago. \u201cI remember eating Mexican food one night, which can be a potential disaster for people with diabetes because of the carbs, but I noticed I needed only two-thirds to a half of the insulin I normally needed.\u201d\n\nSynthesized in the 1920s, metformin was first approved for treatment of Type 2 diabetes in the United Kingdom in 1958. It took until 1995 to get approval in the United States after a potentially fatal disorder linked to a similar drug was found to be rarely if ever associated with metformin.\n\nUnlike insulin shots, which help Type 1 diabetics break down sugar and starches in the blood, metformin lowers blood-sugar levels primarily by squelching the liver\u2019s tendency to release stored-up sugar into the bloodstream. Keeping that extra sugar (actually a form of sugar called glucose) out of the blood helps to maintain normal blood-sugar levels, thereby preventing such long-term complications as blindness, kidney failure and lower-limb amputation.\n\nAbout 29 million people in the United States have diabetes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 90 percent of them have Type 2, in which their bodies slowly fail to respond to normal levels of insulin, forcing their pancreas to produce so much that it\u2019s eventually exhausted. The estimated 2.5 million with Type 1, in contrast, lose their ability to produce insulin, usually within a matter of months, due to an autoimmune attack by the body on itself.\n\nToday, the range of ailments being targeted by metformin, a prescription drug sold under such names as Glucophage, Glumetza, Fortamet and Riomet, all share one characteristic: They are diseases related to aging.\n\n\u201cMetformin actually lowers the rate of cell turnover,\u201d said Michael Pollak, who has been studying metformin\u2019s effects on pancreatic cancer as chairman of oncology at McGill University in Montreal. \u201cIt makes cells divide less quickly. The rate-of-living theory defines aging as the number of cell divisions you undergo since you were a fertilized egg. If the theory is true, then people who age more gracefully have a slower rate of cell division. The question is whether the rate-of-living theory is operational in mammals.\u201d\n\nPollak says that none of the most exciting possible benefits for the drug have yet been proved in randomized clinical trials of non-diabetics. For now, the evidence suggesting benefits is limited to large studies of diabetics that have found, on average that those who take metformin tend to have lower rates of cancer, heart disease and dementia, and to live longer overall than those who take other drugs for diabetes. Those effects have also been seen in animal studies. But such evidence often does not pan out in human studies.\n\nAt a medical meeting in May, Pollak reported disappointing results from his first randomized, placebo-controlled trial of metformin for people with pancreatic cancer. \u201cIt yielded no benefit,\u201d he said. \u201cPlain old metformin given in the same dose as we do for Type 2 diabetes doesn\u2019t seem to be a breakthrough for cancer, at least for pancreatic cancer.\u201d\n\nMany other metformin clinical trials are underway for breast, colorectal, endometrial and other cancers.\n\nFor heart disease, the benefit of metformin over most other drugs for Type 2 diabetics has been seen repeatedly in clinical trials. For people without diabetes, only one study has been published, finding no apparent effect after 18 months. As with cancer, however, other studies are underway.\n\nFor dementia, which people with Type 2 diabetes have double the risk of developing compared with non-diabetics, metformin has been found in a number of studies to cut that risk substantially.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of excitement about metformin and dementia,\u201d said Rachel Whitmer, an epidemiologist at Kaiser Permanente in California.\n\nIn 2013, Whitmer presented the results of a study of about 15,000 people newly prescribed a medication for Type 2 diabetes: By the end of the five-year study, those who received metformin had a 40 percent lower risk of having developed dementia than those prescribed sulfonylureas, another common type of diabetes drug.\n\nBut, Whitmer notes, \u201cI don\u2019t think the story is complete. There needs to be more work in this area with all drugs for diabetes.\u201d\n\nFor Type 1 diabetes, researchers at the University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine published a study in May in which they added either a low dose of metformin or placebo pills to the insulin regimen of 74 adolescents. Those who received metformin lost weight \u2014 generally a benefit for those with diabetes \u2014 and needed less insulin after six months. Those who received the placebo needed more insulin than at the beginning of the study and saw their blood pressure rise. The one goal the study did not achieve was better blood-sugar control.\n\n\u201cThere is some benefit, but it wasn\u2019t the full benefit we hoped for,\u201d said Helen Nickerson, senior scientific program manager at JDRF, formerly known as the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, which partly funded the study. Even so, she said, she is hearing from doctors that growing numbers of them are prescribing metformin along with insulin to patients with Type 1 diabetes.\n\nNo one would suggest that a person with Type 1 diabetes stop taking their insulin. Doing so would be life-threatening. For those with Type 1, metformin is being tested only as an add-on to insulin.\n\nJDRF, meanwhile, is funding a clinical trial to see if metformin will reduce the risk of heart disease in people with Type 1, and it is funding a trial in Britain to see if the drug will prevent children from developing Type 1 in the first place.\n\nTerry Wilkin, a professor of endocrinology and metabolism at the University of Exeter, is leading the prevention trial. He theorizes that the risk of developing Type 1 rises when excess demand for insulin is placed on the pancreas in children who are even slightly overweight. His study will give low daily doses of metformin to children who are at high risk of developing Type 1.\n\n\u201cIf we can even slightly lower their average blood sugar with metformin,\u201d Wilkin said, \u201cI believe we can have a big benefit on their risk of developing Type 1.\u201d\n\nDespite all these potential benefits of metformin \u2014 and despite a recommendation from the American Diabetes Association that it be tried before any other drug for newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetics \u2014 a recent study found that only about half of all such people get metformin as their first prescribed medication. The study does not explain why that might be. Among the possibilities, experts say, are that newer drugs are being pushed heavily in direct-to-patient advertising and that some patients are turned off by the common though mild side effect of metformin \u2014 stomach upset and diarrhea \u2014 which can usually be avoided by starting on a low dose.\n\nThe author of the study, Niteesh Choudhry, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, also found that newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetics who start on metformin are the least likely to need an additional diabetes drug later.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that physicians and patients are not always choosing to start on metformin,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are legitimate reasons to put patients on one drug rather than another.

Lead author Stacey Kenfield, ScD, of UCSF, and a team of researchers at UCSF and Harvard, focused on this variant of prostate cancer to determine if exercise, diet and smoke-free status might have life-saving benefits.\n\nIn the study, published today, Nov. 17, 2015, in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, the researchers analyzed data from two U.S. studies: the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study that tracked more than 42,000 males ages 40 to 75, from 1986 to 2010; and a second, the Physicians' Health Study that followed more than 20,000 males ages 40 to 84, from 1982 to 2010.\n\nTo gage the effects of lifestyle habits, the researchers developed a score based on the results of the health professionals survey, then applied it to the physicians' study. They assigned one point for each affirmative response to questions about regular intense exercise that induced sweating, body mass index (BMI) under 30, tobacco-free status for a minimum of 10 years, high intake of fatty fish, high intake of tomatoes and low intake of processed meat.\n\nTo reduce error, participants had to be free of diagnosed cancer at the start of the study and a four-year lag was imposed to rule out those who unknowingly had lethal prostate cancer, which was determined by evidence of 'prostate cancer death or metastasis to the bones or other organs, excluding the lymph nodes.' Cases were confirmed through medical records and pathology reports, and cause of death was determined by death certificate and medical record, and secondarily by next of kin.\n\nThe researchers identified 576 cases of lethal prostate cancer in the health professionals' group and 337 cases in the physicians' group. Participants with 5 to 6 points in the health professionals' group had a 68 percent decreased risk of lethal prostate cancer and a 38 percent decreased risk was observed in the physicians' group for the same comparison. For dietary factors alone, men with three points, versus those with zero points, had a 46 percent decreased chance of developing lethal prostate cancer in the health professionals' group. In the physicians' group this decrease was 30 percent.\n\nWhile there were fewer cases and less detailed data collected in the physicians' study, the score was similar in both populations, indicating the potential benefit of healthy lifestyle habits in warding off lethal prostate cancer, said the authors.\n\n\"We estimated that 47 percent of lethal prostate cancer cases would be prevented in the United States if men over 60 had five or more of these healthy habits,\" said Kenfield, assistant professor in the Department of Urology at UCSF Medical Center, and formerly of the Department of Medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, where the study was initiated.\n\n\"It's interesting that vigorous activity had the highest potential impact on prevention of lethal prostate cancer. We calculated the population-attributable risk for American men over 60 and estimated that 34 percent of lethal prostate cancer would be reduced if all men exercised to the point of sweating for at least three hours a week,\" Kenfield said.\n\nThe researchers also calculated that lethal prostate cancer among American men over 60 would be cut by 15 percent if they consumed at least seven servings of tomatoes per week and that 17 percent would be spared this diagnosis if they consumed at least one serving of fatty fish per week. Reducing intake of processed meats would cut the risk by 12 percent, they reported. In contrast, the population-attributed risk for smoking was 3 percent, largely because the majority of older American men are long-term nonsmokers.\n\n\"This study underscores the ongoing need for more effective prevention measures and policies to increase exercise, improve diet quality and reduce tobacco use in our population,\" said senior author June M. Chan, ScD, from the departments of Urology, and Epidemiology and Biostatistics at UCSF. \"It takes co-operation and effort from multiple areas, like insurance companies, employers, policy makers and city planners, to figure out how to creatively support and encourage more exercise into most busy adults' working day. These lifestyle habits align with other recommendations to prevent diabetes and heart disease.\"\n\nAbout one man in seven will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during his lifetime, making it the most frequently diagnosed cancer in the United States, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, in 2015 there will be approximately 220,800 cases of prostate cancer and approximately 27, 540 deaths.\n\nThis study was supported by grants from the Prostate Cancer Foundation and the National Institutes of Health.\n\nCo-authors are Erin Van Blarigan, ScD, of the departments of Urology, and Epidemiology and Biostatistics at UCSF; Howard Sesso, ScD, MPH; Edward Giovannucci, MD, ScD; Meir Stampfer, MD, DrPH, and Julie Batista, ScD, all of Harvard T.H.

After their weight had stabilized, each participant followed one of three different diets for four weeks. Participants were fed food that was prepared for them by diet experts. The dieters were admitted to the hospital four times for medical and metabolic testing.\n\nThe diets had the same number of calories, but the fat, protein and carbohydrate content varied. Those diets:\n\u2022A low-fat diet which was about 20% of calories from fat and emphasized whole-grain products and fruits and vegetables.\n\u2022A low-carb diet, similar to the Atkins diet, with only 10% of calories from carbohydrates. It emphasized fish, chicken, beef, eggs, cheese, some vegetables and fruits while eliminating foods such as breads, pasta, potatoes and starchy vegetables.\n\u2022A low-glycemic index diet, similar to a Mediterranean diet, made up of vegetables, fruit, beans, healthy fats (olive oil, nuts) and mostly healthy grains (old-fashioned oats, brown rice). These foods digest more slowly, helping to keep blood sugar and hormones stable after the meal.\n\nFindings, published in this week's Journal of the American Medical Association: Participants burned about 300 calories more a day on a low-carb diet than they did on a low-fat diet. \"That's the amount you'd burn off in an hour of moderate intensity physical activity without lifting a finger,\" says senior author David Ludwig, director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Children's Hospital.\n\n\"Participants burned 150 calories more on the low-glycemic index diet than the low-fat diet. That's about an hour of light physical activity,\" he says.\n\nThe reason for the low-carb advantage is unclear, he says.\n\n\"We think the low-carb and low-glycemic index diets, by not causing the surge and crash in blood sugar, don't trigger the starvation response. When the body thinks it's starving, it turns down metabolism to conserve energy,\" he says.\n\nThe authors note a downside to the low-carb diet: It appears to raise some risk factors for heart disease.\n\nLudwig says that restricting carbohydrates over the long term may be hard for many people. If you're trying to lose weight, \"you can get a jump start with a low-carb diet, but over the long term, a low-glycemic index diet may be better than severely restricting carbohydrates.\"\n\n\"The low-glycemic index diet seems to be the happy medium,\" says Cara Ebbeling, associate director of the Obesity Prevention Center. \"It didn't slow metabolism as much as the low-fat diet, and it didn't seem to have some of the negative effects on cardiovascular disease risk.\"\n\nOn a low-glycemic index diet, you would avoid highly processed carbs such as white bread, white rice, many snack foods, prepared breakfast cereals, sugary desserts and sugary beverages, she says.\n\nExperts had different responses to the findings.\n\nGeorge Bray, an obesity researcher at Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge who has also studied this topic and who wrote the accompanying editorial in JAMA, says that other studies \"show that you can do well on any diet as long as you stick to it. Adherence is the major key for weight loss and maintenance. There is no magic in any diet.\"\n\nEric Westman, a Duke University researcher who has conducted several studies on the low-carb diet and is co-author of The New Atkins for a New You, says this study documents that the \"lower the carbohydrates, the better the metabolic effects. People burn more calories if they eat fewer carbohydrates.\"\n\nMarion Nestle, a nutrition professor at New York University, says longer studies conducted among people in their own environments, not with such controlled meals, have shown \"little difference in weight loss and maintenance between one kind of diet and another.\" More research is needed to show that interesting results like these are applicable in real life, she says.\n\n\"In the meantime, if you want to lose weight, eat less.\"", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The focus of the story was on different dietary approaches to weight loss.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "MONDAY, Dec. 17, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- For patients whose high blood pressure cannot be controlled despite taking several medications, a short burst of radio waves at the nerves around the kidneys may do the trick, a small new study says.\n\nThe treatment was effective for at least six months. The findings could be a significant step in treating people with resistant hypertension, which is a major risk factor for heart attack and stroke, the researchers said.\n\nThe technique -- called catheter-based renal denervation -- is minimally invasive. In it, doctors use a catheter inserted through the artery in the groin, which sends radio waves burning away nerve tissue around the arteries that feed the kidneys.\n\nThe procedure destroys nerves that help control and filter salt in the body and may be overactive in patients with high blood pressure. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved its use.\n\nThe study was funded by medical device maker Medtronic. The findings were published Dec. 17 in the journal Circulation.\n\n\"This is a very promising approach for managing medication-resistant hypertension,\" said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a spokesman for the American Heart Association and professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\n\"High blood pressure is a major contributor to heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and [kidney] failure,\" said Fonarow, who was not involved in the study. \"Despite the availability of a number of effective medications, many patients with hypertension have not achieved adequate control of their blood pressure. There is thus an important, but currently unmet, need for additional therapies to effectively control hypertension.\"\n\nFor the study, an international team lead by Dr. Murray Esler, professor and senior director of the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne, Australia, assigned 35 patients to renal denervation and compared them to 47 patients who had already had the procedure.\n\nAll the patients suffered from drug-resistant hypertension. Their systolic blood pressure -- the top number in a blood-pressure reading -- remained dangerously high at 160 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) or above despite having taking three or more drugs to control blood pressure, the researchers noted.\n\nEsler's team found that more than 83 percent of those who had denervation treatment before had a drop in systolic blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg after six months and almost 79 percent maintained the reduction at 12 months.\n\nThe 35 patients in this phase of the study had similar results to the initial group. Almost 63 percent of these patients saw a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg or more six months after treatment.\n\nFonarow noted: \"In all, reductions in systolic blood-pressure levels on the order of 25 to 30 mmHg were achieved and maintained without any loss in efficacy.\"\n\nThe procedure is safe as well as effective, the study authors said.\n\n\"Participants' kidneys were not damaged or functionally impaired,\" Esler said in a journal news release. \"We also found no ill effects on long-term health from the procedure.\"\n\nWhether this technique might be useful in treating less severe high blood pressure hasn't yet been tested. If it is applicable, it could mean patients need not take blood-pressure drugs, Esler suggested.\n\nAnother expert, however, said that scenario is likely overoptimistic.\n\n\"Hypertension is a hard disease to treat because there are so many things that go into getting blood pressure under control,\" said Dr. Varinder Singh, chairman of cardiology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"There's lifestyle and diet, there is getting to the right doses of medications, there are adherence issues. So anything that will help patients get their goals is exciting.\"\n\nEven with this technique, people will most likely still have to take blood-pressure medications, Singh said. \"You may have to take less medication and you may have to take lower doses of medication, but we all expect that patients will still have to take some medication,\" he said.\n\nSingh also noted that although this procedure is used in other countries it is not yet approved in the United States.\n\nFonarow added: \"While this study demonstrates that renal denervation provides sustained reduction of blood pressure up to one year and appears safe, additional studies with longer-term follow-up are needed.\"\n\nAccording to the American Heart Association, more than 78 million adults in the United States have high blood pressure, which is blood pressure higher than 140/90 mmHg.\n\nAmong these adults, about 9 percent have resistant hypertension, which means that even taking three or more medications to control their blood pressure, it remains higher than 140/90 mmHg.\n\nTo learn more about hypertension, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The independent expert quoted provided important reminders about \u201cso many things that go into getting blood pressure under control\u201d \u2013 lifestyle, medications, adherence, etc.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "\u201cThere\u2019s really no precedent for another drug that does this,\u201d said Dr. Matthew R.

So it cannot be completely ruled out that XL184 somehow stopped bone growth without killing the cancer. However, Dr. Smith said he doubted that was the case because there were signs the drug also controlled tumors outside the bones.\n\nDrugs now used to treat advanced prostate cancer, like Taxotere, do not have much affect on bone scans, Dr. Smith said. Bone drugs like Zometa from Novartis and denosumab from Amgen can protect cancerous bones from fractures, but have not been shown to fight the cancer itself.\n\nAnother investigator in the trial, Dr. David C. Smith of the University of Michigan, said he could not believe it when the bone scan of one patient, who previously had widespread cancer in his bones, came back completely clean.\n\n\u201cI thought they had scanned the wrong person,\u201d said Dr. Smith, who is not related to the doctor in Massachusetts. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this.\u201d\n\nExelixis will now add many prostate cancer patients to the midstage clinical trial from which the results were drawn, said Michael M.

The drug was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in April after a clinical trial showed that those getting the drug had a median survival of about 26 months, four months longer than those in a control group.\n\nSome critics say Medicare would not be doing a review of a drug already approved by the F.D.A. were it not for its high cost.\n\n\u201cOne has to wonder if today\u2019s meeting is about something other than science, namely the cost,\u201d Brad Loncar, an investor in Dendreon whose grandfather died of prostate cancer, told the Medicare Coverage Advisory Committee on Wednesday.\n\nDr. Louis Jacques, director of the coverage and analysis group at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said cost was not a factor and that the agency had reviewed products approved by the F.D.A. in the past.\n\nDr. Jacques said he ordered the review after being contacted by federal lawmakers questioning why their constituents could not get the drug. He realized that reimbursement by regional Medicare contractors was inconsistent, so he decided the agency should have a uniform national policy.\n\nThe Medicare Coverage Advisory Committee, which met in Baltimore, did not discuss the cost of Provenge or make a coverage recommendation. It reviewed the clinical trial data and then rated the strength of the data on a scale of 1 to 5.\n\nThe 10 voting members, mainly doctors and health policy experts, averaged 3.6 on the question of how much confidence they had that there was adequate evidence to conclude that Provenge significantly prolongs survival.\n\nThat is between 3, which is intermediate confidence and 5, which is high confidence. But some analysts said that should be enough for reimbursement. Trading in Dendreon shares, halted during regular market hours, rose 6 percent after hours.\n\nHowever, the panel gave very low scores to evidence that the drug would help prostate cancer patients other than the type who participated in the clinical trial, which were men with advanced cancer, but no or minimal symptoms. That could give Medicare grounds for denying payment when the drug is used off-label, as cancer drugs often are.\n\nMedicare is scheduled to put a proposed decision out for comment by March 30, with a final decision around the end of June.\n\nProvenge has stirred passions since the F.D.A. initially declined to approve it in 2007. Some Dendreon investors and prostate cancer patients staged protests and advertising campaigns and sued the F.D.A. Two doctors who had spurred investor wrath by voting against the drug\u2019s approval at an advisory committee meeting attended a major cancer conference accompanied by bodyguards.\n\nMedicare\u2019s review has drawn hundreds of comments, mostly in favor of coverage.

Using this threshold in routine practice could potentially double the number of patients suitable for immediate discharge directly from the emergency department, say the authors.\n\n\"Until now there were no quick ways to rule out a heart attack within the emergency department,\" explains lead author Dr Anoop Shah from the University of Edinburgh in the UK. \"We have identified a cardiac troponin concentration (less than 5 nanograms per deciliter; <5 ng/L) below which patients are at very low risk of heart attack either during the admission or in the ensuing 30 days. These patients are therefore potentially suitable for immediate and safe discharge from the emergency department. These findings could dramatically reduce unnecessary hospital admissions and provide substantial cost savings for healthcare providers.\"[2]\n\nOne of the most common causes of hospitalisation worldwide is acute chest pain. In the UK alone, chest pain is responsible for around 1 million visits to the emergency department every year. International guidelines recommend that individuals presenting with chest pain are admitted to hospital for testing for very high levels of troponin (above the 99th percentile)--a sign that a heart attack has occurred. Current approaches for assessing patients with suspected heart attacks either require admission into hospital or lengthy stays in the emergency department for repeat testing. Until now, whether new high-sensitivity cardiac troponin tests could identify very low-risk patients who may be suitable for immediate and safe discharge from the emergency department was unknown.\n\nThe test used in this study is more sensitive than the standard version and can detect far lower levels of troponin in the blood. Using this test, troponin levels were measured in over 6000 patients with chest pain admitted to four hospitals in Scotland and the USA. Dr Shah and colleagues prospectively evaluated the negative predictive value (the probability that patients were not at risk) of heart attack or subsequent death from a heart condition after 30 days for a range of troponin concentrations.\n\nThe researchers found that a troponin threshold of <5 ng/L at presentation identified around two-thirds (61%) of patients at very low risk of heart attack and may have been eligible for early, safe discharge--with a high negative predictive value of 99.6%. This high negative predictive value persisted irrespective of age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, or prior cardiovascular disease. At one year, these patients had a three times lower risk of heart attack and cardiac death than those who had troponin levels 5 ng/L or higher.\n\nAccording to Dr Shah, \"Over the last two decades the number of hospital admissions due to chest pain has tripled. The overwhelming majority of these patients do not have a heart attack. This study shows that low plasma cardiac troponin concentrations at presentation identify up to two-thirds of patients who are at very low risk of heart attack and could be safely discharged from the Emergency Department. Use of this approach is likely to have major benefits for both patients and healthcare providers.\"[2]\n\nWriting in a linked Comment, Louise Cullen and William Parsonage from the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Queensland, Australia, and Martin Than from Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand, say, \"The ultimate validation for the safety and efficacy of discharging patients with cardiac troponin concentrations less than 5 ng/L will be the report of clinical outcomes after this threshold is implemented in routine clinical practice...Finally, what further assessment, if any, is needed for those patients identified as low risk and suitable for early discharge? Trials are needed to assess the safety and effectiveness of clinical pathways that involve no further testing for such patients.\"\n\nThis study was funded by the British Heart Foundation and Chief Scientists Office (Scotland).\n\n[1] A troponin test measures the level of troponin proteins in the blood. These proteins are released when the heart muscle has been damaged, like during a heart attack. The more damage there is to the heart, the greater the amount of troponin there will be in the blood. Even a slight increase in the troponin level will often mean there has been some damage to the heart. Very high levels of troponin are a sign that a heart attack has occurred.\n\n[2] Quotes direct from author and cannot be found in text of Article.", "question": "Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The release does a pretty good job of comparing current troponin tests with more sensitive one used for the current study.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Morristown, N.J., Aug. 7, 2017 - As we age, managing healthy weight may become more difficult due to a slowing metabolism, however, help may come from a fiery source -- the capsicum pepper.

The research group plans to treat four more patients with CLL before moving into a larger Phase II trial.\n\n\u201cWe put a key onto the surface of the T-cells that fits into a lock that only the cancer cells have,\u201d said Dr. Michael Kalos, director of translational and correlative studies at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Perelman School of Medicine and an investigator on the study.\n\nThe results provide \u201ca tumor-attack roadmap for the treatment of other cancers,\u201d including those of the lung and ovaries as well as myeloma and melanoma, researchers said.\n\nThe findings were published simultaneously Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine and Science Translational Medicine.\n\nKalos said past efforts to use the technique, known as \u201cadoptive T-cell transfer,\u201d failed either because the T-cell response was too weak or proved too toxic for normal tissue.\n\nThe technique differs from other cancer therapies designed to harness the body\u2019s own immune system to fight tumors \u2014 such as therapeutic cancer vaccines.\n\n\u201cWe are saying forget about stimulating an immune response. We are going to give you an immune response,\u201d Kalos said.\n\nThe treatment appears safe, but researchers said more study was needed. The leukemia patients in the Phase I trial had to be treated with an immunity-boosting drug since the targeted molecule, CD-19, is also present on certain normal immune-system cells.\n\nTo deliver the gene therapy, the researchers used a virus that can only infect cells once. It was used to carry a chimeric antigen receptor targeting CD-19 coupled with receptors for two other components of T-cell activity.\n\nAbout two weeks after the gene therapy, patients began to experience \u201ctumor lysis syndrome\u201d \u2014 chills, nausea and fever \u2014 caused by the break-down products of dying cancer cells.\n\nThe engineered T-cells were detected in patients\u2019 blood for several months afterward, and a portion of them turned into \u201cmemory T-cells,\u201d which could provide ongoing protection against cancer recurrence, researchers surmised.\n\nDr. Walter Urba of the Providence Cancer Center in Portland Oregon cautioned that continued presence of activated T-cells and memory cells might be more of a problem in other types of cancer where toxic effects on normal tissue could be more severe.\n\nIn addition, the long-term viability of the treatment is still unknown.\n\n\u201cOne of the big questions is ... will those persistent T-cells continue to work and prevent that tumor from coming back,\u201d said Urba, who was not involved in the study.\n\nAll of the funding for the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s gene therapy work has come from the academic community, but the work is expensive.\n\n\u201cWe are looking for corporate partners as we head into Phase II trials,\u201d Kalos said.\n\nFurther study will show whether the latest results \u201creflect an authentic advance toward a clinically applicable and effective therapy or yet another promising lead that runs into a barrier that cannot be easily overcome,\u201d Urba said in an NEJM editorial.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "We were surprised to see no mention of radiation, chemotherapy or bone marrow transplants in this story.

This was the first time a portable device was used for these tests. The results show the device accurately indicated reduced electrical activity in the retina in multiple cell layers in the participants who had schizophrenia, including in cell types that had not been studied before in this disorder.\n\n\"Schizophrenia is a devastating disorder, probably the most disabling disorder long term. Although we know quite a bit about it, it's still not that well understood,\" said Steven Silverstein, professor of psychiatry at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and director of research at Rutgers University Behavioral Health Care (UBHC), who designed the study. \"Our study should help generate further research into developing a test that clinicians - like psychologists, psychiatrists or nurses - can use in their offices to diagnose, treat and monitor the condition of people with schizophrenia.\"\n\nLooking at biomarkers in the eye as a way to understand psychiatric disorders is a new field of study.\n\n\"Since the retina is part of the nervous system, what is happening in the retina is likely reflective of what is occurring in the brain,\" Silverstein said. \"For example, we know that certain changes in the retina, like thinning tissue [due to cell loss] or weakening electrical activity, occur alongside loss of brain tissue and reduced brain activity in patients with neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. We and other researchers are now investigating whether retinal changes are related to brain structure and function changes in schizophrenia.\"\n\nIn the just-published study, the researchers evaluated 50 participants: 25 with schizophrenia and 25 with no diagnosed psychiatric disorder. In the test, the participants closed one eye and placed the other against the RETeval device, which flashed 10 to 20 white or colored lights of various intensity against a white or colored background. A tiny skin electrode was placed on the skin under the eye to record the retina's electrical activity. The participants were tested in normal light and after sitting in the dark for 10 minutes to assess activity in different types of retinal cells. Most individual tests were completed within two minutes.\n\n\"Since many of our participants were experiencing severe psychiatric symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, we wanted to use a test that was as noninvasive and quick as possible,\" Silverstein said.\n\n\"While the portable device clearly distinguished people with schizophrenia from those without a psychiatric diagnosis, it's too soon to call this a diagnostic tool,\" said lead author Docia Demmin, a graduate assistant in UBHC's Division of Schizophrenia Research and a doctoral student in Rutgers Department of Psychology. \"However, since every prior study has found that people with schizophrenia exhibit reduced retinal wave forms and slowed retinal responses, our research shows that we closing in on an accurate test that is faster, less invasive, inexpensive and more accessible to patients.\"", "question": "Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "There was no discussion of how schizophrenia is diagnosed currently, which involves a checklist of symptoms such as delusions, incoherent speech, hallucinations, hearing voices, cognitive problems, or a flattening of emotions that hang on for months.

But Tirpak's physician, Dr. Mary Laughlin, turned to something deemed medical waste until recently: umbilical cord blood.\n\nCord blood is rich in stem cells and easier to match than adult bone marrow because the immune cells are not developed. Also, patients can get the treatment in about three weeks -- as opposed to six to eight for bone marrow from an adult donor, said Laughlin, founder and medical director of the Cleveland Cord Blood Center.\n\n\"That can be a critical time interval for a patient who is in remission,\" she said, noting that doctors often fear a patient's relapse while awaiting the transplant.\n\nTraditionally, patients with leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma have first tried to find an adult bone marrow donor either from a close relative or from a national bone marrow registry. But the registry's more than 12 million donors meet the needs of only about 60 percent of Caucasians in the United States and only 5 to 15 percent of minorities, who are underrepresented. Even siblings are not a sure thing, with the chance of matching a brother or sister only 25 percent.\n\nNathan Mumford, who is African-American, tried to find a bone marrow donor after his leukemia was diagnosed not long after he graduated from college.\n\n\"We went through that process, and nobody had a match. Siblings are the best matches. My brother or my sister wasn't a match. My friends, aunts, uncles, cousins, nobody was a match. So, couldn't go that route,\" Mumford said.\n\nAt that point, Mumford said, his choices were to continue chemotherapy and live for, maybe, another year and a half. Or he could try a cord blood stem cell transplant.\n\n\"That was an opportunity,\" said Mumford, who survived Hodgkin's disease as a child. \"That was a chance for me to live. I'm not a quitter. I've never been a quitter, so I wasn't going to quit.\"\n\nMumford received a cord blood stem cell transplant in November 2004. In such transplants, patients have chemotherapy, radiation or both to kill the cancer cells and to suppress the immune system so that the new stem cells are not rejected. Then, the stem cells are injected into the patient's body and travel to the bone marrow cavities, where they create new, healthy marrow. Mumford, who's now 30, says he's never felt better.\n\n\"I just feel amazing,\" he said. \"I have a lot of energy, and I'm just excited about it.\"\n\nMumford lives in Cleveland and runs the Karen E. Mumford Foundation. The nonprofit, named for his mother, who died of breast cancer while he was being treated, provides emotional and financial assistance to cancer patients.\n\nTirpak and Mumford represent a growing number of patients taking advantage of stem cells from cord blood, which can be used in patients with leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma. Cord blood transplants among unrelated donors have risen from 1 percent in 2001 to 24 percent last year, Laughlin says.\n\nNationally, more than 200 hospitals accept cord blood donations. Parents must decide before birth whether to bank a child's cord blood. If they do, it's collected immediately after birth, processed, registered in a national database and kept frozen. If collected and stored for private use, the procedure can cost as much as $2,000 or more, plus annual storage fees.\n\nPublic blood banks collect and store the cord blood free of charge. Those parents get their own child's blood unless it has already been given out as a match for someone else. In that case, other matching blood is made available free of charge.\n\nCord blood stem cell transplants have the same risks as adult bone marrow transplants: the new blood rejecting the host, called graft-versus-host disease. And patients still must endure months of recovery. Well worth it, say Mumford and Tirpak, who received her stem cell injection two years ago.\n\n\"Such a tiny few drops of blood cells really give new birth to people,\" Tirpak said.\n\nOn Saturday, her husband, Jake, finally wore the suit he had been saving for his wife's funeral -- at a family wedding.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story mentions ways in which cord blood donation is superior to or no worse than adult bone marrow transplant.

She picked up a handset, grasping one buzzer in each hand, closed her eyes, and the session began.\n\nThe room was quiet. Through the headphones, Henn heard an alternating tone \u2014 first in the right ear, then the left, back and forth. The handset buzzed in synchrony, right-left-right-left, part of a trauma treatment that also involves recalling painful memories. She turned her thoughts to the day her brother, Nate, died.\n\nNate Henn had been visiting relatives and working with Invisible Children, a nonprofit in Kampala, Uganda. On July 11, 2010, he was at a sports complex with friends, enjoying the broadcast of a World Cup soccer match, when terrorists struck. Nate was only 25 when shrapnel from a bomb ended his life.\n\n\u201c \u2018Your brother\u2019s dead, and you need to come home to take care of your mom,\u2019 \u201d she remembered her father saying. With those simple words, her brother was gone \u2014 and she felt compelled to take control in the ensuing chaos. Henn, who had been visiting her boyfriend in Chapel Hill, immediately returned home to Raleigh, N.C.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t stop for the first week after Nate died,\u201d she said.\n\nThe ordeal didn\u2019t end with the news of Nate\u2019s death. Her other brother, Kyle, rushed home from Delaware to be with the family. But the private plane carrying him crashed the next day in nearby Chapel Hill. The pilot was killed and the co-pilot was seriously injured, but Kyle survived.\n\n\u201cAnd then the media storm went crazy,\u201d Henn said. The family already had received inquiries from journalists about Nate\u2019s death; Kyle\u2019s brush with death only intensified the interest of media outlets from Philadelphia to Raleigh.\n\n\u201cIt made it so much worse,\u201d Henn said. At age 20, she began functioning as the family spokeswoman. \u201cI felt like I had to protect my family from all of it,\u201d she said. She occupied herself with press inquiries and funeral arrangements. But after the whirlwind passed, unaddressed grief remained with her.\n\nWhen a person experiences trauma, the associated memories can remain as vivid and urgent as on the day the event happened. The brain perceives the trauma as happening in the present and reacts accordingly, even in safe situations.\n\nWhen Henn\u2019s traumatic memories of her brother\u2019s violent death were triggered, they \u201cpopped\u201d and glowed in her mind as if they were being shown on a projector screen.\n\n\u201cAll these memories around me started playing like a video loop,\u201d Henn said. Her body remembered the sensations vividly: the heat and discomfort of the summer day, the pain of her high heels as she delivered the eulogy at the funeral.\n\nHenn did cognitive behavioral therapy \u2014 a form of conventional talk therapy \u2014 for five years.\n\n\u201cIt helped me realize feelings were normal,\u201d she explained, and that she was not weak for reeling from the tragedy. \u201cBut I never felt like I was getting over it.\u201d Random memories could send her spiraling into panic and fear. Talk therapy helped her manage those attacks, but it didn\u2019t address the root cause.\n\nHenn was initially diagnosed with a condition known as complicated grief; she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder only last year. She was surprised. She had thought of PTSD as an affliction of soldiers and others directly involved in horrendous events \u2014 not of people like her, suffering from the ripple effects of a bombing in Uganda.\n\nIt was Kyle Henn, recovering from his own PTSD after surviving the plane crash, who recommended eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy, or EMDR.\n\nPsychologist Francine Shapiro developed EMDR in 1987. Three years later, she founded the EMDR Institute, which has trained more than 100,000 practitioners.\n\nSome therapists use sounds from headphones during a session. Others use eye movement, moving a finger or object back and forth as the patient follows, eyes moving left to right and back again. Others employ a bar on which small bulbs light up from one side to another.\n\nPatients follow the light or object with their eyes or listen to the alternating tone while thinking about a specific traumatic memory or series of memories. They describe the memories to the therapist, who gives guidance as needed.\n\nThe idea is that reliving the memories helps remove the sting and that the urgency of the memories can be reduced as the brain begins to move them from short-term to long-term memory. The sound or the eye movement is supposed to activate both sides of the brain in an imitation of REM sleep, when the brain usually converts short-term memories into long-term recollections.\n\nStudies have found benefits to EMDR. But there is debate about whether the eye movement makes a difference, said Stephen Holland, founder of the Capital Institute for Cognitive Therapy and co-author of the textbook \u201cTreatment Plans and Interventions for Depression and Anxiety Disorders.\u201d \u201cThe question is whether stimulation adds to it.\u201d He does not use it in his practice because he considers it no more effective than cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\nBrynne Henn, who lives in the District, began seeing a licensed clinical psychologist who practices EMDR last September. In Gail Kalin\u2019s office, nestled in a tree-shaded apartment building in Northwest Washington, Henn confronted the trauma that still haunted her.\n\nThe techniques associated with EMDR may merely have a placebo effect, some psychologists say. In early sessions, Henn focused on the headphones and handset; they helped distract her from the terror of reliving the traumatic events surrounding her brother\u2019s death, she said. This distraction had a positive effect on her, she said, allowing her to dive deeply into the therapy without freezing in the face of fear.\n\nSome insurance plans cover EMDR. Henn\u2019s does not; she pays for the sessions out of pocket.\n\nHenn, who is a communications associate at a Washington research institution, was initially very skeptical of EMDR.\n\n\u201cIt is so weird,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I first got there and she hands me these two paddles that vibrate in my hands, and then [I] put on these giant headphones \u2014 I was, like: What is this, a hearing test? What are we doing?\u201d\n\nBut Henn was encouraged by the progress she made. \u201cI started getting really interested in it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy is my brain coming up with this? What in the world are you doing to me, that this is what I came up with?\u201d Henn was surprised by the vivid memories \u2014 some of which she hadn\u2019t known existed \u2014 that resurfaced after so much time had passed.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter to her whether research supported EMDR; what mattered was whether it worked for her. Each time a particularly painful memory resurfaced, Henn said, \u201cyou have to go through it again until it has no meaning.\u201d By confronting the trauma head-on, she added, it became less powerful.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s integrating what\u2019s stuck in time,\u201d explained Kalin, the psychologist. Memories formed under the adrenaline of trauma are never put to rest, she said. \u201cEMDR processing is untangling the knot.\u201d\n\nOnce the memories are processed, therapists say, they are less vivid \u2014 less like the film reel Henn would see in her mind. Henn was able to recall processed memories without feeling panic.\n\nEMDR\u2019s central appeal lies in the possibility of closure \u2014 an end to PTSD, and to therapy for it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to come out equipped with tools to take care of myself,\u201d Henn said. She already has put these tools to the test: Two months after she started EMDR, terrorists hit Paris, killing at least 130 people.\n\nSoon after that attack, she heard reports that a video, possibly from the Islamic State, contained a threat to hit Washington next, and she had a \u201cfull-fledged panic attack,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI was not sure where I was; I was sweating profusely but also really cold,\u201d she said. She stepped onto the 11th-floor terrace at work and looked down.\n\n\u201cThe thought came into my head: \u2018I just need to walk off, and that will wake me up,\u2019 \u201d Henn remembered. \u201cAnd I had enough awareness that I sat myself down and was trying to think of calming breaths and going back and forth\u201d \u2014 actions reminiscent of EMDR processing.\n\n\u201cIt took a while, and it was a little terrifying that I had that thought,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the process of being able to calm myself down was much better than anything I had been equipped with before.\u201d\n\nIn a few weeks, Henn mentioned to Kalin, she would be marrying her college sweetheart. Beneath the excitement, she felt a twinge of panic: How would she react to her brother\u2019s absence from the wedding? She asked a close friend to write a speech from Nate\u2019s point of view, as if he were speaking at the celebration. But Henn admitted she was worried that the speech would trigger an extreme emotional reaction, a fear shared by many who suffer from PTSD. They never know when the trauma will reignite; it can spread from the smallest spark, even on the happiest day.\n\n\u201cDoes EMDR deal with the future?\u201d she asked Kalin. Kalin nodded, and they began processing memories again.\n\nAmong the painful recollections, Henn encountered a happy memory \u2014 friends who arrived at the funeral to support the family \u2014 and a smile broke through the tears.\n\n\u201cIt felt like a gift from Nate,\u201d she said.\n\nEMDR, Henn said, allowed her to have a do-over \u2014 to be able to grieve properly and then to move beyond grief. She was finally able to remember the good times with her brother without being overwhelmed by pain.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still sad, but I\u2019m not hurt by it anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not opening up any fresh wounds.\u201d\n\nAs Henn walked outside into a brisk April evening after her session, there was a new easiness to her, as though something had finally been freed.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "Cognitive behavioral therapy, a popular alternative, is mentioned in the story, with conflicting reactions.

These are signals that a debilitating migraine is on its way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re possessed,\u201d said Lorie Novak, who has suffered from chronic migraines since childhood. \u201cI almost feel separate from my body, like it\u2019s just this painful shell around me that\u2019s not me.\u201d\n\nNovak, now in her 60s, is one of the roughly 35 million Americans who suffer from migraines. There are few effective treatments, and no new drugs have been developed since the early 1990s.\n\nBut that could soon change. A handful of drug companies are pressing ahead with novel injectable therapies for migraines, chasing a blockbuster market that Wall Street analysts say could reach $8 billion a year in worldwide sales.\n\nThe new drugs target a bodily protein called CGRP, which plays a role in the dilation of blood vessels in the brain. Scientists haven\u2019t nailed down just how the protein affects migraines, but they\u2019re sure about two things: CGRP levels rocket up when headaches attack and normalize when they go away.\n\nAnd thus four drug makers \u2014 Amgen, Eli Lilly, Teva Pharmaceuticals, and Alder Biopharmaceuticals \u2014 have fashioned antibodies that can bind to CGRP molecules and block their activity. The goal: to relieve the scourge of chronic migraines by stopping CGRP in its tracks.\n\nSo far, it seems to be working. In mid-stage clinical trials, each of the four treatments has eased symptoms for about half of study participants, cutting the number of days they\u2019re afflicted by migraines roughly in half. It\u2019s by no means a cure for migraines, but it should be enough to merit Food and Drug Administration approvals if the companies can replicate those results in larger trials, according to Eric Schmidt, a securities analyst at Cowen and Co.\n\nEach treatment is now in late-stage development, targeting the roughly 38 percent of migraine sufferers who, like Novak, have at least four headache days per month. The first therapy could hit the market in 2018, and, if everything works out, all four could available by the end of the decade.\n\nSo far, the four drugs have performed similarly in clinical trials, and analysts expect the contenders will have to compete on price to grab market share.\n\n\u201cThere will certainly be hypercompetition,\u201d said William Ratner, Lilly\u2019s senior director of global headache marketing. But the companies\u2019 fortunes are intertwined, he said, and \u201cthe class only wins if headache care in America improves.\u201d\n\nAiming to prevent migraines before they start\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of room for improvement. Existing therapies are plagued by inconsistent efficacy and troublesome side effects, and patients are often left to rely on a repurposed treatment for epilepsy. That medication, Topamax, has been dubbed dubbed \u201cSleepomax\u201d by doctors and patients because it\u2019s also a heavy sedative.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very enthusiastic, as I think everyone in the field is, about having another treatment option for people with migraines,\u201d said Dr. Elizabeth Loder, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and chief of the headache division in the department of neurology at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital.\n\nTargeting CGRP is not a particularly new idea. Researchers picked up on the protein\u2019s scent more than 30 years ago, and drug companies spent years trying to craft pills that might block its activity. Merck got all the way into late-stage trials with an anti-CGRP tablet, spending more than $1 billion only to find in 2011 that the drug had toxic effects on the liver and thus no future.\n\nWith the \u201cexquisite sensitivity\u201d of an antibody, however, scientists believe they can block CGRP without triggering dangerous side effects, Alder CEO Randy Schatzman said.\n\nBecause antibodies stay active in the body for weeks, the drug companies see their new products as preventative therapies, injected monthly or quarterly to keep headaches at bay. (Merck\u2019s failed pill, by contrast, was meant as an on-the-spot treatment after the pain started.)\n\n\u201cSo in some senses, it\u2019s a paradigm shift,\u201d Schatzman said.\n\nBut there are still hurdles to clear. Only about half of patients seem to respond to CGRP antibodies, and the companies have no way of predicting who they are ahead of time. A genetic test would be \u201cthe Holy Grail of personalized medicine,\u201d said Rob Lenz, Amgen\u2019s global development lead for neuroscience, but no one has made one yet.\n\nAnd long-term safety remains a major question mark. To date, none of the companies has reported serious side effects in clinical trials, but they\u2019ve only reported data from 12-week studies on about 1,500 total patients. It will take years to determine just what the new therapies do to the body over time, Loder said.\n\n\u2018I felt like my life was being stolen from me\u2019\n\nAny advance, even an incremental one, would be a major leap for the field, said Emily Bates, who studies the genetic causes of headaches at the University of Colorado and is not affiliated with any of the companies working on migraine treatment.\n\nBates struggled with chronic migraines in high school and college. Like many patients, she didn\u2019t respond to any of the preventative therapies available.\n\n\u201cThe pain is more than anything I\u2019ve ever experienced, and I\u2019ve run on broken legs before,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like my life was being stolen from me.\u201d\n\nCollectively, Americans miss about 113 million workdays each year because of migraine. That lost productivity costs society about $13 billion each year, according to the Migraine Research Foundation.\n\nYet scientific progress has been slow, in part because migraine was long considered a psychosomatic condition not worthy of serious research funding, Bates said.\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201csubjective symptom that predominantly affects women,\u201d said Loder, the Harvard neurologist. \u201cThat\u2019s a perfect combination of things that make people feel able to dismiss it.\u201d\n\nNovak, a professor of photography at New York University\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts, spent years trying to hide her migraines because of the stigma attached to the condition. But she decided to change all that in 2009 with a project called Migraine Register. She takes a photo of herself each day she has a migraine. Some years, that\u2019s more than 120 pictures.\n\nThe idea, in part, was to humanize chronic migraines. But the project also forced Novak to reckon with the toll of the disease, something she had tried to ignore for years.\n\n\u201cThat for me was like a concrete proof of how it really does affect my life,\u201d Novak said, \u201cof how much time I lose.\u201d", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story includes the following discussion of alternatives:\n\u201cExisting therapies are plagued by inconsistent efficacy and troublesome side effects, and patients are often left to rely on a repurposed treatment for epilepsy.

Rubbing his neck, on the edge of passing out and feeling numbness on his left side, Reisch didn\u2019t know what was happening.\n\n\u201cPeople were honking at me,\u201d said the 43-year-old, California father of two. \u201cI was driving on the center divide going up and coming down. I felt like I was in a dream state until I finally ran off the road.\u201d\n\n911 calls to police that morning reported a drunk driver on the road and when Reisch crashed, the paramedics were quickly on the scene. First responders asked Reisch to smile and immediately recognized his drooping mouth as a sign of a stroke. At the hospital, the first-line therapy, a powerful blood-thinning medication called tissue plasminogen activator or tPA could not dissolve the blood clots in Reisch\u2019s brain.\n\nSo the doctors at the Comprehensive Stroke Center at the University of California San Diego tried an innovative approach called a stent retriever.\n\nStent retriever therapy essentially captures the clot and pulls it out of the brain. A catheter is placed into a blood vessel in the groin and guided up into the brain through the blocked artery. Then a wire mesh opens, grabbing onto and removing the blood clot while the patient is still having a stroke.\n\nRelated: New Recommendations Say More Americans Should Take Aspirin\n\nFor Reisch, the impact was almost immediate: he began to regain feeling while undergoing the procedure.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re awake through the whole process and actually the doctors are telling you what to do,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cShortly after that he told me I could relax and that I did a good job and they had retrieved the clot and just to relax and I immediately started trying to move my arm.\u201d\n\n\u201cA patient will come in, they can't speak, they can't move half their body,\u201d says neurosurgeon Dr. J Mocco, of Mt.

In April, the journal Radiology published findings that highlight the added importance of removing clots in a timely manner. Researchers examined data on patients treated with both tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the standard in stroke treatment, and stent retrievers and found that restoration of blood flow within 2.5 hours of stroke onset was associated with minimal or no disability in 91 percent of patients.\n\nRoughly 795,000 people suffer a stroke every year in the United States, and it\u2019s the fifth highest cause of death and a leading cause of adult disability, according to the American Heart Association.\n\nFor more than 20 years, an injection of tPA, which dissolves the clot and improves blood flow to the affected part of the brain, has been the standard care for stroke patients. The intravenous drug is very effective for smaller clots, but it often fails to break up larger clots and is usually most effective when given within 4.5 hours after the first symptoms.\n\n\u201cThe earlier that patients with acute ischemic stroke get to a hospital offering the appropriate treatment, the higher the likelihood is of a good outcome,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Mayank Goyal of the Hotchkiss Brain Institute at the University of Calgary.\n\nCurrently, stent retriever therapy is offered in just a few hundred hospitals across the country, including more than 100 Comprehensive Stroke Centers accredited by the American Heart Association and The Joint Commission.\n\nThe new research provides more evidence of the need for new regional centers of care, in order to minimize the time it takes to transport a patient to hospital capable of providing stent therapy, according to Dr. William J. Powers of the American Heart Association.\n\nThe American Heart Association has a select list of some of the comprehensive stroke centers in the U.S.\n\nExperts strongly encourage anyone experiencing stroke symptoms, such as a facial droop, numbness, weakness, blurry vision or speech difficulty, to call 911 immediately. When it comes to a stroke, time is of the essence and according to the National Stroke Association using the FAST approach can help one determine the warning signs.\n\nF - FACE: Ask the person to smile. Does one side of the face droop?\n\nA - ARMS: Ask the person to raise both arms. Does one arm drift downward?\n\nS - SPEECH: Ask the person to repeat a simple phrase.

The data was presented at the American Surgical Association annual meeting in San Diego. Locally advanced pancreatic cancer is Stage III cancer that has not yet spread.\n\nPancreatic cancer has one of the highest mortality rates of all cancers and is expected to climb from the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the U.S. to the second by 2020. Ninety four percent of pancreatic cancer patients will die within five years of diagnosis, and 74% of patients die within the first year of diagnosis.\n\n\"The STAR data adds to the growing body of evidence that IRE ablation may represent a new treatment paradigm for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer,\" said Robert Martin, M.D., Ph.D., F.A.C.S., director of the Division of Surgical Oncology, and Professor, Department of Surgery, University of Louisville, James Graham Brown Cancer Center. \"This new analysis of IRE could help change the standard of care for Stage III pancreatic cancer patients whose only treatment options until now were chemotherapy or a combination of chemo-radiation therapy, which will only stabilize the disease and not destroy the tumor. With IRE, these patients now have a surgical treatment option to augment their treatment plan.\"\n\nThe NanoKnife\u00ae IRE system is a tool that destroys cancerous cells by subjecting them to a series of short electrical pulses using high-voltage direct current that does not injure surrounding cells, blood vessels and other vital structures. IRE overcomes rapid growth of the tumor by killing all malignant cells at once so they cannot continue to grow and spread. The NanoKnife\u00ae IRE system is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the surgical ablation of soft tissue. It is not approved for use in specific cancers.\n\nSTAR was a retrospective analysis of IRE performed on 200 consecutive patients diagnosed with locally advanced (Stage III) pancreatic cancer (LAPC) at six centers in the U.S. The centers that collaborated on the study included University of Louisville, Louisville, KY; Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI; Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH; Piedmont Hospital, Atlanta, GA; Swedish Medical Center, Denver, CO; and Cancer Treatment Centers of America, Atlanta, GA.\n\nFrom July 2010 to October 2014, patients with radiographic Stage III LAPC were treated with IRE and monitored under a multicenter, prospective IRB-approved registry. Perioperative 90-day outcomes, local failure, and overall survival were recorded and compared to standard of care data for Stage III LAPC. All patients underwent induction chemotherapy with 52 percent receiving chemo-radiation, for a median of 7 months (range, 5-13) prior to IRE. IRE was successfully administered to all patients. Nineteen percent sustained complications with a median grade of 2 (range 1-3). Median length of stay was 6 days (range, 4-58) with a median follow-up of 25 months. Six patients (3%) had local recurrence.

The microneedles dissolve into the skin, releasing the vaccine.\n\nIn the study, 100 participants received either the flu vaccine patch, a standard flu shot or a placebo via a patch.\n\nSix months later, no one involved in the study had gotten the flu. People in the microneedle patch groups reported some redness, itching and tenderness but no serious side effects.\n\nPeople who received the flu patch had comparable immune responses to people who had gotten the flu shot.\n\nAbout 70 percent of the patients in the study preferred the patch to the regular shot, says Yasmine Gomaa, the lab's associate director.\n\nNow, Gomaa's lab is looking beyond the flu vaccine. She says the microneedle patch could be particularly helpful in developing countries because it uses a form of vaccines that doesn't need to be kept as cold as regular vaccines. It can be stored at temperatures as high as 104 degrees Fahrenheit for up to a year, she says.\n\nAnd the patch can be administered by people who aren't trained health professionals. A number of the people in the flu patch study applied it to themselves.\n\nIn 2015, Georgia Tech and the pharmaceutical company Micron Biomedical won $2.5 million in grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to develop a patch for polio immunization.\n\nGomaa's hope is that vaccine patches will cost less than vaccinations do now.\n\nA 2016 study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the use of vaccine patches could save on cooling costs and could cut down on waste. Its analysis concluded that a dose of measles vaccine with the patch would cost just under $1, while a typical shot would cost $1.65. But that didn't take into account the costs of getting the patch to market.\n\nThe potential cost savings wouldn't happen until the patches were in \"routine use,\" the CDC noted.\n\nOthers in the vaccine-delivery business are taking a different approach, using a new twist on a needle-free device called a jet injector that has been around for more than half a century.\n\nPortal Instruments, a company that is developing jet injectors, uses technology based on work done by Ian Hunter at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n\"Initially, we worked on microneedles,\" says the company's CEO Patrick Anquetil. \"And then Ian realized that why don't we just remove the needle altogether? And that's how this project came to be.\"\n\nNeedle-free jet injectors were actually used in the 1960s in mass smallpox vaccination campaigns. As described by the CDC, these devices use a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to penetrate the skin. The diameter of the stream is comparable to a mosquito bite.\n\nThe devices were used to quickly vaccinate large numbers of people, including members of the armed forces.\n\nAnquetil notes that the older devices sometimes made patients feel as if they had been punched.\n\n\"To create the jet, you have to instantaneously create 100 times more pressure than you've got in the tire of a car,\" he says. \"Patients actually hated them because they were more painful than a needle and syringe.\"\n\n\"My 85-year-old neighbor still remembers how painful it was,\" says Ron Lowy, CEO of PharmaJet, a company that makes an FDA-approved jet injector that administers a flu vaccine.\n\nThe older devices had another problem. They used the same nozzle for multiple injections, leading to concerns about the transmission of bloodborne pathogens between patients.\n\nToday's devices have made a lot of progress, Lowy says. Now, the syringe is changed for each patient and the injections are gentler.\n\n\"It feels like somebody snapped me with a rubber band,\" he says, adding that the injection happens too fast for some patients to register any sensation at all. It lasts about one-tenth of a second.\n\nHe says hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. have already received the flu vaccine via one of PharmaJet's injectors.\n\n\"If you have your choice, you want to get poked with a needle or you want to try this? Most of the people say, 'Yeah, I'll try that,' \" he says.\n\nCost remains an issue for some jet injectors. Portal is aiming to get its cost down to $3 or $4 per injection.\n\n\"In vaccines, what's really hard is that there's a very, very high volume, and you're competing with a needle and syringe, which is tremendously low cost,\" Anquetil says.\n\nPharmaJet says the ability to give precise doses helps to save money. The company says its flu vaccine \"starter kit,\" which can vaccinate 500 people, costs $900.\n\nFluMist, an FDA-approved flu vaccine delivered through a nasal spray, was widely used in the U.S. and, at one point, was even the preferred method of vaccination for children.\n\nThen last year, in a sharp turnaround, the CDC recommended that it not be used during the 2016-17 flu season after a study found it had not been very effective in the previous year, particularly among kids.\n\nThe vaccine's effectiveness was just 3 percent, so low that \"no protective benefit could be measured\" for children ages 2 to 17, the CDC said in a statement.\n\nIn contrast, the effectiveness of the flu shot was about 63 percent for kids in that age group.\n\nAstraZeneca, the parent company behind FluMist, says the CDC's data contradicts data from several other studies, which show the vaccine was about 48 percent effective during the same flu season. And the same vaccine continues to be recommended and used in European Union markets, AstraZeneca says.\n\nIn the U.S., the CDC continues to recommend against the nasal spray vaccine for the upcoming flu season. AstraZeneca hopes to reverse that decision before flu season begins.\n\n\"We continue to pursue a broad-based investigation to identify potential causes of lower effectiveness\" in recent years, the company said in a statement, adding that one of the four flu virus strains it used in the vaccine during the past two flu seasons may have been the problem.\n\nThe company has chosen a new strain of live virus that is similar to other strains that have proven effective in studies and clinical trials.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "This story is all about alternatives.

But the mechanisms underlying the effect were not well understood.\n\nResearchers in the lab of Jun Wu, research assistant professor at the LSI, wanted to better understand cinnamaldehyde's action and determine whether it might be protective in humans, too.\n\n\"Scientists were finding that this compound affected metabolism,\" said Wu, who also is an assistant professor of molecular and integrative physiology at the U-M Medical School. \"So we wanted to figure out how--what pathway might be involved, what it looked like in mice and what it looked like in human cells.\"\n\nTheir findings, which appear in the December issue of the journal Metabolism, indicated that cinnamaldehyde improves metabolic health by acting directly on fat cells, or adipocytes, inducing them to start burning energy through a process called thermogenesis.\n\nWu and her colleagues tested human adipocytes from volunteers representing a range of ages, ethnicities and body mass indices. When the cells were treated with cinnamaldehyde, the researchers noticed increased expression of several genes and enzymes that enhance lipid metabolism. They also observed an increase in Ucp1 and Fgf21, which are important metabolic regulatory proteins involved in thermogenesis.\n\nAdipocytes normally store energy in the form of lipids. This long-term storage was beneficial to our distant ancestors, who had much less access to high-fat foods and thus a much greater need to store fat. That fat could then be used by the body in times of scarcity or in cold temperatures, which induce adipocytes to convert stored energy into heat.\n\n\"It's only been relatively recently that energy surplus has become a problem,\" Wu said. \"Throughout evolution, the opposite--energy deficiency--has been the problem. So any energy-consuming process usually turns off the moment the body doesn't need it.\"\n\nWith the rising obesity epidemic, researchers like Wu have been looking for ways to prompt fat cells to activate thermogenesis, turning those fat-burning processes back on.\n\nWu believes that cinnamaldehyde may offer one such activation method. And because it is already used widely in the food industry, it might be easier to convince patients to stick to a cinnamon-based treatment than to a traditional drug regimen.\n\n\"Cinnamon has been part of our diets for thousands of years, and people generally enjoy it,\" Wu said. \"So if it can help protect against obesity, too, it may offer an approach to metabolic health that is easier for patients to adhere to.\"\n\nNow, before anyone goes dumping tons of extra cinnamon in their egg nog in hopes of keeping holiday-season pounds at bay, Wu cautioned that further study is needed to determine how best to harness cinnamaldehyde's metabolic benefits without causing adverse side effects.\n\nThe research was supported by the Human Frontier Science Program, Edward Mallinckrodt Jr. Foundation, National Institutes of Health and American Heart Association.\n\nOther study authors were: Juan Jiang, Margo Emont, Heejin Jun, Xiaona Qiao, Jiling Liao and Dong-il Kim, all of U-M.\n\nThe study is titled \"Cinnamaldehyde induces fat cell-autonomous thermogenesis and metabolic reprogramming,\" DOI: 10.1016/j.metabol.2017.08.006.", "question": "Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The release references traditional drug treatments while suggesting cinnamon might be a safer and easier to adhere to strategy for weight loss than a drug.

About 70 percent of smokers give up the daunting effort during the first week of trying.\n\nThe researchers, led by Caryn Lerman, a professort of psychiatry, divided 1,246 subjects into slow metabolizers of nicotine and normal metabolizers of the addictive chemical, based on the length of time it took for them to rid their bodies of the drug. The ratio of two metabolites, or byproducts, of the body's processing of nicotine allows easy identification of the two groups. The metabolite is found in blood and saliva.\n\nThe results of the comparison showed that slow metabolizers did just as well on a nicotine patch or the drug varenicline (marketed as Chantix), a drug that works on the nicotine receptors in the brain. But the patch costs less and has fewer side-effects than varenicline (including nausea, difficulty sleeping and abnormal dreams), so the researchers concluded that slow metabolizers should be put on the patch.\n\nNormal metabolizers of nicotine, meanwhile, had more success with varenicline because they tend to rid their systems of nicotine faster, limiting the effectiveness of the patch.

The machine pumped heated chemotherapy directly into the abdominal cavity for 90 minutes while nurses gently jiggled the man\u2019s bloated belly to disperse the drug to every nook and cranny.\n\nThe treatment is formally called cytoreductive surgery followed by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, or Hipec.\n\nRecent converts include University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland, in the , and even Massachusetts General.

While some patients did seem to live much longer than expected, he said that they had been carefully selected and might have fared well even without the therapy.\n\nProponents say that if cancer has spread into the abdominal cavity but not elsewhere, then lives can be prolonged by removing all the visible and killing what\u2019s missed with Hipec.\n\nBy contrast, said Dr. Paul Sugarbaker, a surgeon at Washington Hospital Center and the leading proponent of Hipec, \u201cthere are no long-term survivors with systemic chemotherapy \u2014 zero.\u201d\n\nDr. Sugarbaker, who opposed Dr. Ryan in the debate, said that it has long been known that cancerous cells are unable to withstand as much heat as healthy cells. And putting the chemotherapy on top of tumors should be more effective than systematically delivering it through the bloodstream.\n\nOne randomized trial done more than a decade ago involving 105 patients in the did show a striking benefit. The median survival of those getting surgery and Hipec, plus intravenous chemotherapy, was 22.3 months, almost double the 12.6 months for those getting only the intravenous chemotherapy. But 8 percent who got the surgery and Hipec died from the treatment itself. And critics say that since that trial was conducted, new drugs have come to market that allow patients with metastatic colorectal cancer to live two years with intravenous chemotherapy alone.\n\nA new trial in the has been temporarily suspended so that researchers can find a way to recruit patients. After nearly a year only one patient had enrolled, because people were reluctant to chance winding up in the control group, according to one of the investigators.\n\nWhile proponents contend that the risk of dying from the surgery has been reduced since the Dutch trial, the procedure still lasts eight hours or more and full recovery can take three to six months. \u201cIt\u2019s maximally invasive,\u201d said Dr. Sugarbaker, who often removes the \u201cspare parts\u201d \u2014 organs a patient can live without, like the spleen, the gall bladder, the ovaries and the uterus.\n\nThe cost of the surgery and Hipec, including hospitalization, ranges from $20,000 to more than $100,000, doctors said.

One lost much of her abdominal wall to infection and just died in misery.\u201d\n\nAnother risk is that the surgery may be done unnecessarily. CT scans cannot pick up many of the small tumors, so it is often unclear how much cancer is inside until the patient is opened.\n\nIn June, Dr. Lowy sliced open a woman and saw, to his horror, that she had more tumors than he could remove. Taking out only some would not improve her chances of survival, so he closed the incision, and she is now starting intravenous chemotherapy.\n\nThings with the male patient, Andy S., went better.

So he signed up for surgery and Hipec with Dr. Lowy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to say my goodbyes to everybody,\u201d Mr. S. said the day before the operation. \u201cI had to talk to my priest.

I wouldn\u2019t wish it on my worst enemy, but I have to go through with it.\u201d\n\nDr. Lowy explored the entire cavity from the diaphragm to the pelvis.

He removed the right side of the man\u2019s colon and the omentum, a fatty structure.\n\nThen two Y-shaped tubes hooked to the Hipec machine were inserted into the abdominal cavity, one to deliver the chemotherapy and the other to bring the drug back to the machine to be reheated. The incision was sewn up around the tubes so the chemotherapy would not leak.\n\nThe man\u2019s belly was filled with three liters of saline fluid and the chemotherapy, a generic drug called mitomycin C, heated to 42 degrees Celsius, or nearly 108 degrees Fahrenheit. Any hotter could have caused injuries.

With increased mitochondria, the treated mice were able to burn off more fat and thus avoid weight gain and decreased sensitivity to insulin, Dr. Auwerx said. He found that their muscle fibers had been remodeled by the drug into the type more prevalent in trained human athletes.\n\nDr. Ronald M. Evans, a leading expert on the hormonal control of metabolism at the Salk Institute, said that the report by Dr. Auwerx\u2019s team had \u201cshown very convincingly that resveratrol improves mitochondrial function\u201d and fends off metabolic disease.\n\nDr. Evans described the study as \u201cvery important, because it is rare that we identify orally active molecules, especially natural molecules, that have such a broad-based, positive effect on a problem as widespread in society as metabolic disease.\u201d\n\nDr. Ronald Kahn, director of the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, said the research would focus attention on the sirtuins, a recently discovered group of enzymes that resveratrol is believed to affect. Noting that he is a scientific advisor to Sirtris, a company developing drugs that activate the sirtuins, Dr. Kahn said, \u201cCertainly, drugs that act on this class of proteins have the potential to have major effects on human disease.\u201d\n\nDr. Auwerx\u2019s study complements one published earlier this month by Dr. David Sinclair of the Harvard Medical School, who found that much more moderate doses of resveratrol protected mice from the metabolic effects of a high-calorie diet. Though his mice did not lose weight, they lived far longer than undosed mice that were fed the same high-calorie diet.\n\nThe two studies were started and performed independently, Dr. Auwerx said, though he obtained supplies of resveratrol from Sirtris, which was co-founded by Dr. Sinclair, and he has become a scientific advisor to the company.\n\nA drug that prolongs life, averts degenerative disease and, on top of all that, makes you into a champion athlete \u2014 at least if you are a mouse \u2014 sounds almost too good to be true.\n\nDr. Christoph Westphal, Sirtris\u2019s chief executive, replied to this objection with a question: \u201cIs it too good to be true that when you are young you get no disease?\u201d\n\nHe believes that activation of the sirtuins is what keeps the body healthy in youth, but that these enzymes become less powerful with age, exposing the body to degenerative disease. That is the process that he says is reversed by resveratrol and, he hopes, by the more powerful sirtuin-activator drugs that his company is developing, though many years of clinical trials will still be needed to demonstrate whether they work and are safe to use.\n\nThe developing buzz over sirtuin activators has captivated some scientists who do research on the aging process, several of whom are already taking resveratrol themselves. Dr. Sinclair has said that he has been swallowing resveratrol capsules for three years, and that his parents and half his lab staff do the same.\n\nSo does Dr. Tomas Prolla at the University of Wisconsin. \u201cThe fact that investigators in the field are taking it is a good sign there is something there,\u201d he said.\n\nBut many others believe taking the drug now is premature, including Dr. Leonard Guarente of M.I.T. whose 15-year study of the sirtuins laid the basis for the field of study. It was after working in Dr. Guarente\u2019s lab as a postdoctoral student that Dr. Sinclair found in 2003 that resveratrol was a sirtuin activator.\n\nThough resveratrol has long been known to be a component red wine and other foods, it is present there in only minuscule amounts, compared with the very large doses used in experiments. Dr. Sinclair dosed his mice daily with 22 milligrams of resveratrol for each kilogram of weight, and Dr. Auwerx used up to 400 milligrams. No one could drink enough red wine to obtain such doses.\n\nResveratrol is now available in capsules that contain extracts of red wine and giant knotweed, a plant found in China. One manufacturer of such capsules is Longevinex, whose president, Bill Sardi, said today that demand for the product had increased by a factor of 2400 since Nov. 1. But even Longevinex\u2019s capsules, which at present contain 40 milligrams of resveratrol each, would have to be gulped in almost impossible quantities for a human to obtain doses equivalent to those used in mice. \u201cIt\u2019s like eating a whole bottle of Tums every day,\u201d Dr. Evans said.\n\nWhether much lower doses would benefit athletic performance is not clear, Dr. Evans said. And higher doses may not be as safe as the lower doses found now in foods and \u201cnutraceuticals\u201d like the extract capsules.\n\nBesides these uncertainties over what a safe and effective dose of resveratrol might be, the science underlying the field is still in full flux. Many central details are still unclear. The principal theory developed by Dr. Guarente and others is that the sirtuins somehow sense the level of energy expenditure in living cells and switch the body\u2019s resources from reproduction to tissue maintenance when food is low.\n\nThis is an ancient strategy, Dr. Guarente believes, that allows an organism to live through famines and postpone breeding until good times return. The switch to tissue maintenance involves specific action to stave off the major degenerative diseases of aging, such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease and neurodegeneration.\n\nThough resveratrol is in the spotlight, the central focus of researchers is on how the sirtuins are activated and what they do. One serious uncertainty is whether, in the mouse experiments, resverattrol in fact acted through the sirtuins or by some other unknown mechanism. In the latter case, Dr. Sinclair\u2019s and Dr. Auwerx\u2019s mouse experiments would offer less support to the sirtuin theory.\n\nDr. Auwerx cites evidence that resveratrol does activate sirtuin, but Dr. Evans said the case was not yet fully convincing.\n\nDr. Bruce Spiegelman, a Harvard Medical School expert on fat metabolism, said Dr. Auwerx\u2019s paper was \u201cpretty good.\u201d Dr. Auwerx believes resveratrol activates sirtuin, which in turn activates a factor known as PGC1-alpha in a manner first described by Dr. Spiegelman and his colleagues last year. Subsequent actions by PGC1-alpha then stimulate cells to produce more mitochondria.\n\nIncreased energy production by mitochondria generates potentially dangerous reactive chemicals that are known to damage cells. So it has long been puzzling that exercise, in which energy is expended, is good for health, not bad.\n\nDr. Auwerx noted that Dr. Spiegelman showed in a report in the journal Cell last month that PGC1-alpha not only increases mitochondria, but at the same time generates chemicals that detoxify the energy by-products.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "This story did not provide information about other ways for a person to attain the benefits mentioned for reservatrol such as protection from weight gain, increased longevity, or avoiding degenerative disease.\u00a0 ", "answer": 0}, {"article": "One of the most frustrating aspects of brain injuries is that they can be difficult to diagnose; emergency rooms can sometimes miss subtle symptoms, leading to improper treatment and potentially catastrophic consequences.

Prediabetics are at increased risk for developing diabetes, which can damage the eyes, kidneys, nerves and blood vessels and often leads to cardiovascular disease.\n\nMany people with prediabetes also have untreated sleep apnea, although few of them are aware of it. The most widely accepted treatment for sleep apnea is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), a device that blows a constant pressure of air into the lungs through a tube and face mask during the night. This helps people breathe better while they sleep by keeping the upper airway open.\n\n\"Our study showed that CPAP in patients with prediabetes can lower their risk of progressing to diabetes when CPAP is used for eight hours, a full night's sleep,\" said the study's lead author, Sushmita Pamidi, MD, a former fellow at the University of Chicago who is now on the faculty at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.\n\n\"Although eight hours of CPAP per night can be difficult to achieve in real-life, our results should provide a strong incentive for anyone with sleep apnea, especially prediabetic individuals, to improve adherence to their treatment for cardio-metabolic risk reduction,\" she said.\n\nPeople with sleep apnea, which is common among overweight and obese individuals, have repeated episodes where their upper airway closes during sleep. This can disrupt sleep and temporarily lower oxygen levels. It has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension and stroke, and may decrease their ability to regulate blood sugar levels. This increases the risk of diabetes.\n\nFor this study, the researchers recruited 39 middle-aged, overweight or obese volunteers with prediabetes and sleep apnea. Two-thirds of them (26) were randomly assigned to two weeks of CPAP treatment. The other 13 received a placebo -- a pill containing no medicine -- to be taken 30 minutes before bedtime. They were told the study would compare the two treatments.\n\nAll participants slept in the sleep laboratory and were closely monitored with all-night sleep recordings during the treatment period. Those assigned to CPAP wore the device for eight hours a night under continuous supervision by a technician. Before and after each treatment period, participants' glucose metabolism was assessed by oral and intravenous glucose-tolerance tests.\n\nThe researchers also measured the stress hormone noradrenaline in the blood and continuously monitored blood pressure for 24 hours at home. All participants were permitted to leave the laboratory during the day and engage in their routine activities.\n\nAfter two weeks, blood sugar control, as measured by an oral glucose tolerance test, improved for those in the CPAP group compared to the oral placebo group. In addition, the ability of insulin to regulate their blood sugar, estimated by the intravenous glucose tolerance test, was improved in the CPAP group compared to the oral placebo group. The CPAP group had, on average, 27 percent lower levels of the stress hormone, norepinephrine, as well as lower blood pressure than the oral placebo group.\n\n\"Despite the demonstrated efficacy of lifestyle interventions and the availability of many drug treatments, the economic and public health burden of diabetes remains enormous,\" said Esra Tasali, MD, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago and senior author of the study. \"Assessment of sleep apnea should be considered in patients at high risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, since our study shows that treatment of sleep apnea can reduce these risks.\"\n\nThe National Institutes of Health, plus the Diabetes Research and Training Center and the Institute for Translational Medicine at the University of Chicago funded this study.

The researchers say this may lead to new national guidelines for treating this cancer subtype, known as uterine serous carcinoma.\n\nUterine serous carcinoma makes up less than 10 percent of all cancers of the endometrium, or lining of the womb, diagnosed in the United States each year, but it accounts for more than a third of the 10,000 endometrial cancer deaths annually. The aggressive carcinomas often don't cause symptoms until they've begun to spread throughout the body. As a result, the average time that standard chemotherapy and surgical treatments can keep the tumor from growing or spreading--known as progression-free survival--is only about eight months.\n\n\"The fact that these tumors grow rapidly, but also have a propensity to spread to lymph nodes and other organs very early, is a double whammy for women,\" says Amanda Fader, M.D., associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and first author of the new study.\n\nFader and her colleagues knew that about 30 percent of all uterine serous carcinomas test positive for HER2/neu, a receptor protein that is also overexpressed in about 10 percent of all breast cancers. Trastuzumab binds to and blocks HER2/neu, keeping it from driving tumor growth, and has been shown to be effective in so-called HER2 positive breast cancers.\n\nFrom August 2011 through March 2017, Fader, Alessandro Santin, M.D., professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Yale University, and collaborators at 11 other cancer treatment centers in the U.S. randomly assigned 61 women with uterine serous carcinoma, being seen at the participating institutions, to receive either the standard chemotherapeutic regimen--a combination of the drugs carboplatin and paclitaxel--or those drugs plus trastuzumab. Some 41 of the patients had stage 3 or 4 uterine serous carcinoma--known as advanced disease--and 17 had recurrent uterine serous carcinoma. All tested positive for the HER2/neu receptor.\n\nAmong all patients, the 28 controls receiving only the standard carboplatin and paclitaxel combination had an average progression-free survival time of eight months, and the 30 who received trastuzumab in addition had an average progression-free survival time of 12.6 months. However, the difference was even more profound in the 41 patients with advanced disease, whose progression-free survival time went from an average of 9.3 months to 17.9 months with the addition of trastuzumab.\n\n\"Even an improvement of a few months may be quite meaningful for women with these cancers,\" says Fader, who is also affiliated with the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins.\n\nAmong patients with recurrent disease, progression-free survival time increased from an average of six months to 9.2 months. The difference, Fader says, may be that these patients have been heavily treated in the past, are more likely to have overall poorer health and are more likely to have mutated or heterogeneous tumors, or tumors with different levels of HER2 expression.\n\nFollow-up studies of the women who remain alive--who now number 35--continue, the researchers say, to track the impact of trastuzumab on overall survival time even after tumor progression. But the results of the trial, they add, were strong enough to warrant submission to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, which guides the design of standard treatment plans around the country.\n\nFader cautions that a larger study of the drug combination, or other combinations, is needed to confirm the findings and potentially extend survival even more. She notes that using trastuzumab to selectively treat uterine serous carcinoma that express HER2/neu is part of a broader trend at Johns Hopkins and other cancer centers to use the tools of tailored therapy, or precision medicine, based on the molecular and genetic makeup of tumors and patients.\n\nOther authors of the paper are Dana M.

These patients lose a ton of weight and keep it off.\n\nHere's how Hutcher does the surgery: first, he sections off a small pouch of the upper part of the stomach, which is then attached to a lower part of the small intestine, bypassing most of the stomach, so that there's not a lot of room for food.\n\nIt used to be that roughly one in 100 people died from this operation. Hutcher says it's now about one in 1,000, which makes it less deadly than most major surgeries.\n\n\"It's less than gall bladder surgery. It's about one-tenth of cardiac surgery,\" he explains.\n\nIt's safer because of new surgical techniques which have also made it more effective. For instance, they can make the stomach pouch smaller than they used to.\n\n\"Even if I wanted to eat a whole cheesecake, my stomach is very tiny. It holds four ounces max, stretched to the max. And that's not even one piece of cheesecake,\" a female patient explained.\n\nA big reason the operation works is because it seems to suppress appetite. \"If you listen to your patients, they come back and they say, 'Doctor, you put the fire out,'\" Hutcher says.\n\n\"When you see a sign for fast food or\u2026she's already shaking her head at me,\" Stahl asked a patient.\n\n\"Don't want it,\" the female patient replied. \"I used to crave sweets all the time.

He owns a doughnut shop with his siblings, but he's able to resist the cravings. \"Before I'd have cravings for everything.

Dr. David Cummings, an expert on appetite at the University of Washington, says as a rule these patients end up just one third lighter.\n\n\"Most people with severe obesity who undergo gastric bypass do not become fully normal, in terms of body weight.

Colorectal cancer screening, for example, has been shown to save lives as a result of early detection, and the Pap test transformed cervical cancer into a treatable disease.\n\nBut this isn't the first study to call into question the benefits of mammography and whether women are too often the victims of overdiagnosis. \n\n\n\nThe trouble with overdiagnosis is that while the cancers doctors find wouldn't have harmed their patients, the treatment and stress that result from the diagnosis probably will.\n\nWe have to find a better way to screen women for breast cancer\n\nThe medical community has known about overdiagnosis and overtreatment for years, documenting the problem in a range of cancers \u2014 in breast, prostate, lung, and thyroid (which you can see in the chart above).\n\nThis raises a tough question: What should the medical community do about overdiagnosis? In a related commentary in the journal, a pair of doctors from the University of Washington School of Medicine note that the estimates of overdiagnosis of breast cancer are \"frustratingly broad\" \u2014 from less than 10 percent to 50 percent or more of women who get screened. In other words, we don't actually know how bad the problem is.\n\n\"Sadly,\" they write, \"we are left in a conundrum. Women will increasingly approach their physicians with questions and concerns about overdiagnosis, and we have no clear answers to provide.\"\n\n\n\nThe authors of the newest study don't advocate no screening. Instead, they note that the benefits of screening will probably be more favorable when screening is directed at people with a high risk of the disease \u2014 such as those with a family history of breast cancer.\n\n\n\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force, which analyzes the best available evidence to create guidelines for doctors, now recommends biennial mammography screening for the general population in women ages 50 to 74. For women under 50 and over 75 \u2014 who aren't at a high risk of breast cancer \u2014 the benefits of mass screening are less clear.\n\nThere are small things doctors can do that still don't happen often enough. For example, most women aren't told about the potential downsides of mammography screening \u2014 even though they're almost always briefed on the benefits.\n\nFor now, it's up to patients to talk to their doctors about their particular risk profiles and how to screen accordingly. We also need to remember that in medicine, more often than not, we generally overestimate the benefits and underestimate the harms.\n\nWATCH: The naked mole rat might help us cure cancer", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The alternative to mammography is not getting screened.

They came with \"horrible\" side effects, he said, and so he rarely took them.\n\nAs a blood pressure monitor squeezed snugly around his arm, the pharmacist counseled Thomas, 49, on his diet and stress level while checking his blood pressure. She then helped Thomas find a medication better suited for his body.\n\nThomas was not at a health clinic or pharmacy or a primary care physician's office.\n\nHe was at the barbershop where he works in Inglewood, California. As part of a study, these health services were provided at his barbershop and others across Los Angeles County.\n\nThe study, published Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine , tested whether pharmacist-led programs in barbershops could significantly lower high blood pressure in black men in the United States.\n\nResults from 12 months after the study show that when guidance was coupled with medication, a blood pressure measurement of less than 130/80 was achieved by 68% of men who participated in the study program, versus 11% of those who didn't.\n\n\"To a certain extent, I was surprised by the magnitude of the effect of the intervention,\" said Ciantel Blyler, a clinical pharmacist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles who was a co-author of the study.\n\n\"Especially once we sat down and looked at the blood pressure control rates and we were comparing the intervention group and the control group, I was sort of taken aback,\" she said.\n\n\"The first number, called systolic blood pressure, measures the pressure in your blood vessels when your heart beats,\" the CDC says. \"The second number, called diastolic blood pressure, measures the pressure in your blood vessels when your heart rests between beats.\"\n\nMany older black men tend to avoid seeing the doctor until they have a serious health problem, and then they \"use the emergency room as a doctor,\" Thomas said.\n\n\"If it wasn't for the program, a lot of guys wouldn't have known they had high blood pressure,\" he said of the study. \"Unfortunately, I wish we had other programs to come in, too.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the barbershop represents a safe haven in the black community -- a no-judgment zone -- where conversations about health and other personal topics are commonplace.\n\nAs a barber, \"we know more about our customers than their spouses do,\" Thomas said.\n\nShape your hair and your blood pressure\n\nThe new study included 319 black men across 52 black-owned barbershops in California's Los Angeles County. The men, 35 to 79 years old, had systolic blood pressure of 140 or more.\n\nThe researchers randomly assigned the men, based on their barbershop, to participate in the pharmacist-led program or to a control group between February 2015 and July 2017.\n\nIn the program group, barbers encouraged the men to meet with specially trained pharmacists at the barbershop to help monitor their blood pressure. The pharmacists could prescribe drug therapy under a collaborative agreement with the men's doctors.\n\nAt his barbershop, Thomas said, many customers were hesitant to open up to the pharmacists and doctors and to meet with them for health consultations.\n\n\"No one wanted to do it,\" he said. \"But by them being there -- they were in there every day -- and then we got used to them, and they warmed up to everybody. ... Then a lot of guys eventually were like, 'I'll go. Let me make sure I'm OK.' \"\n\nBlyler said it didn't take long for the customers to warm up to her and her colleagues.\n\n\"They understood that we were there with good intentions. It was a very comfortable environment, and folks were very welcoming, and it really worked,\" she said.\n\nIn the control group, barbers encouraged the men to make lifestyle changes and doctor appointments, but not much else changed in their usual barbershop visits.\n\nBy the end of the study, the researchers found that the barbers' role in encouraging the men to monitor and improve their health resulted in a significant reduction in blood pressure, when coupled with medication from the pharmacists.\n\nIn participants assigned to the pharmacist-led program, the average reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 21.6 and 14.9 greater, respectively, than in those assigned to the control group at six months, the researchers found.\n\nAt 12 months, the average reductions were \"statistically indistinguishable\" from the six-month data, according to the researchers.\n\n'Medical mistrust has been an important barrier'\n\nThe study had some limitations, including that it was not blind, because both participants and researchers knew who was assigned to the pharmacist-led program and who was in the control group.\n\nAdditionally, more research is needed to determine whether similar study results would occur on a national level, since the study was conducted only in the Los Angeles area.\n\nAlso, pharmacists aimed to lower blood pressure in the program participants to less than 130/80, whereas the primary care providers of those in the control group probably targeted a blood pressure of less than 140/90.\n\nThe researchers found that 17.5% of men who received help were screened, compared with 8.4% of those who didn't receive the screening help.\n\n\"Medical mistrust has been an important barrier to African-Americans seeking health care, and so the barbershop -- where men go on a monthly basis and have an opportunity to develop a rapport with a trusted key opinion leader in the community -- that rapport is a perfect foundation for talking about health,\" Ravenell said.\n\n\"We know that when it comes to people being receptive to health messages, the setting and the mood that people are in can have an impact on how open they are to receiving those messages,\" he said. \"Since the barbershop is a place where men want to be, it's a place that's known for open collegial conversation, it really is a perfect place to relay health messages that are important for black men.\"\n\nThe history of barbershops as havens for health\n\nIn the years to come, as racial segregation laws limited the spaces where black Americans could gather, the barbershop served as a safe meeting space for the black community. In barbershops, black men could speak openly and honestly about a range of topics, including their health -- and that seems to continue today.\n\n\"I think that what's so wonderful about health outreach in the barbershop: It's a comfortable place,\" Blyler said.\n\n\"Folks can ask questions or get information about their health in a 'low-stakes,' relaxed environment,\" she said. \"Barbershops are a social hub for black men, a place where they gather, when getting a haircut or not, and share information.\"", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story explained the alternative\u2013not receiving special help at the barbershop\u2013and what the outcomes were.

Nelson, M.D., Professor and Chair, Obstetrics and Gynecology at Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, Calif. \"Kyleena is highly effective at preventing pregnancy and may be an appropriate choice for women who want a low-dose, non-daily birth control method.\"\n\nKyleena is a small, flexible plastic T-shaped device containing 19.5 mg of a progestin hormone called levonorgestrel. Kyleena is placed by a healthcare provider during an in-office visit and prevents pregnancy for up to five years, but may be removed by a healthcare provider at any time.\n\n\"With the approval of Kyleena, women have an important new birth control option that provides pregnancy prevention for up to five years,\" said Dario Mirski, M.D., Senior Vice President and Head of Medical Affairs for the Americas, Bayer. \"Kyleena expands Bayer's IUD portfolio and is part of our commitment to provide women and their healthcare providers with a variety of contraceptive choices to meet their individual needs.\"\n\nThe use of long-acting reversible contraception (LARCs) has increased nearly five-fold in the last decade.3\n\nBecause Kyleena slowly releases levonorgestrel into a woman's uterus, only small amounts of the hormone enter the blood. For the first 3 to 6 months, a woman's period may become irregular and the number of bleeding days may increase. Women may also have frequent spotting or light bleeding. Some women have heavy bleeding during this time. After using Kyleena for a while, the number of bleeding and spotting days is likely to lessen. For some women, periods will stop altogether. When Kyleena is removed, menstrual periods should return.\n\nAbout the Clinical Trial for Kyleena1\n\nThe contraceptive efficacy of Kyleena was evaluated in a clinical trial that enrolled generally healthy women aged 18 to 35, of whom 1,452 received Kyleena. Of these, 40% (574) were nulliparous women, 870 (60%) women completed 3 years of the study, 707 (49%) elected to enroll in an extension phase up to a total of 5 years, and 550 (38%) completed 5 years of use. The trial was a multicenter, multi-national, randomized, open-label study conducted in 11 countries in Europe, Latin America, the U.S. and Canada. Women less than six weeks postpartum, with a history of ectopic pregnancy, with clinically significant ovarian cysts or with HIV or otherwise at high risk for sexually transmitted infections were excluded. A total of 563 (39%) were treated at U.S. sites and 889 (61%) were at non-U.S. sites. The racial demographics of enrolled women who received Kyleena was: Caucasian (80%), Black/African American (5.1%), Other (2.6%) and Asian (1.2%); 11% indicated Hispanic ethnicity. The clinical trial had no upper or lower weight or BMI limit. The weight range was 38 to 173 kg (mean weight: 68.7 kg) and mean BMI was 25.3 kg/m2 (range 15.2\u201357.6 kg/m2). Of Kyleena-treated women, 22% discontinued the study treatment due to an adverse reaction, 5.0% were lost to follow-up, 2.3% withdrew for unspecified reasons, 1.2% discontinued due to a protocol deviation, 0.9% discontinued due to pregnancy, and 20% discontinued due to other reasons.\n\nThe pregnancy rate calculated as the Pearl Index (PI) in women aged 18-35 years was the primary efficacy endpoint used to assess contraceptive reliability. The PI was calculated based on 28-day equivalent exposure cycles; evaluable cycles excluded those in which back-up contraception was used unless a pregnancy occurred in that cycle. The Year 1 PI was based on 2 pregnancies and the cumulative 5-year pregnancy rate was based on 13 pregnancies that occurred after the onset of treatment and within 7 days after Kyleena removal or expulsion.\n\nAbout 71% of 163 women who desired pregnancy after study discontinuation and provided follow-up information, conceived within 12 months after removal of Kyleena.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (occurring in \u2265 5% users) were vulvovaginitis (24%), ovarian cyst (22%), abdominal pain/pelvic pain (21%), headache/migraine (15%), acne/seborrhea (15%), dysmenorrhea/uterine spasm (10%), breast pain/breast discomfort (10%), and increased bleeding (8%). In the combined studies, 22% discontinued prematurely due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (> 1%) leading to discontinuation were increased bleeding (4.5%), abdominal pain/pelvic pain (4.2%), device expulsion (3.1%), acne/seborrhea (2.3%), and dysmenorrhea/uterine spasm (1.3%). In the clinical trials, serious adverse reactions occurring in more than a single subject included: ectopic pregnancy/ruptured ectopic pregnancy (10 subjects); pelvic inflammatory disease (6 subjects); missed abortion/incomplete spontaneous abortion/spontaneous abortion (4 subjects); ovarian cyst (3 subjects); abdominal pain (4 subjects); depression/affective disorder (4 subjects); and uterine perforation/embedded device (myometrial perforation) (3 subjects).\n\nIndication for Kyleena \n\nKyleena\u2122 (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system) is a hormone-releasing IUD that prevents pregnancy for up to 5 years.\n\u2022 If you have a pelvic infection, get infections easily, or have certain cancers, don't use Kyleena. Less than 1% of users get a serious pelvic infection called PID.\n\u2022 If you have persistent pelvic or stomach pain or if Kyleena comes out, tell your doctor. If Kyleena comes out, use back-up birth control. Kyleena may attach to or go through the uterus and cause other problems.\n\u2022 Pregnancy while using Kyleena is uncommon but can be life threatening and may result in loss of pregnancy or fertility.\n\u2022 Ovarian cysts may occur but usually disappear.\n\u2022 Bleeding and spotting may increase in the first 3 to 6 months and remain irregular. Periods over time usually become shorter, lighter, or may stop.\n\nKyleena does not protect against HIV or STDs.\n\nOnly you and your healthcare provider can decide if Kyleena is right for you.

Hyattsville, MD: National Center for Health Statistics. 2015.", "question": "Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "This is not satisfactory on two levels. First, Kyleena is described as an intrauterine system that releases levonorgestrel in order to prevent pregnancy, and it is described preventing pregnancy for up to five years. Another product from Bayer, Mirena, is an intrauterine device that releases levonorgestrel in order to prevent pregnancy. It also is described as preventing pregnancy for up to five years. When a company is releasing a new product that, to the non-expert audience, looks an awful lot like an existing product, the company needs to clearly describe how the products are different \u2014 in terms of mechanism, benefit, cost and risk. Other levonorgestrel-releasing devices/implants include Liletta and Skyla. How does Kyleena differ from them? Second, and more broadly, the efficacy of Kyleena at preventing unwanted pregnancy is not compared to the broader suite of birth control options available. All in all, this is a significant oversight. Potential users of Kyleena should be able to clearly compare the costs, risks and benefits of the new product to existing products. And if the product is as advantageous as the manufacturer wants the market to believe, an up-front comparison would actually help convince consumers.\nThere are two classes of levonorgestrel IUDs currently on the market that vary in the amount of active hormone they contain: 1) 52 mg IUDs (Mirena and Liletta) and 2) a 13.5 mg IUD (Skyla). There are two important differences between them. First, the\u00a0higher dose IUDs\u00a0are effective for five years, whereas the lower dose Skyla is effective for three years. Second, there are differences in side effects, which for some women may make one preferable to the other. Mirena and Liletta can reduce the frequency and amount of bleeding, as well as menstrual cramping; Skyla has little effect on these factors.\u00a0 With a lower dose of levonorgestrel\u00a0 IUD (19.5 mg) compared to the other 5-year IUDs, Kyleena would seem to be Bayer\u2019s effort to create a lower dose IUD that\u00a0is effective for 5 years.\u00a0 In this context, it would be especially helpful to know how its \u201cside effects\u201d (whether beneficial or not)\u00a0compare to those of the other IUDs.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Select patients age 90 years and older with aortic stenosis (AS) can benefit from a relatively new, minimally invasive surgery for aortic valve replacement, according to an article in the September 2015 issue of the Annals of Thoracic Surgery.\n\u2022 Both transfemoral and transapical approaches to TAVR appear to be safe and effective for treatment of aortic stenosis in select patients age 90 years and older.\n\u2022 By 6 months post-surgery, most quality-of-life measures had stabilized at a level considerably better than baseline, meaning patients quality of life was better than it was prior to surgery.\n\u2022 Future studies are needed to address potential differences in outcomes between TF- and TA-TAVR groups.\n\nAs part of the PARTNER-I trial, Vinod H. Thourani, MD, from Emory University in Atlanta, and colleagues from 12 other institutions in the United States found that transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a safe and effective way to treat aortic stenosis in nonagenarians who qualify for the surgical technique.\n\n\"Historically, extreme elderly patients can be at a very high risk for open surgery,\" said Dr. Thourani. \"We still believe that for those 90 year olds who are low-or intermediate risk, surgical options may be a viable procedure. However, with the advent of TAVR technology, we can now offer these extreme elderly patients a treatment option that otherwise would have been high-risk or prohibitive.\"\n\nAortic stenosis is the most common acquired valve disease in elderly patients and affects nearly 3% of those over the age of 75, according to the American Heart Association. The ability to safely treat AS patients has become increasingly important; the US government predicts that the number of Americans over the age of 85 will exceed 11 million in the next 20 years.\n\nFor the study, the researchers used two different approaches: transfemoral TAVR (TF-TAVR), which is the traditional approach performed via the groin, and transapical TAVR (TA-TAVR), which is performed via the heart muscle. TA-TAVR is an alternative for patients who are medically ineligible for TF-TAVR secondary to severe peripheral vascular disease. While the current study did not evaluate other alternative options for TAVR, these techniques may include transaortic, transcaval, transcarotid, or trans-subclavian.\n\nIn the largest series published to date, between April 2007 and February 2012, 531 nonagenarians underwent TAVR: 329 with TF-TAVR and 202 with TA-TAVR.\n\n\"We evaluated perioperative, short-, and mid-term outcomes following both TF- and TA-TAVR,\" explained Dr. Thourani. \"Compared with an age-sex-race-matched US population, the TAVR patients had a comparable risk of mortality, and quality of life improved within 6 months of the procedure. Our study shows that age alone should not preclude referral for TAVR in patients age 90 years and older.\"\n\nThe study also showed that the 30-day stroke risk was 3.6% in TF-TAVR patients and 2.0% in TA-TAVR patients. Major complications, such as bleeding or vascular issues, occurred in 35% of TF-TAVR patients and 32% of TA-TAVR patients, and more than 80% of patients were discharged home after the procedure.\n\n\"Future studies are needed to address potential differences in outcomes between TF- and TA-TAVR groups,\" said Dr. Thourani, \"but I'm thrilled that we're able to give elderly people the chance to continue enjoying life in their golden years.

Higher soy intake was also associated with less reported fatigue. The breast cancer survivors studied included 173 non-Hispanic white and 192 Chinese Americans including US-born Chinese and Chinese immigrants.\n\nResearchers say breast cancer survivors often experience side effects from cancer treatments that can persist months or years after completion of treatment. For example, because many treatments designed to prevent breast cancer recurrence inhibit the body's production or use of estrogen, the hormone that can fuel breast cancer growth, breast cancer patients often experience hot flashes and night sweats, among other side effects.\n\nThe lead author on the study, Sarah Oppeneer Nomura, PhD, of Georgetown Lombardi, said that while further research is needed in larger study populations and with more detailed dietary data, this project addresses an important gap in research on the possible role of lifestyle factors, such as dietary habits, in relation to side effects of treatments.\n\n\"These symptoms can adversely impact survivors' quality of life and can lead them to stopping ongoing treatments, she says. \"Understanding the role of life style factors is important because diet can serve as a modifiable target for possibly reducing symptoms among breast cancer survivors.\"\n\nWhen study participants were evaluated separately by race/ethnicity, associations were significant among white breast cancer survivors; however; while a trend was seen in the benefit for Chinese women, results were not statically significant. Researchers explain Chinese women typically report fewer menopausal symptoms. Most of them also consume cruciferous vegetables and soy foods, making it difficult to see a significant effect in this subgroup. Indeed, in this study, Chinese breast cancer survivors ate more than twice as much soy and cruciferous vegetables.\n\nWhether the reduction in symptoms accounts for longtime use of soy and cruciferous vegetables needs further investigation, says the study's senior author, Judy Huei-yu Wang, PhD, of Georgetown Lombardi's Cancer Prevention and Control Program.\n\nResults obtained in preclinical studies in animals show that biologically active compounds present in both soy and cruciferous vegetables cause breast cancer cells to grow, but have opposite effects in animals that consume these compounds well before cancer is diagnosed and continue consuming them during and after cancer treatments.\n\nUntil more research is conducted, breast cancer patients should not suddenly start eating soy, if they have not consumed it before, says Leena Hilakivi-Clarke, PhD, a professor of oncology at Georgetown Lombardi and a co-author of the study.\n\nResearchers also found suggestive associations with lower reporting of other symptoms, including joint problems, hair thinning/loss and memory less in women who consumed more soy foods, but these associations did not reach statistical significance.\n\nPhytochemicals, or bioactive food components, such as isoflavones in soy foods and glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables may be the source of the benefit, researchers say. Isoflavones bind to estrogen receptors and exert weak estrogenic effects, among other effects. Glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables influence levels of metabolizing enzymes that can modulate inflammation and levels of estrogen, possibly attenuating treatment-related symptoms.\n\nCo-authors of the study include Chiranjeev Dash, MBBS, MPH, PhD, Leena Hilakivi-Clarke, PhD, and Yun-Ling Zhen, MPH, PhD, from Georgetown Lombardi; Yi-Tin Hwang, PhD, from National Taipei University, Taiwan; Scarlett Lin Gomez, MPH, PhD, from the Cancer Prevention Institute of California; Teresa T.

This research builds upon previous studies demonstrating that art, music, and other similar therapies can effectively reduce symptoms of dementia without medication. By using tablet devices to employ these therapies, however, patients and providers also benefit from a computer's inherent flexibility.\n\n\"The biggest advantage is versatility,\" said Vahia. \"We know that art therapy can work, music therapy can work. The tablet, however, gives you the option of switching from one app to another easily, modifying the therapy seamlessly to suit the individual. You don't need to invest in new equipment or infrastructure.\"\n\nResearchers loaded a menu of 70 apps onto the tablets for the study. The apps were freely available on iTunes and varied greatly in their cognitive complexity--from an app that displayed puppy photos to one that featured Sudoku puzzles.\n\nThe researchers found that tablet use was safe for every patient, regardless of the severity of their dementia, and that with proper supervision and training, the engagement rate with the devices was nearly 100 percent. The study also found that the tablets demonstrated significant effectiveness in reducing symptoms of agitation, particularly--but not exclusively--among patients with milder forms of dementia.\n\nVahia cited several examples of the tablet's potential to improve a patient's condition. One particular patient, who only spoke Romanian, was very withdrawn and irritable, and medications were ineffective in controlling his symptoms.\n\n\"We started showing him Romanian video clips on YouTube, and his behavior changed dramatically and instantaneously,\" said Vahia. \"His mood improved. He became more interactive. He and his medical support team also started using a translation app so that staff could ask him simple questions in Romanian, facilitating increased interaction. These significant improvements are a clear testament of the tablet's potential as a clinical tool.\"\n\nBased on such promising outcomes, the Geriatric Psychiatry Outpatient Services clinical team is expanding the use of tablet devices as a means to control agitation in dementia patients at McLean. This will allow researchers to develop more robust data and expand the scope of the study, including a focus on specific clinical factors that may impact how patients with dementia engage with and respond to apps.\n\nMcLean Hospital is the largest psychiatric affiliate of Harvard Medical School and a member of Partners HealthCare.

Antidepressant medications are one treatment option, but there are safety concerns.\n\nOne recent study, for example, found that pregnant women who started taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the second or third trimester had a higher risk of preterm delivery than other women. SSRIs include drugs like sertraline (Zoloft), paroxetine\n\nBecause of the potential for harm from medications, many pregnant women with depression may prefer psychotherapy or other non-drug options.\n\nAcupuncture has been used for more than 2,000 years in Chinese medicine to treat a wide variety of ailments. According to traditional medicine, specific acupuncture points on the skin are connected to internal pathways that conduct energy, or qi (\u201cchee\u201d), and stimulating these points with a fine needle promotes the healthy flow of qi.\n\nModern research has most often focused on the effects of acupuncture on painful conditions, like chronic back pain and migraines. Researchers speculate that it may help ease pain by altering signals among nerve cells or affecting the release of various chemicals of the central nervous system.\n\nIt is unclear, Manber said, why acupuncture might help lessen the severity of depression.\n\nFor their study, she and her colleagues randomly assigned 52 women to receive depression-specific acupuncture twice a week for four weeks, then weekly for another four weeks. Another 49 women received control acupuncture and 49 received massage. All completed a standard measure of depression severity at the outset and again after four and eight weeks of treatment.\n\nAfter eight weeks, patients in the depression-specific acupuncture group had a higher rate of response to treatment. They were not, however, more likely to see a complete remission in their depression; about 35 percent had a remission, versus 29.5 percent in the other two groups combined - a statistically insignificant difference.\n\nFourteen women who received depression-specific acupuncture reported pain during the needling, as did seven in the control-acupuncture group.\n\nOverall, Manber\u2019s team notes, the response to acupuncture in this study was comparable to what has been seen in studies of psychotherapy for depression during pregnancy.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The requested document is forbidden.

As part of the survey, female participants had blood testing for iron deficiency as well as hemoglobin testing to identify anemia.\n\nWomen are typically tested some time in their teens for anemia -- the severe form of iron deficiency -- using a quick and affordable hemoglobin test. However, iron deficiency can develop years before anemia and can be missed by hemoglobin testing alone.\n\n\"If you think about your car, you have to run your gas tank all the way down before the red light goes on, and that's similar to the way we're screening for iron deficiency,\" said Deepa L. Sekhar, physician and associate professor of pediatrics. \"We're basically waiting until their red light goes on. You have to be really low on your iron storage before you're going to flag as anemic.\"\n\nIron deficiency without anemia has been associated with lower standardized math scores, attention deficit disorder and restless leg syndrome in children and adolescents. Among iron-deficient adolescent women there is a future risk of maternal iron deficiency and negative effects on infant health.\n\nBlood tests for iron deficiency without anemia have been developed but they are more costly and difficult to obtain in the doctor's office compared to hemoglobin testing for anemia. Sekhar and colleagues hoped to determine risk factors for iron deficiency without anemia that could pinpoint which women could benefit most from this more costly testing.\n\nIn the first study, when the researchers analyzed the NHANES study data, 9 percent of females who were 12 to 21 years old had iron deficiency without anemia. The researchers then looked at potential iron deficiency risk factors in this group, including the age when they started menstruating, as well as their race and ethnicity, poverty status, food insecurity, tobacco or nicotine use, dietary information, body mass index (BMI) and physical activity.\n\nAll of these factors have been associated with iron deficiency anemia in women in prior studies. However, the only risk factor significantly associated with iron deficiency without anemia in young women in this study was having had a period for more than three years. The research was recently published in the journal PLOS ONE.\n\nIn a second study, the researchers next looked at whether a specially developed questionnaire could better predict iron status. Questions were included on depression, poor attention and daytime sleepiness, symptoms which all have been associated with iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia, but were not captured in the prior NHANES analyses. This questionnaire was compared to the currently recommended four iron deficiency anemia-risk questions in the Bright Futures Adolescent Previsit Questionnaire, a survey recommended for physician use by the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nNinety-six female adolescents participated in this study, published in The Journal of Pediatrics. The Bright Futures questions alone did not predict iron deficiency or anemia. Yet, the researchers' risk assessment questionnaire was equally poor.\n\nTaken together, the studies suggest that risk factors and assessments should not be used to determine which young women should receive testing for iron deficiency.\n\n\"The questions aren't predictive,\" Sekhar said. \"I think we need to establish the optimal timing for an objective assessment of adolescent iron deficiency and anemia.\"\n\nSekhar believes the appropriate age may be 16 years old, when most females will have been menstruating for at least three years.\n\nIn addition to timing, further research will be needed to determine which blood test for iron deficiency without anemia is accurate, cost-efficient and practical for routine doctor's office use. This test should be given with hemoglobin testing to catch all young women on the spectrum of iron deficiency, Sekhar said.\n\nIron deficiency can be corrected with dietary changes and supplementation, Sekhar added.\n\nOther researchers on the study in PLOS ONE were Laura E.

The discovery could greatly expand the window for diagnosing concussions, especially in patients who experience a delayed onset of symptoms.\n\n\"Symptoms of a concussion, or a mild to moderate traumatic brain injury, can be subtle and are often delayed, in many cases by several days,\" said Linda Papa, MD, MSC, an emergency medicine physician and NIH funded researcher at Orlando Health and lead author of the study. \"This could provide doctors with an important tool for simply and accurately diagnosing those patients, particularly children, and making sure they are treated properly.\"\n\nIt's estimated nearly a quarter of a million children are treated in hospitals each year for concussions from playing sports, an average of nearly 700 a day. Almost all concussions in children are diagnosed only by symptoms, which are either observed, like vomiting or loss of balance, or symptoms reported by the child, like blurred vision or headaches. Neither scenario gives doctors and objective way to determine the severity of the injury.\n\n\"If patients are not diagnosed properly and treated appropriately, it could lead to long-term problems,\" said Papa. Untreated, or under-treated traumatic brain injuries like concussions, can lead to prolonged bouts with headaches, dizziness, memory loss and depression.\n\n\"This test could take the guesswork out of making a diagnosis by allowing doctors to simply look for a specific biomarker in the blood.\"\n\nThe biomarker Papa analyzed is known as a glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). These proteins are found in glial cells, which surround neurons in the brain, and when an injury occurs, the GFAP are released. What makes them unique is that they pass the blood-brain barrier and enter the bloodstream, making them easy to detect with this particular test.\n\n\"Not only were they present in the bloodstream, we were able to detect measurable levels of GFAP up to a week after the injury,\" said Papa.\n\nResearchers analyzed nearly 600 patients for 3 years. When cross-checked with scans, the blood test was able to detect mild to moderate traumatic brain lesions with up to 97 percent accuracy in patients 18 years and older. The blood test also indicated which patients were in need of life-saving neurosurgery. This suggests that the blood test could be used by clinicians for up to a week after injury to detect brain injury. This is important because many patients with concussion may not seek medical attention for days after injury.\n\nThe blood test could also dramatically cut down on the need for computerized tomography (CT) scans. Currently, CT scans are the most precise way to diagnose brain lesions, but are expensive and are associated with radiation exposure. \"Physicians really want to minimize the amount of CTs in patients, especially children, who are a lot more sensitive to radiation and the side effects that can come with it. Fortunately, this simple blood test appears to give us nearly the same information as a CT scan.\"\n\nIn fact, in a previous study published last fall, Papa and her team at Orlando Health tested both. They analyzed 152 children within 6 hours of sustaining a concussion, or mild to moderate traumatic brain injury. The results showed that the blood test was able to detect brain injuries with 94 percent accuracy, nearly as effective as state-of-the art CT scans.\n\n\"This could ultimately change the way we diagnose concussions, not only in children, but in anyone who sustains a head injury,\" said Papa. \"We have so many diagnostic blood tests for different parts of the body, like the heart, liver and kidneys, but there's never been a reliable blood test to identify trauma in the brain.

The randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study in 121 patients showed that MM36 demonstrates a statistically significant effect on the primary endpoints versus vehicle as measured by improvement in IGA score (Investigators Global Assessment) and percentage change in EASI score (Eczema Area and Severity Index). The mean percentage improvement in baseline EASI score was notable very early at week 1 (31.4% vs. 6% for vehicle; p=.0005) and at week 2 (39.0% vs. 3% for vehicle; p=.0001). These effects were sustained through week 8 of the study. MM36 was also associated with improvement in patient-reported outcomes, most notably rapid and sustained itch relief, with Visual Analog Scale scores showing improvement from moderate to mild within the first week (36.4% mean change; p=.0011).\n\nMM36, a PDE4 inhibitor, reduces inflammation in affected skin by inhibiting production of cytokines and chemical mediators that are believed to cause the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis. In particular, MM36 exhibits highly selective inhibitory activity against PDE4 subtype B, an enzyme that may play a significant role in inflammation. MM36 is expected to be the 2nd topical PDE4 inhibitor in the market after the potential approval of Anacor Pharmaceuticals' crisaborole product.\n\n\"The results of the Phase 2 study suggest that MM36 represents a potentially safe, effective and well-tolerated non-steroidal treatment for mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis,\" said Linda Stein Gold, MD, director of clinical research, Department of Dermatology at Henry Ford Hospital and co-author of the article. \"Based on the results of this study, it appears that MM36 could address an important unmet need in dermatology.\"\n\n\"We are pleased that JAAD, the most respected peer-reviewed journal in dermatology, published the Phase 2 results,\" said Bradley Glassman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Medimetriks. \"We believe these Phase 2 results demonstrate compelling evidence of MM36's capacity to be a leading topical PDE4 inhibitor and are aggressively developing MM36 for atopic dermatitis in the US. Atopic Dermatitis patients have few treatment options and Medimetriks is dedicated to addressing this important unmet need.\"\n\nThe JAAD article discussing the Phase 2 results can be found by visiting www.jaad.org.\n\nAtopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by red, swollen and cracked skin with intense itching. The onset of AD occurs most commonly between 3 and 6 months of age, with approximately 60% of patients developing the condition in the first year of life and 90% by 5 years of age. The majority of affected individuals have resolution of disease during childhood, although 10% to 30% of patients maintain the condition throughout their lives. A small percentage of the population develops first symptoms as adults. It has been estimated that approximately 18 million people are living with AD in the U.S. and this disease accounts for up to 20% of patient visits to dermatology offices.\n\nCurrent treatments for atopic dermatitis include topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors. Topical steroids are typically used as first line therapies and are effective anti-inflammatory agents. However, topical steroids may be associated with local and systemic side effects when used for extended periods of time, including skin atrophy, acne and telangiectasias locally, and HPA axis suppression systemically. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) are recommended as second-line treatment for people with atopic dermatitis who are at risk of steroid-related side effects. TCIs carry boxed warnings about a possible association with skin malignancies and lymphoma, although studies have not demonstrated a clear link. Their use can be limited by local adverse reactions such as burning and stinging.\n\nAbout MM36\n\nMedimetriks has sole, exclusive US rights to MM36. Discovered by Otsuka, MM36 is an investigational non-steroidal topical anti-inflammatory PDE-4 inhibitor in development for the potential treatment of atopic dermatitis. MM36 is hypothesized to exert anti-inflammatory action by inhibiting the production of cytokines and chemical mediators thought to cause the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis. In particular, MM36 exhibits highly selective inhibitory activity against PDE4 subtype B, which is an enzyme that may play a significant role in inflammation.\n\nOtsuka Pharmaceutical is a global healthcare company with the corporate philosophy: \"Otsuka \u2013 people creating new products for better health worldwide.\" Otsuka researches, develops, manufactures and markets innovative and original products, with a focus on pharmaceutical products for the treatment of diseases and nutraceutical products for the maintenance of everyday health.\n\nIn pharmaceuticals, Otsuka is a leader in the challenging area of mental health and also has research programs on several under-addressed diseases including tuberculosis, a significant global public health issue.

He's a professor of anesthesiology at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.\n\nThe dorsal root ganglions are nerve cells, on both sides of each of the spine's vertebra, and are the gateway to pain between nerves in different parts of the body, spinal cord and brain. Stimulating this area interrupts pain signals between the painful area and the brain, the researchers explained.\n\nA pacemaker-like device implanted under the skin in the lower back sends small electronic pulses through a wire placed near the specific dorsal root ganglion associated with the pain, McCarthy said.\n\nThe pulses replace pain with tingling or numbness. The strength of stimulation, programmed by a doctor, is based on the patient's level of pain, he said.\n\nThe treatment has two advantages over spinal cord stimulation, McCarthy said. In spinal cord stimulation, a wire runs along the spinal cord sending pulses along the entire spine, but the pulses don't target the specific pain source.\n\nIn addition, dorsal root ganglion stimulation requires significantly lower levels of electric current to quell pain, McCarthy said.\n\nThe goal of this study, he said, was to judge the effectiveness of the therapy over a long period. McCarthy and his colleagues implanted the device in 67 people suffering with chronic back pain and followed them for three to 18 months. Among the participants, 17 had the device for over a year.\n\nBefore receiving the device, most patients rated their pain as an 8 on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being the worst. For most patients, the device reduced pain by 33 percent, which was significant, the researchers reported.\n\nIn addition, patients said they experienced a 27 percent reduction in disability or limitations on daily activities caused by pain. In all, 94 percent of the participants said the treatment was beneficial.\n\nThe procedure was not without complications. Five patients needed to have the wires implanted again, two patients had them removed because they were infected, and one had the device removed because of a complication.\n\nMcCarthy said the therapy is not widely available, even though it was approved by the FDA in 2016. At the moment, its use is confined to more advanced medical centers where doctors have been trained in how to implant and regulate the device.\n\nAlso, the procedure isn't covered by all insurance companies, so out-of-pocket costs to patients can be very high. It is, however, covered by Medicare, he said.\n\nFor uninsured patients, the cost of having spine stimulation devices can range from $15,000 to $50,000 or more, according to a 2008 report funded by the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries.\n\nSpine stimulation is usually approved only after patients have not responded to other treatment, according to Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other insurance companies may have varying policies.\n\nMcCarthy hopes that more doctors will be trained in the procedure and that it will become more available, especially because it has the potential to allow patients to stop taking opioids to control their pain.\n\nOne pain specialist not involved with the study saw the benefits of this procedure.\n\n\"The results of this study are very significant,\" said Dr. Kiran Patel, director of neurosurgical pain at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\nIt shows long-term data that patients experienced significant pain relief and functional improvements, she said.\n\n\"In my pain practice and career, dorsal root ganglion stimulation therapy has been one of the most effective technologies available to combat chronic pain,\" Patel said.\n\n\"I encourage chronic pain patients to seek out physicians who are trained and experienced in the application of dorsal root ganglion stimulation therapy to determine if they are a candidate,\" she said.\n\nThe findings were presented Sunday at the American Society of Anesthesiologists annual meeting, in San Francisco.

Botulinum toxin type A is sold under different brands, but it\u2019s best known by the Allergan brand-name Botox.\n\nBotox gained fame for smoothing aging skin \u2014 by blocking nerve signals and relaxing muscles under the skin \u2014 but the product has a number of medical uses. In the U.S., Botox is approved to treat conditions like chronic migraine, excessive sweating and certain symptoms of MS: overactive bladder and muscles spasms in the arms.\n\nThe new study, published in the journal Neurology, tested the effects of Botox injections on MS-related arm tremors, which affect up to two-thirds of people with MS. Researchers found that when they gave injections to 23 patients, the treatment typically eased their tremors and improved their writing ability.\n\nRight now, there\u2019s no good way to treat MS arm tremors, said Nicholas G. LaRocca, vice-president of healthcare delivery and policy research at the National MS Society. Physical therapy and exercise have been studied, but are usually not very effective, said LaRocca, who was not involved in the new study. Surgery is sometimes used in severe cases, but it\u2019s risky and may not even have lasting benefits.\n\n\u201cExploring new treatments is important, and it\u2019s heartening to see there\u2019s some promise here,\u201d LaRocca said of the current findings. But there\u2019s still a lot to be learned, he cautioned in an interview.\n\n\u201cThis study is fairly preliminary, and it had a small number of patients,\u201d LaRocca said. Larger studies, of more-diverse groups of MS patients, are needed, he said.\n\nThe study\u2019s lead researcher agreed on the need for more work. \u201cThere are several questions that need to be answered by doing larger and longer-term studies,\u201d Dr. Anneke van der Walt, a neurologist at Royal Melbourne Hospital in Australia, said in an email.\n\nOne is how long the benefits of repeat Botox injections might last: this study tested the effects of just one Botox treatment over three months.\n\nIn real life, the injections would have to be repeated every few months, or possibly every six months for some people, according to van der Walt. Another question is whether the side effects change over time. Muscle weakness was the most common side effect in this study, van der Walt said. It affected 42 percent of the study patients, though it went away within two weeks.\n\nMuscle weakness is a potential concern in MS patients, LaRocca noted, since that problem often comes with the disease itself.\n\nThe study included 23 MS patients with mild to moderate arm tremors. Each patient received a round of Botox injections and a round of placebo injections (containing saline), three months apart. Half of the patients got the Botox first, the other half the placebo.\n\nOn average, the patients\u2019 tremor \u201cscores\u201d had gone from a 5 to a 3 six weeks after Botox treatment \u2014 which essentially means moving from \u201cmoderate\u201d to \u201cmild,\u201d LaRocca said. Their ability to write and draw a straight line had also improved by week six, and the benefits were still there at week 12.\n\nIn contrast, there were no improvements after the placebo injections.\n\nLarger studies, van der Walt said, should look at whether Botox is more effective for some tremors than others. Tremors limited to the hand and forearm, for instance, might respond better than tremors that also affect the shoulder. If Botox is eventually approved for this MS symptom, LaRocca said it will be important for doctors to get training in how to give the injections \u2014 since the drug has to go into carefully chosen locations in the muscle.\n\n\u201cSo practitioners will have to be up to speed,\u201d LaRocca said. There will also be the matter of cost. That will vary from patient to patient, depending on how many injections are needed per treatment.\n\nAccording to van der Walt, the cost could range from $500 to $1,000 Australian dollars, which are roughly equal to U.S. dollars. In the U.S., Botox treatments can cost $455-$575 per injection site.\n\nBotox maker Allergan supplied the product for the study, and two of the researchers on the work have financial ties to the company.

So sure is he of the science behind it that he frequently applies the stuff of his research on himself -- and on his wife.\n\n\"She had a persistent boil on her buttocks,\" he explained. Since no standard salves had helped, he liquefied a dollop of a particular variety of honey known as manuka in the kitchen microwave, poured it over gauze and applied it.\n\n\"Fortunately, manuka is effective in treating burns as well as boils,\" Molan said cheerfully. Within a short time, he said, both boil and burn healed.\n\nManuka honey -- widely used for wound treatment in New Zealand, where Molan is co-director of Waikato University's Honey Research Unit -- is becoming increasingly accepted for this purpose around the world. Research over the past two decades, much of it conducted in Molan's lab, has focused on the potential for manuka to be used as an antimicrobial that may one day stand alongside such standard wound treatments as silver dressings and penicillin.\n\nManuka has also attracted attention because, in an era when the efficacy of pharmaceutical antibiotics is under threat, it has shown some promise in the treatment of wounds infected with especially challenging bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the superbug whose incidence increased 32-fold in U.S. hospitals between 1976 and 2003, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nManuka dressings have been in use for some time in Great Britain and Australia as well as in New Zealand; earlier this year they were cleared for use as an antimicrobial dressing in Canada; and last month the Food and Drug Administration cleared them for use in wound and burn care -- though not as an antimicrobial drug -- making them the first honey-based products cleared for medical use in the United States.\n\nThe picture has not always been so bright for manuka, or its manufacturers. New Zealand's scrubby manuka trees with their creamy blossoms used to be chopped down for farmland. Beekeepers regarded manuka honey as almost worthless, feeding it to their bees or simply discarding it: It was difficult to process, its taste too strong and bitter, its color too dark. In short, it seemed \"medicinal.\"\n\nThis began to change with Molan's work. He had spent his career examining the possible antibacterial properties of various natural substances: milk, yeast, bull semen. At a colleague's suggestion, he began looking into manuka honey, and for the past 25 years he has led the way in this particular aspect of apitherapy, the study of honey as a medicine.\n\nSurrounded by the pipettes and petri dishes of his lab, and with a strip of manuka dressing wrapped around a cut finger, Molan says, \"Manuka honey tastes like medicine because it is medicine.\"\n\nToday, New Zealand's Active Manuka Honey Association estimates that 120 tons are sold each year, with sales of almost $10 million annually. Manuka is proving to be a moneymaker for many companies that market it online as \"nature's miracle\" and \"nature's greatest secret,\" claiming it can relieve everything from stomach ulcers to bedsores and sinus infections. Although Molan says he has no direct financial interests in honey, the honey research unit was set up with support from New Zealand's Honey Industry Trust, and his work has resulted in his university's signing a multimillion-dollar contract last year with New Zealand health-care products company Comvita.\n\nAll honey is medicinal to some extent. Its low water content allows it to draw fluid away from wounds; its high sugar content makes it difficult for microorganisms to grow. What's more, worker bees secrete an enzyme, glucose oxidase, into nectar, which releases low levels of the disinfectant hydrogen peroxide when honey makes contact with a damp surface such as a wound. Because of a chemical reaction with tissue, honey also makes healing wounds smell good.\n\nFrom the time of the ancient Sumerians, who prescribed a mix of river dust and honey for ailing eyes, until the early 20th century, honey was a conventional therapy in fighting infection, but its popularity waned with the advent in the mid-20th century of a potent, naturally occurring antibiotic: the blue-green mold penicillin.\n\nNot all honeys are equal, though. Manuka appears to have a poorly understood antimicrobial ingredient, dubbed its Unique Manuka Factor (UMF). The level of UMF can vary, and each batch of manuka is ranked according to its UMF value: The higher the concentration, the darker, thicker and more expensive the manuka is. A 250-gram jar with UMF16, which is in the midrange, sells for about $28.95 on the Internet.\n\nAs with other natural health-care products, many of the claims for manuka's efficacy are sweeping and scantily supported. Molan distances himself from the notion, for example, that, once ingested, manuka acts as a rejuvenator. The most promising research, he and many other scientists say, focuses instead on bioactive honey's potency as a topical application.\n\nThe South African Medical Journal reported in 2006 on a trial among gold miners in which honey worked as well as, and was more cost-effective than, a standard gel on shallow wounds and abrasions.\n\nThe European Journal of Medical Research reported in 2003 that honey had an 85 percent success rate in treating infected post-op Caesarean wounds, compared with a 50 percent success rate for conventional interventions.\n\nOne reason for the heightened interest in honey is that traditional antibiotics are proving increasingly powerless against certain microbes. In 2000, a World Health Organization report warned: \"Since 1970, no new classes of antibacterials have been developed to combat infectious diseases.\" On average, the report said, \"research and development of anti-infective drugs takes 10 to 20 years.\" Today, according to the CDC, \"nearly all significant bacterial infections in the world are becoming resistant to the most commonly prescribed antibiotic treatments.\"\n\nHence the hope that a naturally occurring substance such as honey might help fill the void.\n\nMolan offers anecdotal evidence from a ward at Waikato Hospital, where MRSA has been a persistent problem. The charge nurse, he says, began placing manuka on all wounds. \"Not only did manuka clear up the infections, there were no cross-infections,\" Molan says. \"Now, whenever MRSA appears at Waikato Hospital, they choose honey dressings.\"\n\nAt the May meeting of the European Wound Management Association, researchers presented the results of a small Irish study that compared the effects of manuka honey and a commonly used hydrogel dressing on 100 patients with chronic leg ulcerations. Those patients treated with manuka dressings experienced a higher rate of cleansing and faster healing than those who used the hydrogel dressing. Ten of the patients had ulcers colonized with MRSA. After four weeks, seven of those 10 wounds no longer showed the bacteria's presence. The results have not yet been published.\n\nEven scientists who are intrigued by manuka's promise recognize that more research needs to be done. (And there's wide agreement among medical professionals that people should not test the treatment themselves by slathering their cuts and burns with honey from the pantry shelf.)\n\nAndrew Jull, a research fellow at the University of Auckland's Clinical Trials Research Unit and principal investigator in a trial in New Zealand of 368 patients into the use of honey as a therapy for leg ulcers, says that while \"there is reasonable evidence for manuka honey's antibacterial effect\" in the lab, \"there is still need for in vivo testing.\"\n\nMolan suggests there may be another reason the United States has been slower than some other countries to adopt medicinal honey: the scientific establishment's resistance to traditional remedies.\n\nHe believes it's not customers or patients who need convincing, \"it's the medical community. They find it difficult to accept anything that has an ancient lineage, whatever the scientific evidence,\" he says. \"But manuka is catching on fast.\"\n\nSo much so that in July the FDA gave Derma Sciences, a manufacturer of wound-care products based in Princeton, N.J., clearance to sell manuka wound and burn dressings as medical devices. The company, which has been developing manuka products since 2005, buys medical-grade honey from Comvita, which receives unprocessed honey from beekeepers in New Zealand. The dressings should be available this fall.\n\nRose Cooper, a microbiologist and honey expert at the University of Wales Institute at Cardiff, remains cautiously optimistic that the increased use of honey dressings will help better information to emerge.\n\n\"Honey is not a panacea,\" she said in a telephone interview, but it has been used by British doctors for several years, and with its growing use elsewhere in the world, \"health-care professionals will be more likely to consider honey in treating wounds, and so more data will accumulate.\" \u00b7\n\nEric Frederick Trump is a science journalist and a research associate of the Trauma and Violence Interdisciplinary Studies Program at New York University.

Peled of Peled Plastic Surgery, San Francisco. He hopes his new technique will \"lower the bar to adoption\" of effective surgical treatment for patients with this debilitating headache condition.\n\nIn recent years, surgery has emerged as an effective treatment option for selected patients with chronic, severe headaches. Developed by plastic surgeons who noticed that some migraine patients had fewer headaches after cosmetic forehead-lift, these procedures address \"trigger sites\" linked to certain headache patterns.\n\nSevere temporal headaches can result from muscle spasms or enlarged blood vessels putting pressure on specific nerves located on the side of the head--specifically, the zygomaticotemporal branch of the trigeminal nerve (ZTBTN) and sometimes the auriculotemporal nerve (ATN). During these operative procedures, surgeons seek to relieve pressure on these nerves or to disconnect the nerves in order to prevent them from triggering future headaches.\n\nThe technique is a new use of an approach that many surgeons are already familiar with: the Gillies incision, used for surgical repair of cheekbone fractures. Dr. Peled found that this short incision, placed in the temple behind the hairline, provides direct access to the ZTBTN and ATN. He describes his initial experience with the new approach in 19 patients.\n\nAll patients had chronic temporal headaches that did not improve with medications. They also had a positive result on preoperative testing--either injection of botulinum toxin (Botox) to temporarily block muscle activity, or local anesthetics to temporarily block the involved nerve. Before and after surgery, headache symptoms were assessed using a standard score, the Migraine Headache Index (MHI).\n\nAs in previous studies, surgery provided significant relief from chronic temporal headaches. Average MHI score decreased from about 132 points before surgery to 52 points afterward. Of the 19 patients, 16 had at least a 50 percent reduction in headache symptoms.\n\nIt's unclear why the three remaining patients didn't have good improvement, although Dr. Peled notes that two of the three had had temporal headaches for decades before surgery. None of the patients experienced complications, and there was little or no visible scarring.\n\nThe experience supports a growing body of research showing good outcomes with surgery for chronic temporal headaches. Most recently, a study in Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery reported similar results whether the nerve is decompressed or disconnected. However, previous studies have used technically more complex approaches to access the ZTBTN.\n\nThe simplified approach using the Gillies incision combines the advantages of other approaches to chronic temporal headache surgery while minimizing the disadvantages, Dr. Peled believes.

But another from the United States gives more weight to findings from Africa that show the procedure, when it's performed on adult men, makes a major difference in preventing such diseases as AIDS.\n\nThe findings come as the American Academy of Pediatrics debates updating its recommendations regarding circumcision among newborns. The academy now takes a neutral stance.\n\nIn general, \"there is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the risks and benefits of circumcision,\" said Dr. Douglas S. Diekema, a pediatrician at the University of Washington who's familiar with both reviews and serves on a task force working on the academy's recommendations.\n\n\"There are some clear benefits to circumcision,\" he said. \"There are some risks to circumcision, although the significant ones appear to be rare.\"\n\nNot so, write the Australian researchers, who examined eight studies for a review in the latest issue of the Annals of Family Medicine. Two studies involved neonatal circumcision, and six involved older males, roughly 14 to 49 years old.\n\nThe review's lead author, researcher Caryn Perera of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, said the risk of major complications ranges from 2 percent to 10 percent. \"These may be considered unacceptable for an elective procedure,\" she said.\n\nParents who think circumcision has medical benefits should be aware that there's \"a lack of consensus and robust evidence\" on that, she added.\n\nThough African studies have linked circumcision in adult men to lower rates of sexually transmitted diseases, including the virus that causes AIDS, Perera said that only future studies will tell if those findings are applicable to the Western world, where AIDS is much less prevalent.\n\nAnd there's more to consider, Perera said. She said that circumcision poses problems from a mental point of view, potentially causing \"significant anger or feeling incomplete, hurt, frustrated, abnormal or violated.\"\n\nAs to whether circumcision reduces sexual sensitivity, Perera said there's no evidence that it affects sensation when performed on adults. The highest-quality studies, known as randomized controlled trials, don't report whether infant circumcision affects sensation, she said.\n\nA review in the January issue of Archives of Pediatrics & and Adolescent Medicine, which examined three studies, took a different tack.

A new wearable medical device developed by Kumamoto University has been found to effect visceral fat loss and improve blood glucose (sugar). The current study reports clinical trial results for optimal use frequency.\n\nType 2 diabetes is a disease of systemic organ failure due to chronic hyperglycemia and inflammation from the accumulation of excess visceral fat. Metabolic disorders such as hyperglycemia attenuate stress resistance in the human body and exacerbate insulin resistance. The ability of insulin to lower blood sugar levels is reduced and insulin secretion is decreased.\n\nThe heat shock response (HSR) is activated as a response to stress in the human body, but its function decreased in those with type 2 diabetes. A research team from Kumamoto University, Japan has found that by restoring the function of HSP72, the main protein of HSR, improved glucose-related abnormalities. The team found that a suitable combination of mild electrical stimulation (MES) with heat shock (HS) activated HSP72 more efficiently.\n\nThe researchers developed a belt-type medical device that uses a special type of rubber to transmit MES and HS at the same time. They then performed a clinical trial of MES + HS on 40 obese men suffering from type 2 diabetes. Results showed a decrease fasting glucose levels, a loss of visceral fat, improve insulin resistance, and a significant (-0.43%) improvement in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values. About half of all subjects (52.5%) achieved less than 7.0% HbA1c, which is a treatment goal for diabetes. The first trial showed that activation of the HSR produced a large therapeutic effect.\n\nIn the researcher's next clinical trial, 60 obese patients with type 2 diabetes from both genders were given a 12-week treatment with the belt-shaped MES+HS medical device.

It's a fantastic alternative to treat patients with these diseases, and this study will help doctors when they discuss [treatment options] with patients.\"\n\nBakkum-Gomez has also used the method in her practice and is conducting a study of the IUD, which was originally designed as a contraceptive device, for this purpose.\n\nAbout 3 percent to 5 percent of women who get endometrial cancer, which affects the womb lining, are under the age of 40 and will lose their fertility if they undergo a hysterectomy. The majority of these women have not yet had children, according to background information in the article.\n\nAlthough the IUD is not yet approved to treat endometrial cancer, it is approved and widely used to treat endometriosis and abnormal uterine bleeding.\n\nWhile hysterectomy or removal of the uterus is the accepted treatment for this kind of cancer, doctors have been using the hormone in oral form for the past 20 years, but only for \"well-selected groups of women,\" said Dr. Elizabeth Poynor, a gynecologic oncologist and pelvic surgeon with Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"Well selected,\" in this case, means those with early-stage disease who want to maintain their fertility, much like the group in this trial.\n\nOral hormone treatment to slow down the cancer's growth is a systemic therapy, however, and can have adverse side effects such as skin rashes, nausea and vomiting, headaches and abnormal uterine bleeding, according to background material accompanying the study.\n\nThe theoretical -- but still unproven -- advantage to this new IUD method, Poynor said, is that \"there is a lower risk of systemic side effects . . . and that you may be giving higher doses of the drug directly into the uterus.\"\n\nThe authors followed 20 Italian patients from January 1996 to June 2009 with atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH), which often precedes the cancer, and 14 women with early-stage endometrial cancer confined to the inner layer of the womb.\n\nParticipants -- all of whom were between ages 20 and 40 -- had an IUD known as Mirena, which released levonorgestrel, inserted for a year. They also received monthly injections of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which halts estrogen production, for six months.\n\nThe IUD was removed at the end of the year if there was no evidence of cancer.\n\nNinety-five percent of women with AEH initially saw their lesions disappear completely, while 57.1 percent of women with early-stage cancer also responded completely to the treatment.

Chan School of Public Health, the U.S. National Cancer Institute, and more than 20 other medical centers and organizations finds that higher circulating vitamin D concentrations are significantly associated with lower colorectal cancer risk. This study strengthens the evidence, previously considered inconclusive, for a protective relationship. Optimal vitamin D concentrations for colorectal cancer prevention may be higher than the current National Academy of Medicine recommendations, which are based only on bone health. The study appears online in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nVitamin D, known for its role in maintaining bone health, is hypothesized to lower colorectal cancer risk via several pathways related to cell growth and regulation. Previous prospective studies have reported inconsistent results for whether higher concentrations of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the accepted measure of vitamin D status, are linked to lower risk of colorectal cancer. The few randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation and colorectal cancer completed thus far have not shown an effect; but study size, supplementation duration, and compliance may have contributed to their null findings.\n\n\"To address inconsistencies in prior studies on vitamin D and to investigate associations in population subgroups, we analyzed participant-level data, collected before colorectal cancer diagnosis, from 17 prospective cohorts and used standardized criteria across the studies,\" said Stephanie Smith-Warner, PhD, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and co-senior author on the article. The analysis included over 5,700 colorectal cancer cases and 7,100 controls from the United States, Europe, and Asia. A single, widely accepted assay and laboratory was used for new vitamin D measurements and calibration of existing vitamin D measurements. \"In the past, substantial differences between assays made it difficult to integrate vitamin D data from different studies,\" explained Regina G. Ziegler, PhD, a National Cancer Institute epidemiologist and co-senior author on the article. \"This calibration approach enabled us to systematically explore risk over the broad range of vitamin D levels seen internationally.\"\n\nCompared to participants with circulating vitamin D concentrations considered sufficient for bone health, those with deficient concentrations of vitamin D had a 31% higher risk of colorectal cancer during follow-up, which averaged 5.5 years (range: 1 - 25 years). Similarly, concentrations above bone health sufficiency were associated with a 22% lower risk. However, risk did not continue to decline at the highest concentrations. These associations persisted even after adjusting for known colorectal cancer risk factors. Protective associations were seen in all subgroups examined. However, the association was noticeably stronger in women than men at concentrations above bone health sufficiency. The lifetime risk of colorectal cancer is 4.2% (1 in 24) in women and 4.5% (1 in 22) in men. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women in the United States, with about 140,250 new cases and 50,630 deaths expected during 2018.\n\n\"Currently, health agencies do not recommend vitamin D for the prevention of colorectal cancer,\" said Marji L. McCullough, ScD, American Cancer Society epidemiologist and co-first author of the study. \"This study adds new information that agencies can use when reviewing evidence for vitamin D guidance and suggests that the concentrations recommended for bone health may be lower than would be optimal for colorectal cancer prevention.\"\n\nVitamin D can be obtained in the diet, particularly from fortified foods, from supplements, and from sun exposure.

All of the patients were on standard medications, and some had heart devices implanted.\n\nStem cells are primitive cells that mature into the various cells that make up the body's tissues. In the past 15 years or so, scientists have tried to use the cells to help repair some of the damage seen in heart failure.\n\nHeart failure is a progressive disease where the heart muscle is too damaged to efficiently pump blood throughout the body. It often arises after a heart attack.\n\nSymptoms of heart failure include fatigue, breathlessness and swelling in the limbs. The condition cannot be cured, although medications and implantable devices can treat the symptoms.\n\nIn the new study, the researchers used stem cells from the patients' own thigh muscle to create a patch they placed on the heart.\n\nThat's in contrast to many past studies, where researchers have injected stem cells -- often from patients' bone marrow -- into the heart.\n\nThe patch tactic could have some advantages, said senior researcher Dr. Yoshiki Sawa, of Osaka University.\n\nHe said animal research suggests that cells in sheet form survive for a longer period, compared to injections.\n\nTo test the safety of the approach, Sawa's team recruited 27 patients who had debilitating symptoms despite standard heart failure therapies. The scientists extracted stem cells from each patient's thigh muscle, then cultured the cells so that they formed a sheet.\n\nThe sheet was placed on each patient's heart.\n\nThe tactic appeared safe, the researchers said, and there were signs of symptom improvements over the next six months to a year.\n\nWhy would stem cells from the thigh muscle affect the heart? It's not clear, Sawa acknowledged.\n\nThe stem cells don't grow into new heart muscle cells. Instead, Sawa explained, they seem to produce chemicals called cytokines that can promote new blood vessel growth in damaged areas of the heart. The theory, he said, is that \"hibernating\" cells in the heart muscle can then function better.\n\nStill, it's too soon to know what the new findings mean, said Gorodeski.\n\nThis type of trial, called phase 1, is designed to look at the safety and feasibility of a therapy, Gorodeski said. It takes later-phase trials -- where some patients receive the treatment, and others do not -- to prove that a therapy actually works.\n\nThose trials are underway, Sawa said.\n\nOther studies are further along. Last year, researchers reported on a trial testing infusions of stem cells taken from the bone marrow of patients with severe heart failure.\n\nPatients who received the therapy were less likely to die or be hospitalized over the next year, versus those given standard treatment only. But the study was small, and the stem cells had only a minor impact on patients' heart function.\n\nSo it's not clear why the stem-cell patients fared better, Gorodeski said.\n\nFor now, he stressed, all stem-cell therapies for heart failure remain experimental.\n\n\"There's no cell therapy that we can offer patients right now,\" Gorodeski said.\n\nThe message for patients, he added, is that heart failure can be treated, and researchers are looking for \"innovative\" ways to improve that treatment.\n\nThe study was published April 5 in the Journal of the American Heart Association.\n\nThe American Heart Association has more on heart failure.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "This is a close one.

Like every new study of prostate cancer, the results need to be carefully parsed.\n\nFirst, the study results, which appear in this week's New England Journal of Medicine. It's actually an update of a 2008 report, with an additional three years of data on the nearly 700 men who volunteered for the trial up to 15 years ago. All of them had early-stage prostate cancer at the beginning.\n\nThe study found 38 percent fewer prostate cancer deaths among men randomly assigned to the surgery group versus those in what the Swedes called the watchful-waiting group. Men who had surgery had 41 percent lower risk of their cancer spreading throughout the body, and 66 percent less risk of growth within the prostate.\n\nThe survival benefits were restricted to men under 65. For this group, surgery saved one life for every seven men who had prostatectomies \u2014 considered a favorable ratio. And it applied to men with tumors considered low-risk, meaning they have a relatively low Gleason score, a marker of tumor aggressiveness.\n\n\"Our findings show that some tumors that are considered to be low-risk at diagnosis do pose a threat to life, especially if they are not surgically removed,\" the study authors write.\n\nSo is this a slam-dunk for radical prostatectomy? Game over?\n\nFar from it. In an editorial accompanying the study, Dr. Dr. Matthew Smith of Massachusetts General Hospital makes some important points.\n\nFirst, only about 1 in 20 men in the Swedish study had a prostate cancer diagnosis based on a high PSA level. Almost 90 percent had tumors their doctors could feel on digital rectal exams. But in the U.S., most prostate cancers are identified by PSA screening, and less than half have palpable tumors.\n\nThis is important, because experts believe many prostate tumors found by PSA are likely to be slow-growing \u2014 perhaps so slow they will never cause a problem before the man dies of something else.\n\nSo \"low risk\" in the Swedish study means higher-risk than the current \"low risk\" men diagnosed in the United States. By the way, 9 out of 10 prostate cancers in the U.S. these days is considered low risk.\n\nSecond, the Swedish study compared radical prostatectomy to watchful waiting. And Smith points out that \"watchful waiting\" does not mean the same thing as \"active surveillance.\"\n\n\"Watchful waiting means we're not going to treat you now and if you progress clinically, we'll treat you with hormone therapy \u2013 not with curative intent,\" Smith tells Shots.\n\n\"Active surveillance means observing the patient in a proactive way, with regularly scheduled biopsies,\" he adds. If there's a sign the cancer is progressing, doctors currently would treat with intent to cure, using surgery, radiation or both.\n\nSmith makes another point: Both surgical techniques and radiation therapy technology have improved since the Swedish study was done. So there's reason to think men followed with active surveillance and treated when necessary would fare better than the \"watchful waiting\" group in the newly published study.\n\nUnfortunately, there haven't been any large studies in which prostatectomy and radiation therapy have been compared in patients with early-stage prostate cancer who have been randomly assigned to one or the other.\n\nTwo such studies are underway. Results are some years off. But Smith warns against assuming those results will settle the question of how men with early-stage prostate cancer should be treated.\n\n\"There will always be questions, and an ongoing need to individualize therapy,\" he says.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story mentioned the use of newer surgical techniques than those used to treat the men in the study who underwent prostatectomy.

In this study, the serum presence of a mesothelioma-specific form of the ENOX2 protein (a recently identified marker of malignancy) was found within the serum of asbestos-exposed individuals an average of 6.2 years in advance of clinical symptoms by using the ONCOblot tissue of origin cancer detection test.\n\nSerum samples that were collected from asbestos-exposed individuals prior to the development of mesothelioma as part of a cancer surveillance program were tested for ENOX2 protein presence to determine how long in advance of clinical symptoms that the mesothelioma-specific ENOX2 protein transcript variants could be detected.\n\nThe results of this study showed that two mesothelioma-specific ENOX2 protein transcript variants were detected in the serum of asbestos-exposed individuals 4-10 years prior to clinical diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma, an exciting sign of progress in the cancer detection field.\n\n\"The completion of this trial is an exciting new chapter for our work,\" says Nick Miner, Vice President of Business Development. \"Although asbestos-induced mesothelioma is a very specific example of early detection, we are currently pursuing larger-scale clinical trials to investigate the utility of the ENOX2 protein marker to predict the onset of cancers of other tissues of origin as well.\" Miner continued.\n\nAlthough the fight against cancer often appears to be an overwhelmingly intransigent problem, significant progress is being made regarding the development of additional tools for cancer detection, such as the ONCOblot Test.\n\nThe ONCOblot\u00ae Test was developed and created by Dr. D. James Morr\u00e9 and Dr. Dorothy M. Morr\u00e9 of MorNuCo Inc., located in the Purdue Research Park, West Lafayette, IN. The Morr\u00e9's are committed to the premise that understanding cancer is the key to its conquest. The ONCOblot\u00ae test is based on more than 20 years of basic research. The ONCOblot test is a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) that was developed at MorNuCo Inc. The ONCOblot Test is CLIA registered and meets all current FDA regulations as an LDT. A 510(k) application is being prepared for submission to the FDA to register the ONCOblot test as a medical device.\n\nIf you'd like more information about the ONCOblot\u00ae Test, please visit http://www. or e-mail info@oncoblotlabs.com\n\nIf you'd like to read the clinical study, please visit http://clinicalproteomicsjournal.", "question": "Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The release doesn\u2019t mention any alternatives to the sponsor\u2019s test.

In women agreeing to participate, this led to a 28 per cent reduction in hip fractures over five years.\n\nProfessor Neil Gittoes, of the University of Birmingham's Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, said: \"Our findings showed that screening led to a statistically significant decrease in hip fractures. \"Our data has the potential to influence national policies around prevention of hip fractures, which is particularly relevant in our ageing society. The consequences of hip fractures to older people can be devastating, including impaired mobility and loss of independence. \"While we have demonstrated clinical effectiveness of screening, we are also exploring cost-effectiveness of this approach; initial analyses also look promising in this respect.\"\n\nProfessor Lee Shepstone, from UEA's Norwich Medical School, said: \"Approximately one in three women and one in five men aged over 50 year will suffer a fragility fracture during their remaining lifetime. In the UK around 536,000 people suffer fragility fractures each year, including 79,000 hip fractures.\n\n\"A hip fracture can be devastating with a loss of independence and less than one third of patients make a full recovery. Mortality at one-year post-fracture is approximately 20 per cent.\"\n\n\"We wanted to find out whether screening, like screening for breast cancer, could help identify those at risk of suffering a fracture.\"\n\nThe team used a University of Sheffield developed tool called FRAX, which predicts the probability of a hip fracture or a major osteoporotic fracture (a hip, spine, upper arm or lower arm fracture), to identify older women at high risk.\n\nA total of 12,483 women aged 70-85 were recruited from 100 GP practices in seven regions -Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester, Norwich, Sheffield, Southampton, and York. Half of the women were screened to compare screening with routine care.\n\nAmong those screened, treatment was subsequently recommended for one in seven women deemed at high risk of hip fracture. This recommendation was acted upon by the women and their GPs so that over three quarters of the women at high risk were on osteoporosis medications within six months of screening.\n\nWhile screening did not reduce the incidence of all osteoporosis-related fractures, there was strong evidence for a reduction in hip fractures.\n\nIn the screening group, there were 54 fewer women who suffered one or more hip fractures compared to the routine care group.\n\nThe study suggests that one hip fracture could be prevented for every 111 women screened and early analysis suggests the approach is likely to be cost-effective.\n\nProfessor Shepstone added: \"This is the first trial to show that a community-screening approach based on the FRAX fracture risk tool is both feasible and effective. Given that the number of costly and debilitating hip fractures are expected to increase with an ageing population, the results of this study potentially have important public health implications.\"\n\nProfessor Eugene McCloskey, of the University of Sheffield, said: \"Low-cost screening with FRAX among the older population could result in effective, targeted intervention to reduce the human and socioeconomic burden of hip fractures.\n\n\"If the SCOOP screening strategy was taken up in exactly the same way as in the study in all UK women aged 70-85 years, we estimate that the strategy could prevent up to 8000 hip fractures per year in the UK. Even greater gains could be made if we could reach out to women similar to those who did not take part in the study.\"\n\nThe randomised controlled trial 'SCreening for Osteoporosis in Older women for the Prevention of fracture' (SCOOP) was funded by the Medical Research Council and Arthritis Research UK.\n\nDr Natalie Carter, head of research liaison and evaluation at Arthritis Research UK, said: \"Ten of thousands of people a year present with hip fractures in the UK. As well as significantly increasing mortality, a hip fracture can stop a person's ability to live independently, with 43% no longer being able to walk independently in the year after the fracture. \"We welcome this community based screening programme and any other research that reduces the likelihood of fractures.\"\n\nFor further information or interviews contact Emma McKinney, Press Office, University of Birmingham, at +44 (0)121 414 6681 or contact the Press Office out of hours on 44-0-7789-921165.\n\u2022 The University of Birmingham is ranked amongst the world's top 100 institutions.

Based on the study results, the intervention is promising for people in the initial stages of adjustment to any serious chronic illness.\n\nThe paper was published recently in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology.\n\nThe HIV study is part of a larger body of positive affect research being conducted by Moskowitz. She also is studying the health effects of teaching the skills to individuals with type 2 diabetes, women with metastatic breast cancer and caregivers of dementia patients.\n\nFor the HIV study, which was based in San Francisco, 80 participants (primarily men) were taught a set of eight skills over five weekly sessions to help them experience more positive emotions. Another 79 participants were in the control group.\n\nMoskowitz and colleagues designed the tools based on evidence showing these particular skills increase positive emotions. Some of the skills included:\n\n1) Recognizing a positive event each day \n\n2) Savoring that positive event and logging it in a journal or telling someone about it \n\n3) Starting a daily gratitude journal \n\n4) Listing a personal strength each day and noting how you used this strength recently \n\n5) Setting an attainable goal each day and noting your progress \n\n6) Reporting a relatively minor stressor each day, then listing ways in which the event can be positively reappraised.

In addition to the potential benefit of a lower viral load on the infected person, there may be public health benefits.\n\n\"From a public health perspective, that is potentially huge for prevention of HIV,\" Moskowitz said. \"HIV is less likely to be transmitted with a low viral load. To have a difference like that is amazing.\"\n\nThe reduced viral load could be because of a stronger immune system, Moskowitz said. Observational studies in people living with HIV have shown positive emotion is related to a higher CD4 count (an indicator of less HIV-related damage to the immune system). Or, the reduced viral load may be the result of participants' better adherence to their antiretroviral drug therapy, which generally leads to a suppressed or undetectable viral load, Moskowitz said.\n\nThe positive emotion intervention also improved mental health. At baseline, about 17 percent of the control group and intervention group reported being on antidepressants. Fifteen month later, the intervention group was still at 17 percent but the control group's antidepressant use rose to 35 percent.\n\n\"The group that learned coping skills did not increase antidepressant use, whereas overall the control group increased its antidepressant use,\" Moskowitz said.

It is known that monounsaturated fats can help lower levels of bad cholesterol, reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\nFor their study, Kris-Etherton and colleagues set out to assess how avocado consumption - by replacing saturated fatty acids, or \"bad\" fats - affected risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases.\n\nThe team recruited 45 healthy participants aged 21-70 years who were either obese or overweight.\n\nEvery participant was required to follow each of three cholesterol-lowering diets for 5 weeks. The diets consisted of a lower-fat diet without avocado, a moderate-fat diet without avocado or a moderate-fat diet with one Hass avocado a day.\n\nPrior to starting each diet, subjects ate what the researchers deem an \"average American diet,\" which was made up of 34% of calories from fat, 16% from protein, while around half of calories were from carbohydrates.\n\nFrom both of the moderate-fat diets, participants gained 34% of calories from fat, of which 17% were from monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). The lower-fat diet provided participants with 24% of calories from fat, of which 11% was from MUFAs.\n\nModerate-fat diet with one avocado a day lowered 'bad' cholesterol by 13.5 mg/dL\n\nThe researchers found that participants' levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) - referred to as the \"bad\" cholesterol - were an average of 8.3 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) lower after following the lower-fat diet without an avocado and 7.4 mg/dL lower after following the moderate-fat diet without an avocado, compared with their baseline average.\n\nHowever, after participants followed the moderate-fat diet with one avocado a day, their LDL levels were found to be an average of 13.5 mg/dL lower than their baseline average.\n\nWhat is more, the team found that a number of additional blood measurements - such as total cholesterol, small dense LDL, triglycerides and non-HDL (high-density lipoprotein) - were better after participants followed the moderate-fat diet with one avocado a day, compared with the other two diets.\n\nAlthough these findings demonstrate that an avocado a day alongside a moderate-fat diet has the potential to reduce bad cholesterol, the team notes that their research was a controlled feeding study. \"That is not the real-world,\" says Kris-Etherton, \"so it is a proof-of-concept investigation.\"\n\nStill, the team believes their findings indicate that people should consider replacing saturated fatty acids in their diet with healthier fats from avocados and other sources.

It is a painful infection of a single sensory nerve on one side of the body that can occur almost anywhere but most commonly involves the torso or face. Initial symptoms of tingling or burning pain within days develop into a red bumpy rash and very painful blisters.\n\nThe blisters heal in a week or two to form crusty scabs that eventually fall off. But for about 15 percent of people, shingles does not end there. Instead, it leaves them with deep, searing nerve pain \u2014 a condition called postherpetic neuralgia, or PHN \u2014 that can last for months or years and has no treatment or cure. More than half the cases of PHN affect people over 60.\n\nOther possible complications of shingles include pneumonia, hearing problems, blindness and encephalitis.\n\nThat\u2019s not all.

It also reduces the risk of PHN by 86 percent, and it appears to be longer lasting than Zostavax, which starts to lose its protection after three years.\n\nWhat makes Shingrix so much better is the inclusion of a substance called an adjuvant that boosts the body\u2019s immune response to the vaccine. Another difference is that Zostavax contains a live, weakened virus, making it unsuitable for people with poor immunity, whereas Shingrix contains a nonliving virus particle and may eventually be approved for those with compromised immunity, who are especially susceptible to a severe case of shingles.\n\nI should tell you that the new vaccine is not exactly a walk in the park.

They range from patient demands to malpractice fears to financial incentives and doctors\u2019 own lack of understanding of the risks and benefits of screening.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of pressures,\u201c said Dr. Gerald L. Andriole, a urologic surgeon at Washington University. \u201cIt is not all pure data that is promoting aggressive screening.\u201d Dr. Andriole is directing a National Cancer Institute study of 76,000 men that failed to find a screening benefit after 10 years. The men were aged 55 to 74 when the study began. P.S.A. screening is controversial at any age. Screening proponents say the cancer institute study was flawed and point to a European study of 162,000 men aged 55 to 69 that showed a 20 percent drop in the prostate cancer death rate with screening.\n\nScreening critics say the European study was flawed and add that there is a logical reason it has been hard to show a screening benefit.\n\nThey note that prostate cancer is a common cancer, found in most men\u2019s prostates on autopsy, although often the men had no idea they had it. The cancer can be lethal, but it usually grows so slowly that men die with it, not because of it.\n\nFor most men, screening only has harms because it leads to biopsies and treatments with unpleasant side effects. And, they say, it might not help cure many deadly prostate cancers because those cancers may have already spread outside the prostate, microscopically seeding other organs, long before a P.S.A. test indicates a possible problem.\n\nA positive P.S.A. test usually leads to a biopsy and then, if cancer is found, to a decision about whether to treat it. Nearly all men opt for treatment, which includes surgery to remove the prostate or radiation to destroy the cancer. Side effects can include impotence and incontinence.\n\nEven younger men should weigh the harms of screening, says Dr. Lisa Schwartz of Dartmouth Medical School. \u201cYou also have the potential to wreck their lives,\u201d she said.\n\nOne reason treatment is the most common choice is that it is hard to know if a cancer is lethal. Pathologists can distinguish between cancers that look particularly aggressive and those that do not, but there is a real possibility that even if tissue obtained at a biopsy has only less aggressive tumor cells, more aggressive cells might still be lurking in the prostate.\n\nBut even with this uncertainty, prostate cancer specialists say, most men who are treated would not have died of prostate cancer, and that is especially true for elderly men, in particular those who are frail and have a limited life expectancy. Yet changing medical practice can be difficult.\n\n\u201cAnytime a practice becomes ingrained, it is difficult to eradicate,\u201d says Dr. Brooks. \u201cIt is harder to get rid of an aberrant behavior than to adopt a new one.\u201d\n\nDr. Andriole said the very concept of not screening is difficult.\n\n\u201cIt is the hardest thing in the world not to look for a cancer and not to treat it,\u201d he says. And doctors, he added, have many inducements to screen. They often are afraid they could be sued if they do not screen and a man is found to have a lethal cancer. And there are financial incentives.\n\n\u201cUrologists make money by finding ways to biopsy men and administer treatments,\u201d Dr. Andriole said. Screening, he added, \u201cis promoted by hospitals and industry.\u201d And, he added, \u201cmany patients demand it.\u201d\n\nDr. Brooks of the cancer society says he travels the country and talks to primary care doctors about screening, and has learned that many have misconceptions about the test\u2019s benefits.\n\n\u201cThey often don\u2019t appreciate the downside of screening,\u201d Dr. Brooks said, \u201cand they don\u2019t appreciate the delay in benefit.\u201d In addition, Dr. Brooks said, primary care doctors often \u201coverestimate the likelihood that early detection of prostate cancer will lead to survival benefits.\u201d\n\nAdded to that, Dr. Brooks said, is the length of time it takes to discuss the pros and cons of screening with patients. Often it is easier to just order the test.\n\nDr. Bruce Roth, a professor of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis, said that ideally, a doctor should take a man\u2019s overall health into account and not just go by age in ordering P.S.A. tests. But if a man has been screened year after year, it can be hard to suggest he stop because he may not live much longer.\n\nSome men say the cautions just do not apply to them.\n\nJ. Allen Wheeler, who is 82 and lives in Portland, Ore., said he had his most recent P.S.A. test in January. His doctor orders it routinely, he says, adding, \u201cIn all honestly, it\u2019s part of my physical.\u201d His doctor \u201cjust does it \u2014 that\u2019s the understanding between us.\u201d\n\nMr. Wheeler, who says his health is \u201cfairly good,\u201d said he could not foresee a time when he would stop having the test. He would like to know if he has cancer, he says, although he may decide not to be treated.\n\nA 75-year-old Connecticut man said he had the test because he was healthy and wanted to stay that way.\n\n\u201cI think I am going to live to be 100,\u201d he said, asking that his name be withheld to protect his privacy. A recent P.S.A. test found a small cancer, and he does not want to take a chance that it will grow slowly and not cause him problems.\n\n\u201cI am thinking seriously of having the whole thing taken out,\u201d he says. \u201cHasta la vista.\u201d", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story presented information about the impact of being tested for prostate cancer using the PSA test versus not having the test. \u00a0It was especially clear about the idea that a life expectancy of 10 years as a man thinks about potential benefit.\nBut, again, the option of not being screened wasn\u2019t reflected in the patients profiled in the piece.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Scientists in Britain say they have developed a blood and urine test that can detect autism in children.\n\nResearchers at the University of Warwick said the test, believed to be the first of its kind, could lead to earlier diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in children who could then be given appropriate treatment much earlier in their lives.\n\nASDs mainly affect a person\u2019s social interaction and communication, with symptoms that can include speech disturbances, repetitive and/or compulsive behaviour, hyperactivity, anxiety, and difficulty adapting to new environments.\n\nAs there is a wide range of ASD symptoms, diagnosis can be difficult and uncertain, particularly at the early stages of development. It is estimated that about one in every 100 people in the UK has ASD, with more boys diagnosed with the condition than girls.\n\nScientists said their research found a link between ASD and damage to proteins in blood plasma. They found the most reliable of the tests they developed was examining protein in blood plasma, which found children with ASD had higher levels of the oxidation marker dityrosine (DT) and certain sugar-modified compounds called advanced glycation end-products (AGEs).\n\nGenetic causes are thought to be responsible for about a third of cases of ASD, while the rest are believed to be caused by a combination of environmental factors, mutations, and rare genetic variants. However, researchers believe their new tests could reveal yet-to-be-identified causes of ASD.\n\nThey also confirmed the previously held belief that mutations of amino acid transporters are a genetic variant associated with ASD.\n\nThe Warwick team worked with collaborators at the University of Bologna in Italy, who recruited 38 children who had been diagnosed with ASD along with a control group of 31 other children between the ages of five and 12. Blood and urine samples were taken from the children for analysis.\n\nThe Warwick team discovered there were chemical differences between the two groups. Working with a further collaborator at the University of Birmingham, the changes in multiple compounds were combined using artificial intelligence algorithm techniques to develop a mathematical equation to distinguish between ASD and healthy controls. The outcome was a diagnostic test better than any existing method.\n\nThey said the next steps were to repeat the study with further groups of children to confirm the good diagnostic performance and to assess if the test could identify ASD at very early stages, indicate how the ASD is likely to develop further to more severe disease, and assess if treatments were working.\n\nThe research was led by Naila Rabbani, reader of experimental systems biology at the University of Warwick, who said: \u201cOur discovery could lead to earlier diagnosis and intervention. We hope the tests will also reveal new causative factors.\n\n\u201cWith further testing we may reveal specific plasma and urinary profiles \u2013 or \u2018fingerprints\u2019 \u2013 of compounds with damaging modifications. This may help us improve the diagnosis of ASD and point the way to new causes of ASD.\u201d\n\nThe research has been published in the journal Molecular Autism.\n\u2022 Note added 27 February 2018: The UK autism research charity, Autistica, provided the following comment to the Guardian: \u201cThis is a small, early-stage study which may explain one biological difference in autism. At this stage, the results presented are not strong enough to suggest that this method could be used for the diagnosis of autism. For example, we don\u2019t know whether this technique can distinguish autism from ADHD, anxiety or other similar conditions. There have been many previous attempts to develop a biological test for autism.

Now, technology is dangling the possibility that women can stop that clock, at least for a while.\n\nIn a Manhattan office building on a recent evening, two dozen women \u2014 all in their 30s and 40s \u2014 sit in folding chairs, balancing cellphones and glasses of wine. They're gathered for a seminar called \"Take Control of Your Fertility.\"\n\nDr. Alan Copperman of Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York wastes no time laying out this harsh reality: By the time a woman hits her 40s, 90 percent of her eggs are abnormal. The chances of a typical 40-year-old getting pregnant in any given month? Ten percent. Unless, that is, she gets pregnant with her younger eggs \u2014 eggs she had frozen years before.\n\nCopperman explains the procedure, introduces someone who has gone through it and takes a flurry of questions.\n\nAfterward, women crowd a counter to set up appointments with Copperman's clinic, which offers egg freezing. Sally Montgomery is among the youngest here, and the most upbeat. Her mom had trouble conceiving, so she wants to be proactive.\n\n\"I'm 31, your typical New Yorker,\" she says. \"I'm single, I'm bouncing around, and I'd like the opportunity to have a family, so I just figured, 'Why not?' I don't think it's a guarantee, but it's a nice insurance policy, and I think it takes some of the pressure off.\"\n\nOthers, though, slip out quietly. One 40-year-old says she wishes she'd learned about egg freezing earlier. Esther Montoro, a 37-year-old photographer, looks a little stunned.\n\n\"I think it's fantastic,\" she says, \"but I think it's so incredibly expensive.\"\n\nThe whole process \u2014 a week of hormones, plus the procedure to collect the eggs \u2014 runs $12,000 to $14,000. And because it takes 10 to 20 eggs for a reasonable shot at success, some may need to do this several times. Plus, there are annual storage fees. Then, when you're ready to use your eggs, you'll need in vitro fertilization, another pricey procedure. All told, costs can easily exceed $40,000, money Montoro doesn't have.\n\n\"I guess there's a big assumption that most women that need to do this [are] career, successful, rich women,\" she says. \"And I'm not!\"\n\nIn his office later, Copperman empathizes and says he hopes the procedure eventually becomes easier and cheaper. Still, he says, freezing eggs offers many women the biggest game changer since the birth control pill 50 years ago.\n\n\"Women began to have reproductive choices,\" he says. \"They got to decide when not to get pregnant. This technology has the potential to help women decide when they can get pregnant.\"\n\nClinics in the U.S. have long frozen fertilized eggs, or embryos. But eggs alone are more delicate and prone to damage. Over the years, egg freezing has been offered mainly to cancer patients facing radiation, but success rates were pretty dismal. Of late, though, the technology has exploded thanks to scientific leaps, including a flash-freeze method called vitrification.\n\nIn Copperman's lab, you can hear the sizzle as a tiny tube is plunged into liquid nitrogen.\n\n\"Snap freeze, snap thaw,\" he says. \"And what's really impressive is that when it comes out, it comes out looking just like it went in.\"\n\nIronically, much of this research was pioneered in Italy and Spain, where Catholic influence discouraged the creation of too many embryos, leaving fertility researchers with unused eggs instead.\n\nWith the better survival rate from vitrification and other new freezing methods, more and more clinics are now offering what they call \"fertility preservation.\" Meanwhile, the early adopters are starting to come back and use their eggs.\n\nIn a New York high rise, 8-month-old Camden squeals in delight as she bounces in her walker. She's here thanks to eggs her mom froze several years ago.\n\n\"My best friend and I made a pact together that at age 38, if we were both still single, we were going to have a child on our own,\" says Robyn Ross.\n\nWhen that time came, Ross decided she wasn't ready for single motherhood. Instead, she froze 14 eggs. Within a year, she fell in love and soon got married.\n\nHer husband, Mark Cohen, says he wasn't at all put off by the fact that his new love had her eggs in the freezer. As it turned out, his sperm was weakened by earlier cancer treatment, so conceiving their baby in a lab was the perfect solution.\n\n\"And this is our miracle baby,\" Cohen says, planting a kiss on Camden. \"We are one little happy family.\"\n\nRoss has already evangelized to her younger sister.\n\n\"I made her promise me that if she's still single by the age of 32, she would freeze her eggs,\" she says. \"The younger the better.\"\n\nNow, before you run out to a fertility clinic, there is a big note of caution. The Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, which sets industry guidelines, still considers egg freezing experimental.\n\n\"If the question were just, 'Does egg freezing and thawing work to achieve a pregnancy?' I think we're close,\" says Dr. Eric Widra, a member of the society's executive council.\n\nBut only 1,000 to 2,000 babies in the world have been born using frozen eggs. So far, they're fine \u2014 no abnormalities. Still, Widra would like a larger-scale, longer-term track record. It's not clear when \u2014 or if \u2014 a big-scale study might happen. But Widra says women need to understand that success rates will never be 100 percent.\n\n\"It's an insurance policy that you may or may not actually ever need,\" he says. \"And it's an insurance policy that if you do need, may not pay out.\"\n\nAnd yet, even Widra agrees that egg freezing has appeal if it can help avoid the anguish of infertility. At Shady Grove Fertility, the Washington, D.C., clinic where he practices, he offers it to his own patients.\n\nThe Challenge Of Setting An Age Limit\n\nIt's quite a concept: Put your eggs in deep freeze and disconnect from that nagging biological clock. But, until when? How old is too old to use your younger eggs?\n\n\"There should be guidelines, I think, that are more clearly defined,\" says Dr. Geoffrey Sher, who heads the Sher Institutes for Reproductive Medicine and is based in Las Vegas.\n\nHe says many clinics suggest a cutoff of 50, the average age of menopause. After that, pregnancy can be riskier, and the large age gap raises complicated social issues. But the limit is tricky to impose. Sher remembers one couple who wanted to use donor eggs to conceive. The husband was 45, his wife, 55. Sher hesitated.\n\n\"And she said, 'That's discriminatory. If my husband was my age and I was his age, you wouldn't hesitate.' And she had a point,\" Sher says.\n\nThe woman was healthy. And the uterus doesn't decline like eggs do; in some cases, it can actually be coaxed back into working order. Sher's ethics board said OK.\n\n\"And she went ahead and had a baby at 57 years of age without any problems whatsoever,\" Sher says. \"I get a postcard from them at Christmas every year.\"\n\nThe bigger challenge, Sher and others say, is reaching out to younger women \u2014 getting them to take action before it's too late. They envision a time when society considers freezing eggs an act not of desperation but of empowerment.\n\nThis story was produced for broadcast by Marisa Penaloza.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "No head to head data are provided.

The studies for these drugs, which are not yet on the market, were funded by the drug manufacturers.\n\nDr. John Richert, executive vice president of research and clinical programs at the National MS Society, says the introduction of these pills will mark a major improvement in the lives of MS patients.\n\n\"What we've had available the last 16, 17 years has made a big difference,\" Richert says, \"and what we have coming onboard now, these are going to make even a larger difference.

Richert believes this simpler option will encourage more people to seek treatment.\n\n\"People will be more prone to take them early, more prone to stay on the drugs,\" Richert says.\n\nThe new pills also appear to be more effective than most current drugs. In clinical tests they reduced the number of flare-ups by more than half. The drugs now on the market typically reduce flare-ups by only a third. Such relapses reflect underlying nerve damage, so reducing their number is an indicator that less damage is taking place.\n\nJeffrey Babin, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, was diagnosed with MS nearly seven years ago, when he was 39. He says the discovery shook his world.\n\n\"This is a very scary disease. And when you have an episode, it is one of the most life-changing and life-re-evaluating events,\" Babin says.\n\nHe has been free of MS relapses for several years now, an improvement that may be attributed to the drug Copaxone, one of a half-dozen drugs on the market now that can slow the course of MS.\n\nBabin says he is grateful for the drug \u2014 but he has to go through the painful process of injecting it every day.\n\n\"Injections are no fun; nobody likes to inject themselves,\" Babin says. \"In my case, I wouldn't say there are any major side effects, but I do get those painful welts at the injection sites.\"\n\nThose painful welts are something he would happily do without \u2014 and the new pills could be the answer.\n\nDr. Peter Calabresi of Johns Hopkins University School of Medical is an author of one new study.

Cancerous tumors tend to be stiffer than surrounding tissues or cysts, whereas benign lesions are more compressible.\n\n\"You can perform elastography at the same time as hand-held ultrasound and view the images on a split screen, with the two-dimensional ultrasound image on the left and the elastography image on the right,\" Destounis said.\n\nAs part of an ongoing study, 179 women underwent breast ultrasound and elastography. The researchers performed biopsies on the 134 solid lesions they detected. . They found that elastography correctly identified 98 percent of cancerous lesions and 82 percent of benign lesions, and they also determined that elastography was more accurate than ultrasound in gauging the size of the lesions.\n\nThe findings were to be presented Nov. 30 in Chicago at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America.\n\nIn another study scheduled to be presented at the meeting, researchers found that high-frequency ultrasound with elastography can help distinguish between cancerous and benign skin lesions, which could improve the efficiency of skin cancer diagnosis.\n\nDr. Eliot L.

Although smoking rates in the United States have declined in recent decades, tens of millions of adults continue to smoke, and the habit causes more than 440,000 deaths a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAn effective vaccine could play a major role in reducing smoking around the world, said Dr. Vocci, who estimated that current rates of smoking would lead to one billion deaths in the 21st century.\n\nSurveys show that about 7 in 10 smokers say they would like to quit, but a vast majority of those who try end up relapsing. While the market for smoking cessation therapies is estimated to be more than $1 billion annually, many smokers continue to fail in their efforts to quit even while using the available products, with long-term success rates generally peaking at about 20 percent.\n\n\"It's the period between four-week abstinence and one-year abstinence that's the critical period,\" said Dr. Victor I. Reus, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, and a lead investigator on the NicVax study.\n\nIf the vaccine helps smokers quit, Dr. Reus said, a central question will be whether booster shots could help prevent relapse.\n\nThe classic nicotine buzz occurs when the molecule travels in the bloodstream across the \"blood-brain barrier\" to reach specific receptors in the brain. Nicotine itself does not cause the body to create antibodies as part of an immunological response, the way disease-causing viruses and bacteria do.\n\nThe anti-nicotine antibodies generated by NicVax are proteins that bind to the nicotine molecule. Because the compound is too big to cross the blood-brain barrier, the vaccine is expected to diminish or eliminate the pleasure associated with puffing a cigarette. This lack of positive physiological reinforcement for smoking is believed to reduce the nicotine craving that causes smokers to fail in their efforts to quit.\n\nThe most widespread therapies currently available are nicotine-replacement products, like nicotine patches and gum, which are designed to wean the smoker by administering trickles of nicotine to the body, replacing the surges delivered by cigarettes.\n\nZyban, a repackaging of the antidepressant Wellbutrin, was approved by the F.D.A. a decade ago for smoking cessation. Most recently, the F.D.A. approved Chantix, which works by binding to the nicotine receptors in the brain.\n\nThe current study will test vaccine dosages and sequences of four or five shots; some subjects will get a placebo.

Is this stuff working?\" said Stevens, 48, of La Jolla, Calif. \"Your whole life is in sort of a limbo.\"\n\nDoctors typically must wait weeks or months to see if a treatment is shrinking tumors or at least halting their growth. But researchers are exploring a new use for medical imaging that could shorten the stay in purgatory, possibly revealing within a few days whether chemo is working.\n\nThat speed could save both lives and money. It would allow doctors to switch more quickly from an ineffective drug to a different one, and save health care dollars by waving doctors off expensive but futile treatments.\n\nThe same approach may also prove useful for monitoring radiation therapy.\n\nThis experimental imaging relies on a familiar hospital workhorse: PET scans, typically used for things like detecting cancer or revealing the effects of a heart attack. Unlike CT scans or MRIs, PET scans can show a tumor's internal activity, not just its size.\n\nWhen used to assess the effects of cancer treatment, it can reveal inside information about what the therapy is doing to a tumor even when there's no outward sign.\n\nTo do a PET scan, doctors inject a patient with a radioactive substance that shows up on the scan in places where certain processes are happening \u2013 like hungry cancer cells gobbling up a lot of blood sugar. Think of it as looking around your neighborhood late at night for light in bedroom windows to see who is still awake.\n\nMany cancer patients get PET scans now to assess their disease before treatment, or to spot recurrences later on. But except for lymphoma, PET scans aren't routinely used to get a quicker answer on how cancers are responding to therapy.\n\nThe new research tests both standard PET scans and a newer approach that involves injecting a different tracer substance.\n\nThe standard scan, which looks for blood sugar usage, has gotten good results in tests with a variety of tumors including breast, prostate, colorectal and esophageal cancers, said Dr. Steven Larson of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.\n\n\"I think it's going to be extremely valuable for most tumors where there are effective treatments,\" he said. Some experiments have revealed chemo's effects within 10 days to two weeks.\n\nAs a practical matter, the goal of researchers is to convince federal regulators to cover the procedure under Medicare and Medicaid, which would open the door to routine use. That might take two or three years, he said.\n\nFarther out on the research horizon is a PET scan that uses injections of a different radioactive material and has revealed chemotherapy's impact even faster. Larson figures it will be especially useful for assessing newer drugs that aim to stop a patient's cancer from growing rather than killing the tumor.\n\nThis scan is called FLT PET, after radioactive fluorothymidine. These scans show whether cancer cells are dividing. Uncontrolled division is a hallmark of active cancer, and stopping that division should be an early effect of successful chemotherapy.\n\n\"Our hope ... is you might be able to give a single dose of a chemotherapy agent and within a day or two figure out whether the tumor is going to respond,\" says Dr. Michael Graham of the University of Iowa.\n\nIf the tumor doesn't respond, doctors would \"go on to Plan B,\" he said. \"This is really ... giving us the ability to tailor the therapy to the disease.\"\n\nResearch into FLT PET is still in the early stages. Graham said there are maybe a dozen published human studies so far, most involving too few patients to draw a firm conclusion.\n\nOne report that impressed him involved 28 patients in Korea who were treated for advanced lung cancer \u2013 just like Stevens, who had to wait six weeks to learn whether it was working. The researchers reported that just one week after treatment began, they could tell with 93 percent certainty which patients would eventually respond to the drug and which would not.\n\nIn a much smaller study at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, seven patients with acute myeloid leukemia were scanned at various times during a week of aggressive chemotherapy. Normally, doctors wait a month after chemo is stopped to see if it worked. But the FLT PET scans offered an answer as soon as a day after treatment started.\n\n\"It's always hard to get too excited about a study that just involves seven people,\" said Dr. Mark Juckett, one of the authors. But \"in these few patients, it looked like we could predict those who were going to respond well to chemotherapy and those who weren't.\"\n\nOther preliminary studies suggest the new PET technology might be useful in gauging treatment for breast and brain cancers as well as lymphoma.\n\nGraham figures there's a good chance FLT PET scans will become routine for assessing therapy in the next 10 years.\n\n\"It's a terrible waste of money to spend thousands and thousands of dollars on these patients when it doesn't do any good,\" he said.\n\nGraham, president-elect of the Society of Nuclear Medicine, has been involved in discussions between the society and drug companies about incorporating FLT PET in their studies of experimental cancer drugs.\n\nThe hope is that, over time, FLT PET would prove reliable for giving a faster answer on whether an experimental treatment is working. That would save companies a lot of money, because they could spot ineffective drugs more quickly and not waste further research on them.

That means screening 1,250 women five times over a 10-year period would save one life, study author Hakan Jonsson said during a teleconference Wednesday. The research was published online Wednesday in the journal Cancer and is to be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual Breast Cancer Symposium, which starts Friday in National Harbor, Md.\n\nThe findings will no doubt do little to quell a controversy that has existed since the 1980s over the value of mammography screenings for women in their 40s.\n\nLast year, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended that women in their 40s not at high risk for breast cancer could forego mammograms until they turned 50 and, even then, it said they only needed to undergo screening once every two years.\n\nThat recommendation met with outrage from breast cancer specialists, while other organizations, including the American Cancer Society, continued to recommend annual mammograms for women in their 40s.\n\nTo further stir the pot, a Norwegian study released last week found that routine mammograms accounted for only about one-third of the decline in breast cancer death rates seen recently.\n\nThe value of mammograms for women 50 and older is not in question.\n\nSpeaking at the teleconference, Dr. Jennifer Obel, chair of the American Society of Clinical Oncology's communications committee, said: \"This study adds to our knowledge of mammogram performance in this age group. Many women aged 40 to 49 want unambiguous recommendations. While the optimal schedule of regular mammograms continues to be discussed by experts in the field, the critical message here is that all women starting at age 40 should talk to their doctor to understand the benefits and risks of screening and to understand what is best.\"\n\n\"Mammography has been shown in study after study to reduce breast cancer deaths in women aged 40 to 49,\" Obel added. \"The real message is that any time we order a diagnostic test, we need to discuss that test with our patients.

Although screening is mandated for woman aged 50 to 69 in that country, the decision to screen earlier is made by individual counties.\n\nThe study authors compared death-registry data on women in their 40s who had been invited by their county to be screened with data on women who had not been invited. In all, more than 1 million women were involved in the study and the follow-up period was a lengthy 16 years.\n\nThe reduction was estimated at 26 percent to 29 percent, depending on the model used, according to the study. The reduction was greater when only those women that actually attended screening were considered.\n\nThe benefits were greater in women aged 45 to 49, vs. those aged 40 to 44, the researchers said.\n\nJonsson, an associate professor of cancer epidemiology at Umea University in Sweden, could not pinpoint exactly why his findings differed from those of other studies. He mentioned certain differences in methodology as a possible factor, as well as the possibility that mammographic techniques have improved over the years.\n\nIn another study released during the Wednesday press conference, researchers from M.D. Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas in Houston found that overall survival rates among breast cancer patients in the past six decades have increased, a trend due largely to earlier detection and treatments.\n\n\"There was a significant improvement in survival overall, including all patients with all stages of breast cancer...even those who had disseminated cancer,\" said study author Dr. Aman Buzdar, a professor of medicine and breast medical oncology at M.D. Anderson.\n\nAlthough the data, which covered breast cancer patients who were treated at M.D. Anderson between 1944 and 2004, came from a single institution, Buzdar said he believes the results can be generalized to other breast cancer patients.\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on mammography.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story does not discuss the option of NOT screening.

They also were published online by the New England Journal of Medicine and will be in the April 12 issue.\n\nAngioplasty remains the top treatment for people having a heart attack or hospitalized with worsening symptoms. But most angioplasties are done on a non-emergency basis, to relieve chest pain caused by clogged arteries crimping the heart's blood supply.\n\nThose patients now should try drugs first, experts say. If that does not help, they can consider angioplasty or bypass surgery, which unlike angioplasty, does save lives, prevent heart attacks and give lasting chest-pain relief.\n\nIn the study, only one-third of the people treated with drugs ultimately needed angioplasty or a bypass.\n\n\"You are not putting yourself at risk of death or heart attack if you defer,\" and considering the safety worries about heart stents used to keep arteries open after angioplasty, it may be wise to wait, said Dr. Steven Nissen, a Cleveland Clinic heart specialist and president of the College of Cardiology.\n\nWhy did angioplasty not help more?\n\nIt fixes only one blockage at a time whereas drugs affect all the arteries, experts said. Also, the clogs treated with angioplasty are not the really dangerous kind.\n\n\"Even though it goes against intuition, the blockages that are severe that cause chest pain are less likely to be the source of a heart attack than segments in the artery that are not severely blocked,\" said Dr. David Maron, a Vanderbilt University cardiologist who helped lead the new study.\n\nDrugs are better today than they used to be and do a surprisingly good job, said Dr. Elizabeth Nabel, director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.\n\n\"It may not be as bad as we thought\" to leave the artery alone, she said.\n\nAbout 1.2 million angioplasties are done in the United States each year. Through a blood vessel in the groin, doctors snake a tube to a blocked heart artery. A tiny balloon is inflated to flatten the clog and a mesh scaffold stent is usually placed.\n\nThe procedure already has lost some popularity because of emerging evidence that popular drug-coated stents can raise the risk of blood clots months later. The new study shifts the argument from which type of stent to use to whether to do the procedure at all.\n\nIt involved 2,287 patients throughout the U.S. and Canada who had substantial blockages, typically in two arteries, but were medically stable. They had an average of 10 chest pain episodes a week \u2014 moderately severe.

Diabetes patients' blood sugar levels become abnormally high, causing a host of serious complications including nerve damage, the need for amputations, blindness, and increased risk of heart attacks and strokes.\n\nMany earlier studies had shown that tightly controlling blood sugar significantly reduced the risk of many complications. The new study -- known as the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes, or Accord, trial -- was designed to convincingly test whether various aggressive treatment strategies reduced the risk of heart disease -- the main cause of death among diabetics.\n\nThe study involves 10,251 patients ages 40 to 82 at 77 sites in the United States and Canada at high risk for heart disease for any reason, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol or obesity. About half were placed on a regimen combining diet and exercise with commonly used drugs designed to lower their blood sugar levels to those of the average person with diabetes, while the other half were put on a more intensive regimen designed to drive levels closer to those of someone without diabetes. The patients were further divided into those who also received blood-pressure-lowering medication or drugs to improve their cholesterol levels.\n\nOver about four years, about half of the patients getting intensive treatment achieved blood sugar levels close to normal, and about half the patients in the standard treatment group achieved levels close to the average diabetic.\n\nBut a special 10 member panel that was monitoring the study alerted the organizers that 257 patients r eceiving intensive treatment had died, compared with 203 receiving standard treatment, a difference of 54 deaths -- or 3 per 1,000 participants per year, officials said.

More Americans kill themselves than die from breast cancer.\n\nAs Dr.Thomas Insel, longtime head of the National Institute of Mental Health, prepared to step down from his job in October, he cited the lack of progress in reducing the number of suicides as his biggest disappointment. While the homicide rate in the U.S. has dropped 50 percent since the early 1990s, the suicide rate is higher than it was a decade ago.\n\n\"That to me is unacceptable,\" Insel says.\n\nIt hasn't been for lack of trying. The U.S. has a national suicide hotline, and there are suicide prevention programs in every state. There's screening, educational programs, and midnight walks to raise awareness. Yet over the past decade or so, the national suicide rate has increased. In 2003, the suicide rate was 10.8 per 100,000 people. In 2013, it was 12.6.\n\nAn effort that began in Detroit in 2001 to treat the most common cause of suicide \u2014 depression \u2014 is offering hope. With a relentless focus on finding and treating people with depression, the Henry Ford Health System has cut the suicide rate among the people in its insurance plan dramatically. The story of the health system's success is a story of persistence, confidence, hope and a strict adherence to a very specific approach.\n\nThat approach saved the life of a woman who prefers to be known only by her first name, Lynn. She agreed to share her medical history on the condition that we not use her full name to protect her privacy.\n\nLynn, who's now in her mid-50s, has had bipolar disorder, also known as manic-depressive illness, for nearly 30 years. The depressive part of her illness \"is like the pain of having a cancer,\" she says. About 15 years ago, she started getting irresistible urges to take her own life and she started making serious attempts \u2014 at times almost monthly.\n\n\"When I was in the depths of depression, I was being pulled and sucked into this black tunnel,\" she says. \"I was desperately trying to grab onto something to stop from being sucked in.\" Sometimes she couldn't find anything to hang on to. \"Those are the times when I finally let go and attempted suicide,\" she says.\n\nThe program that saved Lynn almost didn't get off the ground.\n\nFifteen years ago, suicide prevention care at Henry Ford, like in many places, was mostly reactive. When patients came in talking about suicide, health providers took notice. But little was done to find people before they reached that point.\n\nSome of the health providers in the psychiatric division decided they could do better. So they applied to a foundation for a grant to provide something they called \"perfect depression care\" for the 200,000 patients in the health system. The goal: zero suicides.\n\nThe mental health division failed to win the grant, but the health system went ahead with the proposed changes anyway.\n\nThe plan it developed is intensive and thorough, an almost cookbook approach. Primary care doctors screen every patient with two questions: How often have you felt down in the past two weeks? And how often have you felt little pleasure in doing things? A high score leads to more questions about sleep disturbances, changes in appetite, thoughts of hurting oneself. All patients are questioned on every visit.\n\nIf the health providers recognize a mental health problem, patients are assigned to appropriate care \u2014 cognitive behavioral therapy, drugs, group counseling, or hospitalization if necessary. On each patient's medical record, providers have to attest to having done the screening, and they record plans for any needed care.\n\nTherapists involve patients' families, and ask them to remove guns or other means of suicide from their homes. Clerks are trained to make sure that patients who need followup care don't leave without an appointment. Patients themselves come up with \"safety plans.\"\n\nLynn has two copies, one by her nightstand and one in her kitchen. Each lists things she can do when she feels depression coming on. She could sit on her balcony, or do some drawing or painting. The list includes her therapists' phone numbers. And there's a reminder that the feeling will pass \u2014 it has before.\n\nBefore the zero suicide plan went into effect, says psychiatrist Doree Ann Espiritu, acting head of the zero suicide program at Henry Ford, you might make a contract with a patient where the patient agrees not to commit suicide. Studies show it doesn't work very well, she says.\n\nToday, providers are trained to be comfortable asking their patients about suicidal thoughts. \"There is a fear among clinicians that if you ask questions about suicide, you are giving the patient an idea that this could be an option,\" says Espiritu, \"and if you ask about guns or pills, that you are giving them some hints on how they can carry out a plan.\" The Henry Ford therapists are trained to break that barrier.\n\nFor Lynn, the key was persistence \u2014 her therapists', and her own. \"I recall one time with my psychiatrist, who kept trying to encourage me and help me find ways of coping, and I can remember saying, 'I don't believe there's hope, I don't see it, I don't feel it, I need you to hold on to that for me because it's not there,' \" she recalls.\n\nHer therapists never gave up. \"There is no question that the message I got from Day 1 is that they knew they could help me, and they would help me,\" Lynn says. Over the years she's been in group therapy, day treatment, and, when things got bad, the emergency room.\n\nThe Henry Ford approach is catching on. A stream of visitors from U.S. health insurers and from the United Kingdom have made site visits. The Suicide Prevention Resource Center has run two zero suicide training academies for teams from health care systems based on the Henry Ford principles. Other health systems have adapted the plan, including Group Health Cooperative in Seattle and the behavioral health provider Centerstone in Tennessee.\n\nEspiritu started work at Henry Ford just as the program was starting, and she remembers the initial staff meetings: \"There was a lot of, 'How can you do this? How can you aim for zero? How can you expect your clinicians to be perfect and follow this protocol?' \" Some people didn't think it could be done, she says, or even attempted.\n\nStill, the health system went ahead, and the rewards were nearly immediate. Henry Ford epidemiologist Brian Ahmedani studies the numbers. In 2009, for those being actively treated for a mental health problem or substance abuse, \"we had a rate of zero per hundred thousand,\" he says. It's crept up to 20 per 100,000 per year, but that's still 80 percent lower than it was when the program began. The rate is five per 100,000 in the organization's general population, which is well below the national average and has remained steady despite an increasing rate of suicide statewide.\n\nThere's reason to think a full-bore effort to treat depression could reduce health costs, because untreated depression is associated with higher medical bills for chronic illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension. But there are training costs involved, and the Henry Ford system has had to keep its staffing up to be able to provide care for people who need it.\n\nOfficials at Henry Ford say they haven't analyzed the costs. But Centerstone has. The behavioral health provider in Nashville implemented the Henry Ford approach for nearly 200 patients who'd already made a suicide attempt. Reductions in emergency room visits and hospitalizations over the course of a year resulted in savings of more than $400,000.\n\nWhy push for zero, rather than just a reduction? \"Because if you say we're OK with five a year, one of those might be your brother or your friend,\" says Espiritu. \"We aim for zero because it reminds all of us of what we would want for ourselves.\" Maybe it is not possible, she says. But it is a goal.\n\nAnd as for Lynn, she doesn't consider herself cured. She says with the treatment she's received at Henry Ford, she's learned to live, even thrive, with bipolar disease. And she's alive. That, she says, makes her a big success story.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The alternative to \u201cperfect depression care\u201d would seem to be the absence of a formalized requirement for mental health screening to be incorporated into primary care.

Two phase III clinical trials show that a drug that restores the body's natural production of testosterone has no negative effect on a man's sperm count while a topical testosterone gel causes a significant drop. The findings, which are published in BJU International, could change the way men are treated for low testosterone.\n\nWhile testosterone replacement therapy can boost men's energy levels, sex drive, and mood, the treatment can fool the body into thinking that it is producing enough testosterone, so that it in turn starts making less of its own. This can result in a significant decrease in sperm count--leading to infertility--because the body needs its own testosterone to produce sperm.\n\nAn alternative approach to testosterone replacement is based on restoring the body's natural production of testosterone with drugs similar to those used to help women ovulate. Edward Kim, MD, urologist at the University of Tennessee Medical Center and Professor at the University of Tennessee Graduate School of Medicine in Knoxville, and his colleagues compared such a drug, called Enclomiphene citrate, with testosterone replacement therapy (Androgel) in overweight men with low testosterone, or hypogonadism. In the randomized studies, 44 men started on 12.5 mg of oral enclomiphene citrate daily, with 25 men being up-titrated to 25 mg; 42 men received a topical 1.62 percent AndroGel; and 41 men received a placebo. Over five months, patients had 10 clinic visits with one overnight stay.\n\nThe investigators found that Enclomiphene citrate restored blood testosterone levels to normal after 16 weeks while maintaining sperm concentrations, whereas Androgel restored blood testosterone levels but caused marked reductions in sperm concentrations by suppressing the function of the testes.\n\n\"One of the basic tenets in medicine is to do no harm. As this study has shown in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled manner, exogenous testosterone therapy with Androgel can clearly decrease sperm production and potentially impact fertility,\" said Dr. Kim. \"This study confirmed that Enclomiphene can maintain spermatogenesis while restoring testosterone levels to normal.\"\n\nFull citation: \"Oral Enclomiphene Citrate Raises Testosterone and Preserves Sperm Counts in Obese Hypogonadal Men, Unlike Topical Testosterone: Restoration Instead of Replacement.\" Edward D.

In addition, their revamped statistical analyses of urine samples submitted both by healthy patients and those diagnosed with breast cancer yielded 85 percent average accuracy.\n\n\"Breast cancer survival is strongly tied to the sensitivity of tumor detection; accurate methods for detecting smaller, earlier tumors remains a priority,\" says Prof. Yehuda Zeiri, a member of Ben-Gurion University's Department of Biomedical Engineering. \"Our new approach utilizing urine and exhaled breath samples, analyzed with inexpensive, commercially available processes, is non-invasive, accessible and may be easily implemented in a variety of settings.\"\n\nThe study reports breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among females and the leading cause of death around the world. In 2016, breast cancer accounted for 29 percent of all new cancers identified in the United States and was responsible for 14 percent of all cancer-related deaths.\n\nMammography screenings, which are proven to significantly reduce breast cancer mortality, are not always able to detect small tumors in dense breast tissue. In fact, typical mammography sensitivity, which is 75 to 85 percent accurate, decreases to 30 to 50 percent in dense tissue.\n\nCurrent diagnostic imaging detection for smaller tumors has significant drawbacks: dual-energy digital mammography, while effective, increases radiation exposure, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is expensive. Biopsies and serum biomarker identification processes are invasive, equipment-intensive and require significant expertise.\n\n\"We've now shown that inexpensive, commercial electronic noses are sufficient for classifying cancer patients at early stages,\" says Prof. Zeiri. \"With further study, it may also be possible to analyze exhaled breath and urine samples to identify other cancer types, as well.\"\n\nStudy contributors include: Ben-Gurion University biomedical engineering researchers Prof. Yehuda Zeiri, Or Herman-Saffar, Zvi Boger, and Raphael Gonen; Dr. Shai Libson, a surgeon in the Breast Health Center at Soroka; and Dr. David Lieberman, an associate professor in Ben-Gurion University's Joyce and Irving Goldman Medical School, Faculty of Health Sciences.\n\nAbout American Associates, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev\n\nAmerican Associates, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (AABGU) plays a vital role in sustaining David Ben-Gurion's vision: creating a world-class institution of education and research in the Israeli desert, nurturing the Negev community and sharing the University's expertise locally and around the globe.

The company expects a decision by May.\n\nThe drug has been available in Europe and Canada for several years.\n\nTwo other oral medications indicated to treat uterine fibroids are also in development. Bayer launched a phase 3 clinical trial\u2014usually the final trial used by regulators to decide whether to approve a drug\u2014for a similar drug, vilaprisan, in the summer. And AbbeVie is in the midst of phase 3 trials for elagolix to treat uterine fibroids and endometriosis, a disorder in which the tissue that lines the inside of the uterus grows outside of it, causing pelvic pain. The company hopes to have a product available by 2020.\n\nUterine fibroids are benign tumors that grow in and around the uterus. It\u2019s estimated that as many as 26 million women in the U.S. have one or more such tumors, though less than half experience symptoms. The most common symptom is long and excessive bleeding during menstrual periods, which can lead to anemia and the need for blood transfusions. Other symptoms can include pelvic pain or pressure, a swollen abdomen and frequent urination. Fibroids can also cause fertility and pregnancy problems, depending on their size and location.\n\nThe cause of fibroids remains unknown, though those with a family history have an increased risk of developing them. Dietary factors may also play a role. African-American women have a higher rate of uterine fibroids. If a woman has no symptoms, treatment of fibroids isn\u2019t necessary, experts say.\n\nWhile a hysterectomy is the most common way to treat fibroid tumors, women who still want to have children can have a myomectomy. That surgery removes fibroids while keeping the uterus intact. But fibroids can grow back after the procedure. A number of other minimally invasive procedures are less commonly used and usually not recommended for women who want to have children. There\u2019s some chance of recurrence with most of them.\n\nUA belongs to a group of drugs called selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRM). They block the progesterone from feeding the fibroids, which causes them to shrink.\n\n\u201cThis particular drug also works directly on the lining of the uterus\u2014the endometrium\u2014so it also quite fast and dramatically decreases and stops the vaginal bleeding,\u201d says Ayman Al-Hendy, director of interdisciplinary translational research at Augusta University in Georgia and a member of Allergan\u2019s advisory board. Bleeding is reduced within five to six days, he says. Headaches and hot flashes were the most common side effects in the trials with UA, affecting less than 10% of women.\n\nPatients take the once-a-day pill for three months and then stop for one menstrual cycle to allow the endometrium to shed, since the medication makes it grow thicker. Dr. Al-Hendy says the changes to the endometrium don\u2019t raise the risk of endometrial cancer, which some have raised as a concern.\n\nPatients with the condition say it\u2019s time for better treatments.\n\nTanika Gray Valbrun, a 39-year-old network news producer in Atlanta, says she welcomes less invasive treatments that don\u2019t affect fertility. She started the White Dress Project, a nonprofit patient advocacy group for women with uterine fibroids, in 2014.\n\nShe was diagnosed with fibroids at 19. She has suffered from pelvic pain, abdominal bloating that has resulted in people mistakenly thinking she\u2019s pregnant and extremely heavy bleeding that has left her anemic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had five blood transfusions because of the amount of blood I\u2019ve lost,\u201d she says.\n\nShe has tried different types of birth control, but none helped with her symptoms. In 2013 she had a myomectomy and doctors removed 27 fibroids, keeping her out of work for nine weeks. Four years later, the fibroids are back.\n\nVanessa Jacoby, an associate professor in the department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at University of California, San Francisco, conducts research in new fibroid treatments.\n\nShe says UA appears to have fewer side effects than Lupron, the only medication, an injectable, available in the U.S. that shrinks fibroids. Lupron effectively puts women into early menopause, which can result in hot flashes and bone loss. Women often must take it with hormone replacement therapy. It is usually used in preparation for surgery to shrink fibroids and maintain blood reserves.\n\nWhile the company has done studies of women taking the drug up to a year, some experts believe the long-term health profile of a drug needs to be evaluated up to seven years, Dr. Jacoby says.\n\nShao-Lee Lin, vice president of therapeutic areas and international development at AbbVie , says the company is testing a twice daily dosing of elagolix. It is also studying including low-dose hormone therapy within elagolix to help maintain bone health.\n\nLike Lupron, elagolix decreases sex hormones that cause fibroids to grow. What makes it different is it\u2019s fast-acting and easier to reverse the effects if you stop taking it.\n\nStudies have found it significantly reduces heavy menstrual bleeding and decreases the thickness of the endometrium by six months. It also decreases the size of fibroids.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The article mentions some alternative treatments in detail. One strength of the article is that it prominently points out that many women with fibroids who have no symptoms do not require treatment of any kind.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Dr. Ransohoff and other screening experts say patients should continue to have the test, because it is still highly effective. But they also recommend that patients seek the best colonoscopists by, for example, asking pointed questions about how many polyps they find and remove. They also say patients should be scrupulous in the unpleasant bowel cleansing that precedes the test, and promptly report symptoms like bleeding even if they occur soon after a colonoscopy.\n\nThe American Cancer Society says that even if the test is less effective than many had believed, it has no plans to change its recommended intervals between screenings \u2014 the test still prevents most cancers, but the expense and risk of the test argue against doing it more often.\n\nThe cancer society and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also are focusing on developing measurements of quality so that doctors who do colonoscopies can assess themselves and improve.\n\nBut gastroenterologists say that, if nothing else, the study points up the paucity of evidence for the common suggestion that anyone who had a clean bill of health from a colonoscopy is almost totally protected for at least a decade.\n\n\u201cWe have to not overpromise,\u201d said Dr. Ransohoff, who wrote an editorial accompanying the colonoscopy paper. \u201cWe need to look at the evidence, and we shouldn\u2019t go beyond it.\u201d\n\nThe new study matched each of 10,292 people who died of colon cancer to five people who lived in the same area and were of the same age, sex and socioeconomic status. The researchers asked how many patients and control subjects had had colonoscopies and whether the doctors had removed polyps. Then the researchers compared the groups and asked how much the colon cancer death rate had declined in people who had had the screening test.\n\nThe results were \u201ca shock,\u201d said Dr. Nancy N. Baxter, the lead author of the paper and a colorectal surgeon at the University of Toronto. When she saw them, she said, \u201cI asked my analyst to rerun the data.\u201d\n\nNow, researchers say, the challenge is to find out why the test missed so many cancers, in particular, those on the right side of the colon, and whether the problem can be fixed.\n\nAbout 148,000 people will learn they have colon cancer this year, the American Cancer Society reports, and nearly 50,000 will die of it.\n\nIt might be that Canadian doctors were not sufficiently skilled. About a third of the colonoscopies were done by general internists and family practitioners who might not have had the experience to do the test well.\n\nBut, said Dr. Douglas K. Rex, director of endoscopy and professor of medicine at Indiana University, that cannot be the entire explanation because at least one study, as yet unpublished, involving California Medi-Cal patients also found the test missed many cancers on the right side of the colon.\n\nThat leaves several other possibilities.\n\nPerhaps patients did not sufficiently cleanse their bowels of fecal material, a particular problem for the right side of the colon.\n\n\u201cAfter the prep has been completed, mucus and intestinal secretions start rolling out of the small intestine and colon,\u201d Dr. Rex explained. The secretions, he added, pour from the base of the appendix into the right side of the colon and are \u201cvery sticky\u201d and can obscure polyps.\n\nOne solution, supported by six studies, is to be sure there is just a short time between when patients finish taking the strong laxative that cleanses their bowel and the colonoscopy, Dr. Rex said. That usually means taking half of the laxative the night before the screening test and the rest in the morning, something that often is not done, he added, but that he and others recommend.\n\nCancer may also be different in the right colon, researchers said.\n\nFlat and indented polyps tend to cluster in the right colon. And so do another kind, serrated lesions, which, some studies indicate, might turn into cancer much more quickly than typical polyps.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that we will never get as good a result\u201d in the right colon, said Robert Smith, director of screening for the American Cancer Society.\n\nStill, he said, that does not mean that patients should have more frequent colonoscopies. The tests are \u201chugely expensive,\u201d he said, and insurers may not pay for more frequent colonoscopies. The test also carries a small risk of perforating the bowel. Even if colonoscopies miss some cancers, colon cancer remains a rare disease and, after a colonoscopy, \u201cthe likelihood that you have cancer is very, very low,\u201d Dr. Smith said.\n\nDr. Harold C. Sox, editor of the Annals of Internal Medicine, is choosing another option. He is having a stool test, the fecal occult blood test, between colonoscopies. It looks for blood in the stool, which can arise from colon cancer.\n\nDr. Smith does not advocate that strategy, saying that the stool test can have false positives from things like red meat or broccoli that have nothing to do with colon cancer. He worries that frequent stool tests will lead to frequent false alarms and frequent colonoscopies without making much of a dent in the colon cancer death rate.\n\nCT colonoscopies, so-called virtual colonoscopies, are not a solution, some screening experts said.\n\n\u201cThe issues are prep quality, flat lesions, serrated lesions and people not being careful enough in the inspection process,\u201d Dr. Rex said. There is no evidence, he added, that a virtual colonoscopy will help with the inspection process. And, he said, \u201cit almost certainly is not as effective a technology as colonoscopy for flat and serrated lesions.\u201d\n\nInstead, patients should be compulsive about their bowel prep and be sure the test is done by one of the best colonoscopists in their area, gastroenterologists said. Doctors should find polyps in at least 25 percent of men and 15 percent of women. They should take at least eight minutes to withdraw an endoscope from the colon. And they should do a high volume of screening. Dr. Smith said a high volume was at least three or four colonoscopies a day.\n\nAfter the test, patients can ask whether the doctor got to the right side of the colon and how that was documented.\n\nColon cancer experts said people should realize that even if colonoscopies prevent just 60 percent of colon cancer deaths, that still is a lot. Mammograms, for example, prevent 25 percent of breast cancer deaths, and the PSA test for men has not been shown to prevent prostate cancer deaths.\n\n\u201cIf I was to provide one main message, it would be that colonoscopies are the way that colon cancer mortality gets reduced,\u201d Dr. Ransohoff said. \u201cColonoscopy is a good test, but it isn\u2019t completely effective.

More than nine million patients underwent one of 12 such surgeries during the study period, and between six and 22 percent, depending on the surgery, were readmitted to the hospital within a month.\n\nMore than half the time, patients were readmitted or transferred to the hospital where they had the surgery.\n\nThose who returned to the original hospital were 26 percent less likely to die within three months of surgery than those admitted to a different hospital, as reported in The Lancet.\n\n\u201cPatients readmitted after surgery almost always have a postoperative complication, either medical or surgical,\u201d Drs.

No study looked at non-fatal cardiovascular issues like hospitalizations due to heart attacks and strokes, however.\n\nFor the new study, the researchers compared data on people hospitalized between 2002 and 2013 for heart attacks or strokes in counties that did or didn\u2019t restrict trans fats.\n\nAltogether they had data on 3.3 million people in 25 counties without trans fat restrictions and 8.4 million people in 11 counties with restrictions.\n\nIn 2006, there were 753 hospital admissions for heart attack or stroke per 100,000 people in counties that never enacted restrictions compared to 726 per 100,000 people in counties that put restrictions in place.\n\nWhile admissions for heart attacks and strokes fell after 2002 in all the counties, the drop was more substantial in those that enacted trans fat restrictions, the authors found.\n\nAfter three years or more, the combined rate of hospitalizations for heart attacks or strokes was about 6 percent lower in the counties with trans fat regulations.\n\nAdmissions for heart attacks were nearly 8 percent lower in counties with restrictions. Similarly, admissions for strokes were about 4 percent lower in counties with restrictions, but that finding could be due to chance.\n\nBrandt told Reuters Health that New York City was also pushing other public health initiatives around the same time. Those included clean air initiatives and showing calorie counts on restaurant menus.\n\nWhen they removed New York City data to make sure those other factors weren\u2019t driving the findings, the pattern didn\u2019t change.\n\n\u201cWe still found the same thing,\u201d Brandt said.\n\nStill, the study can\u2019t say the trans fat restrictions caused fewer admissions in those counties.\n\nBrandt and colleagues write that in 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) removed manufactured trans fats from its list of safe food additives. By 2018, those fats will be nearly eliminated from American diets, they add.\n\n\u201cThere has been a lot of looking into whether trans fats are harmful,\u201d said Brandt. \u201cHere we find on a population level when we restrict them, it benefits society by reducing heart attacks and strokes.\u201d\n\nThe findings suggest the FDA\u2019s action will lead to health benefits across the country, he added.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story included a\u00a0discussion about how the findings could also be linked to smoking bans and mandatory calorie counts on menus, which could be considered alternative public health measures to reduce heart disease.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Study published in the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association finds OMT plus antibiotics reduces risk of death for the most severely ill patients\n\nCHICAGO--August 29, 2016-- An analysis of multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial found osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) for pneumonia reduced length of hospital stay in adults 50 to 74 years old and lowered in-hospital mortality rates for patients 75 and older. The study results published in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association.\n\nThe study analyzed 375 patients ages 50 or older who were randomly assigned to three groups, either receiving OMT, a light touch or conventional care only. Differences between treatment groups were evaluated for subgroups of participants based on their age, Pneumonia Severity Index and type of pneumonia. The data were analyzed by intention-to-treat analysis of all participants and by per-protocol analysis of participants who finished the study without missing any protocol treatments.\n\nKey findings by per-protocol analysis of the younger subgroup found that OMT decreased hospital stay by 1.1 days compared to those who received conventional care only. By intention-to-treat analysis of the older subgroup, in-hospital mortality rates were 11 percent lower to the conventional-care only group. OMT also reduced the in-hospital mortality rates of those with the highest severity of illness.\n\n\"Osteopathic manipulative therapy was developed in the pre-antibiotic era specifically for the management of pneumonia. While antibiotic therapy is the current standard of care, the emergence of resistant bacteria is a global threat and provides an incentive to explore adjunct treatments that can improve their efficacy,\" said James Bailey, DO, assistant professor in physical medicine and rehabilitation at Rowan University School of Osteopathic Medicine. \"This study should encourage physicians to use their osteopathic techniques when treating older patients with pneumonia.\"\n\nPneumonia is a leading cause of death for elderly patients, with over 90 percent of pneumonia-related deaths among those 65 and older. Previous studies have also shown that OMT can improve the efficacy of antibiotics in pneumonia patients.\n\nOsteopathic manipulative techniques can help treat structural and tissue abnormalities, relieve joint restriction and misalignment, restore muscle and tissue balance and promote the overall movement blood flow throughout the body. When appropriate, it can complement, and in some cases replace, medications or surgery.\n\nDisclosures: The basis for this analysis, The Multicenter Osteopathic Pneumonia Study in the Elderly (MOPSE) clinical trial, was funded by a consortium of foundations including the Foundation for Osteopathic Health Services.

A major government study found the screening scans saved the life of one person for every 300 current or former smokers who were scanned.\n\nBut now cancer and screening experts are worried that the limited findings will be used by private screening centers to promote the test to a broader group than was studied. That, in turn, could lead to thousands of unnecessary lung scans, causing excess radiation exposure and unnecessary biopsies and surgery.\n\nDr. Otis W. Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, said he was stunned to hear a radio advertisement for an Atlanta screening center cite the study just a few days after the government had announced the results. The wording of the ad seemed to be aimed at a broad group, ranging from heavy smokers to women who had never smoked, Dr. Brawley said.\n\n\u201cWe really need to weigh the harms associated with screening,\u201d he said. \u201cThe scientific community still needs to digest this. To take a trial that involves people at high risk for lung cancer and to extrapolate it and say it\u2019s good for people with intermediate or low risk is not appropriate.\u201d\n\nThe study, called the National Lung Screening Trial, focused on a specific high-risk group: 53,000 current and former heavy smokers, aged 55 to 74, who had smoked for at least 30 pack-years. That means someone who smoked one pack a day for 30 years, two packs a day for 15 years or three packs a day for at least 10 years would qualify for the study.\n\nFormer smokers who had accumulated 30 pack-years were included only if they had stopped smoking within the previous 15 years.\n\nThe smokers and former smokers were given either annual CT lung scans or chest X-rays. Compared with conventional X-rays, the CT, or computed tomography, scans create a detailed three-dimensional image of the lungs. The study was stopped when it was found that the scanning group had a 20 percent lower risk of dying from lung cancer than those being screened with X-rays.\n\nBut the early results also showed a downside of scanning: one of every four lung scans showed an abnormality, which often led to additional worry, radiation exposure from follow-up scans and, sometimes, lung biopsies and even risky surgery. But because the study was stopped early, a full analysis of the harms caused by screening scans is still months away.\n\nReading the scans is tricky because harmless nodules can be misinterpreted as suspect lesions. In the study, even experienced radiologists at major cancer centers had a high rate of false positives, suggesting that the rate would be even higher in the real world.\n\n\u201cThere is a learning curve to reading spiral CTs,\u201d Dr. Brawley said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that some radiologists might be early in that learning curve and some patients may be harmed because of it.\u201d\n\nWhile the study found a benefit to scanning a specific group of high-risk smokers, that doesn\u2019t mean other groups will get the same benefit, says Dr. Peter B. Bach, a pulmonologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. In lower-risk groups, for instance, it\u2019s likely that thousands of people would need to be exposed to the risks of screening before a single life was saved. And it\u2019s possible that many of those scanned unnecessarily could be seriously harmed.\n\n\u201cThe aggregate harms to all the people\u2019s lives who are not saved have to be taken into account,\u201d Dr. Bach said. \u201cEven in these highly controlled settings, about 1 percent of the people had surgery or a part of their lung removed for something they thought was cancer and it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nLow-dose CT scans expose patients to about the same radiation levels as mammograms.\n\nFor now, most consumers who want a scan will have to pay for it themselves, although it is expected that insurance companies eventually will approve scanning for those in high-risk groups. (Medicare officials have indicated that they will soon reconsider paying for the screening tests.) The government has estimated the cost at about $300 a scan, but some centers may charge $1,000 or more.\n\nThe day the government announced the study results, Westside Medical Imaging of Beverly Hills, Calif., issued a press release saying that the study \u201cshould once and for all settle the controversy\u201d about whether CT lung scans save lives.\n\nIn the release, Dr. Norman E. Lepor said the scans were an \u201cindispensable\u201d part of annual exams for patients who have smoked for 10 years.\n\nIn an interview, Dr. Lepor said that he only offers lung scans to those at high risk, and that he turns people away who are at low risk but want the scan anyway because \u201cthey just want to know.\u201d\n\nDr. Lepor said it would be \u201cimprudent\u201d not to incorporate the latest study data into his practice right away.\n\n\u201cThere are people who, with good conscience and their take of the data, say it\u2019s not ready for prime time, and there are people who look at the same data and they come to other conclusions,\u201d Dr. Lepor said. \u201cThis is not the first study that has supported screening. We know from our own anecdotes that we have saved a lot of lives.\u201d\n\nDr. Lepor said that he had just met a woman who had smoked for 50 years and was concerned about her risk. \u201cShe\u2019s the poster person for this test,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Brawley said he\u2019s worried that the few early press releases and radio advertisements are just the beginning of widespread promotion of screening lung scans.\n\n\u201cIt was sort of ominous to be working Sunday evening in my home office and this thing comes on the radio,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people run out when there is a new announcement and get the new test. We\u2019re very frightened some people are going to be harmed because of this.\u201d\n\nA version of this article appeared in print on Nov. 16, 2010, on page D5 of the New York edition of The Times.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The one comparison was the synopsis of the key study finding:\u00a0\u201cThe smokers and former smokers were given either annual CT lung scans or chest X-rays.

In a small study from Spain, lupus patients showed dramatic improvements in skin lesions while taking the drug, lenalidomide (Revlimid), and most relapsed soon after they stopped taking it.\n\nThalidomide is best known as the drug that caused thousands of children to be born with missing limbs and other birth defects in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In more recent years it has been brought back to the market to treat a number of serious conditions, but its use is monitored closely to ensure that it is not taken by women who are pregnant or who might become pregnant. Dermatology professor Andrew G. Franks Jr., MD, of the NYU Langone Medical Center, says thalidomide is very effective for treating people with lupus skin conditions who do not respond to standard treatments such as steroids and antimalarial drugs. He says about 75% of patients with affected skin will go into remission with these standard treatments. \u201cThe question has been, \u2018What do you do with the rest?\u2019\u201d he says. Franks says thalidomide can help an additional 75% of patients achieve remission. But side effects are common and some, including nerve damage in the hands and feet, can be permanent.\n\nThe lenalidomide study included 15 women with lupus skin conditions; six had lupus in other areas of the body, too. They all were followed for seven to 30 months. All had received standard treatments, and 14 had been treated with thalidomide previously. The majority of the patients (60%) had the most common subtype of lupus-related skin disease, known as discoid lupus erythematosus, which is characterized by red, scaly patches that can scar. One patient withdrew from the study after one week due to digestive system side effects. All the other patients showed improvement, and the rash cleared up in 86%. The researchers note that the study dose was \u201cgenerally well-tolerated.\u201d No new nerve symptoms were reported.

And children who play sports are nearly three times more likely to suffer sudden cardiac death than their nonathletic counterparts.\n\n\"Few of the kids actually experience sudden death while they're in class or at home,\" says Thomas Debauche, a Houston cardiologist. \"It's pretty much while they're in training or while they're on the field performing, because that's when the adrenalin is flowing,\" and that's when they're calling on the heart for peak performance.\n\nThese surprise attacks are due to inherited problems that children are born with. Cardiologist Douglas Zipes, past president of the American Academy of Cardiology, says the problems kids suffer are typically electrical, like abnormal heart rhythms, or structural, like a thickening of the heart muscle. Both of these problems are exacerbated during exertion when kids play sports.\n\nAccording to Zipes, \"The adrenalin that is released when you're participating [in sports] can stimulate this abnormally thick heart muscle and cause a fatal heart rhythm problem, that is a very rapid heartbeat with no effective contraction, no blood being ejected to the brain and other organs.\" The result is sudden cardiac death.\n\nTypically, schools require kids to provide a family history and have a simple physical exam before participating in sports. But Zipes says more should be done.\n\nCardiologist Debauche agrees. He recently screened more than 2,000 high school athletes in the Houston area, using electrocardiogram, or EKG, to measure the electrical activity of the heart.\n\nAbout 10 percent of the students had an abnormal EKG. One of them was Louis Anthony, who suffered from asthma. In severe cases, asthma can cause the heart to thicken and put kids at risk of cardiomyopathy and sudden death. Anthony's asthma diminished over time, and he says he can still play soccer, run fast and breathe \"just fine.\"\n\nAfter the abnormal EKG result, however, Debauche told Anthony and his parents to closely monitor the asthma. They have.\n\nFor other students who had abnormal EKG results, some received medication for blood pressure and others were treated for abnormal heart rhythms. About 1 percent were told it was too dangerous for them to continue in sports.\n\nThree students had serious heart problems, including one who suffered from a rare disease in which the heart muscle is spongy and contracts poorly.\n\n\"He was literally running the stadium stairs at the time we found him,\" Debauche says. \"He was preparing for track season by running up and down the stadium stairs.\"\n\nDebauche says the heart screening turned out to be life-saving for this student athlete. The student now has an implantable defibrillator and is awaiting a heart transplant.\n\nThe severity of this and the other two problems that turned up as a result of the abnormal EKGs are reason enough, Debauche says, to screen all school athletes nationwide.\n\nSome health experts argue that would be too costly. There's no official policy from the American College of Cardiology, but officials say most members support screening student athletes.\n\nThe American Heart Association suggests that athletes who are identified as at risk for heart problems as a result of a family history or physical exam be referred for further cardiovascular examination, which could include an electrocardiogram.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "\u00a0     \n\n \nThe story makes no attempt to compare the standard approach of screening based on family history, medical exam and personal history to the proposed method of routine screening for all. \u00a0The story suggests that existing recommendations are inadequate.

It aims to screen 1,700 men for five years, but results from the first 300 men were published in the British Journal of Urology International.\n\nGenetic factors that increase prostate cancer risk include inheritable variations in genes known as BRCA1 and BRCA2.\n\nProstate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide and kills 254,000 men a year. U.S. doctors routinely recommend PSA screening in men over 50 on the assumption that early diagnosis and treatment is better than doing nothing.\n\nBut fears about overdiagnosis, which can lead to treatments such as surgery, radiation or hormone therapy that can cause serious side-effects such as impotence and incontinence, have so far dissuaded many European countries from nationwide screening.\n\nThe men in this study \u2014 205 with confirmed BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and 95 who had tested negative for the mutations \u2014 were all offered annual PSA blood testing, and 24 who had raised PSA levels were given a follow-up biopsy.\n\nEeles said the findings added to the increasing evidence that BRCA gene variation carriers develop more aggressive disease and supported the idea that men with genetic risks should be routinely screened for prostate cancer.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story mentions no screening and population-wide screening as alternatives.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Out cold: Some cardiac arrest patients revived after cooling procedure\n\nWilliam Beck was the model of fitness his entire life. He ate a low-fat diet, did yoga, lifted weights and walked three brisk miles a day.\n\nSo mystery and grief hung heavy when he collapsed from a cardiac arrest Jan. 6 inside the Teutonia M???erchor club on the North Side.\n\nFor 15 minutes, the 58-year-old McKees Rocks borough manager was a goner. \"He was dead -- D-E-A-D -- dead,\" said Dr. Jerome E. Granato, Mr. Beck's cardiologist and medical director of Allegheny General Hospital's Coronary Care Unit.\n\nBut in a happy turn of fate, in large part due to a new therapy offered at AGH, Mr. Beck was revived and now is doing amazingly well.\n\nTwo and a half months after his cardiac arrest -- a disease that kills 250,000 people each year -- he has returned to work part-time at McKees Rocks with plans soon to return full time. He is walking 45 minutes each day with plans soon to return to a full hour.\n\nReasons abound for such startling success after an often-fatal episode. He's physically fit. Several people at the club provided quick cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The ambulance service was close by and transported him without delay to AGH only blocks away.\n\nBut most surprising, he shows no diminished mental capacity after being lost to the world for 15 drama-filled minutes. For those who do survive cardiac arrest, brain damage often occurs, doctors say.\n\nWhich brings us to that new therapy at AGH. When Mr. Beck reached the emergency room that Saturday night, doctors gave him what might be described as the big chill.\n\nFor 24 hours, his body temperature was kept at 91 degrees Fahrenheit, which put him in a state of hibernation. That slowed his metabolism and reduced his need for oxygen in his brain and internal organs.\n\nReducing the oxygen need protects the brain and other organs and lowers the incidence of brain, kidney and other organ damage.\n\nIn the emergency room, AGH doctors followed established hospital criteria and inserted a cooling catheter into the femoral vein in his groin area to cool the blood as it pumped bodywide. It caused Mr. Beck's body temperature to drop almost 8 degrees below the normal 98.6.\n\nThroughout the procedure he remained sedated to prevent shivering. He was unaware his body was on ice.\n\nTwo days later, Dr. Granato saw progress in Mr. Beck, even though he eventually had to fight through a serious case of aspiration pneumonia.\n\nHis near full recovery has made him poster man for hypothermia's success in preserving brain and organ function in cardiac arrest patients.\n\nA heart attack can prompt cardiac arrest -- a situation in which the heart rhythm goes chaotic, making it quiver rather than beat, Dr. Granato said. The heart quits pumping blood, leaving vital organs depleted of oxygen -- a situation that can cause significant damage to the brain, kidneys and other organs, or death if quick emergency action is not taken.\n\nBut an electrolyte imbalance caused by dehydration, influenza or other health problems that deplete the system of potassium, magnesium and other minerals also can cause cardiac arrest. That's most likely what happened to Mr. Beck, whose heart arteries were clear. Despite the cardiac arrest, his heart was the picture of health, Dr. Granato said.\n\nDuring a cardiac arrest, he said, all organs are deprived of oxygen for a period of minutes to a half hour. The quivering or chaotic heartbeat, known as fibrillation, must be corrected with an electrical shock via a defibrillator. Once oxygen returns to the brain, further damage can occur.\n\nClinical trials showed a 20 percent increase survival with hypothermia, Dr. Granato said. There are now calls for paramedics to use the cooling procedure in the field en route to the hospital. But an entire institution must adopt the protocol to make it successful.\n\nThe American Heart Association has approved the procedure in the wake of extensive overseas clinical trials.\n\nBut putting the therapy into practice in many hospitals has been slow.\n\nUPMC Presbyterian does about 50 hypothermic therapies a year, said Dr. Clifton Callaway, assistant professor of emergency medicine. He said a doctor at Mercy Hospital also is using the therapy on patients.\n\nOut of every 100 cardiac arrests they respond to, city paramedics succeed in getting 30 to the hospital.\n\nOf those, only seven or eight will be discharged from the hospital, he said. But that number is one or two higher than would occur without hypothermic therapy.\n\n\"We believe the people who do go home have fewer neurological problems that impair the quality of life,\" Dr. Callaway said.\n\nThe percentage increase of survival could translate nationwide into tens of thousands of saved lives each year.\n\nFor now, Dr. Callaway said, there's an upswing in hospitals using the therapy and in two years it will be more routine. City doctors who perform the therapy are collegial in promoting its use.\n\nDr. Ankur Doshi, AGH emergency medical specialist, agreed the brain-protecting therapy \"is a well-established procedure all patients should get if they are in a coma\" after a cardiac arrest.\n\nDr. Ashis Tayal, an AGH stroke neurologist, said trials are under way to use the therapy to help stroke victims. Another University of Pittsburgh Medical Center study also is using hypothermia to treat victims of head trauma. Early trials show promise in both cases.\n\nWithout the therapy, cardiac-arrest patients have a greater risk of suffering dementia, loss of memory or severe devastation of mental capacity, Dr. Tayal said.\n\nAGH doctors have used the procedure in cardiac arrest victims five times since November, and three of those patients survived the procedure. Two, including Mr. Beck, walked out of the hospital.\n\nThe third survived the initial cardiac arrest but did not survive further complications and another cardiac arrest days later.\n\nAlthough the cases are few, AGH's success rate points to the value of the therapy.\n\n\"This is not investigative,\" Dr. Tayal said. \"We consider this to be a standard of care and should be a standard of care to return people to circulation.\"\n\nWithout the procedure, Dr. Granato said, the discussion about Mr. Beck would require a more serious tone.\n\nTo prevent a future cardiac arrest, Mr. Beck had a defibrillator placed in his chest, despite a low probability of a recurrence, Dr. Granato said.\n\nMr. Beck said he didn't regain full consciousness for nine days.\n\nHe remained in the hospital for weeks in large part due to pneumonia.\n\nHe now is undergoing rehabilitation and looking forward to an April 3 checkup.\n\nHe and his wife, Fran, praised AGH for successfully returning him to normal activity without any reductions in brain power.\n\n\"My goal is to get back to a normal life,\" he said, noting he hates cold weather and is surprised he withstood hypothermic therapy.\n\n\"I can't tolerate my body being cold, but it worked,\" he said. \"It boggles my mind, really.\"\n\nAnd talk about perfect timing. He said he has many reasons to thank AGH for saving his life.\n\nOne key reason: His daughter Kirsten, 28, is due to have the Becks' first grandchild April 15.\n\nFirst published on March 28, 2007 at 12:00 am", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The sequence of when this treatment would be used \u2013 and the decisions about how and when it would be used \u2013 are unclear.\u00a0 So, too, then is any discussion about what the options are.\u00a0 ", "answer": 0}, {"article": "TUCSON, Ariz., Nov. 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- HSRx Biopharmaceutical, a leading developer of proprietary OTC drugs, announced that an independently conducted clinical study has demonstrated its new product, OsteoRx\u2122, outperformed Osteo Bi-Flex Triple Strength\u00ae in alleviating pain and increasing range of motion in patients suffering from joint pain.

Alexander Technique is a series of posture lessons, devised by a 19th century Australian actor named F.M. Alexander who had troubles with chronic laryngitis whenever he performed.\n\n\"It's a feeling of working with yourself from the inside out,\" says Rodriguez. \"If you know you're twisting a certain way and using too much force, it's easy enough to know, Let that go.\"\n\nIn particular, Joe now holds himself differently during his solos because of Alexander Technique.\n\n\"I know that I can just sort of be on my sits bones, instead of a funny arch with my stomach pushed out or my back arched in some strange way,\" says Rodriguez\n\nJosephine Gray is Rodriguez's teacher and is a certified instructor in Alexander Technique. When I visited her, I was on my hands and knees next to her trying to re-learn how to stand up.\n\n\"Let the neck be free, the head go forward and up,\" Gray tells me.\n\nOnce I make it to my feet, feeling somewhat like a newborn giraffe, there's a beautiful view of the San Francisco Bay out of the studio window.\n\nGray teaches the technique and says low back pain is a common complaint of clients.\n\n\"We look at what you are doing that causes that problem in the first place, so how you sit at the computer or how you pick up your child or what you do when you're driving,\" says Gray. \"I look at ways of changing your postural habits so you don't get into pain.\"\n\nThese aren't static postures, though. Those who promote the technique say its more about how you move, and training yourself to release tension.\n\nThese are subtle \u2013 tiny, almost imperceptible shifts. And although the teacher will put her hand on your neck or shoulder, it's more to bring awareness than to make adjustments.\n\n\"The whole point is that you understand the process so that you can arrive there yourself,\" says Gray.\n\nGray and Rodriguez, the trumpet player, both say the lessons are no cure all. But there is evidence it can ease chronic low back pain over the long run.\n\nPaul Little is a primary care researcher at the University of Southampton in Britain. He led a study of some 460 patients who were given Alexander lessons, massage, or the usual care of pain killers and exercise.\n\nAfter a year, those who had massage were no better off. Those who had six Alexander lessons showed some improvement. And those who went the distance got the best results.\n\n\"The people who had 24 lessons had gone down from about 21 days of pain that the usual care group reported to about 3 days in pain,\" says Little. \"So a really dramatic difference there is reported days in pain.\"\n\nLittle's research was published in the British Medical Journal in 2008. But now he wants to figure out why it appears to work.\n\nHe's about to start a new study that involves giving chronic back pain sufferers lessons in the Alexander Technique and exercises, and then measuring how far their spines can twist and the size and strength of their deep lumbar muscles \u2013 which Little thinks might work poorly in people with chronic low back pain.\n\nHe cautions though that it may be something else entirely that accounts for the apparent success of the Alexander Technique. If that's the case, Little says he'll have to go back to the drawing board.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The article mentioned that the jazz trumpeter featured in the piece had failed to improve after trying massage, chiropractic, and powerful painkillers.

The hope is that the devices, now being tested in clinical trials, will save lives, reduce medical expenses and nudge heart patients toward managing their symptoms much the way people with diabetes manage theirs. Patients, who often are frail or live far from their doctors, can be spared frequent office visits. Doctors can learn immediately if devices are malfunctioning or if patients\u2019 hearts are starting to fail.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like having an office visit every day and a complete physical every week,\u201d said Dr. Leslie Saxon, a cardiologist at the University of Southern California.\n\nThe big leap forward came a few years ago when device companies figured out how to make transmitters that send data over a broader range, 20 or 30 feet. That meant that, with her device, Mrs. Elzo did not have to wait till her doctor could put a receiver directly on her chest. Instead, she simply went near a small box, which is attached to a phone jack near her bed. Once a week, she also measures her weight and blood pressure \u2014 key indicators of heart failure \u2014 and that information is automatically transmitted to her doctor. If there are problems, the machine alerts her doctor.\n\n\u201cNow, every single day the device is being queried,\u201d said her doctor, James Coman of the Heart Rhythm Institute in Tulsa. \u201cIt\u2019s just a phenomenal tool.\u201d\n\nThere is a downside, though: \u201cInformation overload is a very serious problem\u201d for the doctors, said Dr. Lynne Warner Stevenson, director of the Heart Failure Program at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston and a professor at Harvard Medical School, who counts herself as a proponent of smart devices. More information, she warned, is not always beneficial.\n\nThe devices transmit useful data along with data whose significance is not clear, like variations in heart rate. Large swings in heart rate can indicate risk, but it is not clear what to do about them.\n\nEven more confusing are changes in thoracic impedance, a measurement of resistance to electric current through the lung. Impedance changes can predict future heart crises, but more often have no clinical explanation. Yet when doctors get data on impedance changes, they often feel uneasy and call patients to see how they are, making patients uneasy in turn, Dr. Stevenson said.\n\nDr. Stevenson likened such information to the game of \u201cJeopardy!\u201d \u2014 doctors are given answers in search of a question. It\u2019s a challenge even for the nation\u2019s 1,000 heart failure specialists. But it can be even harder for primary care doctors, who have less expertise in heart failure yet care for most of the six million patients in the country with the condition.\n\nDr. Richard Page, president of the Heart Rhythm Society, said doctors wonder if they can be held liable if they do not look at all the data. Still, he said, the new technology \u201cis potentially transformative.\u201d\n\nFor researchers the information deluge leads to a different problem: how to analyze the data. A large clinical trial of a cardiac device used to involve 1,000, maybe 2,000 patients. Now, Boston Scientific, a maker of one of the smart heart devices, is following 400,000 patients.\n\n\u201cNo one has ever done research like this before,\u201d said Dr. Saxon, who leads an independent team of academic scientists overseeing Boston Scientific research. The company has no editorial control over the papers the scientists write, Dr. Saxon said.\n\nBoston Scientific gets data from patients\u2019 defibrillators. It also gets information on deaths from Medicare.\n\nThe data are stripped of patient identifiers and analyzed, a task requiring the company to become more like a Google or a Microsoft, handling enormous amounts of information. There are, for example, more than four million recordings of weights and blood pressures and over 60,000 instances when the defibrillators went off, shocking a patient\u2019s heart.\n\nSo far, Dr. Saxon\u2019s group has reported on the first 90,000 patients. Half of them had not been enrolled for remote monitoring and served as a control group.\n\nPatients whose doctors looked at the data survived 5 to 15 percent longer than patients in earlier clinical trials of the devices, Dr. Saxon reported. And, in a paper under review, the group reports that their three-year survival was significantly greater than that of patients in the study whose doctors did not see the data.\n\nOther researchers will be analyzing economic data. The devices can cost as much as $30,000. Do patients with defibrillators make up for some of that expense with fewer hospitalizations or doctor visits?\n\nA study using a similar device, made by Medtronic, suggests that is the case. The Medtronic study, directed by Dr. George Crossley, president of St Thomas Heart at Baptist Hospital in Nashville, involved 2,000 patients randomly assigned to receive a defibrillator that transmitted data or a device that did not transmit. Those with the nontransmitting device were seen in their doctor\u2019s offices every few months, the standard of care.\n\nPatients whose devices transmitted spent less time, on average, in the hospital when they were admitted \u2014 3.3 days compared with 4 days \u2014 and their hospital costs were $1,600 less per admission.\n\n\u201cThe plausible reason, we think, is that we got to these people much sooner in the course of their illness,\u201d Dr. Crossley said. \u201cWe think we did not let the people in the remote sensing group get into heart failure.\u201d\n\nStill, the information overload problem looms. One solution, being tested by St. Jude Medical, a medical device company in St. Paul, is to let patients deal with important data.\n\nThe idea, said Dr. Neal Eigler, a senior vice president at St. Jude, is to get heart patients to adjust their medications regularly based on readings of their heart\u2019s functioning, just as patients with diabetes adjust their insulin based on blood glucose readings.\n\nPatients hold a small device over their chest twice a day, and if they experience symptoms like shortness of breath. It transmits readings of blood pressure in the left atrium \u2014 the upper left chamber of the heart. If pressure in that chamber gets too high, the lungs can fill with fluid.\n\nDoctors preprogram the hand-held device to provide instructions to patients in response to their left atrial pressure measurements, telling them, for example, to take a different dose of a medication, restrict fluid intake, increase their activity level or call the clinic.\n\nIf successful, the smart device could have a big effect. One million patients a year are hospitalized for heart failure. Ninety percent of the time it is because fluid has accumulated in their lungs.\n\nDr. Stevenson, who has no connection with St. Jude, is intrigued. Patients can see what is happening to their own bodies and act accordingly. They have to strictly limit salt in their diet, for example, and seeing their left atrial pressure might be motivating.\n\n\u201cA patient might say, \u2018Maybe my pressure is higher because that pizza I had for dinner last night had a lot of salt,\u2019 \u201d Dr. Stevenson said.\n\nAs a more positive incentive, the device can also instruct patients to decrease their medications if they are doing well.\n\nSt. Jude recently completed a small study of 40 patients and is starting a large clinical trial. In the pilot study, the device reduced the frequency of high atrial pressure readings by two-thirds and the number of hospitalizations by 80 percent over five months.\n\nMeanwhile, patients whose doctors can deal with the data stream from smart devices say they are getting peace of mind.\n\nThey include people like Danielle Denlein, who, to her total shock, developed a serious heart problem.On October 20, 2008, at 1:50 p.m., Ms. Denlein was driving to a drug store to buy formula for her 5-day-old baby girl. Suddenly, she felt a pain in her chest. She thought it was heartburn. Then it began radiating down her arm.\n\n\u201cI just knew \u2014 I don\u2019t know how I knew, but I knew \u2014 I was having a heart attack,\u201d she said.\n\nAlthough she was only 35, her main coronary artery had ripped open, a rare complication associated with pregnancy.\n\nMs. Denlein now relies on her smart defibrillator to save her from her injured heart, and to alert her doctor, Dr. Saxon, to problems if they occur.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s life changing,\u201d Ms. Denlein said. \u201cIt gives me such a feeling of comfort.\u201d\n\nMrs. Elzo feels the same way.\n\nHad her device not alerted her doctor that it needed to be replaced, she said, \u201cI shudder to think what would have happened.\u201d", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The alternative of how things are currently done is not clear. Many involve the patient manually checking the device at home over a phone or going to the doctor. For many patients, this new technology may be of marginal benefit at unclear cost. \nIn addition to the new devices, one needs a new system of \"non-visit\" based care and monitoring.

The study discovered the specific triggers activating the development of fibrosis which accelerates heart failure. Blocking the triggers through the use of a specific kind of bile acid prevented cardiac fibrosis from occurring.\n\n\"This is something that nobody has ever seen before,\" says Marek Michalak, co-principal investigator and a distinguished professor in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Alberta's Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry. \"Cardiac fibrosis is considered a permanent remodeling of the heart. Inevitably it leads to heart failure and eventually death. The bottom line is that this shows for the first time that cardiac fibrosis is preventable.\"\n\n\"It offers hope to those who are living with heart failure,\" adds Luis Agellon, co-principal investigator and a professor at McGill University's School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition. \"Prevention of fibrosis will extend the ability of the heart to function, even if at a reduced capacity. Currently patients with heart failure have poor quality of life and a dismal prognosis. Improving their quality of life will do wonders for these individuals.\"\n\nFibrosis is an early step on the path to heart failure. According to the Heart and Stroke Foundation there are currently 1.3 million Canadians living with heart disease or heart failure--a condition that severely limits physical activity because the heart cannot pump enough oxygenated blood that the body needs. About 30 per cent of patients diagnosed with heart failure will die within the first year.\n\nCardiac fibrosis itself is caused by a variety of factors including high blood pressure, overwork of cardiac muscle and long-term consumption of a diet that is high in both saturated fat and sugar--all cause increased stress to heart cells. Individuals with diabetes, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and heart transplant recipients are also known to be at high risk.\n\n\"It's almost like building a scar,\" says Michalak. \"It's exactly the same type of biological activity but it's happening in the heart tissue. It destroys the ability of the heart to function normally.\"\n\nThe team is now pushing forward with additional studies to see if the same therapeutic effect can be achieved in humans. They also aim to gain a better understanding of exactly how bile acids can prevent cardiac fibrosis from occurring.\n\n\"We don't yet have a full understanding--nobody does--of how the bile acid actually does what it does in heart cells,\" explains Michalak. \"So, another phase of the work is to find out what actually happens within heart cells at the molecular level.

Impaired insulin sensitivity is one risk factor for type 2 diabetes, which is associated with age and obesity and happens when the body can\u2019t properly convert blood sugar into energy.\n\nThe researchers did two brief sleep experiments. On one occasion, the volunteers were permitted just 4.5 hours of rest for four nights, followed by two evenings of extended sleep that amounted to 9.7 hours on average. On another occasion, the same men were allowed to sleep 8.5 hours for four nights.\n\nAfter the four nights of sleep deprivation, the volunteers\u2019 insulin sensitivity had fallen by 23 percent and their bodies had started to produce extra insulin. But when researchers checked again after two nights of extended rest, the men\u2019s insulin sensitivity, and the amount of insulin their bodies produced, had returned to normal, mirroring what was seen during the portion of the experiment when the volunteers consistently got a good nights\u2019 rest.\n\nThe volunteers were given a calorie-controlled diet to limit the potential for their food and drink choices to influence the outcomes.

Finally, some new research offers simple, practical advice \u2014 at least for men 60 and older.\n\nResearchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and Lund University in Sweden have found that a man\u2019s P.S.A. score at the age of 60 can strongly predict his lifetime risk of dying of prostate cancer, according to a new report in the British medical journal BMJ.\n\nThe findings also suggest that at least half of men who are now screened after age 60 don\u2019t need to be, the study authors said.\n\nThe researchers followed 1,167 Swedish men from the time they were 60 years old until they died or reached 85. During that time, there were 43 cases of advanced prostate cancer and 35 deaths in the group. The researchers found that having had a P.S.A. score of 2.0 or higher at the age of 60 was highly predictive of developing advanced prostate cancer, or dying of the disease, within the next 25 years.\n\nAbout one in four men will have a P.S.A. score of 2.0 or higher at the age of 60, and most of them will not develop prostate cancer, said the study\u2019s lead author, Andrew Vickers, associate attending research methodologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering. But the score does put them in a higher-risk group of men who have more to gain from regular screening, he concluded.\n\nThe higher the score at age 60, the greater the long-term risk of dying from prostate cancer, Dr. Vickers and his colleagues found. Men with a score of 2.0 or higher at age 60 were 26 times more likely to eventually die of the disease than 60-year-old men with scores below 1.0.\n\nStill, the absolute risks for men with elevated scores were lower than might be expected. A 60-year-old man with a P.S.A. score just over 2.0 had an individual risk of dying from prostate cancer during the next 25 years of about 6 percent, the researchers found. A 60-year-old man with a P.S.A. score of 5 had about a 17 percent risk.\n\n\u201cMost of those men are going to be absolutely fine,\u201d said Dr. Vickers. \u201cBut they can be told they are at high risk and they need screening.\u201d\n\nMen with a P.S.A. score of 1.0 or lower at age 60 had a very low individual risk of death from prostate cancer over the next 25 years, the study found: just 0.2 percent.\n\n\u201cThey can be reassured that even if they have prostate cancer or get it, it\u2019s unlikely to become life-threatening,\u201d said Dr. Vickers. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong case that they should be exempted from screening.\u201d\n\nThe advice is less clear for men with scores between 1.0 and 2.0 at the age of 60. They still have a very low individual risk of dying from prostate cancer, judging from the new data. The long-term risk of dying from prostate cancer ranged from about 1 percent to 3 percent for these men, and the decision to screen may depend on their personal views and family histories, Dr. Vickers said.\n\nWhile the findings don\u2019t answer all of the questions associated with P.S.A. screening, they should give peace of mind to sizable numbers of men who decide not to continue regular testing. The results also will reassure men who decide to continue with regular screenings that the benefits most likely outweigh the risks.\n\nDr. Eric A. Klein, chairman of the Glickman Urological and Kidney Institute at the Cleveland Clinic, said that he would like to see the findings of the new study independently confirmed, but that other studies also have suggested that the risk of cancer is low in men whose P.S.A. levels remain below 1.5 in their 50s and 60s.\n\n\u201cWe are in the midst of a paradigm shift in screening and risk assessment that no longer relies on a simple P.S.A. cutoff to determine who should be biopsied,\u201d Dr. Klein said.\n\nP.S.A. screening is already not advised for those 75 and older, because the slow-moving nature of the disease means that a vast majority of men at that age are likely to die from something other than a newly detected prostate cancer. A major study last year confirmed that P.S.A. testing is not helpful for men with 10 years or less of life expectancy.\n\nBut the advice continues to be murky for younger men. In a large European study reported last year, 50- to 54-year-olds didn\u2019t benefit from screening. But men ages 55 to 69 who had annual P.S.A. testing were slightly less likely to die from prostate cancer than those who weren\u2019t screened.\n\nThe researchers who conducted the latest study also have investigated whether a man\u2019s P.S.A. score at 50 can predict his long-term risk. In a 2008 report of 21,000 men published in the journal BMC Medicine, the researchers found that two-thirds of the advanced cancer cases that developed over 25 years were in men who had a P.S.A. score of 0.9 or higher at the age of 50.\n\nThose findings can help younger men decide how intensely they want to screen for the disease. A man whose P.S.A. test shows him to be at low risk at age 50 may decide not to be retested again until the age of 60. A man with a higher score may want to do more frequent testing.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t solved every single problem with screening,\u201d Dr. Vickers noted. \u201cWe need to screen fewer people, screen the right people, and we don\u2019t have to treat every cancer we catch.\u201d\n\nA version of this article appeared in print on September 28, 2010, on page D1 of the New York edition of The Times.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "\u00a0The story focused on the possibility of reducing the number of PSA tests a man might undergo in his lifetime to screen for prostate cancer if at age 60 his PSA level is found to be less than 1. \u00a0SInce the test is run on a blood sample collected as part of the blood collected for various other types of screening and testing, the story did not make clear why reducing the number of PSA tests a man has is of importance. \u00a0It goes beyond the cost of the test itself and includes the costs for biopsies and cancer treatments which would not be done. \u00a0The story should have been clearer that beyond costs, reducing the number of tests may be a benefit because not only is testing itself stressful, but the more you test, the more likely you are to get an abnormal result. \u00a0Even if this elevated PSA level is addressed by just repeating the test, treating a urinary infection, etc \u2013 it still adds stress and cost.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "A vaccine that blocks the high from heroin has just moved one step closer to reality.\n\nThe compound, created by chemists at the Scripps Research Institute, works in a way that\u2019s similar to other vaccines. By introducing the immune system to a potential future enemy, antibodies against that invader are ready to attack when the time comes. In this case, the vaccine introduces a piece of the heroin molecule to the immune system. In response, this protective system manufactures antibodies to the drug, including the components that cause the high.\n\nAs a result, those molecules never reach the brain, preventing the euphoria that may have otherwise resulted. The absence of a high could help recovering heroin users resist the temptation to relapse, the researchers say.\n\nThe current study of the vaccine, published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, follows eight years of laboratory research and studies in rodents that indicated the compound could neutralize heroin at different doses.\n\nHere, the Scripps investigators, working with researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University, tested the vaccine on four rhesus monkeys. The animals were given three doses of the vaccine, which elicited a successful immune response that neutralized heroin given at varying doses. The high-blocking effects of the vaccine were strongest during the first month but continued for more than eight months. The researchers did not observe any harmful side effects from the intervention.\n\nRelated: Opioid epidemic and overdose deaths blamed on pharma in Ohio lawsuit\n\nTwo of the animals had been exposed to the vaccine seven months before for a similar pilot study.

He figured that a person who is dependent on drugs would find a replacement if heroin no longer caused a high.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a panacea,\u201d says Thomas. But in light of the growing drug abuse epidemic, for which, he says, \u201cwe have so few tools,\u201d adding a vaccine to the available treatments could help. \u201cIt\u2019s an avenue that shows some promise.\u201d\n\nAlthough research on humans is not yet planned, study authors Kim Janda and Paul Bremer, chemists at the Scripps Research Institute, are encouraged about this next step.

In part, this is due to the cancer\u2019s ability to resist anti-androgen therapy. A University of Colorado Cancer Center study published today [May 3] in Oncotarget shows that combining a CPT1A inhibitors with anti-androgen therapy increases the cancer\u2019s sensitivity to the anti-androgen drug enzalutamide.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge development for men with CRPC that previously did not have many options,\u201d says Isabel Schlaepfer, PhD, CU Cancer Center member, assistant professor in the Division of Medical Oncology and senior author of the study. \u201cThere is a critical need for improved therapies for this specific cancer type.\u201d\n\nMost cells use the energy of glucose (sugar). Some prostate cancers evolve to use energy from lipids (fat). Previous work shows that metabolizing lipids helps prostate cancer escape anti-androgen therapy. However, there are many steps involved in lipid metabolism and researchers have been working to break prostate cancer\u2019s ability to harness this energy source. In this study the researchers focused on the CPT1A enzyme. CPT1A helps facilitate the entry of long chain fatty acids into the cell\u2019s mitochondria for oxidation. This oxidation is vital to lipid metabolism and has been shown to aid cancer cell survival, resistance to radiation, oxidative stress, and activation of oncogenic signaling pathways.\n\n\u201cWe had to find a way to block this pathway so that the cancer would not be able to burn lipid in the mitochondria to acquire energy to resist therapy,\u201d explains Schlaepfer.\n\nIn fact, we are already able to block the action of the CPT1A enzyme. The drug ranolazine is a fat oxidation inhibitor that earned FDA approval in 2006 to treat angina. When Schlaepfer and colleagues experimented with fat burning inhibitors and anti-androgens in cancer cell lines, they found that the addition of ranolazine to anti-androgen therapy made tumors more sensitivity to the anti-androgen drug enzalutamide.\n\n\u201cThis finding may have a huge impact on patients with CRPC that had very few options before,\u201d says Schlaepfer. \u201cSince the drugs are clinically safe, a clinical trial can be designed in patients for whom enzalutamide is prescribed.\u201d", "question": "Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "Are there other drugs that have the same pharmalogical effect as enzalutamide? \u00a0We learn nothing about what else is out there that treats this particular type of cancer and how effective it might be.\nAnother approach to treating castrate-resistant prostate cancer is the drug abiraterone (marketed as Zytiga), an androgen synthesis inhibitor, used in combination with  prednisone.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "A surgically implanted electrical device that stimulates the sacral nerve can calm an overactive bladder, according to a company that sells it.

Diet has been extensively studied as a modifiable risk factor in the development of breast cancer but epidemiologic evidence on the effect of specific dietary factors is inconsistent.\n\nThe Mediterranean diet is known for its abundance of plant foods, fish and especially olive oil. Miguel A. Mart\u00ednez-Gonz\u00e1lez, M.D., of the University of Navarra in Pamplona and CIBEROBN in Madrid, Spain, and coauthors analyzed the effects of two interventions with the Mediterranean diet (supplemented with extra virgin olive oil [EVOO] or nuts) compared with advice to women to follow a low-fat diet. Study participants in the two intervention groups were given EVOO (one liter per week for the participants and their families) or mixed nuts (30 grams per day: 15 grams of walnuts, 7.5 grams of hazelnuts and 7.5 grams of almonds).\n\nThe study was conducted within the framework of the large PREDIMED (Prevenci\u00f3n con Dieta Mediterr\u00e1nea) trial, which was designed to test the effects of the Mediterranean diet on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2009, 4,282 women (ages 60 to 80 and at high risk of cardiovascular disease) were recruited. Women were randomly assigned to the Mediterranean diet supplemented with EVOO (n=1,476), the Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts (n=1,285) or the control diet with advice to reduce their dietary intake of fat (n=1,391).\n\nThe women were an average age of 67.7 years old, had an average body mass index of 30.4, most of them had undergone menopause before the age of 55 and less than 3 percent used hormone therapy. During a median follow-up of nearly five years, the authors identified 35 confirmed incident (new) cases of malignant breast cancer.\n\nThe authors report that women eating a Mediterranean diet supplemented with EVOO showed a 68 percent (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio of 0.32) relatively lower risk of malignant breast cancer than those allocated to the control diet. Women eating a Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts showed a nonsignificant risk reduction compared with women in the control group.\n\nThe authors note a number of limitations in their study including that breast cancer was not the primary end point of the trial for which the women were recruited; the number of observed breast cancer cases was low; the authors do not have information on an individual basis on whether and when women in the trial underwent mammography; and the study cannot establish whether the observed beneficial effect was attributable mainly to the EVOO or to its consumption within the context of the Mediterranean diet.\n\n\"The results of the PREDIMED trial suggest a beneficial effect of a MeDiet [Mediterranean diet] supplemented with EVOO in the primary prevention of breast cancer. Preventive strategies represent the most sensible approach against cancer. The intervention paradigm implemented in the PREDIMED trial provides a useful scenario for breast cancer prevention because it is conducted in primary health care centers and also offers beneficial effects on a wide variety of health outcomes. Nevertheless, these results need confirmation by long-term studies with a higher number of incident cases,\" the authors conclude.\n\nIn a related editor's note, Mitchell H. Katz, M.D., a deputy editor of JAMA Internal Medicine, writes: \"Of course, no study is perfect. This one has a small number of outcomes (only 35 incident cases of breast cancer), the women were not all screened for breast cancer with mammography, they were not blinded to the type of diet they were receiving, and all were white, postmenopausal and at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Still, consumption of a Mediterranean diet, which is based on plant foods, fish and extra virgin olive oil, is known to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and is safe. It may also prevent breast cancer. We hope to see more emphasis on Mediterranean diet to reduce cancer and cardiovascular disease and improve health and well-being.\"\n\nEditor's Note: Authors made conflict of interest and funding/support disclosures.

When taken within 24 hours of the first runny nose or sore throat, zinc lozenges, tablets or syrups can cut colds short by an average of a day or more and sharply reduce the severity of symptoms, according to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, a respected medical clearinghouse.\n\nIn some of the cited studies, the benefits of zinc were significant. A March 2008 report in The Journal of Infectious Diseases, for example, found that zinc lozenges cut the duration of colds to four days from seven days, and reduced coughing to two days from five.\n\nWhile the findings are certain to send droves of miserable cold sufferers to the drugstore in search of zinc treatments, the study authors offered no guidance on what type of zinc product to buy. The authors declined to make recommendations about the optimal dose, formulation or duration of zinc use, saying that more work was needed before they could make recommendations.\n\n\u201cOver all, it appears that zinc does have an effect in controlling the common cold,\u201d said Dr. Meenu Singh, the review\u2019s lead author and a professor in the department of pediatrics at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in Chandigarh, India. \u201cBut there still needs to be consensus about the dose.\u201d\n\nZinc experts say that many over-the-counter zinc products may not be as effective as those studied by researchers because commercial lozenges and syrups often are made with different formulations of zinc and various flavors and binders that can alter the effectiveness of the treatment.\n\n\u201cA lot of preparations have added so many things that they aren\u2019t releasing zinc properly,\u201d said Dr. Ananda Prasad, professor in the department of oncology at Wayne State University School of Medicine in Detroit and an early pioneer of research into zinc as an essential mineral. Two of Dr. Prasad\u2019s studies were included in the Cochrane report.\n\n\u201cThe public is confused because people have used the wrong dose, they have used the wrong sort of zinc or they have not started the treatment within 24 hours of onset,\u201d he said.\n\nEven so, the new report gives credence to the long-debated theory that zinc can be an effective treatment for colds. While it\u2019s not certain how the mineral curbs colds, it appears to have antiviral properties that prevent the cold virus from replicating or attaching to nasal membranes.\n\nThe first study to show that zinc might be a useful treatment for the common cold was published in 1984, but the research was criticized for its poor methods. Since that study, 18 more trials of zinc for colds have been conducted: 11 of them showed it to be a useful treatment, while seven of them showed no benefit, according to the review.\n\nAlthough a majority of trials have shown some benefit from zinc, many of them have been criticized for failing to \u201cmask\u201d the treatment, meaning the participants most likely knew they were using zinc, which may have skewed the results. At the same time, many of the trials that showed no benefit from zinc have been criticized for using formulations that may have contained ingredients that blunted the effectiveness of zinc.\n\nThe Cochrane reviewers selected 15 studies that enrolled a combined 1,360 participants. The studies were all considered to have good methodological quality with a low risk of bias, but they were far from perfect. All the studies compared zinc use with a placebo, but in several studies the zinc users complained about the taste of lozenges, suggesting that some people may have known that they were using zinc rather than a placebo.\n\nEven so, when the data was pooled, the effect shown was strong. The review found that not only did zinc reduce the duration and severity of common cold symptoms, but regular zinc use also worked to prevent colds, leading to fewer school absences and less antibiotic use in children. People who used zinc were also far less likely to have a cold that lasted more than seven days.\n\nThe studies used various forms and doses of zinc, including zinc gluconate or zinc acetate lozenges and zinc sulfate syrup, and the dose ranged from 30 to 160 milligrams a day. Several studies in the Cochrane review used zinc acetate lozenges from the Web site ColdCure.com, created by George Eby, the researcher who wrote the first zinc study in 1984.\n\nDr. Prasad said his studies have used zinc acetate lozenges from ColdCure.com that contained about 13 milligrams of zinc. Study participants took a lozenge every three to four hours during the day for four consecutive days, resulting in a daily dose of 50 to 65 milligrams a day, he said.\n\nSome cold sufferers have been wary about using zinc since the Food and Drug Administration warned consumers to stop using Zicam nasal sprays and swabs, which contain zinc, after numerous reports that some users lost their sense of smell after using the product.

But most of those fears are related to the use of a combination of two hormones, estrogen and progestin, which are prescribed to relieve hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause, and have been shown to increase a woman\u2019s risk of breast cancer.\n\nThe new findings, reported Tuesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association, come from 10,739 women in the Women\u2019s Health Initiative study who had previously had a hysterectomy, the surgical removal of the uterus. Nationwide, about one-third of women in their 50s have had a hysterectomy.\n\nThe Women\u2019s Health Initiative was begun in 1991 by the National Institutes of Health as a sweeping investigation of hormone use and other health issues of postmenopausal women.\n\n\n\nWhile most women in the hormone study were taking combination hormone therapy, women without a uterus took estrogen alone or a placebo for about six years and were followed for nearly 11 years. The estrogen-only group was not given progestin, which is prescribed only to protect the uterus from the harmful effects of estrogen. Although all the women in the estrogen study stopped using the treatment in 2004, the investigators have continued to monitor their health, as is typical in large clinical trials.\n\nThe most surprising new finding relates to breast cancer. The women with hysterectomies who used estrogen alone had a 23 percent lower risk for breast cancer compared with those who had taken a placebo. This is in stark contrast to the higher risk of breast cancer shown in the estrogen-progestin part of the trial.\n\n\u201cThe decreased risk of breast cancer in this group is something we totally didn\u2019t expect when we started the W.H.I. hormone therapy trials,\u201d said Andrea Z. LaCroix, the study\u2019s lead author and a professor of epidemiology at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. \u201cThis study differentiates estrogen alone from estrogen and progestin in a very big way. I hope it gets across to women, because we are not reversing ourselves.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the investigators emphasized that the results do not change recommendations concerning combination hormone therapy for the two-thirds of menopausal women who still have a uterus. The Women\u2019s Health Initiative data have consistently shown that the combination of estrogen and progestin raises breast cancer risk, and that the treatment should be used only to relieve severe menopause symptoms, using the lowest dose for the shortest possible time.\n\nBut the data are reassuring for millions of middle-aged women without a uterus who take estrogen to relieve hot flashes and other menopause symptoms.\n\nAn accompanying editorial in the journal was skeptical about the results, arguing that the design of the initiative, which is skewed toward older women and stopped all forms of hormone treatment after several years of use, does not match the way doctors typically prescribe treatment to women in their 50s at the onset of menopause.\n\nDr. Graham Colditz, an author of the editorial and professor of surgery at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said he thought data collected from observational studies that show a higher risk of breast cancer associated with estrogen use were more reliable than the data gathered from the Women\u2019s Health Initiative clinical trial.\n\n\u201cThe finding doesn\u2019t reflect how hormones are used in the U.S. at the moment,\u201d Dr. Colditz said.\n\nThe trial has, however, been held up for years as the gold standard for medical research, and its findings linking combination hormones to breast cancer and heart problems led to significant changes in the way doctors around the world treated menopause.\n\nA major caveat in interpreting the new estrogen data is that the study used conjugated equine estrogens, which are estrogen compounds derived from the urine of pregnant mares and marketed by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals under the brand Premarin. The brand has fallen out of favor with many women who are choosing treatments that contain estradiol, which is chemically similar to a woman\u2019s natural estrogen. It is not known whether the benefits of estrogen shown in the Women\u2019s Health Initiative would be replicated using a different type of estrogen.\n\nNobody knows why estrogen treatment alone appeared to lower breast cancer risk in the study, but one explanation may be that in menopausal women with low levels of natural estrogen, the effects of estrogen drugs induce cell death in existing tumors. Nobody is suggesting that women start using estrogen to prevent breast cancer, but the finding opens a potentially new avenue of research in the prevention of the disease.\n\n\u201cWe need to look closely at these findings to see if we can learn more about ways to prevent breast cancer in women,\u201d said Dr. JoAnn Manson, a Women\u2019s Health Initiative investigator and an author of the study who is chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston.\n\nIn the final analysis of the estrogen-only trial, use of the hormone was not associated with any significant risks or benefits pertaining to blood clots, stroke, hip fracture, colon cancer or overall death rates.\n\nBut there were surprising differences in the risks and benefits of estrogen use on heart risk when comparing the youngest and oldest women in the study.

It also doesn't change the very limited treatment choices.\n\nBut the new criteria, which were developed by the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association, are almost guaranteed to prompt confusion, even in people who are thinking quite clearly.\n\nThe guidelines say, for instance, that newly developed \"biomarker\" tests, such as assays for proteins in spinal fluid, and some specialized brain scans can be used for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's. But, the guidelines say, the tests are to be used only for research, and not for diagnosing Alzheimer's in the general public.\n\nThe distinction is nothing to worry about for patients and their families. \"You don't need a biomarker test\" for everyday clinical practice, says David Knopman, a professor of neurology at the Mayo Clinic, who was co-chairman of the group that revised the dementia diagnosis. The existing tests for Alzheimer's are adequate, he says. And those biomarkers? \"It's in the fine print, but it definitely says in multiple places that the biomarkers are for research purposes.\"\n\nWhy? Well, the biomarker tests and PET scans aren't yet accurate enough to reliably diagnose Alzheimer's, and haven't been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. And it's also because there are no treatments that can prevent, slow or stop early signs of Alzheimer's.\n\n\"For research, there's a lot of value,\" Knopman says. \"For everyday clinical use, very very little.\"\n\nAbout 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's. The hallmark signs are problems with thinking, learning, and memory. The current definition, created in 1984, describes Alzheimer's that way. But over the past few years there's been solid evidence that Alzheimer's starts damaging the brain years before a person starts having noticeable problems thinking. Scientists have been putting a lot of effort into trying to identify what starts the disease process, but have so far come up empty.\n\nThe new definitions, which were just published online by the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia, acknowledge this dimly understood early phase of Alzheimer's. Now there are two new pre-dementia phases: mild cognitive impairment and \"preclinical Alzheimer's.\"\n\nIn mild cognitive impairment, a person's changes in thinking are noticeable to himself, friends, or family. They would show up on tests of memory and recall, but don't interfere with everyday activities. Alzheimer's is just one possible cause. Because there are no treatments to prevent or stop Alzheimer's, many people may not consider this diagnosis a blessing.\n\nThe second new phase, preclinical Alzheimer's, is much squishier. There's no list of symptoms that a doctor can whip out to say you've got it. Rather, the goal in creating this category is to see if scientists can define when the disease starts, and track it through biomarker tests, brain imaging, or other yet-to-be-invented tests. If that happens, it might someday lead to ways to prevent Alzheimer's. But for now this category is useful only to researchers.\n\nThe goal in all this, according to the Alzheimer's Association, is to increase opportunities for earlier diagnosis and treatment. The problem is that there aren't yet any reliable tools for earlier diagnosis and treatment. The new criteria are really a call for more research \u2014 and the money to fund it. That would be good for the Alzheimer's Association and the National Institute on Aging, which sponsored the work on the new criteria.\n\nAnd it does leave one wondering if a lot more worry will be generated by the notion of \"preclinical Alzheimer's,\" when science and medicine can't offer anything to ease those fears.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "\n\n\nThis story gives readers a sense that putting off evaluation for signs of early Alzheimer\u2019s disease is a reasonable alternative, since not only are lab tests and brain scans not ready for regular clinical use, but there is limited value in getting a diagnosis since there are no treatments that can change the course of the disease.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Researchers trying to find a way to treat multiple sclerosis think they\u2019ve come up with an approach that could not only help patients with MS, but those with a range of so-called autoimmune diseases, from type-1 diabetes to psoriasis, and perhaps even food allergies.\n\nSo far it\u2019s only worked in mice, but it has worked especially well. And while mice are different from humans in many ways, their immune systems are quite similar.\n\n\u201cIf this works, it is going to be absolutely fantastic,\u201d said Bill Heetderks, who directs outside research at the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, part of the National Institutes of Health, which helped pay for the research. \u201cEven if it doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s going to be another step down the road.\u201d\n\nIn autoimmune disease, the body\u2019s immune cells mistakenly attack and destroy healthy tissue. In MS, it\u2019s the fatty protective sheath around the nerves; in type-1 or juvenile diabetes it\u2019s cells in the pancreas that make insulin; in rheumatoid arthritis it\u2019s tissue in the joint.\n\nCurrently, the main treatment is to suppress the immune system, an approach that can leave patients vulnerable to infections and cancer. The new treatment re-educates the immune cells so they stop the attacks.\n\nThe approach uses tiny little balls called nanoparticles made of the same material used to make surgical sutures that dissolve harmlessly in the body. They\u2019re attached to little bits of the protein that the immune cells are attacking, the researchers report in Sunday\u2019s issue of the journal Nature Biotechnology.\n\nStephen Miller of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago had been trying a slightly different approach to treating MS. When normal cells die naturally through a self-destruction process called apoptosis, immune cells called macrophages come in and eat up the mess.\n\nThe macrophages are carried to the spleen where they show these ground-up bits of cells to other immune cells called T-cells. It\u2019s a kind of introduction that familiarizes the T-cells with the body\u2019s normal cells. Then T-cells know not to attack healthy cells.\n\nMiller\u2019s team had been trying to find ways to use this process to re-educate the T-cells. They have been attaching bits of the myelin that T-cells mistakenly attack to healthy cells from MS patients that were self-destructing, then infusing the concoction back into MS patients.\n\nThe idea would be to \u201cintroduce\u201d the myelin to the T-cells at the same time they were \u201cmeeting\u201d the healthy tissue, and educate them to leave the myelin alone.\n\nSo far the team has only shown the process is safe \u2013 a phase 1 clinical trial. But Miller says the experiment also seemed to show they were beginning to repair the patients\u2019 immune systems. However, it was hideously expensive. \u201cIt cost probably about a million dollars to treat 10 patients using live cells,\u201d he said.\n\nObviously, the researchers needed something cheaper. Miller got together with Lonnie Shea, a professor of chemical and biological engineering at Northwestern. They substituted cheap little balls of plastic called polystyrene nanoparticles for the self-destructing cells.\n\nThese new nanoparticles stopped the course of a MS-like disease in mice, the researchers found. But polystyrene is no good to use in people. It doesn\u2019t break down and contains a compound, styrene, that may cause cancer.\n\nShea had another possibility, called poly(lactide-co-glycolide) or PLG for short. \u201cIt turns out this is an FDA approved substance that is used in resorbable sutures,\u201d said Miller.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing rare or exotic or strange here,\u201d said NIBIB\u2019s Heetderks. The particles are easy to produce, he said.\n\nThis worked just as well in mice. It only takes an hour in a chemical bath to attach little bits of myelin to the nanoparticles of PLG. When infused into a vein, they\u2019re carried by the blood right to the spleen, where the nanoparticles \u201cmeet\u201d the T-cells.\n\nIf the treatment was done as soon as the mice had their first MS-like attack, the attacks stopped. The effects lasted for the entire lives of the mice, Miller said.\n\nWhat\u2019s great about the approach, Miller says, is that it can be used to treat any autoimmune disease. For diabetes, little bits of pancreatic beta cells could be attached to the nanoparticles. For a food allergy, the part of the food that causes the allergic response could be attached. \u201cYou can try to induce tolerance to peanuts or eggs or shellfish or whatever you are allergic to,\u201d he said.\n\nOne shortcoming is that scientists don\u2019t always know what\u2019s causing an autoimmune disease. \u201cWe know that in rheumatoid arthritis, your joints get attacked, but what we don\u2019t know really well is what specific protein in your joints is being attacked. We really need to know that before we can apply this therapy,\u201d Miller said.\n\nNow the researchers are looking for funding so they can test this new approach in people. They\u2019re in discussions with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation to test it in people with type-1 diabetes, and the Myelin Repair Foundation to test it in MS patients, Miller said. They may form their own company to develop it as a medical treatment, something that would be years away.\n\nMice don\u2019t live very long, and it\u2019s not clear if human patients would need repeat treatments. But the T-cells that are re-educated usually live for a long time in the body, and have long memories, Miller said.\n\nIt\u2019s also clear the approach would not repair any damage already done by the disease, so the best candidates would be patients having their very first symptoms. But it might be possible down the road to combine the nanoparticle treatment with another treatment to replace the damaged tissue in more advanced patients, Miller said.\n\nNew drug may help MS", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story does mention other treatments, but mainly in the context of them being inferior.

It is diagnosed in 235,000 U.S. men each year and kills more than 27,000, making it the most common cancer and second-leading cancer killer, after lung cancer, among men. Most cases are diagnosed after age 65.\n\nSome experts said they hope the findings will encourage more doctors to consider treating elderly men.\n\n\"This debunks the idea that older men do not benefit from treatment,\" said Christopher L. Amling of the University of Alabama in Birmingham. \"This gives support to the idea that active treatment can be beneficial.\"\n\nOther experts expressed skepticism, saying the study's design may have missed another explanation for the lower death rate among men who were treated: They were probably healthier in ways that doctors can tell only by examining them, not by looking at their medical records, which is what the study's authors did.\n\n\"There was probably something about these guys that made them more likely to get treated that also made them more likely to survive,\" said Mark S.

The report greatly expands the universe of people who should be screened to see if they need the medication to everyone over age 40 regardless of whether they have a history of cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe recommendations also support the position of the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association, which in 2013 radically shifted their advice from suggesting that doctors focus on the level of a patient\u2019s low-density lipoproteins (LDL) or \u201cbad cholesterol\u201d to looking at a more comprehensive picture of risk based on things such as weight and blood pressure, as well as lifestyle factors.\n\n\u201cPeople with no signs, symptoms, or history of cardiovascular disease can still be at risk for having a heart attack or stroke,\u201d said Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, who chairs the task force.\n\n[Could these new cholesterol drugs save many people from heart attacks?]\n\nThe task force, which is made up of independent experts but commissioned by the government, concurred after a comprehensive review of the evidence on the topic determined that a broader evaluation of risk is needed. But it puts a greater emphasis on age than the ACC and AHA did in determining who might benefit from the medication in preventing heart attack or stroke. It is also slightly more conservative when it comes to determining the benefits of taking the medications, which include Lipitor, Crestor and Zocor.\n\nThe new guidelines, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, suggests that people ages 40 to 75 who have one or more risk factors \u2014 such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes or smoking that put them at a 10 percent or greater risk of having a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years \u2014 should be on statins. The group also said that people with a 7.5 percent to 10 percent risk \u201cmay also benefit\u201d but did not definitively recommend they take them. \u201cPeople in this group should make an individual decision with their doctor about whether to start taking statins,\u201d the task force advised.\n\nIn contrast, the ACC and AHA recommend that people with a 7.5 percent or greater risk take the drugs.\n\n[Who should take statins? A vicious debate over cholesterol drugs.]\n\nAnother important difference between the groups is that the task force withheld a recommendation about starting statins in adults who are 76 and older, saying that \u201cthe current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms.\u201d In a commentary accompanying the recommendations, Philip Greenland and Robert Bonow note that there is \u201cuncertainty and hesitation\u201d in the guidelines regarding older people but said it appears that it is not necessary to stop taking statins at age 76 if you are already on them.\n\nThe task force and AHA groups carry tremendous influence in medical practice and in what insurance companies will cover. Medicare typically follows USPSTF guidelines in determining coverage and the Affordable Care Act specifies that USPSTF recommendations rated at the strongest levels must be used as a floor for coverage for private insurers. In the case of statins, this would apply to the use of the drug by those who are 40 to 75 years old with one or more risk factors for cardiovascular disease and who have a 10 percent or greater risk \u2014 but not those with 7.5 to 10 percent risk.\n\nIndividual doctors are free to take the advice or leave it, and in recent months there has been a lot of debate about what the scientific evidence really shows regarding the therapy.\n\nThere is a consensus among experts that people at substantial risk for heart disease benefit from statins but considerable disagreement about those at lower risk. Last month, National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins wrote in the journal Lancet that \u201cit\u2019s a force for good.\u201d But Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California at San Francisco and editor of JAMA Internal Medicine, and others have been vocal about their belief that the drugs are overprescribed and that the side effects \u2014 which range from muscle pain and cataracts to possibly an increased risk for diabetes in women \u2014 should be taken more seriously.\n\nIn an opinion piece Sunday, Redberg and Mitchell Katz, deputy editor of JAMA Internal Medicine, advised everyone to take \u201ca step back\u201d and ask \u201cwhy this debate is so contentious.\u201d They suggest that the estimates of the benefits of statins may be inflated, that the drugs as an intervention are \u201cweak,\u201d and that the reports of adverse events are incomplete.\n\n\u201cIn deciding on any therapy, it is important to understand the risks and benefits, particularly for healthy people,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe two U.S. guidelines are notably more aggressive in recommending drugs than reports issued by their counterparts in other parts of the world, including the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (which recommends statins in men 40 and older but only after age 50 in women, and the U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which recommends discussing lifestyle modification before offering statin therapy). The European Society of Cardiology focuses more on managing LDL.\n\nStatins are among the best-selling drugs in the United States, with a 2011 study showing at least 32 million Americans were taking them. The 2013 ACC and AHA guidelines recommend an estimated 24 million more people should be on them.\n\nThe task force\u2019s recommendations come on the heels of an important new study, published Saturday, that shows that people who use statins survive heart attacks better than those who do not. They are more likely to not only get to the hospital and survive until they are discharged but also survive in greater numbers a year after their hospitalization than those who do not use statins.\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nStatin intolerance is real, researchers find.

Memory capacity begins to worsen, along with processing speed and the ability to form long-term memories. Finding a way to defer the onset of these issues becomes increasingly important as life expectancy gets longer and global populations age.\n\nThis study, conducted by researchers from Italy's University of L'Aquila and Mars, Incorporated, reinforces the results of several recent cognitive studies--throwing more light on the important role diet plays in maintaining cognitive health. Dr. Giovambattista Desideri, lead author on the paper, said, \"The results of this study are encouraging--they support the idea that diet, and specifically a diet rich in cocoa flavanols, can play an important role in maintaining cognitive health as we age.\"\n\nThis study was the second installment in a two-part investigation by this team into the effects cocoa flavanols have on the brain. The first study, published in the journal Hypertension in 2012, found cognitive and cardiometabolic benefits of habitual cocoa flavanol consumption in older adults who had been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Despite these findings, the question of the benefits of cocoa flavanols on cognitive function among individuals without MCI remained uncertain.\n\nThis second study just published in the AJCN looked to address this question. Enrolling men and women aged 61-85 years with no evidence of cognitive dysfunction, the participants in this controlled, randomized, double-blind study were assigned to one of three flavanol groups, consuming a drink containing either high (993 mg), intermediate (520 mg) or low (48 mg) amounts of cocoa flavanols every day for eight weeks. The nutritionally matched drinks were specially prepared. The high- and intermediate-flavanol cocoa drinks were produced using Mars' patented Cocoapro\u00ae process, while the low-flavanol drink was made with a highly processed, alkalized cocoa powder. Other than the inclusion of the test drink, normal diets and regular lifestyle were maintained throughout the study.\n\nAt the start of the study and again after eight weeks, cognitive function was assessed using a battery of tests that examined memory, retention, recall, as well as executive function. Among those individuals who regularly consumed either the high- or intermediate-flavanol drinks, there were significant improvements in overall cognitive function after only eight weeks. As cognitive function was normal for this aged population, this study shows that even cognitively healthy individuals can quickly benefit from the regular inclusion of cocoa flavanols in their diets.\n\nIn addition to evaluating cognitive function, the researchers also monitored insulin resistance, blood pressure and other metabolic markers. Excitingly, there was also evidence of improvements in these cardiometabolic outcomes. In the high- and intermediate-flavanol groups, both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced and insulin resistance was significantly improved. In contrast, only a modest improvement in diastolic blood pressure was observed in the low-flavanol group, with no significant improvements in either systolic blood pressure or insulin resistance among the consumers of the low-flavanol drink.\n\nIt is not yet fully understood how cocoa flavanols bring about improvements in cognitive function, but the study's authors suggest that the improvements in insulin resistance and blood pressure could be revealing. \"Earlier studies suggest a central role for insulin resistance in brain aging,\" said Desideri. \"These results could therefore provide some insight into a possible mechanism of action for the cognitive improvements we have observed.\"\n\nOver the past decade, there has been significant evidence indicating that consuming cocoa flavanols improves vascular function. Dr. Catherine Kwik-Uribe, human health and nutrition director at Mars, Incorporated, and co-author on this latest study, said, \"Since the brain is a heavily vascularized tissue, we might also be looking at vascular improvements as underlying the observed improvements in cognitive function.\"\n\nDr. Kwik-Uribe went on to speak about Mars' flavanol research program that has spanned over two decades: \"The amount of research showing the beneficial effects of cocoa flavanol consumption is growing and Mars is proud to be a partner in important research like this that highlights the positive role cocoa flavanols may play in supporting healthy aging.\"\n\nDr. Desideri and his team are already thinking about the next steps: \"It is clear from our latest research and other recent studies that cocoa flavanols have profound effects on the body, and specifically the brain,\" said Desideri. \"Now we'd like to know how they work and how long the effects last. If these further studies confirm the findings that brain health can be improved by consuming dietary flavanols, it may have the potential to affect the daily lives of millions of people world-wide.\"\n\nNote to Editors: This research trial was carried out with a special cocoa flavanol test product, designed to deliver a standardized amount of flavanols within a nutritionally suitable drink. This test product is currently not commercially available. Flavanol content of commercially available chocolate is variable and, given its macronutrient profile, it is not recommended as a health food.\n\nFlavanols are a distinct group of naturally occurring compounds that can be found in a variety of foods such as tea and red wine. Cocoa flavanols refers to the group of bioactives found naturally in fresh cocoa beans. Cocoa is an especially rich source of flavanols and the type and mixture of flavanols and procyanidins found in cocoa is unique. Mars studies show cocoa flavanols have a range of proven health benefits, including improved circulation and cardiovascular health.

The institute is part of the National Institutes of Health, which funded the study.\n\nKing worked on the original clinical trial on which the new analysis is based. The study, known as Active, examined the effects of cognitive training programs on 2,785 healthy older adults.\n\nParticipants were divided into three groups. One got training for memory improvement, one for reasoning and one with computerized training in speed-of-processing.\n\nIn the speed training, which emphasized visual perception, individuals were asked to identify objects on a screen quickly. The program got harder with each correct answer.\n\nParticipants had 10 one-hour training sessions conducted in a classroom setting over five weeks. Some received four additional \u201cbooster\u201d sessions one year after the original training, and four more two years after that.\n\nScientists measured cognitive and functional changes immediately and at one, two, three, five and 10 years after the training to see if it affected how participants performed daily tasks.\n\nResults of that study, published in 2014, found modest benefits in the reasoning and speed-of-processing groups, but not memory.\n\nThe new analysis was by Dr. Jerri Edwards of the University of South Florida, whose mentor, Dr. Karlene Ball of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, sold her rights to the program to Posit Science. Edwards also was a paid consultant for the company for part of 2008.\n\nThe program is now incorporated in Posit Science\u2019s BrainHQ.com brain training program.\n\nEdwards did a secondary analysis of the 10-year data, looking at the time it took individuals to develop dementia.\n\nShe found that the group that did speed training showed 33 percent less risk of dementia relative to the control group, while the memory and the reasoning interventions offered no such benefit.\n\nPeople who completed 11 or more speed training sessions were at 48 percent less risk for developing dementia over the 10 years of the study, Edwards said.\n\n\u201cAt first blush, that\u2019s kind of a big deal,\u201d Mayo Clinic Alzheimer\u2019s expert Dr. Ronald Petersen said. \u201cThis may even be clinically relevant.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, a group of nearly 70 neuroscientists and cognitive psychologists led by researchers at Stanford University\u2019s Center on Longevity and the Berlin Max Planck Institute for Human Development signed a letter saying there was \u201clittle evidence\u201d of such results from brain games.

His wife had undergone a colonoscopy, the gold-standard exam that costs about $1,500, but Rowe's internist recommended an alternative that was less invasive and expensive: a virtual colonoscopy, which uses three-dimensional images from a CT scan to detect benign polyps or cancers.\n\n\"It sounded good to me,\" said Rowe, pleased that he could schedule the $800 procedure for 7:45 a.m. at a downtown medical building. Unlike standard colonoscopy, generally performed under anesthesia, in which a long, flexible scope is inserted into the rectum and snaked through the large intestine to find and snip out polyps, the new procedure doesn't require a ride home or a day off. Rowe planned to be at his desk an hour or so later.\n\nInvented 16 years ago by a radiologist who got the idea while playing video games on a flight simulator during advanced training at Johns Hopkins, virtual colonoscopy has become an increasingly popular alternative to standard, or optical, colonoscopy, which is typically performed by a gastroenterologist. Initially regarded as a high-tech novelty, the new procedure has in recent months received key endorsements as a first-line screening test from influential medical groups, notably the American Cancer Society, after several large studies found it to be effective at finding large polyps.\n\nLike other mass screening tests including mammography, the overarching question is whether the benefits of virtual colonoscopy outweigh the risks.\n\nIts supporters, many of them radiologists who read CT scans, tout virtual colonoscopy as a more palatable alternative that has the potential to boost low rates of screening. One of the most common and deadliest malignancies, colon cancer can be prevented -- or even cured -- if detected early. Currently about half of Americans over 50 are screened for the disease; some shun traditional colonoscopy, which is the only way to remove polyps, because of its invasive nature.\n\n\"This is a really good test that's going to find way more cancer than optical colonoscopy,\" said Mark Klein of Washington Radiology Associates, who has performed more than 1,200 virtual colonoscopies since 2002, Rowe's among them. \"Is it perfect? No. But no test is.\"\n\nThe prospects for significant expansion of the procedure, which is covered by a growing number of insurance companies, have collided with a large and unexpected roadblock. In February, officials at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced a preliminary decision not to cover the procedure as a mass screening test for Medicare recipients.\n\nCMS officials, who are scheduled to issue their final ruling May 12, cited reservations expressed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of health experts, and concluded that there is insufficient evidence that virtual colonoscopy would benefit Medicare recipients. CMS cited concerns about radiation exposure and the number of patients who would require follow-up colonoscopies to remove polyps, as well as the inability of CT scans to reliably detect small or flat growths.\n\nMedicare's decision has sparked a furious lobbying campaign. More than 40 members of Congress have signed letters urging federal officials to reconsider, and the dispute has split doctors in the same specialty: the American Gastroenterological Association favors Medicare coverage, while the American College of Gastroenterology does not.\n\nIn many ways, the debate mirrors some of the complexities inherent in overhauling health care, a top priority of the Obama administration. At issue is whether virtual colonoscopy will enhance quality or whether it is, in the words of one physician blogger, \"a proxy for high-tech excesses.\"\n\n\"CMS made the right decision,\" said John Petrini, a Santa Barbara, Calif., gastroenterologist who heads the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. Why, he asks, should patients undergo two tests when one is sufficient?\n\nKlein disagrees. \"They got it completely wrong,\" he said. \"Some people will die from that decision, completely unnecessarily,\" because they won't get a standard colonoscopy.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story mentions standard colonoscopy as the alternative to virtual colonoscopy.

Recommendations included cutting 500 calories a day, eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains by following the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet approach, and exercising at least three hours a week.\n\nIn addition, the researchers asked the participants questions about sleep time, depression, insomnia, screen time and stress.\n\nDuring this part of the trial, the participants lost an average of almost 14 pounds. The 60 percent of the participants who lost at least 10 pounds went on to take part in the next phase of the trial. Those in the second phase of the trial continued their diet and exercise program.\n\nElder's team found the right amount of sleep and stress reduction at the start of the trial predicted successful weight loss. Lower stress by itself predicted more weight loss during the first phase of the trial, they added.\n\nDeclines in stress and depression were also important in continuing to lose weight during both phases of the trial, as were exercise minutes and keeping food diaries, Elder's group found.\n\nDr. David L. Katz, director of the Prevention Research Center at Yale University School of Medicine, said that \"while we often tend to look at health one condition at a time, the reality is that health is best viewed holistically.\"\n\n\"People who are healthy and vital tend to be healthy and vital not because of any one factor, but because of many. And the factors that promote health -- eating well, being active, not smoking, sleeping enough, controlling stress, to name a few --promote all aspects of health,\" he added.\n\nThis study shows that people are more likely to lose weight when not impeded by sleep deprivation, stress or depression, he said.\n\n\"Anyone who has ever tried to lose weight probably could have said much the same from personal experience. Similarly, weight loss reduced stress and depression. This, too, is suggested by sense and common experience, as it is affirmed by the science reported here,\" Katz said.\n\nThe important message is that weight loss should not be looked at with tunnel vision, Katz said.\n\n\"Improving sleep may be as important to lasting weight control efforts as modifying diet or exercise. Managing stress is about physical health, as well as mental health. This study encourages weight loss in a more holistic context,\" he said.\n\nAnother study presented earlier this month at the American Heart Association scientific sessions held in Atlanta found that people of normal weight eat more when they sleep less.\n\nColumbia University researchers discovered that sleep-deprived adults ate almost 300 calories more a day on average than those who got enough sleep.

Improvements in symptoms were greatest in patients diagnosed with normal coronary arteries or who had their medications discontinued and least in those with moderate nonobstructive disease or who received new prescriptions.\n\n\u201cAlthough CTCA removes diagnostic uncertainty and halves the rate of subsequent heart attacks, quality of life can be negatively impacted in those who are worried about their health and are found to have nonobstructive coronary artery disease,\u201d Newby said. \u201cMuch like screening tests for cancer, being told you have heart disease does not make the patient feel better,\u201d he added.\n\nIf a doctor is faced with a patient who is already on an aspirin and statin with an unconfirmed and questionable clinical diagnosis of angina due to coronary heart disease, he said, then CTCA would be useful because finding normal heart anatomy means that more invasive testing can be avoided, treatment could be stopped and quality of life improved.\n\n\u201cIf, however, a patient presents with atypical symptoms and is on no therapy, then the clinician needs to discuss with the patient the implications of potential CTCA findings, including nonobstructive disease that would mandate life-long preventative therapy,\u201d Newby said. \u201cCertainly, this is something we now discuss in more detail with our patients, some of whom have declined CTCA.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was striking for me that health status was very much related to receiving a (treatable) diagnosis or excluding such a diagnosis, rather than experiencing angina symptoms per se,\u201d said Dr. Paula M.

Obese women should gain even less.\n\nGaining too much weight is tied to an increased risk of complications for both mother and child, according to the researchers, who completed the review for The Cochrane Collaboration, an international organization that evaluates medical research.\n\nFor the new review, the researchers examined data from 65 randomized controlled trials, which are considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d of medical research. They were able to combine data from 49 trials involving a total of 11,444 pregnant women.\n\nThe women were randomly assigned to a diet, exercise, a combination of the two or standard care. The diets and exercise programs varied, but could include low-glycemic diets and unsupervised exercise.\n\nWomen who took part in diet, exercise or combination programs were about 20 percent less likely than women in standard-care groups to gain too much weight while pregnant, the researchers report.\n\nThe women who took part in diet, exercise and combination programs were also less likely to develop high blood pressure during pregnancy, compared to those in the standard care group.\n\nThere was no clear benefit among the women in the diet and exercise groups when the researchers looked at other complications, such as cesarean delivery, but it did look like there may be some benefit, they write.\n\nWhile the new study generally did not show fewer complications in the diet and exercise group, Dr. Loralei Thornburg told Reuters Health that it\u2019s good that there was no increase in complications.\n\n\u201cThis was very reassuring that there wasn\u2019t an increased risk of preterm birth with moderate exercise,\u201d said Thornburg, a high-risk pregnancy expert at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York.\n\n\u201cMost people gain more weight than they probably should during pregnancy,\u201d Thornburg, who was not involved with the review, told Reuters Health.\n\nShe said women who gain too much weight may not be able to lose it after the baby is born.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the injectable drug Siliq (broadalumab) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults.\n\nBecause of an association with suicidal thoughts and behaviors, Siliq will be sold with a \u201cblack box\u201d warning and should be considered only for patients whose psoriasis has not responded\u2014or has stopped responding\u2014to phototherapy or to other systemic medicines taken orally or via injection.\n\nPlaque psoriasis is an autoimmune condition that causes cells to build up on the surface of the skin, forming thick red patches and flaky silver-white scales. Current treatment options for psoriasis include topical treatments (like corticosteroids) phototherapy (using an ultraviolet light box or a laser) and systemic drugs\u2014delivered via a pill, an injection or an IV infusion\u2014that work throughout the body.\n\nSiliq is unique because it binds to the receptor of a protein called interleukin-17, a known contributor to inflammation. By blocking the receptor from being activated, it keeps the body from receiving signals that can fuel inflammatory responses and psoriasis progression. Two other psoriasis drugs currently on the market work similarly, but instead bind to the protein itself.\n\nThis small difference is significant, says Dr. Richard Fried, a member of the National Psoriasis Foundation medical board, since responses to drug treatments can vary dramatically from person to person. \u201cHaving another agent in our armamentarium that works by a different mechanism is a welcome addition and may prove beneficial to many psoriasis suffers,\u201d he says in an email. (Fried says he has no involvement with the drug or the drug company.)\n\nIn the three clinical trials considered for drug approval, more than 50% of patients who used Siliq achieved total skin clearance\u2014the ultimate goal of psoriasis treatments\u2014within a year. The most common side effects of the drug were joint and muscle pain, headache, fatigue, diarrhea, throat pain, nausea, flu, low white blood cell count, fungal infections and reactions at the injection site.\n\nThe drug also comes with a more serious warning, as well. In a total of six clinical trials totaling about 6,200 participants, six suicides were reported by people receiving Siliq. People with a history of suicide attempts or depression had an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior.\n\nBecause of these events, the labeling for Siliq will include a Boxed Warning, and the drug will only be available through a restricted REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program. In order to prescribe it, doctors must be certified with the program and must counsel patients about this risk. Patients must also agree to seek medical attention should they experience new or worsening mood changes, anxiety or suicidal thoughts.\n\nA causal association between Siliq and increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior has not been established. Fried, a dermatologist and clinical psychologist, points out that psoriasis itself can be associated with mental health problems.\n\n\u201cEffective treatment has consistently shown reduction in the incidence and severity of depression and reduced likelihood of suicide,\u201d says Fried. He adds that the data on Siliq suggests that it is not only effective in treating psoriasis, but that many patients experience improvement in anxiety and depression, as well.\n\nSiliq, like other psoriasis medications, also affects the immune system. It can raise patients\u2019 risk of infections and shouldn\u2019t be used by people with certain chronic conditions, such as Crohn\u2019s disease or active tuberculosis infections. People should also avoid immunizations with live vaccines while being treated with Siliq.\n\n\u201cPatients and their health care providers should discuss the benefits and risks of Siliq before considering treatment,\u201d said Dr. Julie Beitz, director of the Office of Drug Evaluation III in the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in an agency press release.\n\nThe drug\u2019s recommended dosage schedule is an injection once a week for the first three weeks, followed by an injection every other week.

In 2009, he had routine blood work that revealed an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. When PSA is above 4 nanograms per milliliter of blood, it can be one of the first signs of a prostate tumor. Harder\u2019s PSA was 9.\n\nBy the time Harder saw a urologist, it had skyrocketed to 20. His doctor recommended the traditional next step: a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy, which involves taking random tissue samples from 12 cross sections of the prostate.\n\nOver the course of two years, Harder, 60, an MRI technologist, would have three TRUS biopsies. They were all inconclusive.\n\n\u201cIt is frustrating to have a bunch of biopsies with a rising PSA and no proof of cancer,\u201d Harder said.\n\nAfter Harder\u2019s third biopsy, his urologist was ready to throw in the towel, and that\u2019s when Harder was referred to Jinxing Yu, M.D., at VCU Health. By then, Harder\u2019s PSA was around 30.\n\nYu is the director of oncologic and prostate imaging in the Department of Radiology at VCU. Over the past five years, he has developed diagnostic techniques using MRI technology to investigate difficult cases like Harder\u2019s.\n\nAfter one MRI, Yu found Harder\u2019s tumor. After that, Yu performed a targeted biopsy guided by the MRI scanner, allowing him to take tissue samples directly from the tumor.\n\nIn 2012, he started on a treatment plan: hormone therapy for six months to shrink the tumor and prostate, and then external beam radiation to finish the job. Today, his PSA is normal.\n\nOther patients who continue to hit a brick wall with negative results from TRUS biopsies yet persistently high PSA levels may not be as fortunate.\n\n\u201cA patient had 10 TRUS biopsies and his doctors still couldn\u2019t find a tumor,\u201d Yu said. \u201cIf you do not have this kind of advanced imaging, sometimes a patient runs into a situation when a tumor can\u2019t be found and treated because it\u2019s too late \u2014 it has already metastasized. He ends up diagnosed with cancer only after the tumor has spread to his bone or lymph nodes years later.\u201d\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging and targeted biopsy for the prostate have provided relief for patients like Harder who have not been able to get an accurate diagnosis. When caught early, prostate cancer is highly treatable.\n\nMuch like someone would have an MRI to investigate the cause of back pain, the technology gives doctors eyes on what is happening in prostate tissue. VCU Medical Center is one of the major teaching hospitals in the country doing advanced multiparametric MRI, which involves taking three different types of imaging sequences of the prostate.\n\nEach of the sequences \u2014 T2 weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic contrast enhanced imaging \u2014 tells a story, and together they can be used to make a diagnosis with more than 90 percent accuracy.\n\nInterpreting a prostate MRI to be able to correctly diagnose cancer is a skill that can take years to develop. Yu and his team look for certain patterns that are typical of cancer on each of the different sequences.\n\n\u201cIf we put those characteristic features together from each sequence then we can say with a high degree of confidence that this area is concerning for cancer and potentially target it for biopsy,\u201d said Sarah Winks, M.D., an attending physician in the Department of Radiology.\n\nAn MRI can also help determine how aggressive a tumor is, Yu said, and indicates if the tumor extends outside of the prostate and involves other areas \u2014 all information that helps urologists and radiation oncologists determine the best course of treatment.\n\nIn addition to enhancing detection of prostate cancer, magnetic resonance technology also enhances the biopsy process with a procedure called magnetic resonance/ultrasound fusion biopsy. MRI scans are overlaid with real-time ultrasound images to guide the biopsy needle to the tumor.\n\nIn 2014, VCU Health\u2019s Department of Radiology, supported by the Division of Urology in the Department of Surgery, purchased ultrasound/MRI fusion biopsy equipment. Prior to this, Yu\u2019s team had performed targeted MRI biopsies with the patient being moved in and out of the MRI scanner as the needle was guided to the target area \u2014 a sort of stop-motion procedure that could take up to an hour. The new equipment has simplified and shortened the process to about 20 minutes.\n\nA study published in 2015 by the Center for Cancer Research found that fusion biopsy is 30 percent more accurate in diagnosing high-risk, aggressive cancers than a TRUS biopsy. It is also much better at finding tumors in the anterior part of the prostate, near where Harder\u2019s tumor was located.\n\nYu credits the technology and also having a dedicated team that can perform multiparametric-MRI, read the MRI scans and conduct biopsies with a very high success rate.\n\n\u201cAt most places, there will be a radiologist reading the MR image and a clinician performing the biopsy. The person reading the image and person putting in the needle is different,\u201d Yu said. \u201cSometimes you don\u2019t get the same result. We do both. That\u2019s one of our strengths.\u201d\n\nYu has seen how MRI technology has changed prostate patients\u2019 care. \u201cFive years ago, 95 percent of patients with prostate cancer or a high PSA would never get any imaging,\u201d Yu said. \u201cRight now, I think probably 50 or 60 percent get imaging.\u201d Sometimes, these are patients pushing their doctors for a referral as one of Yu\u2019s patients did last year.\n\nLast August, Jim Grandon of Colville, Washington, discovered he had a PSA of 5.3. It was elevated from the 4.1 measurement that he had registered for a few years. The rising PSA was cause for concern. Instead of going through with an immediate TRUS biopsy recommended by his urologist, he decided to research next steps.\n\n\u201cWith just going in and doing a blind biopsy like most urologists will do, you have anywhere from 35 to 45 percent success rate,\u201d Grandon said. \u201cI found three or four places around the country with a biopsy success rate of over 85 percent. When I went back to my urologist, he said, \u2018Why spend money flying around the country when we can take care of you here?\u2019 I said, \u2018Because 85 percent is better than 40 percent.\u2019\u201d\n\nVCU Medical Center was one of the places Grandon had researched to get his diagnostic testing done, and a few phone calls later, he was on a plane flying across the country to see Yu.\n\nOn his second day in Richmond, Grandon had an MRI that showed a lesion. The next day, Yu biopsied it. On the fourth day, Grandon flew home and began researching treatment options. He opted for brachytherapy followed by external radiation at a clinic closer to home, and recently completed his treatment.\n\nMore and more, physicians are hearing about and understanding the benefits of MRI technology for prostate care, which has also been helpful in preventing overdiagnosis and overtreatment. According to the Center for Cancer Research study, MRI targeted biopsies detect 17 percent fewer low-risk tumors. These are tumors that would have never developed into a life-threatening cancer, but might lead a doctor and patient to treat it unnecessarily.\n\nWhen Yu started prostate MRI screening in 2011, his team performed about 50 scans per year. Now, with the support of Massey Cancer Center, Urology and Radiation Oncology, they are doing about 1,200 multiparametric-MRI and 200 imaging guided biopsies per year. He estimates the volume will continue to increase because VCU will attract patients not only from the Greater Richmond area but also patients such as Grandon from other parts of the country.\n\nYu hopes the advanced technology means positive changes in the standard of care. He speculates that in the same way women have a baseline mammogram, men would have a baseline prostate MRI and periodic magnetic resonance scans if warranted by bloodwork and family history.", "question": "Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The news release offers comparisons between MRIs and the current standard of ultrasound-guided biopsies.\nOne option not mentioned is foregoing a PSA test.

Several companies do not sell tests in China or India, where boys are prized over girls and fetuses found to be female have been aborted. While sex selection is not considered a widespread objective in the United States, companies say that occasionally customers expressed that interest, and have been denied the test. A recent study of third pregnancies in the journal Prenatal Diagnosis found that in some Asian-American groups, more boys than girls are born in ratios that are \u201cstrongly suggesting prenatal sex selection,\u201d the authors said.\n\nAt least one company, Consumer Genetics, which sells the Pink or Blue test, requires customers to sign a waiver saying they are not using the test for that purpose. \u201cWe don\u2019t want this technology to be used as a method of gender selection,\u201d said the company\u2019s executive vice president, Terry Carmichael. Sex-determination tests are part of a new frontier of fetal DNA testing, which can be used to determine paternity and blood type, and is being used to develop early screening tests for genetic diseases or disorders like Down syndrome.\n\nThe new study found that to be reliable, the sex-determination tests had to be performed after at least seven weeks of gestation. Most tests that were highly accurate were conducted on a mother\u2019s blood, not urine. And certain rigorous laboratory procedures had to be followed. For the blood tests, women prick their fingers and send blood samples to labs. If the Y chromosome is detected, the fetus is male. Absence of a Y chromosome would probably mean the fetus is female, but could mean that fetal DNA was not found in that sample.\n\nThe tests are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration because they are not used for medical purposes, a spokeswoman said, but the agency is investigating the explosion of home genetic tests like these and genome-sequencing kits.\n\nDr. Diana Bianchi, executive director of the Mother Infant Research Institute at Tufts Medical Center in Boston and the lead author of the sex-determination report, said, \u201cA very important aspect of the study is how this advances prenatal care.\u201d\n\nBut there are potential concerns too, she said, including that women may spend more than $250 for the tests when they don\u2019t have insurance for prenatal care. A typical blood test like Pink or Blue, for example, costs $25 for the kit. Lab fees and shipping costs, which vary, bring the total expense to $265 to $330.\n\nDr. Bianchi is conducting another study to \u201ctry to find out why people are buying these things and what are the consequences,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to educate health care providers that pregnant women are buying these tests.\u201d\n\nAnother type of test not studied by the researchers has become popular because it is cheaper and can be done at home. These tests analyze hormones in women\u2019s urine, a method that several experts said has not been studied as rigorously as DNA. Rebecca Griffin, a founder of the biggest seller, Intelligender, said two independent studies found it 90 percent accurate at 10 weeks.\n\nAnother company, TrovaGene, has developed a DNA test using urine, which, according to Gabriele Cerrone, TrovaGene\u2019s co-founder and director, is 95 percent accurate at predicting boys at seven weeks, and 88 percent accurate at predicting girls. TrovaGene is also developing a test for Down syndrome.\n\nMost DNA tests on the market use blood.\n\nRaylene Lewis, 34, of College Station, Tex., had a frustrating experience with a now-defunct company, Acu-Gen, which guaranteed 99.9 percent accuracy with its blood tests. In 2005, she was told she was having a boy, and she chose a name, bought boy clothes and told everyone. When an ultrasound revealed she was carrying a girl, \u201cI was absolutely shocked,\u201c she said. She was not unhappy, she said, but \u201cit was like the baby boy disappeared.\u201d\n\nWhen the Lewises complained to Acu-Gen\u2019s president, they were told, \u201cWe are very sure that genetically you are having a male,\u201d she said, reading a transcript of the conversation, which they recorded. The official suggested that the baby might be \u201cwhat a baby girl looks like on the outside,\u201d but that \u201cwe\u2019re giving you the results on the inside.\u201d\n\nMs. Lewis, who sued Acu-Gen, said she ultimately received a refund. Lawyers for Acu-Gen could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe Pink or Blue test, which claims 95 percent accuracy at seven weeks and gives refunds for wrong results, appears to meet the standards described in the new study.\n\nChelsea Wallace, 23, of Okeechobee, Fla., was thrilled early this year when the test she took at seven weeks said she was having a boy, a result confirmed weeks later by ultrasound. Ms. Wallace, who has a 3-year-old daughter, said she also would have been happy with a girl, but that since she and her fianc\u00e9 could not agree on a boy\u2019s name, finding out early gave them time to choose the name Layton.

Now, a small pilot study suggests such a test could be developed.\n\nThe study, of 78 people with and without colon cancer, found that those with the disease tended to have a distinct pattern of chemicals in their breath. And when researchers analyzed the study participants' breath samples, they correctly identified the colon cancer patients 76 percent of the time.\n\nThe findings, reported online Dec. 5 in the British Journal of Surgery, sound good. But if you're waiting for your doctor to offer such a test, don't hold your breath.\n\n\"It's an interesting concept, but this is in the very early stages,\" said Dr. Durado Brooks, director of prostate and colorectal cancers for the American Cancer Society.\n\n\"There's no way to tell if this would work in the general population,\" said Brooks, who was not involved in the research.\n\nWhat's more, he added, there are already several good ways to catch colon cancer -- or, even better, precancerous growths called polyps, which can then be removed before a tumor develops. Yet about 40 percent of Americans who should be getting screened are not.\n\n\"Colon cancer is a highly preventable disease,\" Brooks said. \"And I would encourage the four out of 10 people who are not taking advantage of the existing screening tools to talk with their doctor.\"\n\nThe idea of using a breath test to catch cancer is not new: Researchers are looking into breath tests for detecting a number of cancers, including lung and breast tumors. It's all based on studies showing that breath samples from cancer patients tend to have a distinguishing pattern of so-called volatile organic compounds (VOCs).\n\nWhen it comes to colon cancer, people already have several options for screening, which for most adults should begin at age 50 -- or possibly earlier if you are at higher-than-normal risk.\n\nThe choices include a yearly stool test that looks for hidden blood, or either of two invasive tests that scope the colon: sigmoidoscopy every five years, along with stool testing every three years; or colonoscopy every 10 years.\n\nBut many people are turned off by those tests.\n\nSo Dr. Donato Altomare and colleagues at the University Aldo Moro in Bari, Italy, decided to test the feasibility of a breath test.\n\nAnalyzing breath samples from 37 patients with colon cancer and 41 healthy middle-aged adults, the researchers found 15 VOCs that seemed to differ between the two groups.\n\nThey then used a statistical model to see if certain VOC patterns separated the colon cancer patients from the healthy participants. In the end, the researchers were able to correctly identify the cancer patients 76 percent of the time.\n\nBut, Brooks pointed out, that also means the breath test was wrong about one-quarter of the time.\n\nThere's no way of knowing how well such a screening test would work in the real world -- including how many people might wrongly get a positive result and undergo needless invasive tests to follow up, Brooks said.\n\nAnother big question, he added, is whether breath analysis could pinpoint people with colon polyps.\n\n\"One of our goals in screening is to detect polyps, not cancer,\" Brooks said. \"This study doesn't address that.\"\n\nAltomare's team acknowledges that there is a lot of work left to do. It's still unclear which breath chemicals should be measured, or what statistical method is best for weeding out cases of colon cancer.\n\nBrooks said it would be nice to have a very simple, accurate screening test -- whether that means a breath test or blood or urine tests. Yearly stool tests are simple and cheap, but people often don't want to do them.\n\n\"We're always searching for simpler things to do,\" Brooks said.

It is found throughout the human body, with high concentrations in the liver, adrenal glands and brain.\n\nThe latest research, conducted by investigators at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, is important not only because it suggests another treatment option for patients with depression, but because it also offers news clues into the physical pathways of depression that could ultimately lead to more effective treatments.\n\n\u201cThere are many directions in research that this opens up,\u201d said Dr. George I. Papakostas, director of treatment resistant depression studies at Mass General and the study\u2019s lead author. \u201cIt provides clues to new treatments, and it provides clues to understanding what causes depression as well as what goes on biochemically when people get better from depression.\u201d\n\nThe researchers studied the use of SAMe or a placebo in 73 adults with depression who were not responding to prescription antidepressant treatment. All of the study subjects continued to take the prescription antidepressant, but 39 of them were randomly assigned to receive SAMe for six weeks. The remaining 34 patients received a placebo in addition to their regular prescription treatment.\n\nAfter six weeks of treatment, 36 percent of the patients taking a combination of SAMe and an antidepressant showed improvement, compared to just 18 percent of those taking the antidepressant and placebo. And about 26 percent of patients in the SAMe group experienced a complete remission of symptoms, compared to just 12 percent in the placebo group, according to a report published in The American Journal of Psychiatry.\n\nThe research offers hope to patients who haven\u2019t been helped by traditional antidepressant treatment. Studies suggest that for more than half of depressed patients, antidepressants alone don\u2019t eliminate symptoms. As a result, doctors are looking for additional treatments to help these patients, referred to as \u201cnonresponders.\u201d\n\nModern antidepressants essentially work by building up concentrations of neurotransmitters, which amplifies their effect on the brain. It\u2019s not clear exactly how SAMe works to curb depression, but researchers have several theories. SAMe may influence the expression of genes involved in depression or alter the function of different receptors and structures that transport neurotransmitters in the brain. The molecule also may be directly involved in the creation of neurotransmitters.\n\n\u201cMost antidepressants we use are acting on neurotransmitters in the brain,\u201d said Dr. J. Craig Nelson, professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, and author of an editorial accompanying the study. \u201cIt may be that SAMe is facilitating the synthesis of the neurotransmitters that the drugs then act on. That\u2019s probably the best hypothesis.\u201d\n\nOther studies have suggested that SAMe can relieve symptoms of depression. A 2002 analysis of depression trials conducted by the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality found that SAMe use resulted in clinically meaningful benefits to depressed patients compared to placebo, and that the supplement worked as well as tricyclic antidepressants, a category of prescription drugs.\n\nIn his editorial, Dr. Nelson notes that SAMe is typically not covered by insurance companies, and that although the cost is relatively low, it is still more than the drug co-payments required by most health plans. A monthly supply of the same brand of supplement studied would be about $143, the editorial notes.\n\nDr. Nelson, who was not involved in the Harvard study, said the results need to be replicated in a larger study, and that more information is needed on dosing, side effects and long-term treatment with SAMe, among other things. Dr. Papakostas agrees the study \u201cneeds replication\u201d but said he is hopeful about the potential for future research.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge advancement in terms of expanding the types of medications we have to treat depression,\u201d Dr. Papakostas said. \u201cIn the last 60 years of depression research, all the treatments have focused on similar mechanisms of action. This is one of the first few studies that suggests a different mechanism. It\u2019s a medication that works differently than everything else.\u201d\n\nThe study was funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Mental Health, but the SAMe pills and placebo pills were provided by the dietary supplement maker Pharmavite.

Hughes, chief executive of Zafgen, said the Boston company will use the data to prepare a \u201crisk-mitigation\u201d plan to help persuade the Food and Drug Administration to lift its so-called clinical hold on the late-stage trial, allowing it to resume. But he conceded that Zafgen, which had once hoped to begin selling its drug candidate, Beloranib, as early as 2016, will have to conduct at least one additional study before it can apply for FDA approval.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re delighted with the results,\u201d Hughes said in an interview. \u201cThis is the first demonstration of a clinical benefit against two of the major issues that affect this patient population. Our intention is to provide a plan for moving forward with an emphasis on patient safety.\u201d\n\nThe clinical results did not address a key issue for patients and regulators: whether Beloranib triggered the blood clotting that resulted in two patient deaths last year. Zafgen has lost more than 80 percent of its stock value since the week in October when the first death was made public.\n\nMany patients suffering from Prader-Willi syndrome, the rare condition Beloranib treats, are prone to blood-clotting and other diseases. Hughes said Zafgen will continue to study the effect of the drug in its further trials and risk-mitigation plan, and address it in discussions with FDA officials.\n\n\u201cAs of today, we have no evidence to suggest that Beloranib by itself can cause blood clots,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cThis is a patient population that\u2019s at risk for thrombotic [clotting] issues.\u201d\n\nZafgen said its six-month study involving 107 patients suffering from Prader-Willi syndrome met its two primary goals, known as end points: showing significant weight loss by many patients and a decrease of hyperphagia-related behavior, meaning excessive eating.\n\nWhile the FDA\u2019s clinical hold prevented Zafgen from completing its trial, Dennis D. Kim, the company\u2019s chief medical officer, said it was largely finished. Sixty-eight of the enrolled patients completed the study, Kim said, while 27 other patients completed 20 of the trial\u2019s scheduled 26 weeks. A small number of other patients withdrew early.\n\nZafgen has not identified the patients who died or said at which of 14 US trial sites they were taking the drug. Some analysts have suggested the FDA might approve the drug, despite the adverse events, if Zafgen can prove its benefits outweigh its risks to some patients.\n\nThere are currently no treatments for Prader-Willi syndrome, the most common genetic cause of life-threatening obesity. Prader-Willi affects an estimated 6,000 to 8,000 Americans.\n\nIt can dominate the lives of patients and their families, leading to excessive overeating, choking, and stomach rupture, along with slowed metabolism and psychiatric disorders.\n\n\u201cThe efficacy of Beloranib looks very promising,\u201d said Dr. Merlin G.

But now the Food and Drug Administration has evaluated the safety of the second generation of silicone implants and the results are mixed.\n\nAn FDA report, released in late June, says silicone implants are generally safe. But complications from implants are frequent \u2014 things like hardening of the skin around the implant; ruptured, wrinkled, or lopsided implants; scarring, pain and infection.\n\nAs many as half of patients will need to have additional surgeries or have the implants removed in the first decade.\n\nIt also turns out that the longer a woman has the implants, the more likely she is to experience these complications.\n\nTake Kate Marion. She had silicone implants for breast augmentation in her late 20s. Just shy of two decades later she noticed something unusual.\n\n\"When I was crossing my left arm across my body \u2014 for instance, to put lotion on my right arm \u2014 I would make a little noise from my armpit, the way little boys do when they stick their hand in their armpit and pump their arm up and down,\" Marion says. \"A little tooty noise.\"\n\nAn MRI showed both her implants had burst. Her doctor immediately recommended removing them, which she did. Marion hasn't suffered any apparent harm from her ruptured implants, and she even confesses to having an occasional twinge of regret that she didn't have them replaced when she had the old ones removed. But ultimately she decided she didn't want to go through more surgery.\n\n\"Well, how long would these next ones last? I would be in my 60s when I had to do this again, and who wants to have surgery unnecessarily when you are 60 something?\" says Marion.\n\nAlthough the long-term effects of silicone in the body are still uncertain, many plastic surgeons don't see the leaking of modern implants as a health concern.\n\n\"The actual silicone that's within the implants is inert. So if the silicone gel leaks, it doesn't travel through the body, it doesn't cause systemic problems. So the MRI is really detecting a cosmetic concern,\" says New York City plastic surgeon Matthew Schulman.\n\nBut there have been more serious outcomes. Annette Knecht got silicone implants in 1991 following a double mastectomy. For years afterward she felt ill, suffered multiple bouts of pneumonia, had trouble breathing and pain in her chest. Doctors reassured her it wasn't her implants.\n\n\"We had a CT scan done, and it showed OK \u2014 everything looked fine, so we didn't worry about it,\" says Knecht.\n\nBut no one ever told her to get an MRI \u2014 something the FDA now recommends that women with silicone implants get every few years. As it turned out, Knecht's implants had leaked; a biopsy found silicone in her lymph nodes and in her lungs. She is currently disabled and awaiting a lung transplant \u2014 all, she says, for vanity.\n\n\"We're about four generations removed from those implants,\" says Schulman, the plastic surgeon. He explains that implants have undergone big changes since the early 1990s, when Knecht received hers. Back then they contained a runny liquid silicone.\n\n\"The silicone implants of today are what we call a cohesive gel \u2014 it's essentially like a jelly. So the jelly may ooze a little bit, but it will not run out like an oil,\" says Schulman.\n\nSid Wolf of the nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen is among critics who point out that the data in the FDA report sample just a fraction of the nearly 400,000 women who receive breast implants each year. Moreover, that data are limited to just the last two or three years \u2014 not enough, Wolf says, to make any real claims about the long-term safety of the implants.\n\n\"There is a huge deficiency of long-term data at a time when we know that the longer these devices are in, the more problems ... occur,\" says Wolf.\n\nStill, there are plenty of satisfied customers among the nearly 400,000 women who receive breast implants each year. Not only have the number of women choosing breast implants for augmentation risen by nearly 40 percent in the last decade, Schulman says that in his practice, 80 percent of them are choosing silicone over saline. What's more, he says few of them follow the recommendations to get routine MRIs to screen for leaks.\n\nSchulman says that the rates of complications for silicone implants are roughly the same as for saline \u2014 though he feels these complications can be minimized by choosing an experienced surgeon. Still, he warns his patients that no procedure is without risks \u2014 and additional surgeries are a very real possibility.\n\n\"Your young breast implants don't last forever,\" says Schulman. \"They may leak, they may rupture, you may decide you want a different size. So you have to at least expect that sometime in your life, you are going to need a reoperation.

Sadler from Warwick's Department of Chemistry, researchers have developed a new line of attack against cancer: an organic-osmium compound, which is triggered using a non-toxic dose of sodium formate, a natural product found in many organisms, including nettles and ants.\n\nNamed JPC11, it targets a metabolic process which cancer cells rely on to survive and multiply. It does this by converting a key substance used by cancer cells to provide the energy they need for rapid division (pyruvate) into an unnatural lactate - leading to the cells' destruction.\n\nUniquely, this chemo-catalyst treatment can be recycled and reused within a cancer cell to attack it repeatedly.\n\nThis unprecedented functional ability to recycle and reuse the compound within cancer cells could lead to future anticancer drugs being administered in smaller, more effective, and potentially less toxic doses - decreasing the side-effects of chemotherapy.\n\nThe researchers have been focusing on the potential to use this compound on ovarian and prostate cancers.\n\nOvarian cancers are becoming increasingly resistant to existing chemotherapy drugs (such as the platinum drug, cisplatin). Since this new research functions in a totally new and unique way, it may overcome this acquired resistance and widen the spectrum of anticancer activity.\n\nImportantly, the development opens up a possibility for a more selective cancer treatment as JPC11 was observed to specifically target the biochemistry of cancer cells, leaving healthy cells largely untouched - another improvement compared to existing platinum-based drugs, which can also attack non-cancerous cells.\n\n\"This is a significant step in the fight against cancer. Manipulating and applying well-established chemistry in a biological context provides a highly selective strategy for killing cancer cells.\n\n\"We have discovered that chemo-catalyst JPC11 has a unique mechanism of action - and we hope that this will lead to more effective, selective and safer treatments in the future.\"\n\nProfessor Peter Sadler, a medicinal chemist at the University of Warwick commented:\n\n\"Platinum compounds are the most widely used drugs for cancer chemotherapy, but we urgently need to respond to the challenges of circumventing resistance and side-effects.

Chemo-catalysts, especially those with immunogenic properties, might provide a breakthrough.\n\n\"It will take time to progress from the lab to the clinic, but we are fortunate to have a talented enthusiastic, international team working with colleagues in Warwick Cancer Research Centre across the borderlines of chemistry, cell and systems biology and cancer medicine who are determined to succeed.\"\n\nProfessor Martin Wills, catalyst specialist at the University of Warwick, commented:\n\n\"Although asymmetric catalytic hydrogenation processes are well developed in the materials industry, this research provides the first ever example of it being achieved inside cells using a synthetic catalyst.\"\n\nHandedness (molecular asymmetry) is critical to the function of bio-molecules in the body. Proteins, enzymes and our DNA, for example - are handed. Only the correct hand works, in the same way that a right hand does not fit a left-hand glove.\n\nIn this case, the osmium compound JPC11, with sodium formate, can selectively produce a molecule of a specific 'handedness' - thus manipulating how cancer cells grow.\n\n\"The 'handedness' of molecules is critical in the body. Our hands are near-identical, but are mirror images of each other. The same can be true of molecules, and in some cases, having the wrong handed molecule can have profound biological consequences.\n\n\"We believe that manipulation of the 'handedness' of molecules in cells could provide a new strategy for fighting diseases.\"\n\nThe research, 'Asymmetric transfer hydrogenation by synthetic catalysts in cancer cells', is published in Nature Chemistry.

Gelmann, deputy director of the Comprehensive Cancer Center at Columbia University. \u201cTechnology today enables us to find out a huge amount of information,\u201d Dr. Gelmann said. \u201cBut how does the public deal with this information? How does it help them make decisions? And if they make a decision, does that lead to a day, a week, a month, of life saved?\u201d\n\nThe study, by scientists at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, the Harvard School of Public Health, and Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, will appear in the Feb. 28 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. It was released online on Wednesday, a journal spokeswoman said, because \u201cit is a very active area of research with a lot of competition.\u201d\n\nResearchers long knew that the disease often runs in families. Though scientists spent years looking for genes, they found none that were reproducibly associated with a marked effect.\n\nWith new technology to scan the entire length of a person\u2019s DNA, researchers tried a new approach. They began looking for small variations in tiny DNA regions that were associated with prostate cancer. That resulted in the discovery, by several groups of investigators in Iceland and the United States, of the gene variants, small alterations in gene sequences. Unlike traditional genetic links to disease, the variants are not mutations that destroy a gene\u2019s function. In fact, no one knows what their effect is.\n\nThe next step was to ask whether those variants really could predict who had prostate cancer. So Dr. Jianfeng Xu, a professor of epidemiology and cancer biology at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, and his colleagues studied a Swedish population of 2,893 men with prostate cancer and 1,781 men who did not have it. That led to their finding that each of the five variants independently predicted prostate cancer risk.\n\n\u201cEach confers a moderate risk,\u201d Dr. Xu said, adding that the effect of having just one of the variants \u2014 a 10 or 20 percent increase in a man\u2019s chance of having prostate cancer \u2014 was not enough to justify using a single variant for screening. But, he added, because each conferred an independent risk, the risks added up so that the more men had, the greater their risk. Then they found that family history of the cancer added an independent risk. \u201cThat was very, very surprising to us,\u201d Dr. Xu said.\n\nThe next step, Dr. Isaacs said, is to look in other populations. \u201cWe think that can happen almost instantaneously,\u201d he said, explaining how scientists have blood samples and family histories of thousands of men who were tested for prostate cancer.\n\nBut some said that if the test leads to more screening, it is not necessarily a good thing. There is already too much prostate-cancer screening, they say, resulting in too much treatment. \u201cTo me, it is a nightmare,\u201d Dr. Albertsen said. \u201cWe are just feeding off of this cancer phobia.\u201d\n\nWhat is needed, and what the new test does not provide, is a way to decide which cancers are dangerous and which are not, Dr. Isaacs said. Still, he said the new test could help patients if it was used with caution. \u201cWe may be premature with this idea \u2014 everyone has a different way of thinking about this \u2014 but it should not take five years to know if we are on the right track. All this can happen very rapidly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have worked with enough families that have a positive family history to know that people are anxious to know their risk of prostate cancer,\u201d he said.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story never mentioned that it is an option to decline screening.

According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA), 15 million adults\u2014approximately 6.7 percent of the population\u2014suffer from major depressive disorder, which is most often treated through a combination of talk therapy and medication. Those who struggle with depression have imbalanced levels of serotonin, which maintains mood, and dopamine, which controls the pleasure and reward zones. The brain\u2019s synapses control how much of these chemicals are released, and drugs like Zoloft effectively prevent the little serotonin being produced from reabsorbing back into the nerve cells from which they were released, resulting in a higher concentration of serotonin. Some pill-averse patients have longed for a natural cure for depression, while others complain that the drugs they\u2019re on aren\u2019t enough. Hope for both groups may have arrived through an unlikely source: magnets. Researchers discovered they can harness the power of magnetism to increase serotonin production and combat depression through a process called Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS).\n\n\u201cEach [symptom of depression] maps onto a given circuit of the brain,\u201d neurologist Alvaro Pascual-Leone told NPR in April 2016 about treating patients using TMS. \u201cThe reason why that circuit of the brain is not functioning properly...has to do with a deficit of a certain chemical in the brain. But the point is that if we can identify the circuit that causes the symptoms, we can target that circuit and make it function better through brain stimulation. So, in a sense, [TMS is] not a treatment...for the ultimate cause of the disorder, but it\u2019s an intervention that improves how the patient is able to function.\u201d\n\nTMS has a lot in common with a traditional MRI scan. In fact, the only clue TMS treatment contains magnets at all is that patients must remove any jewelry and stow their credit cards (to prevent demagnetization) before treatment. According to Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine\u2019s description of the technique, a coil is fitted to the front of a patient\u2019s head so the electromagnetic pulses can target the prefrontal cortex of the brain, which controls emotion. A physician then tests the machine to see how much power is needed to affect the patient\u2019s reflexes. Once the patient\u2019s thumb involuntarily twitches, the current is strong enough to affect the patient\u2019s brain activity. At this point, specific symptoms can be targeted depending on the patient\u2019s needs.\n\nThe biggest drawback to TMS, according to advocates, is the limitations on just who can undergo the treatment. Though it was approved by the FDA in 2008, its use is federally restricted with exemptions only for those with severe depression, autism or Parkinson\u2019s. Even those who are approved to undergo the treatment face another barrier as TMS is not widely covered by health insurance. Its efficacy varies from patient to patient and, like most prescriptions for depression, TMS has its own set of side-effects. The most common, not surprisingly, are headaches. Although one-third of patients have reported experiencing painful scalp sensations and facial twitching, these tend to fade after several treatments.\n\nDespite these setbacks, researchers are optimistic about TMS\u2014and not just as a form of treatment for depression. Experiments treating Parkinson\u2019s and autism, the other two conditions for which TMS is approved, have seen some success among neurologists. More studies will be needed to determine whether this method can be used as a widespread treatment for other brain-related disorders, but if today\u2019s research is any indication, TMS could be a key to improving the lives of Americans suffering from a multitude of disorders.\n\nThis article was excerpted from Newsweek's Special Edition: Nature's Remedies\u2014Heal Your Body.

It does this by enhancing the protective neurohormonal systems (Natriuretic Peptide system) while simultaneously inhibiting the harmful effects of the overactive renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).11 Other heart failure medicines only block the harmful effects of the overactive RAAS.12 Entresto contains the neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril, and the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) valsartan.11\n\nEntresto is indicated in the US to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with chronic heart failure (NYHA Class II-IV) and reduced ejection fraction.11 Entresto is usually administered in conjunction with other heart failure therapies, in place of an Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).11 Entresto film-coated tablets are available in three dosage strengths: 24/26 mg, 49/51 mg, and 97/103 mg (sacubitril/valsartan).11 These doses are referred to as 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg in the clinical trial literature including the New England Journal of Medicine publication of the results of PARADIGM-HF. The target treatment dose of Entresto is 97/103 mg twice daily.11\n\nNovartis is committed to providing patients with affordable access and resources through Entresto Central.

A pathologist, examining the brain after death, would see microscopic black freckles, plaque, sticking to brain slices like barnacles. Without plaque, a person with did not have the disease.\n\nThere is no treatment yet to stop or slow the progress of Alzheimer\u2019s. But every major drug company has new experimental drugs it hopes will work, particularly if they are started early. The questions though, are who should be getting the drugs and who really has Alzheimer\u2019s or is developing it?\n\nEven at the best medical centers, doctors often are wrong. Twenty percent of people with \u2014 a and intellectual functions \u2014 who received a diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s, did not have it. There was no plaque when their brains were biopsied. Half with milder memory loss, thought to be on their way to Alzheimer\u2019s, do not get the disease. And with such a high rate of misdiagnosis, some who are mistakenly told that they have Alzheimer\u2019s are not treated for conditions, like depression or low levels of thyroid hormone or drug side effects and interactions, that are causing their memory problems.\n\nBrain scans that showed plaque could help with some fundamental questions \u2014 who has or is getting Alzheimer\u2019s, whether the disease ever stops or slows down on its own and even whether plaque is the main culprit causing brain cell death.\n\nDr. Skovronsky thought he had a way to make scans work. He and his team had developed a dye that could get into the brain and stick to plaque. They labeled the dye with a commonly used radioactive tracer and used a PET scanner to directly see plaque in a living person\u2019s brain. But the technology and the dye itself were so new they had to be rigorously tested.\n\nAnd that is what brought Dr. Skovronsky, a thin and eager-looking 37-year-old, to his e-mail that recent day.\n\nFive years ago, Dr. Skovronsky, who named his company Avid in part because that is what he is, had taken a big personal and professional gamble. He left academia and formed Avid Radiopharmaceuticals, based in , to develop his radioactive dye and designed a study with patients to prove it worked.\n\nHospice patients were going to die soon and so, he reasoned, why not ask them to have scans and then brain autopsies afterward to see if the scans showed just what a pathologist would see. Some patients would be demented, others not.\n\nSome predicted his study would be impossible, if not unethical. But the F.D.A. said it wanted proof that the plaque on PET scans was the same as plaque in a brain autopsy.\n\nThe Avid study was designed to provide that proof. And the full results, contained in the e-mail message sent that day, May 14, were the moment of truth. When he saw them, Dr. Skovronsky said they were everything he had hoped for.\n\n\u201cThis is about as good as it gets,\u201d he said that day.\n\nHe went into a rotunda that serves as Avid\u2019s lunchroom to tell the company\u2019s 50 employees. \u201cThis is a big day for us,\u201d he continued. \u201cI thought about what I would say, but I have totally forgotten it.\u201d\n\nHis employees applauded. Then they had champagne in blue plastic cups.\n\nThe type of scans used in this study, PET scans, are expensive and patients have to go to a scanning center, get injected with a radioactive dye, wait for the dye to reach their brain and then have a scan.\n\nOther tests are being studied \u2014 ones that look for amyloid in cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the brain; scans that look for shrinkage of the brain in areas needed for memory and reasoning; PET scans that look for uptake of glucose, a cellular fuel, to show areas where the brain was active and where it was not. The tests, though, were not necessarily specific for Alzheimer\u2019s and none had been studied to see if they accurately predicted plaque on autopsy.\n\nEarlier this decade, two scientists at the developed an amyloid dye that while not practical for widespread use, stunned scientists by showing it seemed possible to see amyloid in a living brain.\n\nThe researchers, Chester Mathis and William Klunk, began their work two decades ago, persevering even though they had no research money. In the first 10 years, they tested more than 400 compounds. When they finally found one that seemed promising, they tested more than 300 variations.\n\n\u201cOn and on it went,\u201d Dr. Mathis said.\n\nFinally, in late 2001, they began working with collaborators in to test their dye in humans.\n\nOn 2002, the Swedish researchers injected the first Alzheimer\u2019s patient with the dye, known as Compound B, and scanned the patient\u2019s brain.\n\nIt worked, the Swedish doctors told Dr. Mathis in an excited phone call.\n\nA PET scan showed amyloid exactly where it would be expected. The Swedish doctors were convinced they were seeing actual plaque. They told Dr. Mathis it was time to celebrate.\n\nBut Dr. Mathis worried. What if the same pattern occurred in people without Alzheimer\u2019s?\n\nTwo weeks later, he got another call from Sweden. His colleagues had scanned a person without Alzheimer\u2019s. There was no sign of telltale plaques.\n\nHis sweet reward came in July 2002, when the scans were shown to an audience of 5,000 scientists at an international conference on Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThere was an audible gasp,\u201d Dr. Mathis said. \u201cThe field was taken aback.\u201d\n\nYet there was a problem. Pittsburgh Compound B used carbon 11 as its radioactive tracer. And its half-life is 20 minutes. Researchers have to make it in a cyclotron in the basement of a medical center, quickly attach it to the dye, dash over to a patient lying in a scanner, and inject it.\n\nAnd a critical question remained: Was a PET scan with the Pittsburgh dye really equivalent to a brain autopsy?\n\nMeanwhile, others, including Dr. Skovronsky, had another idea \u2014 use fluorine 18, with a half-life of about two hours. It could be made in the morning, and used that afternoon. And fluorine 18 is made routinely for two million PET scans each year.\n\nDr. Skovronsky, starting at the and then at Avid, worked with a University of Pennsylvania chemist, Hank Kung, for nine years to find and develop the radioactive dye. The university had the patent; Avid licensed it. Finally, on June 8, 2007, a patient at Johns Hopkins had a scan with their compound. Plaque lit up.\n\nMost of the time, the scans were as expected \u2014 those with Alzheimer\u2019s had lots of plaque, those with normal memories had little if any and those with mild memory impairment were in between.\n\nBut about 20 percent of people over 60 with normal memories had plaque.\n\n\u201cThen we looked more carefully,\u201d Dr. Skovronsky said. \u201cThe 20 percent who had amyloid, though they were still statistically in the normal range, did worse on every memory test than the control group.\u201d\n\nWhat, Dr. Skovronsky asked, did that mean? Were they starting to develop Alzheimer\u2019s? If so, could dementia be stalled if there were drugs to stop amyloid from accumulating?\n\nThe definition of Alzheimer\u2019s is plaque plus memory loss and other symptoms of mental decline. But what is not known because no one could follow the development of plaque before a person died, was whether people with plaque and normal memories were developing Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always assumed the pathology has been there, that the plaque has been there years before symptoms,\u201d said Dr. Steven T. DeKosky, an Alzheimer\u2019s researcher who is vice president and dean at the School of Medicine. \u201cBut we never had a way to detect plaque in living persons,\u201d he said. And so plaque in the brains of people with normal memories has been a puzzle.\n\n\u201cOver the next couple of years, we will find out what it means.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 23, 2008, Avid and two other companies, and , that are developing fluorine 18-based dyes for amyloid scans, got a pointed question from an advisory committee to the F.D.A.: How do you know that what you are seeing on scans is the same as the amyloid you see on autopsy?\n\nIt seemed impossible to answer. If researchers wait for their subjects to die before comparing scans with autopsies they can be waiting a long time.\n\nBut Avid had a plan, and the committee agreed in principle that it would work. Hospice patients would be study subjects, some with dementia, some without. All would have memory tests and brain scans. After death, their brains would be autopsied. Avid suggested that after the first 35 died, there should be enough data to know if the scans gave a true picture of the pathology. Then the F.D.A. could decide if the results were convincing enough to approve the dye for marketing.\n\nSome doctors had misgivings, wondering how they could ask people who were sick and dying to be scanned just to help Alzheimer\u2019s research. But, they found, most patients and their families agreed and said they were grateful to have been asked.\n\nThat was evident on May 19, when Dr. Skovronsky gave a lunch for patients\u2019 families in City, Ariz., to thank them for participating.\n\n\u201cIt really touched my heart to be in this,\u201d said Dorothy Wall, whose husband, Claude E. Wall, died of in Sun City on March 3.\n\n\u201cSomething bad happens, and now something good happens.\u201d\n\nLate last year, Avid saw the initial results of its hospice study \u2014 data from the first six patients. Then, as more patients were studied, the data from them were held by a company that would analyze it. Avid did not see the results until the study was completed. But those first six were encouraging.\n\nA man diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s and cancer had a scan showing no plaque. His autopsy did not show it, either. The diagnosis was wrong. Another man with and dementia had been diagnosed as having dementia solely due to Parkinson\u2019s. His scan showed amyloid. So did the autopsy. He had Alzheimer\u2019s. A woman with mild memory loss had a scan showing no amyloid. Her autopsy also found none. Three others had clinical diagnoses of Alzheimer\u2019s, confirmed by scans and autopsies.\n\nFinally, on May 14, 35 patients had been scanned and autopsied. The Avid study was complete, and the full data will be presented at the meeting next month. Other companies, still doing their studies, did not yet have data to examine.\n\nAnd Dr. Skovronsky got that e-mail message.\n\n\u201cThis is going to have a big impact on Alzheimer\u2019s disease, guys,\u201d he told his staff that day.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "As mentioned above, there should have been some attempt here to explain why this scan would be better than a doctor talking with her patient.

But the procedure had never been done in people.\n\nOn Tuesday, Dr. Todd Mainprize, a neurosurgeon at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and the University of Toronto, announced at a news conference that he had successfully breached the blood-brain barrier in a 56-year-old Canadian woman whose brain tumor, diagnosed six years ago, had recently begun to grow.\n\nMainprize performed the two-and-a-half-hour procedure last Thursday, with the patient, Bonny Hall, inside an MRI scanner. Hall felt nothing from the seconds-long bursts from 1,024 ultrasound beams aimed at different points around her skull, and an MRI scan confirmed that the brain barrier was successfully traversed.\n\nThe microscopic bubbles \u2014 roughly the size of red blood cells \u2014 had previously been injected into a vein, along with a chemotherapy drug called liposomal doxorubicin and a tracing molecule.\n\nOn Friday, as scheduled, Hall had brain surgery to remove her tumor. No damage from the ultrasound was visible inside her brain, Mainprize said, and she is recovering well from the surgery.\n\nBecause the trial was designed solely to determine the safety of focused ultrasound to the brain, the patient was not given a therapeutic dose of doxorubicin and the procedure is not expected to help in her recovery, Mainprize said. In the trial at Sunnybrook \u2014 funded by the Virginia-based Focused Ultrasound Foundation \u2014 nine others are slated to receive the same procedure.\n\nSucceeding in getting drugs across the barrier is \u201ca huge achievement\u201d said Dr. Nathan McDannold, a radiologist at Boston\u2019s Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, who has been working to open the barrier with ultrasound since he first accomplished the feat 15 years ago in animals.\n\nBut it\u2019s just one of many. New, safe doses of drugs will need to be determined, once medication is not being diverted by the blood-brain barrier, noted Dr. Gordon Li, a neurosurgeon at Stanford. \u201cIf we feel like we have a safe method of getting drugs in there,\u201d he said, \u201cit will open up a whole new slew of clinical trials.\u201d\n\nMainprize said the patient, a \u201cremarkable woman,\u201d was chosen to go first, because of the status and large size of her tumor, because it was an area of the brain that the ultrasound machinery could easily reach, and because of her willingness to help the research.\n\nIn a prepared video, Hall said she just wants to get back to living her life. \u201cI want to be a normal housewife \u2026 a normal grandma.\u201d", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The article doesn\u2019t discuss other research underway that may be trying to get drugs across the blood brain barrier.

Medicare advisers will meet next Wednesday to discuss the drug, which was developed by Dendreon, a Seattle-based biotechnology company.\n\nProvenge is the first so-called therapeutic cancer vaccine \u2013 meaning it works by training the patient\u2019s immune system to attack the tumor \u2013 to win F.D.A. approval. The treatment is made for each patient from his own blood. Sales have been small so far because Dendreon\u2019s manufacturing capacity has been limited.\n\nWhile Medicare generally pays for drugs that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, its debate over paying for Provenge has raised concerns among some cancer patients, doctors and investors who say the government is sending a warning shot that it will not automatically pay for high-priced medicines.\n\n\u201cNot only is C.M.S.\u2019s action contrary to Congress\u2019s intent to ensure beneficiary access to drugs and biologicals used in an anticancer chemotherapeutic regimen, but it threatens to stifle future innovation and cancer research for years to come,\u2019\u2019 Dr. Al B. Benson III, president of the Association of Community Cancer Centers, said in a comment submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nBut others say the health care system cannot afford to continue paying high prices for all therapies, particularly cancer drugs that extend lives by only a few months.\n\nWith expensive medicines there is already a sort of dual approval system, especially with private insurance companies. First a drug must get F.D.A. approval and then a manufacturer often must go through a lengthy process of persuading insurers to pay for the drug.\n\nMedicare is not supposed to consider price when determining whether to cover a drug, however.\n\nSome analysts have assumed that Medicare will pay for Provenge when used for the patients specified in the drug\u2019s label \u2013 those with advanced prostate cancer that is resistant to hormone-deprivation therapy but who are experiencing no or minimal symptoms.\n\nThe Medicare review might be more designed to limit off-label use of the expensive drug, such as for patients who already have symptoms. The review for Medicare said there was insufficient evidence to judge whether Provenge would work if used off-label.\n\nThe F.D.A. declined to approve Provenge in 2007, setting off protests by patients and Dendreon investors. After Dendreon completed another trial, which reaffirmed a survival advantage for the drug, Provenge was approved this April.\n\nBut the analysis for Medicare said that there were issues in how the trials were designed that made it difficult to assess how effective Provenge really was. One big issue was that the placebo used in the control arm was not really inert.\n\nRobyn Karnauskas, a biotechnology analyst at Deutsche Bank, said in a note to clients Wednesday that the assessment of moderate evidence in support of Provenge boded well for reimbursement. \u201cHistorically, moderate means that CMS will reimburse the product for its on-label indication,\u2019\u2019 she wrote.\n\nDendreon\u2019s shares rose more than 5 percent in trading after the close of the market.\n\nThe assessment was done by a technology evaluation group at the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association under contract to the government\u2019s Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "\n\n\nAlthough the available treatments for men with advanced prostate cancer are limited, there are other approaches that could have been mentioned.

The World Health Organization (WHO) lists reducing salt intake among its top 10 \u201cbest buys\u201d for reducing rates of chronic disease.\n\nIn Britain, the National Institute of Health and Clinical Guidance (NICE) has called for an acceleration of the reduction in salt in the general population from a maximum intake of 6 grams(g) a day for adults by 2015 to 3 g by 2025.\n\nU.S. guidelines recommend Americans consume less than 2.3 g of salt daily, or 1.5 g for certain people who are more at risk for high blood pressure or heart disease.\n\nWhile previous trials have found there is a blood pressure benefit from cutting salt, research has yet to show if that translates into better overall heart health in the wider population. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases \u2014 the leading causes of death worldwide.\n\nTaylor said he thought it did not find any evidence of big benefits because the numbers of people studied and the salt intake reductions were relatively small.\n\n\u201cThe people in the trials we analyzed only reduced their salt intake by a moderate amount, so the effect on blood pressure and heart disease was not large,\u201d he said.\n\nFor this review, Taylor\u2019s team found seven studies that together included 6,489 participants. This gave the researchers enough data to be able to start drawing conclusions, they said. But even so, the scientists think they would need to have data from at least 18,000 people before they could expect to identify any clear health benefits.\n\nElaine Rush, a professor of nutrition at Auckland University of Technology in Australia, said that putting a spotlight on single trials and generalizing dietary advice for a single nutrient such as salt was \u201cnot helpful.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is helpful is for the food industry to reformulate products to reduce sodium and increase the nutrient quality of foods by using real ingredients,\u201d she said in an emailed comment.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "There was no mention in this story about what is known about other means of reducing the risk of developing or dying of heart disease. \u00a0A brief mention \u2013 even one additional sentence \u2013 about the importance of smoking cessation, exercise, and other dietary changes would have provided perspective.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Consuming walnuts and select other whole foods as part of a healthy diet may be associated with a reduced risk of physical function impairments throughout the aging process in women\n\nFolsom, Calif., (June 22, 2016) - A new study published in the Journal of Nutrition suggests that consuming 1-2 servings of walnuts per week (1/4 cup per serving) was associated with reduced risk of developing impairments in physical function, which helps enable older women to maintain independence throughout the aging process. (1)\n\nThis paper emphasized that overall diet quality, rather than individual foods, may have a greater impact on reducing risk of physical function impairments. Specifically, diet quality traits most associated with reduced rates of incident physical impairment were higher intake of fruits and vegetables; lower intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, trans fat, and sodium; and moderate alcohol intake. Among food components, the strongest relations were found for increased intakes of oranges, orange juice, apples, pears, romaine or leaf lettuce, and walnuts.\n\n\"There's a lot of research that looks at specific health conditions in aging, such as diabetes and heart disease, but less attention to research on quality of life and ability to maintain independence with aging,\" said Dr. Francine Grodstein, ScD, professor of medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. \"The simple message from this study is that eating an overall healthy diet, including certain foods, such as walnuts and other whole foods, may help women with the ability to do key everyday tasks as they age, like carrying groceries or dressing themselves.\"\n\nThe researchers looked at data from 54,762 women in the Nurses' Health Study, which tracked women for over 30 years. Between 1992 and 2008, the women were asked questions about their physical function, including their ability to perform basic activities of daily living. This new paper prospectively examined the association between the dietary habits of the participants and subsequent impairment in physical function. Diet was assessed using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI-2010), a measure of diet quality that incorporates foods and nutrients predictive of chronic disease risk based on scientific evidence.\n\n\"These results add to the large body of evidence that outline the many benefits of a healthy diet for women. Additional research is needed to better understand how diet and lifestyle choices can help maintain our health and well-being as we age,\" said Dr. Grodstein.\n\nThere are numerous possible active properties in walnuts that may be contributing factors in providing health benefits. Walnuts are unique among nuts in that they are primarily composed of polyunsaturated fat (13 grams per ounce), which includes alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), the plant-based omega-3 fatty acid. They are the only nut to contain a significant amount of ALA with 2.5 grams per one ounce serving.\n\nSome study limitations should be considered. The sample only included women, so these results may not be generalizable to men. Additionally, participants were not assigned to eat walnuts or other foods, and were just asked about their dietary choices. It is also possible that subjects may have misreported their dietary intake since this information was collected by questionnaires. In addition, because this is an observational study, residual confounding cannot be ruled out (i.e. that other lifestyle habits which are more common in adults who eat walnuts could contribute to the study findings); and, thus, the results should be interpreted with caution.\n\nThis research was supported in part by the California Walnut Commission (CWC). The CWC has supported health-related research on walnuts for more than 25 years. While the CWC does provide funds and/or walnuts for various projects, the actual studies are conducted independently by researchers who design the experiments, interpret the results and write the manuscripts.\n\nThe California Walnut Commission, established in 1987, is funded by mandatory assessments of the growers.

The team used this opportunity to see how stimulating the brain affects memory.\n\nThey focused on an area of the brain called the entorhinal cortex, which helps form and store memories.\n\n\u201cThe entorhinal cortex is the golden gate to the brain\u2019s memory mainframe,\u201d Dr. Itzhak Fried, professor of neurosurgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, who worked on the study, said in a telephone interview. The research was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nFried said sensory experiences that eventually become memories pass through this hub before they are stored in the hippocampus, the brain\u2019s chief memory center.\n\nFor the study, patients played a video game in which they had to shuttle people around in taxis to different shops in a virtual city. The team tested whether stimulating the entorhinal cortex or the hippocampus while they were learning their way around the city improved their recall.\n\n\u201cWhen we stimulated the hippocampus itself, there was not an effect. It was really stimulation in the gateway to the hippocampus - the entorhinal cortex - where we got the beneficial effect in terms of memory,\u201d Fried said.\n\nCompared to testing before stimulation, zapping this part of the brain helped people recognize landmarks and navigate the virtual city more quickly. Fried said the findings suggest stimulating the brain just as memories are forming is key.\n\nIn Alzheimer\u2019s disease, this area of the brain is affected early on, when signs of dementia begin to appear.\n\nFried said the study might have implications for treatments for patients with early Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but he cautioned that the results are very preliminary.\n\n\u201cThe question would be whether this can help memory in patients with memory impairments,\u201d he said.

In a study published in the Annals of Neurology in 2010 researchers tested deep brain stimulation in six patients over the course of a year and found the treatment to be relatively safe. They also saw signs the treatment might have an effect on memory.\n\nDr. Sandra Black, a brain researcher at the University of Toronto who wrote an editorial on the current study, said the findings could have implications for early stage Alzheimer\u2019s disease if tests were developed to identify this process early through imaging or genomics.\n\n\u201cAlthough the current evidence is preliminary, is based on small samples and requires replication, the potential application of deep-brain stimulation in amnestic disorders is enticing,\u201d Black wrote.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "This story offers a bit more information about existing treatments than the other story we reviewed, but all it says is that available drugs cannot prevent Alzheimer\u2019s disease from progressing.

Based on 2010 U.S. Census data, a study estimated the prevalence of osteoporosis among women 50 to 69 years of age at 3.4 million. It has been estimated that the lifetime risk of osteoporotic fracture for a 60-year-old woman is 44 percent. Additional therapies are needed for prevention of osteoporotic fractures. As a result of its mechanism of action, it has been hypothesized that the drug abaloparatide, a synthetic peptide, would have a more pronounced anabolic (i.e., bone growing) action on bone compared with the osteoporosis drug teriparatide.\n\nPaul D. Miller, M.D., of the Colorado Center for Bone Research, Lakewood, Colo., and colleagues randomly assigned postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to receive daily injections for 18 months of placebo (n = 821); abaloparatide (n = 824); or teriparatide (n = 818). The trial was conducted at 28 sites in 10 countries.\n\nAmong 2,463 women (average age, 69 years), 1,901 completed the study. New vertebral fractures occurred less frequently in the active treatment groups vs placebo: in 0.58 percent (n = 4) of participants in the abaloparatide group; in 0.84 percent (n = 6) of participants in the teriparatide group; and in 4.22 percent (n = 30) of those in the placebo group. The estimated event rate for nonvertebral fracture was lower with abaloparatide vs placebo: 2.7 percent in the abaloparatide group; 3.3 percent in the teriparatide group; and 4.7 percent in the placebo group.\n\nBone mineral density (BMD) increases were greater with abaloparatide than placebo. Incidence of hypercalcemia (the presence of abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood) was lower with abaloparatide (3.4 percent) vs teriparatide (6.4 percent). Overall, there were no differences in serious adverse events between the treatment groups.\n\n\u201cFurther research is needed to understand the clinical importance of risk difference, the risks and benefits of abaloparatide treatment, and the efficacy of abaloparatide vs other osteoporosis treatments,\u201d the authors write.\n\n: This study was funded by Radius Health.

Use our submission form or ask @juliaoftoronto on Twitter.\n\nIs running really a better form of exercise than walking, given that running can lead to more injuries?\n\nAt Vox, I sit near health reporter Sarah Kliff, who trains for half-marathons and triathlons with a casualness most people reserve for grocery shopping. But Sarah\u2019s also suffered with plantar fasciitis and a stress fracture. At times, she's hobbled around in running shoes for months because everything else hurt too much, and even sported a big blue brace on her left leg to help cushion the tiny cracks in the bones of her foot brought on from too much wear and tear.\n\nIn many ways, Sarah is a perfect case study in how to think about the benefits and risks of running versus walking. Running has greater health benefits than walking (Sarah is super fit), but it also carries a much bigger risk of injury (see Sarah\u2019s foot brace).\n\n\n\nSo which effect dominates? To find out, I first searched for \"randomized control trials\" and \"systematic reviews\" on running, walking, and exercise at PubMed health (a free search engine for health research) and in Google Scholar. I wanted to see what the highest-quality evidence \u2014 trials and reviews are the gold standard \u2014 said about the relative risks and benefits of these two forms of exercise.\n\nIt was immediately apparent that running can lead to more injuries, and the risk goes up as running programs get more intense. Studies have found that runners have significantly higher injury rates than walkers (one study found that young men who run or jog had a 25 percent higher risk of injuries than walkers), and that ultramarathoners are at an even greater risk. The main running-related injuries include tibia stress syndrome, Achilles tendon injuries, and plantar fasciitis.\n\nOverall, more than half of people who run will experience some sort of injury from doing so, while the percentage of walkers who will get hurt is around 1 percent. Interestingly, it seems you can walk pretty much endlessly without any increased risk of hurting yourself.\n\nThat running hurts people shouldn't be surprising. As this study described, \"Running produces ground reaction forces that are approximately 2.5 times body weight, while the ground reaction force during walking is in the range of 1.2 times body weight.\" You're also more likely to trip and fall while running than you are during a walk.\n\nJogging even 5 to 10 minutes per day can reduce the risk of death from all causes I also learned about some of the incredible health benefits of going fast: Even five to 10 minutes per day of jogging at around 6 miles per hour can reduce the risk of death from cardiovascular disease and other causes. Joggers have been found to live longer than non-joggers even after adjusting for other factors \u2014 a difference of 3.8 years for men and 4.7 years for women.\n\nThat said, research has found that walking carries significant health benefits, as well. Some studies suggest that you can extend your life and stave off disease by simply walking \u2014 and the more, the better.\n\nAll this research, while illuminating, didn\u2019t offer up any clear conclusions on whether running or walking was better for you overall. So I asked some of the world\u2019s leading researchers in this area. Their conclusion? You need to consider the trade-offs.\n\n\"Running moderately prolongs life more than walking does,\" said Peter Schnohr, a clinical cardiologist who has researched many aspects of exercise and health. The key word there is \"moderately.\" Schnohr warned of the emerging research that doing a lot of endurance exercise over the long term (like triathlon training) can lead to heart problems. Overall, there's a U-shaped association between running and mortality, he said. Too little isn't helpful for health, but too much might be harmful.\n\n\n\n \"The most favorable regimen is two to three running days per week, at a slow or average pace\"\n\n\"The most favorable [regimen] is two to three running days per week, at a slow or average pace,\" Schnohr advised. \"Running every day, at a fast speed, more than 4 hours per week is not as favorable.\" And for those who don't like running, he noted, \"Fast walking, not slow, also prolongs life. I can\u2019t tell how much.\"\n\nDutch researcher Luiz Carlos Hespanhol pointed out that in general, running simply delivers health benefits more efficiently than walking does. This study, for example, found that five minutes of running per day is as beneficial as 15 minutes of walking. Hespanhol also said that after one year of training just two hours a week, runners lose weight, reduce their body fat, lower their resting heart rates, and drive down their blood serum triglycerides (fat in the blood). There's even evidence that running can have positive effects on tension, depression, and anger.\n\nEven so, Hespanhol wasn't a total cheerleader for running. A good walking regimen can have similar benefits, he noted. So on running versus walking, it really depends on your values and preferences: \"One could choose walking instead of running as a mode of physical activity based on injury risks, since walking is less risky than running,\" he explained. Or alternatively: \"One could choose running because the health benefits are larger and come faster, in a shorter period of time.\"\n\nTo recap: Running improves your health more efficiently than walking does and has greater health benefits per time invested. But even a small amount of running carries more injury risk than walking. And a lot of running (i.e., ultramarathon training) can well be harmful, while the same is never true for walking.\n\nWhere does this leave us? All the exercise researchers seemed to agree on one thing: that the best exercise routine is the one you'll actually do. So the answer to the running versus walking question will probably vary from person to person. If you prefer one over the other, stick with that. And if you still can't decide, Hespanhol suggested this: \"Why not do both \u2014 running and walking \u2014 in order to get the best of each?\"\n\nSend your questions to Julia via the submission form or @juliaoftoronto on Twitter.

When patients are in an abnormal irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation, blood clots can form in the LAA, which can then circulate out through the bloodstream and cause stroke. Once the device is in place in the opening of the LAA, a thin layer of tissue grows over it, preventing blood clots from forming in the LAA and therefore preventing stroke.\n\nIt has been suggested that as treatment for atrial fibrillation, the Watchman device may be preferable to standard blood thinning medications, such as warfarin, which raise the risk of bleeding. To assess the cost-effectiveness of the device versus medication, the researchers developed a statistical model based on data from two key research trials, known as PROTECT AF and PREVAIL.\n\nThe researchers found that while results from the trials varied, the device did appear to be more cost-effective in the larger, longer-term trial. \"What we know is that the PROTECT AF trial enrolled more patients and has longer follow-up at this time and this allows greater statistical certainty,\" said Dr. James Freeman, assistant professor of cardiology and first author on the paper. \"Based on that, the study may provide more certainty in terms of cost-effectiveness.\" However, longer-term results are needed to be completely certain of the device's value in clinical practice, he said.\n\nThe study published online May 16 in Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology.", "question": "Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The news release does mention that the implantable device is intended to replace medication.\nIt goes further, stating that \u201cIt has been suggested that as treatment for atrial fibrillation, the Watchman device may be preferable to standard blood thinning medications, such as warfarin, which raise the risk of bleeding.\u201d\nHowever, the release does not cite data to support that suggestion, so it is impossible to make a meaningful comparison.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "The pocket-watch-sized device is billed as \"a pacemaker for the brain,\" the newest cutting-edge treatment for as many as 4 million adults whose severe depression is not relieved by psychotherapy, drugs or even shock treatments.\n\nSince its approval under unusual circumstances eight months ago by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), more than 550 Americans have undergone surgery to have a vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) implanted in their chests to activate parts of their brains. Another 7,000 people -- aided by a network of nurses hired by Cyberonics, the Houston-based manufacturer of the device -- are seeking approval from their insurance companies for the $25,000 operation.\n\nMore than 3,700 psychiatrists, including doctors affiliated with Suburban, Georgetown, Sheppard Pratt and Howard University hospitals, have been trained in the use of VNS, the first device ever approved to treat depression. It consists of a battery-operated generator attached to an electrode implanted in the vagus nerve in the neck. The generator emits regular pulses of electricity that are supposed to stimulate serotonin and other brain chemicals believed to regulate mood, according to Cyberonics.\n\nYet despite the imprimatur of the FDA and an aggressive marketing campaign mounted by the company, the most basic question about the treatment remains unanswered: Does it work? Is VNS a lifesaving treatment for chronic depression, as some patients and doctors maintain, or an unproven and potentially harmful treatment based on flimsy science, as critics contend?\n\nAt the heart of the debate is this: The only rigorous clinical trial of the device -- which is approved to treat severe epilepsy -- failed to demonstrate effectiveness in alleviating depression. That study involved 235 patients, all of whom received the device, which was turned on in only half the group. At the end of three months, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups.\n\nA second study of 174 VNS recipients found that 30 percent showed significant improvement after one year. Because that study lacked a control group and because patients received other depression treatments after the device was implanted, there is no way to know whether the device was responsible. For years experts have known that depression -- unlike, say, type 1 diabetes -- can get better without treatment.\n\nLast July, a top FDA official, citing the lack of alternatives for severely depressed patients, overruled unanimous opposition by 20 members of his staff and approved the device as a depression treatment for adults who had failed four other treatments.\n\nFDA spokesman Stephen King said that VNS met federal standards for medical devices, which are less stringent than those governing drugs, and might help adults who had exhausted other options and were at a high risk of suicide. Cyberonics officials testified that 30,000 people commit suicide annually, most of whom were diagnosed with severe depression. The same rationale had led an FDA advisory panel in 2004 to approve the device by a 5-2 vote.\n\nTo Philadelphia psychiatrist Richard P. Malone, a member of the panel who voted against approval, such arguments are specious.\n\n\"Pancreatic cancer is a hopeless condition\" with a much higher death rate than chronic depression, said Malone, a professor of psychiatry at Drexel University. \"And we have as much evidence that this works for pancreatic cancer as it does for depression. Why not use it for that?\"\n\nSome patients with chronic depression say they were willing to try anything that promised relief. Graphic artist Colleen Kelly decided in 2000 that she had nothing to lose by enrolling in an experimental study of VNS. Now 42, Kelly, who lives in Prince George's County, said dozens of medications had not helped her for long or had caused severe reactions. Nearly three dozen electroshock treatments failed to work and wiped out years of memories, she said.\n\nVNS gave Kelly three \"very good years,\" she said, and then her depression returned. \"The past year has been abysmal,\" said Kelly, who urged the FDA advisory panel to approve the device. \"I still keep hoping it's going to help me in some way.\"\n\nBut critics say they are not persuaded by Cyberonics's theory of how VNS works. The company's Web site says that \"preliminary imaging studies suggest that VNS Therapy affects many areas of the brain implicated in mood regulation.\"\n\nBut Malone called the theory \"all speculative.\"\n\n\"This almost has a feel of 18th-century psychiatry -- having a device and not being able to show how it works,\" he said.\n\nWashington psychiatrist Wayne Blackmon agreed. \"Psychiatry has been burned again and again by overextravagant claims\" about devices and psychosurgery, said Blackmon, a lawyer and a past president of the D.C. Medical Society. \"The history of psychiatry is plagued by psychiatrists jumping the gun because these poor people are suffering and the argument is we have to do something.\"\n\nThe device has also attracted attention on Capitol Hill, where the Senate Finance Committee has spent two years looking into decision-making at the FDA.\n\nLast month committee chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), whose panel issued a report highly critical of the agency's approval of VNS, said he was concerned that patients and their doctors were not being adequately informed about the risks of VNS, which include cardiovascular problems that can be life-threatening.\n\nGrassley questioned whether Medicare and Medicaid should pay for the device, which costs $15,000 and must be replaced every five years or so when the battery runs low. So far neither the federal government nor private insurers have agreed to cover VNS for depression on a routine basis, although many have approved individual cases.\n\nLast week, BlueCross BlueShield of Alabama announced it would pay for VNS treatment in chronically depressed patients who had failed four previous treatments.\n\nTwo recent technology assessments by major insurance companies have concluded there is insufficient evidence to find that VNS works for depression. A report by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, an influential mental health insurer in Boston, called it \"experimental, investigational and unproven.\"\n\nRobert \"Skip\" Cummins, Cyberonics's CEO, dismissed such criticism and said his company, whose sole product is VNS, faced similar skepticism after the device was approved for epilepsy in 1997.\n\nHe noted that VNS is now accepted by insurers as a treatment for intractable seizures, which can be fatal if they are not controlled. About 35,000 epilepsy patients have received the implant.\n\nMany FDA \"regulators, politicians and third-party payers\" know little about resistant depression, Cummins said. \"Hundreds of psychiatric thought leaders and patients are rallying around the device\" for \"the worst of the worst\" cases of depression, he said.\n\n\"There is nothing out there as safe and effective,\" Cummins said, adding that a company-financed study showed that the effectiveness of VNS improved over time. He added that he has a personal interest in intractable depression because his mother and grandfather committed suicide.\n\nNew York psychiatrist T. Byram Karasu, chairman of the task force that writes the section on depression for psychiatry's diagnostic and statistical manual, said that even though the effectiveness of VNS is uncertain, it appeals to patients and their psychiatrists.\n\nIn its marketing campaign, Cyberonics notes that VNS treatment does not cause the weight gain associated with antidepressants and the confusion and memory loss common after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), psychiatry's term for shock treatments.\n\n\"VNS has a quality of cardiac surgery to it, a certain cachet,\" and it lacks the stigma of shock treatments, said Karasu, adding that six of his patients adamantly refused ECT and opted instead for VNS. \"No one would know you didn't get a defibrillator.\"\n\nFor Paulo Negro's patients, the issue is not stigma, but options. Negro, chief of behavioral health services at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, said his VNS patients have tried everything, but their depression always recurred.\n\n\"What would you do if you've not been getting better for years?\" asked Negro. \"It's a chance to get better. I'd take it.\"\n\nThat's what Charles E. Donovan III did. The St. Louis resident credits the implant he received five years ago with saving his life. At the time, the Georgetown University graduate said he was so depressed he told his doctor he hoped to die on the operating table.\n\nBut in the weeks after surgery, Donovan said, he started to feel better. Although he takes antidepressants, Donovan said, he is sure drugs are not responsible, because they hadn't helped him previously.\n\nDonovan, who is featured on the Cyberonics Web site, said he has no financial relationship with the company. He recently self-published a book about his experiences, entitled \"Out of the Black Hole,\" and runs a pro-VNS Web site for patients. \"I am so humbled by this treatment and grateful,\" he said.\n\nOthers have had far less positive experiences. Among them is Katherine V. Coram, 58, of Silver Spring who got the implant in the same study as Donovan. Coram said she knew she was in the group with the activated device because she could feel it going off, she said. She frequently lost her voice while she was talking and felt a persistent constriction in the back of her throat. Both are common side effects of VNS treatment.\n\nCoram said the device seemed to help a bit at first, but when the doctor turned up the settings, she felt suicidal for the first time in years. Worsening depression and suicide attempts were reported by one-third of patients in one study funded by Cyberonics, according to data presented to the FDA.\n\nLast year Coram said she had the generator removed from her chest because it wasn't helping. The electrodes in her neck must remain forever; doctors tell VNS patients that removing them is too risky because tissue grows around them As a result, VNS recipients cannot undergo a full body MRI or therapeutic ultrasound.\n\n\"I'm still angry about the whole thing,\" said Coram, who said she regrets getting the implant and currently relies on the standby treatments: psychotherapy and antidepressants.\n\n\"You get desperate when you've been depressed for years,\" she said. \"This sounds benign, like a pacemaker. My crusade is for people to know a lot more about it before they sign up.\" \u00b7", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "There is mention of psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy and antidepressants but few details are given about these options. ", "answer": 1}, {"article": "(Health.com) -- The makers of POM Wonderful pomegranate juice say that the drink improves blood flow and heart health, prevents and treats prostate cancer, and works 40 percent as well as Viagra (whatever that means). All for about four bucks a bottle.\n\nThose impressive claims helped the company rack up $91 million in sales in 2009. They also earned the disapproval of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Last month, the agency sued POM Wonderful for making \"false and unsubstantiated\" health claims, and is asking the company to remove the claims from its ads.\n\nA 100 percent juice drink that contains antioxidants (and no added sugar), POM is just one of many beverages that bill themselves as promoting better health. VitaminWater, kombucha tea, coconut water, and various brands of juice drinks made from acai, goji berry, and mangosteen have all used health claims in their marketing -- and some, like POM, have been the subject of scrutiny and legal action.\n\nThe FTC, along with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has been cracking down on food and beverage makers for allegedly overselling the health benefits of their products. In 2009 alone, the FDA warned 17 companies that they were providing misleading nutritional information on their packaging or making overly specific health claims.\n\nHealth.com: 25 diet-busting foods you should never eat\n\nNot all of the products were drinks, but \"the beverage category stands out,\" says Bruce Silverglade, director of legal affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. \"At first blush it seems that beverage products are certainly a large proportion of food products that make bogus health-related claims.\"\n\nDrinks such as POM have become increasingly popular with consumers in recent years, thanks in part to public health campaigns against soda that have been prompted by the obesity epidemic. \"The trend is away from traditional soda pop [toward] products claiming to provide magical health benefits,\" Silverglade says.\n\nAre the health claims true? Yes and no. The federal government doesn't require companies to vet health claims with the agency before plastering them on product packaging (as long as the claims are accompanied by a disclaimer about their uncertainty). But that doesn't mean the claims are invented -- most are based in research.\n\nThe research is often funded by the manufacturers, however, and industry-funded research can be prone to bias. A 2007 study found that research on health drinks that was funded entirely by beverage companies was between four and eight times more likely to find a favorable result than research with no industry support.\n\n\"If a cell phone company told you they tested all the models and their model came out the best, would you believe it? Probably not,\" says Dr. Lenard Lesser, M.D., one of the co-authors of that study and a researcher at UCLA. \"The same is true with nutrition research, but the stakes are higher because we're putting our bodies at risk.\"\n\nWhere's the line between research and marketing?\n\nHowever far-fetched the claims may sound, POM is standing behind them. (Two weeks before the FTC publicly announced its lawsuit, POM preemptively sued the FTC, claiming that preapproval of ads featuring health claims violates the company's right to free speech.)\n\nBut are shoppers really convinced that POM can unclog their arteries, cure cancer, and lead to hotter sex?\n\nThere seem to be more than a few believers out there. \"\n\nI started drinking POM after reading the studies two years ago, my triglycerides were almost 1000!,\" one of POM Wonderful's 12,000 fans breathlessly posted on Facebook after the FTC announced its lawsuit. \"Working out everyday, drinking POM, and eating healthy, they are now less than 400. Forget what the Feds say! I believe!!!\" (A triglycerides level of 400 is still nearly three times higher than what's considered normal.)\n\nMost health beverage drinkers aren't as enthusiastic as the realtor from Alaska who posted the above testimonial. Quinton Ma, a 22-year-old marketing coordinator at Gawker Media, in New York City, started to drink VitaminWater as a middle schooler because it seemed like a healthy alternative to soda.\n\n\"I figured that if they were selling something that I could get extra vitamins from, it couldn't hurt to drink,\" Ma says. \"Once I learned they were really just cleverly marketed sugar waters, I stopped.\"\n\nHealth.com: You are what you drink\n\nBut the fact is, even when people don't buy the health claims they often still buy the beverage. That's the paradox of products such as POM, Silverglade says: The health claims on these products strain the imagination, yet studies have repeatedly shown that health claims sell food.\n\nThat's because these claims -- however improbable they may seem -- distract shoppers from the real nutritional information and hook consumers with buzzwords like \"antioxidant.\"\n\nThis phenomenon is known as a \"health halo,\" an aura of healthfulness attached to a product based on labels like \"low-fat\" \"all-natural\" or \"made with whole grains\" that seduces consumers into overeating. According to a study by the FTC, this halo effect can even lead people to overlook warning statements -- about the high sodium content of a product, for example.\n\n\"A healthy halo develops around products like these,\" says Frances Largeman-Roth, R.D., Health magazine's senior food and nutrition editor. \"The health-conscious consumer incorporates them into their lifestyle, thinking that they're doing a world of good for themselves.\"\n\nThe makers of POM Wonderful have spent $34 million on scientific research on POM products and pomegranates. According to the FTC's complaint, the studies POM has funded do not substantiate the company's claims, and a closer look at the research seems to bear that out.\n\nOne of the most prominent claims, that POM can decrease arterial plaque by 30 percent, was taken from a single pilot study that included just 19 people and was funded by the makers of POM. Another claim, that POM drinkers experience a 17 percent improvement in blood flow, was taken from another POM-funded study that included just 45 people and only lasted for three months.\n\n\"These days it's possible for a food company to pay just about anybody to conduct a study,\" says Silverglade.\n\nMichael Aviram, Ds.C., a cholesterol researcher at Rambam Medical Center, in Haifa, Israel, defended his studies on pomegranates -- many of them funded by POM -- by noting that they were published in \"very prestigious peer reviewed journals,\" including the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition and Atherosclerosis. Dr. Harley Liker, M.D., a physician at UCLA Medical Center who has also led research funded by POM, directed all inquiries to a POM spokesman.\n\n\"A grocery store is a designed marketing environment to get people to buy things,\" says Lesser. \"Lots of products are going to try to use health claims from research, often from their own industry, [just] to sell a product.\"\n\nHealth.com: 14 health products you probably don't need\n\nIffy health claims don't mean that products like pomegranate juice should be avoided at all costs, says Keri Gans, R.D., a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association. As long as consumers limit themselves to 8-ounce servings and products with no added sugar, juice can be an excellent source of vitamins and other nutrients, Gans says. But it's \"not going to solve any of your health issues,\" she adds.\n\nThe bottom line is that consumers shouldn't believe everything they read on labels. \"If they focus on consuming an overall well-balanced diet, they might not need to focus so much on finding a product that makes false promises,\" Gans says.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The\u00a0purported health benefits of POM and other\u00a0health drinks are based on their supposedly high content of antioxidant compounds.\u00a0People can obtain similarly high levels of antioxidants, at much lower cost,\u00a0just by eating a healthy diet with lots of regular fruits and vegetables, which are also rich in antioxidants.

They\u2019re part of a huge \u2014 and wildly popular \u2014 supplement industry which goes largely unregulated. Supplement makers aren\u2019t allowed to claim that their products can cure or treat a particular condition, but they are allowed to make sweeping claims that the products promote health.\n\nThe infusion treatments can be traced back to an intravenous supplement known as the Myers\u2019 cocktail, a slurry of magnesium, calcium, B vitamins, and other products developed decades ago by a Baltimore physician. There is a published review on the use of Myers\u2019 cocktail \u2014 but it\u2019s just a collection of anecdotal evidence. The author, Dr. Alan Gaby, has long promoted the use of intravenous vitamins for a wide range of clinical conditions.\n\nThe research on injectable vitamins of any kind is thin and the results unimpressive. One study looked at injectable vitamins to treat asthma, but there was no placebo group to compare outcomes against. Two studies have examined intravenous vitamin use in fibromyalgia patients. One didn\u2019t turn up any significant improvement in patients who received the infusions.

Forty percent have heart disease, and half will die from it. In recent years, surgical techniques, anesthesia and other medical care advanced, and death rates fell.

They found that the two groups had widespread differences in terms of brain connectivity.\n\nEEG revealed that the children with autism had a reduced short range connectivity, indicating poor function of local brain networks. This was especially true in the left hemisphere regions of the brain responsible for language.\n\nThe children with autism also had increased connectivity between brain regions that were farther apart, which might be a mechanism developed to compensate for reduced short range connectivity, the researchers said.\n\nThe research was conducted at Boston Children's Hospital and was published online June 25 in the journal BMC Medicine.\n\nThe use of EEG-based testing may help diagnose autism in children and may improve early detection in infants, leading to more effective treatments and coping strategies, the researchers said.\n\n\"What was unique about this study is the very large number of children studied,\" Dawson noted. \"Consistent with many previous studies using EEG and functional MRI with both children and adults with autism, these investigators found that, overall, children with autism show reduced coordination (coherence) across brain regions.\"\n\nShe said the findings are important because, \"they help us understand why individuals with autism have difficulty with complex behaviors, such as social interaction and language. As children's brains develop, the different brain regions become increasingly connected, allowing for the acquisition of complex behaviors that require coordination across different brain regions.\"\n\nLanguage, for example, requires coordination across the auditory, visual, and motor brain regions, as well as the participation of the prefrontal cortex, she said.\n\n\"This reduced functional connectivity in the brain helps us understand impairments associated with autism,\" she added. \"The hope is that early behavioral intervention can help mitigate these functional impairments, helping to form the connections that natural develop in typical children.\"\n\n\"Although autism is still principally a clinical diagnosis, this study ... may allow for a new approach to classifying children with autism and may even assist in the early identification of affected children at a younger age,\" said Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven & Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York in New Hyde Park, NY.\n\nThe number of children diagnosed with autism in the United States has recently increased to one in 88.\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more about autism.", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story does mention that autism is a clinical diagnosis (and though this research study was not about diagnosis, it deals with better understanding the brain activity behind the behaviors which lead to the diagnosis).

That was the conclusion of a new study published today in the journal Molecular Therapy Oncolytics by scientists from The Gene Editing Institute of the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute at Christiana Care Health System.\n\nThe study reports that in both tissue culture and in a mouse, tumor growth stopped and there was a dramatic decrease in the volume of existing tumors when chemotherapy was combined with CRIPSP-Cas9, which was used to disable a tumor gene known as NRF2. Previous studies have shown that the NRF2 gene controls cell functions in lung cancer tumors that helps them thwart the effect of chemotherapies that might otherwise reduce or eliminate them entirely.\n\n\"Our goal is to see if CRISPR can be used with chemotherapy to provide a safe, affordable way to give patients who are not responding to treatment at least a fighting chance against this very challenging cancer,\" said Eric Kmiec, Ph.D., the principal author of the study and the director of the Gene Editing Institute. \"We believe that finding ways to use CRISPR to improve existing treatments will lead to some of the first benefits for patients while we tackle the vital ethical issues around the use of CRISPR for edits that can be passed on through DNA. This is an exciting step in the journey of exploring the health benefits of gene editing.\"\n\nThe study was led by Pawel Bialk, research scientist at the Gene Editing Institute, the nation's only CRISPR-focused research initiative situated in a community health care system.\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Dr. Kmiec said there are chemotherapies that have helped patients achieve remission or at least live longer and enjoy a better quality of life by significantly slowing the progress of the disease. But he said some patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, the most common form of lung cancer, are resistant to chemotherapy agents used to treat the disease or develop resistance after being exposed to the drugs.\n\nDr. Kmiec said the lung cancer work reflects an approach adopted by the Gene Editing Institute to move cautiously in developing medical applications of gene editing. Based inside the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute at Christiana Care, his research team gains unique insight into the lives and needs of cancer patients and the health care professionals who care for them, which helps them to maintain a strong focus on doing what's right for patients.\n\nDr. Kmiec noted that while his team is working to move into human trials, the CRISPR application being developed for lung cancer does not involve directly editing a patient's genome --only the genes in the tumor.\n\nCRISPR stands for \"clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats.\" It was originally a defense mechanism found in bacteria that allows the bacteria to recognize and slice up the DNA of invading viruses. Scientists have learned how to manipulate this mechanism so that it essentially can be programmed to find and remove a specific sequence of DNA code--which acts like software for controlling biological activity in a cell. Cas9 is a reference to an enzyme, sometimes described as a form of \"molecular scissors,\" that is used by CRISPR to cut out a section of DNA code.\n\nDr. Kmiec said there are many efforts under way to modify CRISPR so that it can be used to not only remove or \"knock out\" a section DNA, but also to replace or \"knock in\" a new strand of code. But he said there continues to be significant safety concerns around this type of CRISPR application. He said for now, his team is focused on \"using CRISPR in its native form, which is to just cut out a section of DNA,\" and to start with applications that do not directly impact the patient's DNA. He said using CRISPR to do things like improving drug response represents the \"low-hanging fruit\" of CRISPR patient applications.\n\n\"We think it's best to start with CRISPR therapies that involve relatively conservative uses of this powerful tool,\" Dr. Kmiec said. \"This approach can also hopefully help contain costs and provide a level of safety and reliability that is reassuring for patients and increases the chance that insurance companies will provide coverage.\"\n\nDr. Kmiec said that as a CRISPR research program that treats patients from across the economic spectrum, his scientists are keenly aware of the challenges of making cutting edge medical treatments accessible and beneficial for all patients.\n\n\"This work is another significant step on the pathway to FDA approval,\" said Nicholas J. Petrelli, M.D., FACS, Bank of America endowed medical director of the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute. \"The Gene Editing Institute is taking a careful and methodical approach to developing innovative therapies. Dr. Kmiec and his team interact with our oncologists who deal with lung cancer every day on how gene editing could have a realistic impact and improve treatment.

The new findings show that black tea polyphenols, which are too large to be absorbed in the small intestine, stimulate the growth of gut bacterium and the formation of short-chain fatty acids, a type of bacterial metabolites that has been shown to alter the energy metabolism in the liver.\n\n\"It was known that green tea polyphenols are more effective and offer more health benefits than black tea polyphenols since green tea chemicals are absorbed into the blood and tissue,\" said Susanne Henning, the study's lead author and an adjunct professor at the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition, which is part of the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. \"Our new findings suggest that black tea, through a specific mechanism through the gut microbiome, may also contribute to good health and weight loss in humans.\"\n\n\"The results suggest that both green and black teas are prebiotics, substances that induce the growth of good microorganisms that contribute to a person's well-being,\" she said.\n\nIn the study, four groups of mice received different diets -- two of which were supplemented with green tea or black tea extracts:\n\nAfter four weeks, the weights of the mice that were given green or black tea extracts dropped to the same levels as those of the mice that received the low-fat diet throughout the study.\n\nThe researchers also collected samples from the mice's large intestines (to measure bacteria content) and liver tissues (to measure fat deposits). In the mice that consumed either type of tea extract, there was less of the type of bacteria associated with obesity and more of the bacteria associated with lean body mass.\n\nHowever, only the mice that consumed black tea extract had an increase in a type of bacteria called Pseudobutyrivibrio, which could help explain the difference between how black tea and green tea change energy metabolism.\n\nDr. Zhaoping Li, director of the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition, chief of the UCLA Division of Clinical Nutrition and the study's senior author, said the findings suggest that the health benefits of both green tea and black tea go beyond their antioxidant benefits, and that both teas have a strong impact on the gut microbiome.\n\n\"For black tea lovers, there may be a new reason to keep drinking it,\" she said.\n\nThe findings build on a 2015 UCLA study that demonstrated that both green tea and black tea helped prevent obesity in mice that consumed a high-fat, high-sugar diet.\n\nThe new study also concluded that both green tea and black tea have different effects on liver metabolism. According to Henning, the molecules in green tea are smaller and can more readily be absorbed into the body and reach the liver directly, while black tea molecules are larger and stay in the intestine rather than being absorbed.

But MetroHealth and Cleveland EMS officials say they aren't convinced the therapy is proven enough to rewrite the book on cardiac arrest treatment.\n\n\n\nThe American Heart Association recommended cooling for most cardiac arrest survivors after two small studies in Australia and Europe, published in 2002, showed a clear benefit. The therapy is targeted to patients stricken by ventricular fibrillation, an electrical disturbance that causes the heart's pumping chambers to quiver instead of pump. It's the most common cause of sudden cardiac arrest.\n\nMany hospitals and cities have been slow to adopt the heart association recommendations.\n\nDr. Arie Blitz, a UH heart surgeon and president of the heart association's Cleveland chapter, is calling for a Columbus-like system here.\n\nColumbus rescue workers start the cooling process with cold saline IV's and ice packs placed in the armpits and groin. Hospitals take over with more sophisticated cooling equipment. Some Cleveland-area hospitals have looked at inflatable suits that circulate cold water.\n\n\"I am still amazed that lots of physicians are not aware of the technology,\" Blitz said in an e-mail. \"And if they are aware, they are not using it.\"\n\nDespite often heroic efforts to save cardiac arrest victims with CPR and defibrillation, two out of three who regain a pulse but don't wake up don't survive to hospital discharge. Even those who do are often neurologically impaired.\n\n\"In the past, we thought this was a hopeless cause,\" said Dr. Michael DeGeorgia, UH's director of neuro-intensive care and a proponent of cooling therapy. \"We know now there's a lot we can do about it. Now we cool patients and they walk and talk and go home.\"\n\nDoctors say they don't fully understand why cooling works. But the process protects the brain from damage caused by a cascade of biochemical reactions that occur when circulation is restored.\n\nUH is working out procedures for its emergency department and Cleveland Heights EMS crews. The Cleveland Clinic is also looking at cooling equipment for all its system hospitals, said Dr. Thomas Tallman, an emergency doctor and Clinic EMS director.\n\nBut Dr. David Rosenbaum, director of MetroHealth's heart and vascular center, said there is not enough research data to justify a regional system. Rosenbaum, a heart rhythm specialist, also challenged whether cooling is a priority, considering that heartbeat is restored in only a small number of people who suffer cardiac arrest outside hospitals.\n\nWith more than 300,000 deaths a year in the United States from cardiac arrest, Rosenbaum said the focus should be on preventing deadly rhythm disturbances and improving access to defibrillation.\n\n\"The more upstream the interventions are, the greater impact they will have on sudden death,\" Rosenbaum said. Cooling \"at best can have really a small impact on the bigger problem.\"\n\nMetroHealth would play an important role in a coordinated system because of its high patient volume and its medical oversight of Cleveland EMS.\n\nCleveland EMS Commissioner Edward Eckart said based on advice from Dr. Thomas Collins, city EMS medical director and a MetroHealth emergency doctor, the city has no plans to carry cooling equipment or transport patients only to hospitals that provide the therapy.\n\nEckart said the city has not been approached about starting a program, but he agrees the medical research on lives saved is not strong enough to shift gears. The city now takes cardiac arrest survivors to the closest hospital capable of emergency angioplasty (a treatment for heart attacks, which often happen in tandem with cardiac arrest).\n\nA regional approach to cooling \"is not something we believe right now is worth taking on,\" Eckart said.\n\nCooling therapy is part of a larger push to improve dismal survival rates from cardiac arrest.\n\nChances of surviving depends largely on where you live. For example, patients treated in large, urban teaching hospitals have better odds than those treated elsewhere, according to research from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine published last month.\n\nAnd people in cities that have pushed cardiac arrest as a public health imperative - focusing on bystander CPR training, defibrillation programs and EMS response - also fare better.\n\nCities such as Seattle report survival rates above 35 percent for ventricular fibrillation arrests - the type that can be corrected with defibrillation. But the national average is about 4 percent.\n\nIn 2007, UH's Blitz, calling the gap in survival rates an embarrassment, pressed Cleveland hospitals and EMS officials to join a national program to track outcomes and improve survival. City officials do not know the survival rate here, according to a spokeswoman. But she said Cleveland plans to join the national program, which is supported by the heart association and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nColumbus is already part of the program, called Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival. The city's survival rate is 12 percent, and it is expected to improve with a citywide cooling program adopted last July, said Dr. David Keseg, the Columbus EMS medical director.\n\nColumbus handles about 500 cardiac arrests a year. \"All our hospitals have signed on to cooling, so we haven't had to establish resuscitation centers,\" Keseg said. Asked about outcomes, he said results won't be available until the program reaches one year.\n\nThough it's not unusual to have debate over new therapies, the benefits of induced hypothermia is not a new discovery. Napoleon's medics were said to ice soldiers to preserve injured limbs 200 years ago. Cooling was tested as far back as the 1950's for cardiac arrest survivors. Today it's used routinely to reduce complications of heart surgeries, and it has shown promise for stroke and spinal injuries.\n\nBlitz uses a cooling device during some surgeries, and he has received research money from the device-maker, Alsius Corp. of Irvine, Calif.\n\nBlitz said debate should be aired publicly, and he is not rattled by opposition to plans for a regional approach.\n\n\"I think the data shows that for patients who have cardiac arrest and are not waking up, there's very little downside,\" he added. \"Why not offer them something?\"", "question": "Does the story compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The story listed several alternative infrastructure investments that might contribute to the enhanced survival of individuals who suffer ventricular fibrillation in a non-hospital setting. \u00a0The story mentioned bystander CPR training programs, defibrillation programs and EMS response as alternative investments to cooling apparatus. \u00a0\nThe story would have been much more valuable to readers had it included information about the size of the benefit and the costs involved with each of these as compared to cooling equipment in emergency departments.\u00a0", "answer": 1}, {"article": "In the first controlled clinical trial of nicotinamide riboside (NR), a newly discovered form of Vitamin B3, researchers have shown that the compound is safe for humans and increases levels of a cell metabolite that is critical for cellular energy production and protection against stress and DNA damage.\n\nStudies in mice have shown that boosting the levels of this cell metabolite--known as NAD+--can produce multiple health benefits, including resistance to weight gain, improved control of blood sugar and cholesterol, reduced nerve damage, and longer lifespan. Levels of NAD+ diminish with age, and it has been suggested that loss of this metabolite may play a role in age-related health decline.\n\nThese findings in animal studies have spurred people to take commercially available NR supplements designed to boost NAD+.

After each dose, blood and urine samples were collected and analyzed by Brenner's lab to measure various NAD+ metabolites in a process called metabolomics. The trial showed that the NR vitamin increased NAD+ metabolism by amounts directly related to the dose, and there were no serious side effects with any of the doses.\n\n\"This trial shows that oral NR safely boosts human NAD+ metabolism,\" Brenner says. \"We are excited because everything we are learning from animal systems indicates that the effectiveness of NR depends on preserving and/or boosting NAD+ and related compounds in the face of metabolic stresses. Because the levels of supplementation in mice that produce beneficial effects are achievable in people, it appears than health benefits of NR will be translatable to humans safely.\"\n\nThe next step will be to study the effect of longer duration NR supplementation on NAD+ metabolism in healthy adults, but Brenner also has plans to test the effects of NR in people with diseases and health conditions, including elevated cholesterol, obesity and diabetes, and people at risk for chemotherapeutic peripheral neuropathy.\n\nPrior to the formal clinical trial, Brenner conducted a pilot human study - on himself. In 2004, he had discovered that NR is a natural product found in milk and that there is pathway to convert NR to NAD+ in people. More than a decade of research on NR metabolic pathways and health effects in mice and rats had convinced him that NR supplementation had real promise to improve human health and wellness. After consulting with UI's institutional review board, he conducted an experiment in which he took 1 gram of NR once a day for seven days, and his team analyzed blood and urine samples using mass spectrometry. The experiment showed that Brenner's blood NAD+ increased by about 2.7 times. In addition, though he reported immediate sensitivity to flushing with the related compound niacin, he did not experience any side effects taking NR.\n\nThe biggest surprise from his metabolomic analysis was an increase in a metabolite called NAAD, which was multiplied by 45 times, from trace levels to amounts in the micromolar range that were easily detectable.\n\n\"While this was unexpected, I thought it might be useful,\" Brenner says. \"NAD+ is an abundant metabolite and it is sometimes hard to see the needle move on levels of abundant metabolites. But when you can look at a low-abundance metabolite that goes from undetectable to easily detectable, there is a great signal to noise ratio, meaning that NAAD levels could be a useful biomarker for tracking increases in NAD+ in human trials.\"\n\nBrenner notes this was a case of bidirectional translational science; having learned something from the initial human experiment, his team was able to return to laboratory mice to explore the unexpected NAAD finding in more detail.\n\nBrenner's mouse study showed that NAAD is formed from NR and confirmed that NAAD levels are a strong biomarker for increased NAD+ metabolism. The experiments also revealed more detail about NAD+ metabolic pathways.\n\nIn particular, the researchers compared the ability of all three NAD+ precursor vitamins - NR, niacin, and nicotinamide - to boost NAD+ metabolism and stimulate the activity of certain enzymes, which have been linked to longevity and health benefits. The study showed for the first time that oral NR is superior to nicotinamide, which is better than niacin in terms of the total amount of NAD+ produced at an equivalent dose. NR was also the best of the three in stimulating the activity of sirtuin enzymes. However, in this case, NR was the best at stimulating sirtuin-like activities, followed by niacin, followed by nicotinamide.\n\nThe information from the mouse study subsequently helped Brenner's team design the formal clinical trial. In addition to showing that NR boosts NAD+ in humans without adverse effects, the trial confirmed that NAAD is a highly sensitive biomarker of NR supplementation in people.\n\n\"Now that we have demonstrated safety in this small clinical trial, we are in a position to find out if the health benefits that we have seen in animals can be reproduced in people,\" says Brenner, who also is co-director of the Obesity Research and Education Initiative, professor of internal medicine, and a member of the Fraternal Order of Eagles Diabetes Research Center at the UI.\n\nIn addition to Brenner, the research team included lead study author Samuel Trammell, Mark Schmidt, Benjamin Weidemann, Zhonggang Li, and E. Dale Abel at the UI Carver College of Medicine; Philip Redpath and Marie Migaud at Queens University Belfast; Frank Jaksch at ChromaDex in Irvine, Calif, and Ryan Dellinger, formerly at ChromaDex.\n\nThe research was funded in part by grants from the National Institutes of Health, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, the Roy J. Carver Trust, and ChromaDex.", "question": "Does the news release compare the new approach with existing alternatives?", "explanation": "The news release states that researchers found NR is \u201csuperior\u201d to two other NAD+-boosting vitamins, niacin and nicotinamide, in the total amount of NAD+ produced and stimulation of sirtuin enzymes, which influence a cellular processes such as energy efficiency, inflammation, stress resistance, and mitochondrial biogenesis. However, it\u2019s impossible to say at this point whether any of these biochemical effects translate into health benefits.\nThe news release does not mention any proven methods for boosting metabolism and maintaining health into old age, such as keeping active and maintaining a good diet.", "answer": 0}]
