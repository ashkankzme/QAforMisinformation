[{"article": "A new, experimental cholesterol-fighting drug is creating quite a buzz among researchers and other experts, prompting some to use words such as \"dramatic,\" \"breakthrough\" and \"game changing,\" to describe early-stage clinical trial results.\n\nIf these initial results pan out in larger trials, the drug could prove to be more effective than statins, the widely prescribed drugs which have been very successful in lowering levels of LDL - or bad cholesterol.\n\nResearchers have known for some time that when the protein PCSK9, which stands for proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9, binds to LDL receptors on the liver, it compromises the organ's ability to filter the bad cholesterol from the blood. \n\n \n\n Too much LDL cholesterol circulating in the blood can lead to the thickening of artery walls, making them less flexible and therefore impairing their function and increasing the risk of heart disease.\n\nIn this phase one clinical trial, which is designed to determine if a drug is safe, researchers found that using a monoclonal antibody (lab-produced protein) called REGN727, was not only safe, but effectively blocked PCSK9 and therefore signficantly reduced bad cholesterol in healthy patients as well as those also taking the popular cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor.\n\nEarlier studies had shown this effect in primates, but this new study, published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, provides the first clinical trial data for testing the drug on humans. This new drug is being developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi, who funded the research.\n\n\u201cWars for PCSK9 are far bigger than the statin wars,\" said Dr. Evan A Stein, lead author of the study and researcher at the Metabolic and Atherosclerosis Research Center in Cincinnati, Ohio. \u201cThis is a hot research area and everybody is so close together.\"\n\nOther companies including Amgen, Merck & Company, Novartis and Pfizer, are also hot on the trail developing their own PCSK9 inhibitor drugs. Stein said.\n\nAdditional results for PCSK9 inhibitor drugs are expected to be presented at the annual American College of Cardiology meeting which begins Saturday in Chicago, he said.\n\nThe REGN727 study included three trial arms. Two arms used 72 healthy volunteers who were either injected with a single dose of the drug in increasing amounts to test for side effects, which is the purpose of a phase one clinical trial. A third arm included 21 people with a family history of high cholesterol, and 30 people with nonfamilial high cholesterol. All of those subjects were also receiving treatment with the statin Lipitor.\n\nA control group of subjects with nonfamilial high cholesterol was treated only with a special diet. None of the subjects who received REGN727 discontinued the study because of adverse effects, and the subjects who received REGN727 had a striking reduction of 60 to 65% in LDL cholesterol, according to Stein.\n\nStein characterized the results of the trial as \u201cpretty dramatic.\u201d\n\nA PCSK9 inhibitor, Stein said, differs from statins \"because it's unlike any other drug. With statins you get toxicity \u2013 with these drugs we don\u2019t see any side effects with the antibody.\u201d\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, authors Dr. Stephen G. Young, and Loren G. Fong, Ph.D. write: \u201cAt this point, the status of PCSK9 therapeutics appears to be full speed ahead. Soon, we can expect more human trials in which investigators will dissect the properties of different PCSK9 antibodies and assess the effect of these agents.\u201d\n\nHowever, without long-term safety data and evidence that PCSK9 inhibitors truly help prevent heart disease, Young and Fong caution that it will remain unclear how important this class of drugs will be.\n\nThe cost of this drug will also play a role in determining which patients might use it, Fong and Young say. But they also note that \"patients who cannot tolerate statins could benefit greatly.\"\n\nIf the results are confirmed, \u201cThis is game changing science,\u201d said Dr. Richard A. Stein, a spokesman for the American Heart Association who's not related to the study author or involved in the research.\n\nStein called the trial results \u201ca very important breakthrough,\" while being careful to note that they represent early science which should be confirmed through larger and longer studies.\n\nHe said the study methodology was thorough because it included people with high cholesterol as well as people with genetic familial high cholesterol, which is proven to be a result of impaired PCSK9 genetic function.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The findings were released at a news briefing held in advance of the annual meeting of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) in San Diego.\n\nBut if the findings are confirmed, \"patients who are taking aspirin for other reasons may see an added benefit,\" says study head Kevin Choe, MD, a radiation oncologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas.\n\nResearchers stress the findings are preliminary and that men with the cancer should not reach for the aspirin bottle in an attempt to improve their health.\n\nOct. 25, 2010 -- Aspirin , already linked in some studies to a lower risk of developing colon cancer , may also cut the risk of dying of prostate cancer by more than half, a large study suggests.\n\nStudies have shown that people with cancer are more prone to blood clots and that people with blood clots are at increased risk of cancer. Also, lab and animal studies suggest drugs that anticlotting drugs like aspirin may interfere with cancer growth and spread. So Choe and colleagues hypothesized that anticlotting drugs may lower the risk of dying among men with prostate cancer.\n\nThe study involved 5,275 men with localized cancer whose disease had not spread beyond the prostate gland; 1,982 of the men were taking anticlotting medications: aspirin, Lovenox, Plavix, and/or warfarin.\n\nBy 10 years after diagnosis, 10% of men not taking one of these medications had died from prostate cancer vs. 4% of those who took an anticlotting medication.\n\nThe risk that cancer spread was also reduced by anticlotting medications, from 7% to 3%. Also, 43% of men who didn\u2019t take anticlotting medications had a recurrence of their cancer, compared with 33% of men who did take them.\n\nMen who took aspirin gained the greatest benefit, Choe says.\n\nHarvard Medical School's Anthony Zietman, MD, president of ASTRO, tells WebMD that the findings are intriguing. However, they need to be confirmed, and the optimal dose, timing, and duration of use needs to be worked out, he says.\n\nAspirin and other anticlotting medications carry risks of their own, chiefly bleeding, Zietman says.\n\n\"We have to be sure the benefits outweigh the risks before we recommend this to patients.\"\n\nThis study was presented at a medical conference.

Hundreds of patients who received the model have had to undergo new operations to replace it. Also, scar tissue often builds up around intravenous wires, a process that can make removing and replacing them difficult or dangerous.\n\nDr. Bardy said in a telephone interview that the deaths of several patients many years ago because of wire-related injuries were a factor in his interest in developing the new device.\n\n\u201cYou are looking at a therapy that can avert, we hope, complications and be as effective,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the study published Wednesday, Dr. Bardy and others reported that the new device had undergone several successful initial trials, including one in which it was used for a year in about 60 patients.\n\nThe device is being developed by Cameron Health, a small company in San Clemente, Calif., that was co-founded by Dr. Bardy. Since the cardiologist began work on the project about a decade ago, the defibrillator he helped design has gone through several iterations.\n\nThe device will not be suitable for a significant number of heart patients, particularly those who require units that also include a pacemaker, which regulates a heart that is beating too fast or too slowly.\n\nBut Dr. Bardy estimated that the device could work in about 25 percent of patients who now get a defibrillator. These are largely patients at risk, because of genetic factors or certain types of heart diseases, for a type of erratic cardiac rhythm that can cause sudden death. Dr. Bardy said the cost of the new device is about the same as a standard defibrillator. However, he said it could help reduce health care costs, because implanting it is much simpler.\n\nBefore the device can be sold here, Cameron Health will have to submit more extensive human trial data to the F.D.A..

They received injections of a placebo or different doses of AMG145, which is a human monoclonal antibody.\n\nHuman monoclonal antibodies are naturally occurring human antibodies that are genetically altered in a laboratory, cloned in large numbers and introduced into the patient to target disease sites.\n\nThe patients who received AMG145 had 41 percent to 63 percent reductions in \"bad\" (LDL) cholesterol and did not experience significant muscle-related side effects, said study leader Dr. David Sullivan, of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Australia, and colleagues.\n\nThe reductions in LDL cholesterol seen in these patients were comparable to those that occur in patients taking the highest doses of the most effective statins, the researchers added.\n\n\"The most interesting aspect of this study is use of a novel approach using monoclonal antibodies -- a subtype of antibodies -- in the management of elevated LDL cholesterol,\" said Dr. Kenneth Ong, acting chief of cardiology at the Brooklyn Hospital Center.\n\n\"In this phase 2 study, the results are certainly impressive and warrant further investigation,\" Ong said. \"Of note is the reduction in the number of myalgias (muscle pains) for patients compared to the number of myalgias experienced by people taking statins.

Greenberg, chief of urologic oncology at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, who was not involved with the study.\n\n\"This is relatively early stage disease, and it shows what we would expect it to show: that those who have more years [to live] have better survival if treated aggressively,\" he said.\n\nMen with prostate cancer face a confusing maze of options today, including not only surgery but hormone therapy, different kinds of radiation therapy and even simply foregoing medical treatment while monitoring the cancer closely (\"watchful waiting,\" also known as \"active surveillance\").\n\n\"Watchful waiting\" is often recommended when a man is not expected to die of the cancer and would like to avoid the risk of the debilitating side effects associated with prostate cancer treatment. These may include: incontinence and erectile dysfunction (surgery); erectile dysfunction and secondary cancers (radiation therapy); nausea, breast growth, liver problems (hormonal therapy); and weakness, hair loss, fluid retention (chemotherapy).\n\nThe data presented in the May 5 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine is a 15-year follow-up of a study for which three-years of follow-up had previously been reported.\n\nThe earlier study also found that undergoing a radical prostatectomy lowered the risk of the cancer spreading, as well as the death rate from prostate cancer or any other cause.\n\nThe researchers, Drs. Anna Bill-Axelson and Lars Holmberg of University Hospital, Uppsala, and colleagues, enrolled nearly 700 men with early prostate cancer under the age of 75 who were randomly selected either to undergo a radical prostatectomy or to stay in \"watchful waiting\" mode.\n\nAfter an average follow-up of about 13 years, 14.6 percent of the men who had undergone surgery had died, versus 20.7 percent in the watchful waiting group, a 38 percent reduced risk.\n\nThe benefit was primarily seen among men younger than 65 and the authors estimated that seven men under the age of 65 and 8 over the age of 65 would need to be treated to save one life.\n\nThere was also a benefit in men whose tumors had low-risk characteristics.\n\nMen whose cancer had moved outside of the prostate gland and who underwent removal of the prostate had a seven times higher risk of dying than men whose tumors hadn't spread.\n\nRadical prostatectomy can come with a price -- including erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence and even bowel incontinence -- although these effects are not as common as techniques improve. A nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy, for example, may be able to prevent erectile dysfunction.\n\nAlso, the men in this study were diagnosed only after they had symptoms, unlike the majority of men in the United States, Greenberg said.\n\n\"The advantage of screening is that men are more likely to be cured of cancer but they also have a greater chance of not succumbing to the consequences of the surgical complications, whether [those] be erectile dysfunction or urinary incontinence,\" Greenberg said.\n\nAlso, he said, erectile dysfunction can also be a factor of aging and can be treated in most cases.\n\nBut much remains to be known about how best to treat different types of prostate cancer.\n\n\"The management of early stage prostate cancer continues to require further randomized controlled studies, which are underway, to determine the true benefit of treatment versus expectant management,\" said Dr. Marc Danziger, an attending urologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, who was not involved with the study.\n\n\"Currently, the potential benefit and side effects of treatment needs to be addressed on an individual basis in relation to the risk stratification of disease, patient desires, health status and risk tolerance,\" Danziger added.\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on prostate cancer treatments.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story did not engage in overt disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A 25-year-old medicine that costs less than $10 a treatment could save tens of thousands of people seriously injured in accidents or by violence.\n\nA study of more than 20,000 patients with traumatic injuries and at risk of bleeding to death found those who were treated with tranexamic acid were significantly less likely to die than those who got a placebo.\n\nSome 14.5 percent of patients who got the drug were dead within a month of being injured compared with 16 percent of those who got the dummy medicine.

Results of the technique, called deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS), will be presented Sunday at ENDO 2017, the Endocrine Society's 99th annual meeting in Orlando, Fla.\n\nThis study expands on the researchers' previous finding that dTMS reduced food cravings and induced weight loss in obese individuals. Unlike deep brain stimulation, dTMS does not need an operation or implantation of electrodes. Instead, an electromagnetic coil is placed on the scalp and sends magnetic pulses to stimulate specific deep regions of the brain. Currently approved in the U.S. for treating major depression, dTMS is being studied in some countries for the treatment of other neuropsychiatric disorders, especially addiction.\n\n\"We need new safe and effective therapies for obesity,\" said principal investigator Livio Luzi, M.D., professor and head of endocrinology at the IRCCS Policlinico San Donato and the University of Milan in Milan, Italy. \"Despite numerous preventive and therapeutic interventions, none has stopped obesity from reaching epidemic proportions.\"\n\nAn underlying cause of obesity may be an impaired gut microbiota composition, an imbalance in the complex mix of beneficial and harmful microorganisms that inhabit the digestive tract. Luzi said scientists now know that an impaired gut microbiota can alter the brain's signals for appetite and satiety, or fullness. He and his co-workers studied whether dTMS could improve the gut microbiota composition in obese persons and, if so, by what underlying mechanisms.\n\nIn their study, funded by the Italian Ministry of Health, the investigators recruited three men and 11 women, ages 22 to 65, with obesity as shown by a body mass index (BMI) of 30 to 45 kg/m2. They randomly assigned the study subjects to two groups for five weeks to receive 15 sessions--three times per week--of either dTMS (to the insula and prefrontal cortex deep in the brain) or a sham stimulation as a control. Before and at the end of treatment, subjects provided stool samples for microbiota analysis.\n\nThe research team also measured blood levels of glucose (sugar), insulin, pituitary gland hormones and neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine. Pituitary hormones play a key role in regulating appetite, and recent research shows that norepinephrine and other neurotransmitters affect microbiota composition, Luzi said.\n\nAfter five weeks of treatment, subjects receiving dTMS lost more than 3 percent of their body weight and more than 4 percent of their fat--significantly more than controls did, Luzi reported.\n\nResults of the fecal analysis demonstrated that, after five weeks, dTMS-treated subjects had greatly increased quantities of several beneficial bacterial species with anti-inflammatory properties, such as are found in healthy people. The control group, however, had no clinically relevant alterations in their microbiota composition, Luzi said. He also reported that changes in the abundance of other bacterial species correlated with improvement of metabolic and hormonal parameters, including glucose, insulin, several pituitary hormones and norepinephrine.\n\n\"These changes suggest a beneficial effect of dTMS on both weight loss and change in microbiota composition,\" Luzi said. \"Our research shows the innovative ability of dTMS in exerting anti-obesity effects through alteration of the gut-brain axis.\"\n\nEndocrinologists are at the core of solving the most pressing health problems of our time, from diabetes and obesity to infertility, bone health, and hormone-related cancers.

For men at high risk for the disease -- blacks and men who have a father, brother or son found to have prostate cancer at an early age (before 65) -- that discussion should start at age 45.\n\n\"Because prostate cancer grows slowly, those men without symptoms of prostate cancer who do not have a 10-year life expectancy should not be offered testing since they are not likely to benefit,\" the society notes on its Web site.\n\nAmbivalence over the test hasn't been confined to the United States.\n\n\"In Europe, we have been reluctant to recommend that all men get PSA testing as we have felt that there has been a lack of knowledge,\" agreed lead researcher Dr. Jonas Hugosson, a professor of urology at the University of Gothenburg.\n\nHowever, he believes that with the results of the new 14-year study, \"it feels ethically difficult not at least to inform all men over the age of 50 about PSA and its possibilities. Personally, I would recommend my friends check their PSA,\" Hugosson added.\n\nThe report is published in the June 30 online edition of The Lancet Oncology.\n\nFor the still-ongoing study, Hugosson randomly assigned some 20,000 men to either PSA screening once every two years or no screening. The men were between 50 and 65 at the start of the study.\n\nMen whose PSA levels were above normal were offered more tests, such as a digital rectal exam and prostate biopsies.\n\nOver 14 years of follow-up, deaths from prostate cancer dropped by 44 percent among the screened men, compared with unscreened men, the researchers found. Overall, 44 of the men who had PSA testing died from prostate cancer, compared to 78 men who had not had been screened.\n\nAmong screened men, 11.4 percent were diagnosed with prostate cancer, compared with 7.2 percent of unscreened men. Of the men in the screened group diagnosed with prostate cancer, nearly 79 percent were diagnosed because they took part in the study, the researchers noted.\n\nIn addition, men in the screened group were more likely to have their cancer diagnosed while it was in an early stage. In the screened group, 46 men were diagnosed with advanced cancer, compared with 87 men in the unscreened group, Hugosson's team found.\n\n\"Our study has a longer follow-up than previous studies, but shows that in those men invited [to the study], the risk of dying is only half of that in the control group. In men younger than 60 at study entry, the effect was even more pronounced -- only one-quarter of expected deaths occurred,\" Hugosson said.\n\nMoreover, the risk of over-diagnosis was less than previously thought, with just 12 men needed to be diagnosed to save one life. However, since the benefit of PSA screening requires at least 10 years to be borne out, it still seems questionable to test PSA for men over 70, the researchers noted.\n\nDr. David E. Neal, a professor of surgical oncology at the University of Cambridge in the U.K. and author of an accompanying editorial, believes that, \"PSA testing detects prostate cancer early in its natural history when it causes no symptoms. By doing so, it can save the lives of some men who would otherwise have died of the disease.\"\n\nThis study adds to previous evidence that PSA testing and screening for prostate cancer saves lives, he said. Still, the PSA test remains \"a blunt instrument,\" when it comes to determining the aggressiveness of a particular tumor, Neal said. \"We need better tests that identify more accurately those men destined to develop problems in the future from this disease,\" he said.\n\nIn the United States, PSA testing remains a routine part of most physical exams, according to Dr. Nelson Neal Stone, a professor of urology and radiation oncology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City.\n\n\"I would say 70 to 80 percent of physicians now order a PSA test,\" he said. \"So it is more or less the standard to care in America to get a PSA done.\"\n\nStone noted that screening detects a lot of early cancers, which do not need to be treated. \"When we see patients with low-risk disease we don't treat them, we observe them,\" he said.\n\n\"Younger men benefit most from screening, because they have the greatest risk of dying,\" Stone said. \"This study clearly supports PSA screening to prevent prostate cancer deaths.\"\n\nAnother expert, Dr. Anthony D'Amico, chief of radiation oncology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, added that \"people in good health will benefit from [PSA] screening, but people in poor health may not benefit at all.\" That's because if their prostate tumor is not aggressive they are more likely to die from the other, more serious conditions, he explained.\n\nFor more information on prostate cancer, visit the American Cancer Society.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "\u00a0There was no overt disease-mongering.

Yet Dr. Bertin has recently changed the way he talks about medication, offering parents a powerful argument. Recent research, he says, suggests the pills may \u201cnormalize\u201d the child\u2019s brain over time, rewiring neural connections so that a child would feel more focused and in control, long after the last pill was taken.\n\n\u201cThere might be quite a profound neurological benefit,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nA growing number of doctors who treat the estimated 6.4 million American children diagnosed with A.D.H.D. are hearing that stimulant medications not only help treat the disorder but may actually be good for their patients\u2019 brains. In an interview last spring with Psych Congress Network, an Internet news site for mental health professionals, Dr. Timothy Wilens, chief of child and adolescent psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital, said \u201cwe have enough data to say they\u2019re actually neuroprotective.\u201d The pills, he said, help \u201cnormalize\u201d the function and structure of brains in children with A.D.H.D., so that, \u201cover years, they turn out to look more like non-A.D.H.D. kids.\u201d\n\nMedication is already by far the most common treatment for A.D.H.D., with roughly 4 million American children taking the pills \u2014 mostly stimulants, such as amphetamines and methylphenidate. Yet the decision can be anguishing for parents who worry about both short-term and long-term side effects. If the pills can truly produce long-lasting benefits, more parents might be encouraged to start their children on these medications early and continue them for longer.\n\nLeading A.D.H.D. experts, however, warn the jury is still out.\n\n\u201cSometimes wishful thinking gives us hope that the impressive short-term relative benefits of medication over other treatments will persist beyond childhood, but I haven\u2019t seen it,\u201d said James Swanson, director of the Child Development Center at the University of California at Irvine. Dr. Swanson, a co-author of a landmark federally funded study, the Multimodal Treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, said that follow-up research found overall improvement but no greater long-term benefits after three years for children who were treated with medication compared to those who weren\u2019t. One possible reason, as the report noted, was that many children refuse to continue taking medication after a year or so, something most parentsof such children well know.\n\nResearch has shown that the brains of people with A.D.H.D. on average look and function differently than those who don\u2019t have the disorder, particularly when it comes to processing two important neurotransmitters: dopamine and norepinephrine. For most people with A.D.H.D., stimulants can temporarily boost focus, motivation and self-control by increasing the availability of these chemical messengers. The question is whether these effects can last once the drugs have left the bloodstream.\n\nIn arguing for \u201cnormalization,\u201d Dr. Wilens cited a major review in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry in late 2013, which looked at 29 brain-scan studies. Although the studies had different methods and goals, the authors said that, together, they suggested that stimulants \u201care associated with attenuation of abnormalities in brain structure, function, and biochemistry in subjects with A.D.H.D.\u201d\n\nBut other A.D.H.D. experts challenge this conclusion. Dr. F. Xavier Castellanos, director of research at the New York University Child Study Center, called assertions that stimulants are neuroprotective \u201cexaggerated,\u201d adding: \u201cThe best inference is that there is no evidence of harm from medications \u2013 normalization is a possibility, but far from demonstrated.\u201d\n\nA.D.H.D. is an exceptionally controversial diagnosis, with particular controversy zeroing in on researchers, including Dr. Wilens himself and some of the authors of the 2013 report he cited who have received financial support from pharmaceutical firms. In an email, Dr. Wilens said he had not received \u201cany personal income\u201d from the pharmaceutical industry since 2009.\n\nAs several experts noted, a major impediment to determining the long-term impacts of A.D.H.D. medication is that a \u201cgold-standard\u201d study would require researchers to assign children randomly to groups that either received medication or didn\u2019t. Such a practice has been deemed unethical due to the widespread belief that the medication can help struggling children, at least in the short-term.\n\nAnd other research has raised new concerns. One peer-reviewed 2013 study co-authored by Dr. Swanson suggested that the stimulants may change the brain over time so as to undermine the long-term response to the medication and even exacerbate symptoms when people aren\u2019t taking them.\n\nDr. Peter Jensen, the former associate director of child and adolescent research at the National Institute of Mental Health, cautioned that parents should not try to force children with A.D.H.D. to take medication when they don\u2019t want to, adding that \u201cmost kids don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\nDr. Jensen, who now heads the REACH Institute, a national nonprofit organization concerned with children\u2019s mental health, once surveyed 100 parents of sons and daughters in their 20s who had been diagnosed with A.D.H.D., asking what made the most difference.\n\n\u201cEighty percent of them said \u2018Love your child.

Michael Brunt, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis. \"One repair isn't appropriate for all circumstances.\"\n\nHernias occur when part of an internal organ, such as the intestines, bulges out through muscle. At issue are the surgical approaches that physicians use when a patient suffers from a hernia in the groin.\n\nThe procedures are designed to reduce the bulge of the hernia and make a patch so it doesn't protrude again. \"It's as if you had a leak in a tire that's ballooned out,\" Brunt said. \"You'll patch it to prevent it from continuing to protrude.\"\n\nThe study, led by researchers at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, examined two procedures.\n\nOne procedure, known as total extraperitoneal inguinal hernioplasty, is performed under a general anesthetic and uses a laparoscopic approach through a small opening. It was developed in the 1990s, Brunt said.\n\nThe other approach is older and is performed through a 2- to 2.5-inch incision in the groin, Brunt said. It can be done under local anesthesia. The study authors didn't examine a third approach, known as \"patch and plug,\" he said.\n\nIn the study, researchers randomly assigned 660 hernia patients to one of the two surgical procedures. Almost all the patients were men, and their average age was around 55.\n\nThe researchers followed up with 75 percent of the patients after an average period of five years.\n\nHernias recurred in 5 percent of laparoscopic and 8 percent of the traditional-procedure patients. Recurrences decreased to 0.5 percent and 4 percent, respectively, if the procedures were performed by experienced surgeons.\n\nAfter five years, 28 percent of those who had the traditional procedure reported chronic pain, compared to 15 percent of the laparoscopic group.\n\nThe study \"confirms what a lot of surgeons who do both procedures know already,\" Brunt said. \"There's less pain and a bit of a faster recovery from the laparoscopic procedure.\"\n\nStill, \"the vast majority of patients do well, regardless of the approach,\" he said.\n\nWhy use the traditional approach if the laparoscopic technique is better in some ways?

The cohort included 305 patients under 70 years of age, 448 patients ages 70 to 79 years, and 330 patients aged 80 years or more (which included 16 patients aged 90 years or more). The median age was 75 years (range 41to 94).\n\nStudy results show no significant differences among the three age groups with respect to 2-year local recurrence, regional recurrence, distant metastases or the incidence of grade 3 or higher toxicity. Cause-specific survival was similar among all three age groups (90.3 to 90.6 percent). Two-year overall survival was lower in older patients, which is likely related to other medical issues.\n\n\"Older patients are often not considered for radiation therapy due to concerns about their ability to tolerate treatment. The results of our study clearly support the use of SBRT for elderly patients, especially those who may not be able to tolerate longer courses of radiotherapy or more invasive treatment options,\" says Meredith Giuliani, MBBS, FRCPC, MEd, a radiation oncologist in the Cancer Clinical Research Unit at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network in Toronto and lead study author. \"Radiation oncologists need to work closely with our peers in other parts of the medical community to ensure that patients with diagnosed or suspected early-lung cancer are evaluated for potential treatment with SBRT regardless of age.\"\n\n\"This study is the largest series of its type to evaluate SBRT outcomes in patients aged 80 years and older,\" says Joel Goldwein, MD, Senior Vice President, Medical Affairs for Elekta. \"In addition to providing important support for using SBRT to treat early-stage lung cancer in elderly patients, these findings highlight the value of multi-institutional collaborations and large data sets that can provide statistically meaningful answers to critical questions about treatment outcome and guide clinical decision making.\"\n\nThe Elekta Lung Research Group (ELRG) is an international collaboration of physicians and physicists that is evaluating clinical outcomes in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer patients. To date, they have accumulated data on close to 1,200 such patients and identified medical and technical factors that affect tumor control and toxicity. Their collective experience is among the largest multinational series of patients treated with image-guided SBRT to date.\n\nThe ELRG includes participants from William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan; Princess Margaret Cancer Centre; Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Julius-Maximilians University of W\u00fcrzburg in W\u00fcrzburg, Germany; and The Netherlands Cancer Institute-Antoni van Leeuwenhoek hospital in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\n\nDisclosure: This research was partially supported by Elekta through a research grant with all institutions being members of the Elekta Lung Research Group.

This method, this test, needs to be tried [and confirmed] with many more subjects outside our laboratory,\" he says. Plus, the research needs to be expanded to many more study participants and tried on younger people with autism and those who are not as high-functioning as the subjects in this first trial.\n\nUsing the MRI, the study authors measured how the water in the brain flows along the axons or nerve fibers in the parts of the brain that control language, social and emotional functioning. The scans revealed that the wiring of the brains of those with autism was disorganized compared with the brains of a typical person without autism. This is how they could determine which brains scans belonged those study participants with autism.\n\nThe study included only males between the ages of 7 and 28 because they were part of a bigger research project at the University of Utah, which is following males with autism for a longer period. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 1 in 110 children in the United States have an autism spectrum disorder and boys are far more likely to have this neurological disorder that affects language and social behavior \u2013 that number is about 1 in 70. However future studies will include girls too.\n\nCurrently there's no biologic test for autism, so pediatricians look to see if a child is meeting certain developmental milestones as well as signs and symptoms of autism. (The advocacy group Autism Speaks has posted videos to help parents see the signs of autism)\n\nThe earlier a child has been identified as having autism, the earlier behavioral therapies can be applied to lessen the impact of the disorder later in life. Lange believes this brain scans can be done on younger children, as long as they can go to sleep in the scanner \u2013 on their own, without sedation (because you can't move during the test).\n\nCarissa Cascio, an assistant professor of psychiatry from Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, who specializes in autism and neuro-imaging, believes these study results are important. But she cautions that using this method as a true diagnostic tool to detect autism in a child is \"a long way off.\" \"What this paper seems to be doing is taking the first steps towards parlaying what we are able to glean from brain imaging into potential diagnostic tools.\"\n\nZachary Warren, who is the director of the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center Treatment and Research Institute for Autism Spectrum Disorders (TRIAD), says since there are many types of autism, \"it becomes very challenging to capture all these differences with one test.\" Still he believes this is new study can help pinpoint the earliest markers of concern in developing brains.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "Both stories rely on the CDC statistics for autism prevalence.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "More than a third of American adults use some form of complementary or alternative medicine, according to a government report. Natural remedies have an obvious appeal, but how do you know which ones to choose and whether the claims are backed by science? In this occasional series, the New York Times \u201cReally?\u201d columnist, Anahad O\u2019Connor, explores the claims and the science behind alternative remedies that you may want to consider for your family medicine cabinet.\n\nThe Science: For decades, parents looking for an over-the-counter medicine to cure a child\u2019s sickness and coughing have turned to syrupy medicines containing dextromethorphan, a popular cough suppressant found in products like Children\u2019s Dimetapp DM and Robitussin DM.\n\nBut in 2007, a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel declared the products potentially harmful in small children and recommended a ban on many of them. As an alternative, many experts suggest something as simple as a spoonful of honey or even a small cup of flavored water, which have few side effects and seem to be effective.\n\nThe thinking is that sweet substances of any kind help soothe the back of the throat and break up mucus in the airways. Honey is also known to have antioxidant and antimicrobial properties.\n\nIn one double-blind study published in The Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, researchers recruited 105 children and teenagers who had coughs from upper-respiratory infections. The subjects were randomly divided into three groups: one that received no treatment, another that received one or two teaspoons of buckwheat honey, and a third that received a dose of honey-flavored dextromethorphan. Ultimately, the honey produced the greatest improvements when it came to better sleep and reduced cough frequency and severity.\n\nThe study was carried out by pediatricians at the Pennsylvania State University medical school and supported by a grant from the National Honey Board, an industry-backed agency of the Department of Agriculture.\n\nIn a similar study published in the journal Pediatrics in 2004, researchers recruited 100 children with upper respiratory tract infections who had been coughing for an average of over three days. The children were given a cough syrup with dextromethorphan, a cough syrup containing an antihistamine, or a placebo, which was essentially flavored water. Although children in all three groups experienced a reduction in coughing, those who received the flavored water fared the best.\n\nThe Risks: According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, honey may be useful in relieving coughing, but it should never be given to children under a year of age because in rare cases it can cause infantile botulism.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story does not engage in disease-mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "WEDNESDAY, Aug. 2, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- A new treatment might open the door for more patients with advanced kidney disease to get a transplant, a preliminary study suggests.\n\nOf the 100,000-plus Americans waiting for a donor kidney, about one-third are \"sensitized,\" said Dr. Robert Montgomery, director of the Transplant Institute at NYU Langone in New York City.\n\nThose patients face a tough situation: They harbor immune system antibodies that are primed to attack a donor organ.\n\nThe antibodies can form when a person is exposed to foreign tissue, Montgomery explained. So a patient who's had a prior kidney transplant may be highly sensitized -- meaning they have a large number of the offending antibodies.\n\nIt can also happen to patients who've had blood transfusion or ever been pregnant, Montgomery said.\n\nIt's almost impossible to find a compatible donor for those patients. But they might be able to receive a kidney from an incompatible donor if they first undergo an extensive \"desensitization\" process.\n\nThat involves various treatments -- including IV drugs called immune globulin and rituximab -- that try to quash the antibodies that would attack the donor organ.\n\nNow the new research suggests a simple approach -- an infusion of a particular enzyme hours before the transplant -- could offer a better alternative.\n\nResearchers found that the treatment -- dubbed IdeS -- quickly wiped out the dangerous antibodies, allowing all but one of 25 patients to have a successful transplant.\n\nThe findings were published in the Aug. 2 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Funding for the study came from the company developing IdeS -- Hansa Medical.\n\nMontgomery, who was not involved in the study, said he's \"never seen anything like it.\"\n\n\"When you give this, all of the antibodies are gone,\" Montgomery said. \"I'm hopeful that this will turn out to be a game-changer.\"\n\nHowever, he stressed, many questions remain.\n\nCritically, the enzyme does not banish the antibodies forever. They come back, Montgomery said -- and the results of that comeback vary from patient to patient.\n\nIn the study, 10 patients had an episode of antibody-mediated rejection anywhere from two weeks to five months after their transplant. That means antibodies started to attack the new kidney.\n\nThose patients were all successfully treated with standard anti-rejection drugs, according to the researchers.\n\nStill, it's not yet clear how the patients will fare in the long term, said Dr. Julie Ingelfinger, a professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston.\n\nIngelfinger, who wrote an editorial published with the study, echoed Montgomery's cautious optimism.\n\nIf larger, longer studies bolster the current findings, she said, \"this could potentially be practice-changing.\"\n\n\"But,\" Ingelfinger stressed, \"only time will tell.\"\n\nLead researcher Dr. Stanley Jordan agreed that more work is necessary.\n\nBut the findings mark another step forward for patients like these, according to Jordan, who is medical director of the kidney transplant program at Cedars-Sinai, in Los Angeles.\n\nTraditionally, highly sensitized patients in need of a kidney have languished on waiting lists because it's so hard to find a compatible donor.\n\nBut in the past 15 years or so, desensitization has emerged as an alternative.\n\nLast year, a landmark study proved that patients who receive transplants after desensitization live significantly longer than those who stay on dialysis.\n\n\"The outcomes have been good,\" Jordan said.\n\nBut, he added, there's clearly room for improvement.\n\nIngelfinger agreed. \"The desensitization protocols now in use are time-consuming, and they don't always work,\" she said, noting that they can leave dangerous antibodies behind.\n\nDesensitization adds about $20,000 to $30,000 to the cost of the transplant, according to the University of Wisconsin's transplant center.\n\nThe new approach is quite different, Ingelfinger said.\n\nPatients receive one infusion of an enzyme called IdeS four to six hours before the transplant.\n\nThe enzyme is derived from a strain of Streptococcus bacteria, and it essentially chops up the antibodies that would attack the organ.\n\nJordan acknowledged that the source \"sounds scary,\" but stressed that patients do not receive the bacteria itself -- but an engineered version of the enzyme.\n\nIn all, 25 U.S. and Swedish patients received an infusion of IdeS before their kidney transplant. All but one had a successful transplant, and none had detectable antibodies immediately afterward.\n\nIdeS patients still received additional treatment -- including a week of immune globulin and rituximab infusions.\n\nAnd as with all transplants, they needed standard anti-rejection drugs.\n\nBecause IdeS so readily banishes the offending antibodies, it might make transplants feasible for even the most highly sensitized patients, Montgomery said.\n\nBut the \"$65,000 question\" remains, he said: Can it extend the survival of the donor kidney and, ultimately, patients' lives?\n\nIdeS is still experimental, and the only way patients could receive it is through a clinical trial. It will be \"a few years\" before it could be more widely available, Montgomery said.\n\nThe National Kidney Foundation has more on kidney transplantation.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No mongering here.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Jan. 5, 2011 -- A two-week course of the antibiotic rifaximin (Xifaxan) helps to relieve the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and the relief lasts up to 10 weeks after stopping the medication, according to new research.\n\n''The major finding was that all IBS symptoms improved,\" says Mark Pimentel, MD, director of the GI Motility Program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, who led the clinical trial of the drug at Cedars.\n\nThe study looked only at those IBS patients with the non-constipation form, he tells WebMD.

This research demonstrates a novel method of treating this tumor without the toxicity of aggressive therapy that can also have late effects on the patient's health,\" said Tamarah J. Westmoreland, MD, PhD, a pediatric surgeon at Nemours Children's Health System and senior author of the study. \"Unique approaches to target tumor cells with nanoparticle delivery systems hold promise for treatment of resistant tumors, such as the high risk neuroblastoma. We are hopeful that in the future, nanoparticles can be utilized to personalize care to patients and reduce the late effects of therapy.\"\n\nNeuroblastomas are cancers that start in early nerve cells and commonly form in the tissue of the adrenal glands, near the kidneys. About 700 new cases of neuroblastoma are diagnosed each year in the United States and most cases appear in children younger than 5 years old. High-risk neuroblastoma is hard to cure and is more likely to become resistant to standard therapies or recur. These cancers are also associated with late effects after treatments have ended, including developmental delays, hearing loss, or other disabilities.\n\nCurcumin has been shown to have substantial anti-cancer ability, but its low solubility and poor stability have made its use in medicinal applications challenging. Researchers from Nemours and UCF found that nanoparticles can be used to deliver curcumin to tumor sites.\n\n\"This shows that nanoparticles can be an effective delivery vehicle for cancer drugs,\" said Professor Sudipta Seal, who directs of UCF's NanoScience Technology Center and Advanced Materials Processing Analysis Center, and is a collaborator on the study. \"More research is needed, but we are hopeful it could lead to more effective treatment of this devastating disease in the future.\"\n\nIn the study, researchers loaded Cerium oxide nanoparticles with curcumin and coated them with dextran to test in cell lines of a high-risk form of neuroblastoma, known as MYCN-amplified, as well as non-amplified neuroblastoma. This formulation induced substantial cell death in neuroblastoma cells while producing no or only minor toxicity in healthy cells. Overall, the nano-therapeutic treatments showed a more pronounced effect in MYCN-amplified cells, which are traditionally more resistant to drug therapies.\n\nNanoscience research, which explores the unusual properties of materials at the nanoscale, has led to advancements in medicine, energy, information storage, computing and other fields. At no more than 100 nanometers, nanoparticles are exceedingly small.

Ahlquist, professor of medicine and a consultant in gastroenterology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.\n\n\"The dream is to eradicate colon cancer altogether and the most realistic approach to getting there is screening,\" he said. \"And screening not only in a way that would not only detect cancer, but pre-cancer. Our test takes us closer to that dream.\"\n\nAhlquist was scheduled to present the findings of the study Thursday in Philadelphia at a meeting on colorectal cancer sponsored by the American Association for Cancer Research.\n\nThe new technology, called the Cologuard sDNA test, works by identifying specific altered DNA in cells shed by pre-cancerous or cancerous polyps into the patient's stool.\n\nIf a DNA abnormality is found, a colonoscopy would still be needed to confirm the results, just as happens now after a positive fecal occult blood test (FOBT) result.\n\nTo see whether the test was effective, Ahlquist's team tried it out on more than 1,100 frozen stool samples from patients with and without colorectal cancer.\n\nThe test was able to detect 85.3 percent of colorectal cancers and 63.8 percent of polyps bigger than 1 centimeter. Polyps this size are considered pre-cancers and most likely to progress to cancer, Ahlquist said.\n\nThe sensitivity of the test is much better than what has been seen in other stool screening tests, the ACS' Brooks added. \"But, showing that in a small group of samples is very different from demonstrating that in a population where only a small number of individuals are going to have polyps of that size. Then we will know if this is a big step forward,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Ahlquist, Cologuard is the first noninvasive test to detect pre-cancerous polyps, he added.\n\nIn addition, the test is the only one that is able to identify cancer in all locations throughout the colon, something which other tests either can't or don't do well, Ahlquist said.\n\nOne more advantage: patients do not need to do any special preparation before taking the test, something that other tests require, he added.\n\nAhlquist noted that the test still needs to be refined. \"We learned there are still some bugs and we can make the test even better,\" he said.\n\nCologuard is not yet available for sale. Clinical trials comparing the test with colonoscopy are slated to start next year. Ahlquist hopes that the test will be approved and available within two years.\n\nAhlquist noted that the cost of the test has not yet been established. It is expected to cost more than a fecal occult blood test, but far less than a colonoscopy. A fecal occult blood test can cost as little as $23 while a colonoscopy can total $700.\n\nAnother benefit is that it would probably need to be done once every three years, while the fecal occult blood test is usually done yearly. Savings over time on a more accurate test done fewer times could justify the higher cost of the Cologuard test, Ahlquist said.\n\nIn two other presentations at the meeting, researchers have linked key gene variants to the risk for colon cancer and also to the prognosis of the disease.\n\nIn one study, researchers found that people who have long telomeres, the small strips of DNA that cover the ends of chromosomes, have a 30 percent increased risk of developing colon cancer.\n\n\"Even for people their age, their telomeres were longer than you'd expect for healthy people,\" lead researcher Dr. Lisa A. Boardman, an associate professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic, said in a statement. \"This suggests that there may be two different mechanisms that affect telomere length and that set up susceptibility to cancer,\" she said.\n\nIn the other study, a research team led by Kim M. Smits, a molecular biologist and epidemiologist in the GROW-School for Oncology and Developmental Biology at Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands, uncovered a surprise when it came to a gene variant on the KRAS gene called the G variant. This variant, long linked to poorer outcomes in advanced colorectal cancer, actually predicted a better prognosis in early-stage colon cancer.\n\n\"You would intuitively think that the G variant would be associated with a poorer prognosis, as it is in late-stage colorectal cancer, but that is not the case,\" Smits said in a statement.\n\nExperts point out that studies presented at scientific meetings do not have to pass the rigorous peer review of studies published in reputable journals.\n\nFor more information on colon cancer, visit the American Cancer Society.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering here.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The new study only included national data through 2005, the most recent year they were available, but, said Dr. Durado Brooks, director of prostate and colorectal cancers for the American Cancer Society, \u201cthere is no reason to believe it has changed significantly since 2005.\u201d Doctors said there are several reasons screening seems to continue indefinitely as men age. They range from patient demands to malpractice fears to financial incentives and doctors\u2019 own lack of understanding of the risks and benefits of screening.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of pressures,\u201c said Dr. Gerald L. Andriole, a urologic surgeon at Washington University. \u201cIt is not all pure data that is promoting aggressive screening.\u201d Dr. Andriole is directing a National Cancer Institute study of 76,000 men that failed to find a screening benefit after 10 years. The men were aged 55 to 74 when the study began. P.S.A. screening is controversial at any age. Screening proponents say the cancer institute study was flawed and point to a European study of 162,000 men aged 55 to 69 that showed a 20 percent drop in the prostate cancer death rate with screening.\n\nScreening critics say the European study was flawed and add that there is a logical reason it has been hard to show a screening benefit.\n\nThey note that prostate cancer is a common cancer, found in most men\u2019s prostates on autopsy, although often the men had no idea they had it. The cancer can be lethal, but it usually grows so slowly that men die with it, not because of it.\n\nFor most men, screening only has harms because it leads to biopsies and treatments with unpleasant side effects. And, they say, it might not help cure many deadly prostate cancers because those cancers may have already spread outside the prostate, microscopically seeding other organs, long before a P.S.A. test indicates a possible problem.\n\nA positive P.S.A. test usually leads to a biopsy and then, if cancer is found, to a decision about whether to treat it. Nearly all men opt for treatment, which includes surgery to remove the prostate or radiation to destroy the cancer. Side effects can include impotence and incontinence.\n\nEven younger men should weigh the harms of screening, says Dr. Lisa Schwartz of Dartmouth Medical School. \u201cYou also have the potential to wreck their lives,\u201d she said.\n\nOne reason treatment is the most common choice is that it is hard to know if a cancer is lethal. Pathologists can distinguish between cancers that look particularly aggressive and those that do not, but there is a real possibility that even if tissue obtained at a biopsy has only less aggressive tumor cells, more aggressive cells might still be lurking in the prostate.\n\nBut even with this uncertainty, prostate cancer specialists say, most men who are treated would not have died of prostate cancer, and that is especially true for elderly men, in particular those who are frail and have a limited life expectancy. Yet changing medical practice can be difficult.\n\n\u201cAnytime a practice becomes ingrained, it is difficult to eradicate,\u201d says Dr. Brooks. \u201cIt is harder to get rid of an aberrant behavior than to adopt a new one.\u201d\n\nDr. Andriole said the very concept of not screening is difficult.\n\n\u201cIt is the hardest thing in the world not to look for a cancer and not to treat it,\u201d he says. And doctors, he added, have many inducements to screen. They often are afraid they could be sued if they do not screen and a man is found to have a lethal cancer. And there are financial incentives.\n\n\u201cUrologists make money by finding ways to biopsy men and administer treatments,\u201d Dr. Andriole said. Screening, he added, \u201cis promoted by hospitals and industry.\u201d And, he added, \u201cmany patients demand it.\u201d\n\nDr. Brooks of the cancer society says he travels the country and talks to primary care doctors about screening, and has learned that many have misconceptions about the test\u2019s benefits.\n\n\u201cThey often don\u2019t appreciate the downside of screening,\u201d Dr. Brooks said, \u201cand they don\u2019t appreciate the delay in benefit.\u201d In addition, Dr. Brooks said, primary care doctors often \u201coverestimate the likelihood that early detection of prostate cancer will lead to survival benefits.\u201d\n\nAdded to that, Dr. Brooks said, is the length of time it takes to discuss the pros and cons of screening with patients. Often it is easier to just order the test.\n\nDr. Bruce Roth, a professor of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis, said that ideally, a doctor should take a man\u2019s overall health into account and not just go by age in ordering P.S.A. tests. But if a man has been screened year after year, it can be hard to suggest he stop because he may not live much longer.\n\nSome men say the cautions just do not apply to them.\n\nJ. Allen Wheeler, who is 82 and lives in Portland, Ore., said he had his most recent P.S.A. test in January. His doctor orders it routinely, he says, adding, \u201cIn all honestly, it\u2019s part of my physical.\u201d His doctor \u201cjust does it \u2014 that\u2019s the understanding between us.\u201d\n\nMr. Wheeler, who says his health is \u201cfairly good,\u201d said he could not foresee a time when he would stop having the test.

The study appears in Scientific Reports.\n\nGestational diabetes occurs only in pregnancy and results when the level of blood sugar, or glucose, rises too high. Gestational diabetes increases the mother\u2019s chances for high blood pressure disorders of pregnancy and the need for cesarean delivery, and the risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes later in life. For infants, gestational diabetes increases the risk for large birth size. Unless they have a known risk factor, such as obesity, women typically are screened for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nIn the current study, researchers evaluated whether the HbA1c test (also called the A1C test), commonly used to diagnose type 2 diabetes, could identify signs of gestational diabetes in the first trimester of pregnancy. The test approximates the average blood glucose levels over the previous 2 or 3 months, based on the amount of glucose that has accumulated on the surface of red blood cells. According to the authors, comparatively few studies have examined whether the HbA1c test could help identify the risk for gestational diabetes, and these studies have been limited to women already at high risk for the condition. The test is not currently recommended to diagnose gestational diabetes at any point in pregnancy.\n\nThe researchers analyzed records from the NICHD Fetal Growth Study, a large observational study that recruited more than 2,000 low-risk pregnant women from 12 U.S. clinical sites between 2009 and 2013. The researchers compared HbA1c test results from 107 women who later developed gestational diabetes to test results from 214 women who did not develop the condition. Most of the women had tests at four intervals during pregnancy: early (weeks 8-13), middle (weeks 16-22 and 24-29) and late (weeks 34-37).\n\nWomen who went on to develop gestational diabetes had higher HbA1c levels (an average of 5.3 percent), compared to those without gestational diabetes (an average HbA1c level of 5.1 percent). Each .1 percent increase in HbA1c above 5.1 percent in early pregnancy was associated with a 22-percent higher risk for gestational diabetes.\n\nIn middle pregnancy, HbA1c levels declined for both groups. However, HbA1c levels increased in the final third of pregnancy, which is consistent with the decrease in sensitivity to insulin that often occurs during this time period.\n\n\u201cOur results suggest that the HbA1C test potentially could help identify women at risk for gestational diabetes early in pregnancy, when lifestyle changes may be more effective in reducing their risk,\u201d said the study\u2019s senior author, Cuilin Zhang, Ph.D., of the Epidemiology Branch at NIH\u2019s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.\n\nExercise and a healthy diet may lower blood glucose levels during pregnancy. If these measures are not successful, physicians may prescribe insulin to bring blood glucose under control.\n\nThe authors noted that further studies are needed to confirm whether measuring HbA1c levels in early pregnancy could determine a woman\u2019s later risk for gestational diabetes. Similarly, research is needed to determine whether lowering HbA1c with lifestyle changes, either in early pregnancy or before pregnancy, could reduce the risk for the condition.\n\nAbout the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD): NICHD conducts and supports research in the United States and throughout the world on fetal, infant and child development; maternal, child and family health; reproductive biology and population issues; and medical rehabilitation.

The women completed questionnaires about their diet every four years for 18 years.\n\nDuring the study period, 405 participants had heart attacks. Women who ate the most blueberries and strawberries were 32 percent less likely to have a heart attack, compared to women who ate berries once a month or less. This held true even among women who ate a diet rich in other fruits and vegetables.\n\nThis benefit was independent of other heart risk factors such as advancing age, high blood pressure, family history of heart attack, body mass index, exercise, smoking, and caffeine and alcohol intake. The findings appear online Jan. 14 in the journal Circulation.\n\nThe study can't say specifically what about the berries seemed to result in a lower risk of heart attack among these women, or that there was a direct cause-and-effect link between eating the berries and lowered heart attack risk. But blueberries and strawberries contain high levels of compounds that may help widen arteries, which counters plaque buildup, the researchers said. Heart attacks can occur when plaque blocks blood flow to the heart.\n\n\"Berries were the most commonly consumed sources of these substances in the U.S. diet, and they are one of the best sources of these powerful bioactive compounds,\" said study lead author Aedin Cassidy. \"These substances, called anthocyanins -- a flavonoid -- are naturally present in red- and blue-colored fruits and vegetables, so they are also found in high amounts in cherries, grapes, eggplant, black currants, plums and other berries.\"\n\nMen are likely to benefit from eating berries as well, although this study included only women, said Cassidy, who is head of the department of nutrition at Norwich Medical School at the University of East Anglia, in England.\n\nAlthough more research is needed to confirm these benefits, \"these data are important from a public health perspective because these fruits can be readily incorporated into the habitual diet,\" the study concluded.\n\nDr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a preventive cardiologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, noted that this was a \"huge study that followed women for a long period of time. Women who ate three or more servings of strawberries and blueberries per week decreased their heart attack risk by one-third. This is pretty compelling.\"\n\nSteinbaum's advice to both women and men is to include berries in their diet, and make them part of their daily fruit and vegetable fill.\n\nOne serving of blueberries or strawberries equals about one cup.\n\nDana Greene, a nutritionist in Boston, regularly tells her patients to consume more fruits and vegetables, including berries.\n\n\"They are so good for you,\" Greene said. Besides flavonoids, berries also are loaded with other nutrients, including vitamin C, potassium and folate.\n\n\"I tell all patients to make sure that half of their plate is filled with fruits and vegetables, especially richly colored ones like blueberries and strawberries,\" Greene said. \"Berries can also help people lose weight and maintain that loss because they feel fuller faster.

An endometriosis pain treatment was just approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and it\u2019s expected to arrive at pharmacies as soon as August. The pill, called elagolix (brand name Orilissa), from the drugmaker AbbVie, is the first FDA-approved oral treatment in more than a decade for the moderate to severe pain that comes with endometriosis.\n\n\u201cThis [medication] could really be transformative,\u201d said Hugh Taylor, an OB-GYN at Yale Medical School who led the key trials testing the drug.\n\nEndometriosis is one of the most common gynecological conditions, affecting as many as one in 10 women of reproductive age. And it can be incredibly painful. The reason is simple: Women with the condition are growing excess tissue in their abdomen that they can\u2019t shed.\n\nEvery month, a woman\u2019s uterine lining thickens and sheds during her period if she\u2019s not pregnant. With endometriosis, that tissue thickens and bleeds, but it happens outside of the uterus \u2014 on the fallopian tubes, or even in the nose or lungs. Because the extra tissue has no way to exit the body (it can\u2019t go through the vagina since it\u2019s not growing in the uterus), it builds up and becomes trapped, leading to pain and, in some cases, infertility.\n\nThere\u2019s no cure for endometriosis. To manage symptoms, women are usually prescribed birth control or over-the-counter painkillers as a first-line approach, but they don\u2019t always work. In severe cases, a doctor may suggest \u201cexcision surgery\u201d to remove the extra tissue. (Dunham had eight surgeries and ended up getting a hysterectomy, which was considered an extreme measure.)\n\nEnter elagolix. Endometriosis is an estrogen-driven disease, and the drug works by lowering estrogen levels. Two large double-blind, placebo-control randomized trials, which 1,285 women completed, tested whether it can help women control endometriosis pain. The results, published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine, were impressive. The patients in those trials scored their pain from 0 (no pain) to 3 (severe pain). On average, they had pain levels of 2.2 out of 3 before starting on the drug \u2014 and they experienced a 2-point reduction in pain after taking the treatment for three months.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a major advance,\u201d said Dr. Louis DePaolo, head of the fertility and infertility branch at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, \u201cand another option women have that\u2019s effective.\u201d\n\nNow the less good news: The drug won\u2019t cure endometriosis; it\u2019ll only tamp down the pain it causes. Many women in the trial experienced the symptoms of menopause \u2014 hot flashes, headache, insomnia \u2014 and researchers have also found the drug causes bone loss. We have no idea about the long-term effects of taking the drug because there are no trials lasting for longer than a year, or how it stacks up against other painkillers (since the trials only compared it to placebo). That\u2019s not to mention cost: The drug\u2019s price is listed at $850 per month. But for some, the risks and costs may be worth it. Here\u2019s why.\n\nEndometriosis is incredibly common \u2014 but it can go undiagnosed for years\n\nEndometriosis is a chronic, sometimes highly disruptive condition. The three main ways it manifests are through pelvic pain, infertility, and pelvic masses such as cysts, scar tissue, and fibroids. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, some important signs of endometriosis include:\n\u2022 Pain before and during periods\n\nBut many women don\u2019t know they have endometriosis. It\u2019s sometimes mistaken or dismissed for regular period pain. Definitively diagnosing the disorder requires invasive surgery; doctors need to peer inside the pelvis through a laparoscopy. (Imaging is rarely helpful in getting a clear diagnosis.) This involves making a small incision in the belly and inserting a tube with a tiny camera to see if the pelvic organs show signs of tissue scarring and buildup. So it\u2019s no surprise it takes between three and 11 years after the onset of symptoms to diagnose endometriosis.\n\nDoctors aren\u2019t sure why some women get it\n\nAdding to the mystery around endometriosis: No one knows exactly what causes it, but doctors have some theories.\n\u2022 Retrograde menstrual flow: During a period, when a woman is shedding her uterine lining, some of that tissue can flow through her fallopian tubes and into her pelvis, which researchers think may cause endometriosis. But doctors have also found that the rate of retrograde menstruation is about the same in women with and without endometriosis, so they think additional factors spur the disorder in some.\n\u2022 Genes: The disorder runs in families, so doctors believe there\u2019s a genetic component. If a woman\u2019s mom or sister had endometriosis, the woman is believed to be at a higher risk.\n\u2022 Somatic mutations: Researchers are also finding that somatic mutations \u2014 acquired changes to DNA that happen after a person is born \u2014 may also be an endometriosis driver.\n\u2022 Immune system dysfunction: Problems with the immune system can hamper a woman\u2019s ability to clear her menstrual debris, leading to endometriosis.\n\u2022 Environmental factors: There\u2019s some evidence to suggest environmental exposures to certain chemicals may contribute to one\u2019s risk of developing endometriosis.\n\nThe treatments available don\u2019t always help, and some have severe side effects\n\nWhen birth control pills or over-the-counter painkillers fail to help endometriosis pain, women are often left choosing between a monthly injection called Lupron Depot, which can put women into a profoundly menopausal state, or Danazol, a male hormone that often causes acne and facial hair growth.\n\nIn women for whom these drugs aren\u2019t effective, or who don\u2019t want to take medications, surgery to remove the displaced endometrial tissue can be a highly effective option. But the trouble with surgery is that endometriosis can recur, so women may need more surgeries. The success of surgery also depends on finding a skilled and experienced surgeon, and there\u2019s always the risk of surgical complications.\n\nThe new drug elagolix is not risk-free, either. In the trials, women who took the drug had greater bone loss than did those who received placebo, and this wasn\u2019t entirely surprising. Like other endometriosis treatments, the drug works by lowering estrogen levels (since endometriosis needs estrogen to grow). When that happens, women experience menopausal side effects. The most common in the trials were hot flashes, headaches, and insomnia. (Elagolix is available in two doses \u2014 150 mg per day, or 200 mg twice daily \u2014 and the women on the higher dose experienced the side effects more frequently.) Mood swings and night sweats were less common, and one woman in the trial died by suicide (though there\u2019s no indication that the medicine was a cause of her death).\n\nDePaolo pointed out, \u201c[Elagolix] doesn\u2019t have the pronounced side effects some of the other compounds have.\u201d That\u2019s because, he said, it doesn\u2019t drive down estrogen levels as severely.\n\nBut for patients who have tried other estrogen-lowering medicines, elagolix isn\u2019t all that appealing. \u201cThis drug is palliative in nature. It does not cure or shrink the disease,\u201d Casey Berna, director of programs and partnerships for the advocacy group EndoWhat. The drug\u2019s side effects also concerned her, as did the lack of knowledge about its long-term impact.\n\nFor other women, though, the trade offs may be worth it.

Results from the first of three key clinical trials could arrive by year's end.\n\nScientists are cautious: In a hunt spanning two decades, no one has found a medication to help treat cocaine addiction, and there's no guarantee that modafinil will pan out.\n\nBut for Dr. Nora Volkow, director of NIH's National Institute on Drug Abuse, the narcolepsy medicine tops the list of promising potential therapies. It may help restore proper function of a crucial brain chemical, dopamine, that addiction hijacks.\n\nAnd in describing why he's hopeful, one leading researcher recounts the man who accused his drug dealer of selling bad coke before realizing modafinil had kept him from getting high _ and several other modafinil testers who told of flushing cocaine down the toilet.\n\n\"I've been treating cocaine-addicted patients for something like 25 years, more, and I've never heard of anybody throwing away cocaine,\" says Dr. Charles Dackis of the University of Pennsylvania, who led a pilot study that suggested modafinil more than doubled addicts' chances of going cocaine-free for at least three weeks.\n\nThat study enrolled just 62 people, but the results were significant enough for NIH to fund new research _ at Pennsylvania, the University of Texas in Houston, Boston University and other sites _ enrolling about 650 cocaine users to see if modafinil really does work.\n\nThe main side effect so far: insomnia, not surprising as modafinil is sold today to help narcolepsy patients fend off that neurologic disease's sudden sleep attacks.\n\nAddiction specialists gave it a look because even though modafinil isn't a classic stimulant, it triggered something in the brain to also improve patients' mood, energy levels and ability to concentrate _ effects that might counter cocaine withdrawal. Then came the surprises:\n\n_Cocaine intensely stimulates the brain's pleasure centers, producing not just a \"buzz\" or a \"rush,\" but outright euphoria. In a small safety study to ensure that modafinil didn't make cocaine worse, some users found the once-a-day pill blocked that high. \"We didn't expect that at all,\" Dackis says.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No real evidence of disease mongering.

The low-cost approach, grounded in psychological theories of pain, could help address the nation's epidemic of addictions to opioid painkillers and illicit drugs.\n\nVeterans who received this pain-focused care while also being treated for addiction found that the intensity of their pain decreased, their ability to function increased, and their alcohol use went down, compared to veterans who received a less-focused approach. However, the two groups had similar rates of drug use.\n\nJust 10 weekly sessions of the approach, called ImPAT for Improving Pain during Addiction Treatment, had an effect that lasted up to a year in 55 veterans who took part, according to the new results published in the journal Addiction by a team from the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System's Center for Clinical Management Research and University of Michigan Medical School's Addiction Center.\n\nThe researchers have already launched a follow-up study in a larger group of 480 non-veterans in a residential addiction treatment program. And the study's authors note that the ImPAT approach has the potential to be easily and inexpensively adopted by addiction treatment centers and groups worldwide, through team members trained in standard psychological techniques.\n\n\"These results highlight the need for addiction treatment programs to offer a multifaceted approach that doesn't only address substance use but also the other factors that might be driving substance use, including pain,\" says Mark Ilgen, Ph.D., the study's lead author and a VA and U-M psychologist specializing in addiction research. \"We've shown that it's possible to improve pain outcomes in people with addiction, and even have some spillover effects on their substance use.\"\n\nAddiction treatment programs often have patients who suffer from chronic pain, but offer few options to treat them, Ilgen says.\n\nTo make matters worse, \"Past studies of psychosocial approaches for pain have often excluded people with drug or alcohol problems, addiction treatment programs do not usually have providers trained in pain care, and many pain specialists will not treat people who also have addiction. So patients are caught in the middle.\"\n\nAll 129 patients in the study, most of them men in their 40s and 50s, were receiving outpatient addiction treatment in a CBT-based, non-abstinence setting at the Ann Arbor VA. Half were randomly assigned to ImPAT sessions, the other half to support groups of peers, led by a therapist, where pain and addiction could be discussed.\n\nImPAT combines elements of cognitive behavioral therapy with another psychosocial approach called acceptance and commitment therapy.\n\nWhile the two approaches aren't usually used together, they are often used in pain treatment settings - but those clinics and programs don't often accept people who also acknowledge they have addiction issues. Ilgen and his colleagues hope their results will help bring the techniques into addiction treatment settings, where the cognitive behavioral therapy approach is often used.\n\nThe ImPAT technique seeks to use integrated approaches both to help patients focus less on their pain and more on other aspects of life. This includes techniques to help people adapt to their pain, find ways to distract themselves from their pain, and think of ways to function in the face of pain.\n\n\"We want to take the focus off pain and put it onto functioning, and finding pleasurable ways to spend time,\" Ilgen says. \"There's also a strong link between depression and pain. Pain is responsive to mood, and mood is responsive to social support.\"\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the new paper, another addiction and pain specialist, William C. Becker, Ph.D. of Yale University and the Connecticut VA, notes that the new results are even more impressive because ImPAT was compared with another psychosocial approach.\n\nThe newly published study did show that one in five veterans randomly assigned to ImPAT or the comparison approach did not actually attend any sessions - likely because of delays in getting the sessions going. The larger ongoing study, based in an abstinence-based treatment facility in Michigan and funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, has largely avoided that issue by decreasing the delay between study recruitment and the start of the treatment groups, Ilgen says.\n\nThe study in veterans was planned just before the rapid rise in, and increased awareness of, opioid painkiller addiction issues in the U.S. While opioid addiction was one of the issues faced by veterans in the study, most had issues with multiple substances.\n\nThe sharp rise in opioid addiction in recent years - often among people who started taking the painkillers as treatment for acute or chronic pain -- has made the search for effective non-drug pain treatment options even more urgent, Ilgen notes.\n\n\"Long-term use of opioids can sometimes lead to a hypersensitivity to pain, so there may actually be a causal link between use of these medications and pain,\" he notes. \"We need to study psychological pain management approaches in opioid-dependent patients, including those receiving addiction therapies such as buprenorphine.\"\n\nIn the meantime, he notes, people struggling with addiction who want to seek relief from pain should explore the full range of treatment options that have been shown to work in non-addicted patients, including physical therapy, exercise and psychotherapy as well as antidepressant medications. And while existing prescription guidelines do not explicitly prohibit the use of opioid painkillers in people with pain who have substance use disorders, these guidelines recommend only using opioids sparingly and under close supervision, he says.\n\nIn addition to Ilgen, an associate professor in the U-M Department of Psychiatry and member of the U-M Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, the study team included Addiction Center director Frederic Blow, Ph.D., as well as Amy S. B. Bohnert, Ph.D., Stephen Chermack, Ph.D., Carly Conran, Mary Jannausch, M.S., and Jodie Trafton. Blow, Bohnert and Chermack are all members of the VA CCMR and IHPI.

On fertile days, users must abstain from sex or use other protection such as condoms to prevent pregnancy. The app was approved as a class IIb medical device by T\u00fcv S\u00fcd, a notified body in Sweden where it is based.\n\nBut sexual health organisations are warning that being classed as a medical device does not guarantee that the app will effectively prevent pregnancy. Sexual health charity the FPA, Fertility UK, and the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists are jointly calling for more large-scale independent trials to ensure that evidence for such apps is on a par with other rigorously tested methods of contraception.\n\nNatural Cycles is one of numerous apps that help women practise a method of contraception called natural family planning, also known as the fertility awareness method.\n\n\n\nNatural family planning involves monitoring your body for signs of ovulation, like an increase in your temperature, or a change in cervical mucus.\n\n\"The thing about the female egg is that it only lives for about 24 hours. So if you could reliably know when you've ovulated as a woman, and then you give that egg two or three days to die, any time after that in the cycle you will not get pregnant because there's no egg to fertilise,\" Dr Susan Walker, a senior lecturer in sexual health at Anglia Ruskin University, told BuzzFeed News.\n\n\n\nTaking your temperature is what sets Natural Cycles and other apps like it apart from standard period-tracking apps. Without temperature information an app can can guess at your ovulation day based on your average cycle length, but can't be sure when you actually have ovulated, and so you can't use it as a reliable form of birth control.\n\nYou don't actually need an app to practise natural family planning \u2013 although it does cut down on paperwork. Even so, the FPA advises that natural family planning is most effective if you\u2019re taught how to do it by a specialist teacher, and you monitor all three fertility indicators \u2013 temperature, menstrual cycle length, and cervical secretions.\n\nBut natural family planning is not for everyone. For starters, it can only protect against pregnancy, not STIs.\n\nAnd if you're considering ditching the Pill because remembering to take it each day is too much effort, you probably won't like having to remember to take your temperature every morning.\n\n\"You really have to commit to it, whether you're doing it the traditional way or you're using an app. You have to take your temperature every morning and record that, because without all that data it's not really any use to you,\" Bekki Burbidge, head of communications at the FPA, told BuzzFeed News. \"It's not a method that's going to suit everybody.\"\n\nBut for women like Natural Cycles co-founder Dr Elina Berglund, who want an alternative to hormonal contraception, it's an option worth pursuing. Along with her husband and co-founder Dr Raoul Scherwitzl, Berglund created the algorithm used in the app for personal use, before deciding it was something she should share with the rest of the world.\n\n\"When it comes to contraception it's all about choice. It's not like one solution will fit all women,\" said Berglund.\n\n\"Our typical user is in a stable relationship a few years before wanting to have kids. At first she starts to use the app to prevent pregnancy, and when she's ready [to get pregnant] she switches to plan, and usually she gets pregnant quite quickly, because the app already knows her body and cycle.\"\n\n\n\nTo use the app, you need a monthly or yearly subscription, and a thermometer that you have to use to take your temperature each morning before you get out of bed.\n\n\n\nThe app then tells you if you're likely to be fertile or not that day.

The sensitivity may also trigger or exacerbate headaches.\n\nWhile sunglasses can provide some relief from photophobia, wearing them all the time is not always a practical solution, nor is it pleasant for patients to live in a dark room for days at a time. A new study from the University of Cincinnati (UC), published online this week in the Journal of Athletic Training, assessed the use of colored lenses in post-concussion patients and found wearing certain color-tinted sunglasses may be a good alternative to dark sunglasses.\n\n\"While sunglasses can provide some relief, they are not very practical indoors or in low light environments,\" says Joe Clark, PhD, professor in the Department of Neurology and Rehabilitation Medicine at the UC College of Medicine and lead author of the study. \"What is needed is a light mitigation strategy that can be readily employed indoors, which can optimize relief in those who suffer from photophobia, or light sensitivity.\"\n\nClark and researchers at the College of Medicine assessed visual symptoms of 51 concussion patients and used frames with varying colored lenses to find out if certain hues provided relief from photophobia.\n\n\"We found that 85 percent of patients reporting photophobia had relief of the symptoms with one or more colors-- blue, green, red and purple--with no reported adverse events,\" Clark says.\n\n\"Sensitivity to light can be common and impact activities of daily life suggesting that light mitigation might improve quality of life in many of these patients.

Fenfluramine was taken off the market in 1997 after being linked to potentially life-threatening heart valve problems.

And children who play sports are nearly three times more likely to suffer sudden cardiac death than their nonathletic counterparts.\n\n\"Few of the kids actually experience sudden death while they're in class or at home,\" says Thomas Debauche, a Houston cardiologist. \"It's pretty much while they're in training or while they're on the field performing, because that's when the adrenalin is flowing,\" and that's when they're calling on the heart for peak performance.\n\nThese surprise attacks are due to inherited problems that children are born with. Cardiologist Douglas Zipes, past president of the American Academy of Cardiology, says the problems kids suffer are typically electrical, like abnormal heart rhythms, or structural, like a thickening of the heart muscle. Both of these problems are exacerbated during exertion when kids play sports.\n\nAccording to Zipes, \"The adrenalin that is released when you're participating [in sports] can stimulate this abnormally thick heart muscle and cause a fatal heart rhythm problem, that is a very rapid heartbeat with no effective contraction, no blood being ejected to the brain and other organs.\" The result is sudden cardiac death.\n\nTypically, schools require kids to provide a family history and have a simple physical exam before participating in sports. But Zipes says more should be done.\n\nCardiologist Debauche agrees. He recently screened more than 2,000 high school athletes in the Houston area, using electrocardiogram, or EKG, to measure the electrical activity of the heart.\n\nAbout 10 percent of the students had an abnormal EKG. One of them was Louis Anthony, who suffered from asthma. In severe cases, asthma can cause the heart to thicken and put kids at risk of cardiomyopathy and sudden death. Anthony's asthma diminished over time, and he says he can still play soccer, run fast and breathe \"just fine.\"\n\nAfter the abnormal EKG result, however, Debauche told Anthony and his parents to closely monitor the asthma. They have.\n\nFor other students who had abnormal EKG results, some received medication for blood pressure and others were treated for abnormal heart rhythms. About 1 percent were told it was too dangerous for them to continue in sports.\n\nThree students had serious heart problems, including one who suffered from a rare disease in which the heart muscle is spongy and contracts poorly.\n\n\"He was literally running the stadium stairs at the time we found him,\" Debauche says. \"He was preparing for track season by running up and down the stadium stairs.\"\n\nDebauche says the heart screening turned out to be life-saving for this student athlete.

They're gaining more acceptance.\"\n\nBefore the FDA action, pain-relieving patches were available in the United States only by prescription, said Dr. John Dombrowski, director of the Washington Pain Center in Washington, D.C. Their active ingredients include such medications as lidocaine, capsaicin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. The active ingredients in Salonpas are methyl salicylate and menthol, common components of pain-relieving gels and creams, such as Bengay.\n\nPain patches have a number of benefits, Rosenquist and Dombrowski said, not the least of which is convenience. With a patch, you \"put [it] on and forget about it, rather than having to remember to take pills,\" Dombrowski said.\n\nThe patches also deliver their medicine directly to the site of a person's pain. This may eliminate some of the side effects that come with taking pills. For instance, some analgesics are likely to cause an upset stomach unless they're taken with food. \"Obviously, patches get around that,\" he said. \"It's a very clever way of getting the medications right where they need to be.\"\n\nAnd, because patches release their medication slowly into the body through the skin, people also should get more consistent pain relief than they do with pills.\n\nOn the other hand, people have to be sure to carefully follow instructions for using the patches, to avoid overdose.\n\nThe main downside to pain patches, however, apparently comes from their effect on the skin. Some people may find themselves allergic to either the active ingredient in a patch or the adhesive used to keep the patch on the body.\n\n\"You need to pay attention when you put them on, to see if you have any kind of skin reaction to the compounds that are contained in the patch,\" Rosenquist said.\n\nBoth doctors said that they expect more over-the-counter pain patches to hit the market if the popularity of Salonpas continues to grow. Future over-the-counter options, they predicted, could include reduced-dosage versions of the NSAID-delivering patches now available through prescription.\n\n\"Success begets success,\" Dombrowski said. \"If this does very well, other drug companies will say, 'I want a piece of this action.'\"\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more about pain.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story may lead the reader to think minor aches deserve treatment with a medication when, in fact, they might not benefit from any medication.

In the eight-week trial, researchers found significant reductions in signs of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein and other blood markers.\n\n\u201cCurcumin is the active ingredient of the famous spice turmeric and has a long history of culinary and medicinal use in the Asian countries,\u201d said the study\u2019s senior author Amirhossein Sahebkar.\n\n\u201cTwo key effects of curcumin that account for most of the therapeutic effects of this compound are its strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties,\u201d said Sahebkar researcher at the Mashhad University of Medical Sciences in Iran, in an email.\n\nThese properties of curcumin have been shown in several animal studies, he noted, but there have been relatively few studies in people. So his team designed a randomized controlled clinical trial to see if short-term use of a curcumin supplement could reduce inflammation in people with metabolic syndrome, a cluster of risk factors for heart disease.\n\nHaving a large waistline, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, low levels of HDL (good) cholesterol and high levels of triglycerides, are among the factors that make up metabolic syndrome. People with three or more of these classic traits are at higher than average risk of developing heart disease or diabetes or both.\n\nInflammation is also emerging as a feature of metabolic syndrome, Sahebkar\u2019s team writes in the journal Clinical Nutrition. They set out to see if curcumin supplements could at least roll back that risk factor by enrolling 117 participants who had been diagnosed with metabolic syndrome for their study.\n\nHalf were given pills containing one gram of curcumin powder, and the other half were given similar looking pills with no curcumin inside. All the participants took the supplements every day for eight weeks.\n\nAt the beginning of the study and again at the end, the researchers measured levels of three blood markers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein (CRP), which even on its own has been linked with heart disease risk.\n\nThey found that the people who took curcumin had improved blood levels of all three biomarkers as well as reduced fasting blood sugar and hemoglobin A1c, a measure of long-term blood sugar levels. The comparison group had higher glucose and levels of one of the inflammation markers, and no changes in the other markers.\n\nThe study team also analyzed data from eight previous studies and confirmed that curcumin had shown a significant reduction of CRP concentrations in a total of 281 patients.\n\n\u201cThe findings of our studies, along with clinical findings reported by other groups, indicate the usefulness of daily use of curcumin supplement for the prevention and treatment of several diseases,\u201d Sahebkar said.\n\nThe researchers didn\u2019t examine the effect of curcumin on any diseases, and it was a fairly brief study, so it\u2019s not clear what the long-term implications may be they caution in their report.\n\nThe study was funded by the Clinical Trial Research Center in Tehran and the Iran National Science Foundation. One of the authors is CEO of Sabinsa Corporation and Sami Labs Ltd, manufacturers of curcumin supplements.\n\nSahebkar said most of the clinical benefits reported for curcumin have been achieved when curcumin was added to a standard drug therapy regimen, and patients should be careful not to replace their prescribed drugs with curcumin without prior consultation with their physician.\n\n\u201cCurcumin is a very safe natural supplement, and there is no severe adverse event associated with its use, even at high doses,\u201d Sahebkar said.\n\nHowever, owing to limited safety information, pregnant and lactating women should avoid using this supplement, Sahebkar said.\n\n\u201cIn addition, patients with malabsorption syndrome, gall bladder problems, gastric ulcer, bleeding problems as well as those who are undergoing surgery, and those who have a history of hypersensitivity to herbal products should be cautious and consult with their physician before taking this supplement,\u201d Sahebkar said.\n\nSahebkar added that he is often asked about the possibility of using turmeric instead of pure curcumin supplements.\n\n\u201cWhilst turmeric is known to have several medicinal properties, and its regular use in diet is strongly suggested, it cannot be regarded as an equivalent substitution of curcumin,\u201d he said.\n\nSahebkar said turmeric contains very low quantities of curcumin, usually less than 5 percent, and curcumin has a very low absorption in its raw form, usually less than one percent of raw curcumin is absorbed when taken orally.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story makes clear that inflammation is a risk factor for heart disease, rather than equating it to heart disease.

This is the first product in its class (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors) approved to treat this type of cancer.\n\n\"Tecentriq provides these patients with a new therapy targeting the PD-L1 pathway,\" said Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \"Products that block PD-1/PD-L1 interactions are part of an evolving story about the relationship between the body's immune system and its interaction with cancer cells.\"\n\nTecentriq targets the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway (proteins found on the body's immune cells and some cancer cells). By blocking these interactions, Tecentriq may help the body's immune system fight cancer cells. Tecentriq is the first FDA-approved PD-L1 inhibitor and the latest in the broader class of PD-1/PD-L1 targeted biologics approved by the FDA in the last two years.\n\nTecentriq is approved for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma whose disease has worsened during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or within 12 months of receiving platinum-containing chemotherapy, either before (neoadjuvant) or after (adjuvant) surgical treatment. Urothelial carcinoma is the most common type of bladder cancer and occurs in the urinary tract system, involving the bladder and related organs. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) estimates 76,960 new cases of bladder cancer and 16,390 deaths from the disease in 2016.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Tecentriq were studied in a single-arm clinical trial involving 310 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. This trial measured the percentage of patients who experienced complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors (objective response rate). The study also looked at the difference in effect based on \"positive\" versus \"negative\" expression of the PD-L1 protein on patients' tumor-infiltrating immune cells. In all patients, 14.8 percent of participants experienced at least a partial shrinkage of their tumors, an effect that lasted from more than 2.1 to more than 13.8 months at the time of the response analysis. In patients who were classified as \"positive\" for PD-L1 expression, 26 percent of participants experienced a tumor response (compared to 9.5 percent of participants who were classified as \"negative\" for PD-L1 expression).\n\nWhile patients who received Tecentriq experienced a tumor response across the study, the greater effect in those who were classified as \"positive\" for PD-L1 expression suggests that the level of PD-L1 expression in tumor-infiltrating immune cells may help identify patients who are more likely to respond to treatment with Tecentriq. Therefore, today the FDA also approved the Ventana PD-L1 (SP142) assay to detect PD-L1 protein expression levels on patients' tumor-infiltrating immune cells and help physicians determine which patients may benefit most from treatment with Tecentriq.\n\nThe most common side effects of treatment with Tencentriq were fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, urinary tract infection, fever (pyrexia) and constipation. Tencentriq also has the potential to cause infection and serious side effects that result from the immune system effect of Tencentriq (known as \"immune-mediated side effects\"). These severe immune-mediated side effects involve healthy organs, including the lung, colon and endocrine system.\n\nThe FDA granted the Tecentriq application breakthrough therapy designation, priority review status and accelerated approval for this indication. These are distinct programs intended to facilitate and expedite the development and review of certain new drugs in light of their potential to benefit patients with serious or life-threatening conditions.\n\nTecentriq is marketed by Genentech based in San Francisco, California.

You're missing out on a lot of stuff other children can have. I always want to try peanut stuff.\"\n\nMom Monica Glover said the family discovered Ellis' peanut allergy when she was about 3. The tipoff: a skin reaction around her mouth after she was given food with a small amount of peanuts in it. \"We were lucky to have discovered it that way. That was a mild reaction,\" Glover said, and a doctor confirmed the allergy through tests.\n\nThe discovery was \"distressing,\" Glover said. Accidental exposure to peanuts has happened, resulting in \"severe stomach cramps and vomiting,\" she said. \"Essentially, we have to live in fear all the time of Ellis being inadvertently exposed to peanuts and having a reaction that is potentially life-threatening.\"\n\nGlover seized the opportunity to participate in a study on the safety and effectiveness of an experimental treatment that could give her daughter protection against accidental exposure to peanuts. Despite the risk, it was \"a gift,\" she said, adding that her family hoped their efforts might help \"lots of other children.\"\n\nThe risk paid off: Two-thirds of the kids in the study were able to eat the equivalent of two peanuts without any symptoms after following the months-long experimental treatment regimen, the researchers found.\n\nEllis is one of the majority of children for whom the treatment works. \"It's been a huge success,\" her mother said.\n\n\"It does not make the allergy to go away,\" Vickery said. \"The purpose is not to get them to be no longer peanut allergic and allow them to eat whatever they want.\"\n\n\"I'm telling patients when I see them that my hope is that patients will have access by late next summer, something like that,\" Vickery said. He added that although the study proved the treatment's effectiveness and safety only in children, adults would probably benefit in the same way.\n\nTo test the experimental therapy, 66 research centers in 10 countries recruited 551 participants who ranged in age from 4 to 55 and who all had a peanut allergy. Most -- 499 participants -- were between the ages of 4 and 17.\n\n\"We were extremely well-informed about the entire process,\" Glover said. \"You start at a super low dose and work your way up. You take it at the hospital under observation. Then, you take it at home every day. \"\n\nThree-quarters of the study participants were given the treatment in increasing amounts every two weeks until reaching maintenance, when they received the equivalent of one peanut daily. The remainder of the participants were given a placebo. At the conclusion of the study after a year, all of the participants faced an \"exit food challenge\": They ate, under a doctor's supervision, the equivalent of two peanuts.\n\nTwo-thirds of the treatment participants were able to tolerate this exit dose without a severe reaction. Half tolerated even twice that amount: a four-peanut dose.\n\nOverall, participants experienced fewer side effects during the study than the researchers had anticipated. \"It's intuitive that that process would trigger some allergic symptoms in many patients,\" Vickery said. A third completed the study with no more than mild side effects, such as stomachache.\n\nEllis experienced stomach cramps and vomiting multiple times during the study, usually on days when her dose was increased to raise her tolerance. \"Having stomach cramps did not feel very good,\" she said. Still, she usually vomited, and the cramps passed quickly.\n\nOnce, she felt her throat constrict, and \"it was harder for me to breathe,\" she said. She'd gone into anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction. The hospital staff reacted immediately and gave her a shot of epinephrine. \"I felt safe with all the doctors and nurses around me. They can help you get through it,\" she said.\n\nA little more than 11% of the children dropped out of the study due to severe side effects. Among children receiving the treatment, 10% required rescue epinephrine during the exit challenge, compared with 53% in the placebo group.\n\n\"These treatments really have the potential to transform people's lives,\" Vickery said, \"and I have seen it happen firsthand: the sense of relief [families] get when a child becomes desensitized.\"\n\nTrying to be 'bite safe'\n\n\"It's what a lot of families call trying to be 'bite safe.' it's not that you're curing the allergy; it's not that you're going to be able to eat peanut butter sandwiches,\" said Sicherer, who was not involved in the study. \"It's really just to have a better threshold so that if you accidentally ate something that had a little bit of peanut in it, maybe you wouldn't have a reaction or the reaction wouldn't be so bad.\"\n\nThough the immunotherapy treatment is simply a matter of gradually increasing your tolerance to peanuts, you could have a severe reaction at home. \"This is not something to try at home,\" Sicherer said.\n\nAimmune has made peanut into a \"pharmaceutical-grade\" product, he said. \"Most people think of it as medicinalized food.\" Doctors and patients both know exactly how much you're getting, he said, \"and that's important because if you're reactive to, say, a 50th of a peanut, you don't want to have a mistake where you're suddenly getting a 10th of peanut.\"\n\nAssuming the treatment wins FDA approval, Sicherer said, the conversation between doctors and patients will be, \"Is it better to just avoid the food and ask a lot of questions at restaurants and be real careful, or do something like this and still don't eat the food and ask the questions in the restaurant, but at least know you have a bit of a safety valve?\"\n\nThere are more than a few caveats when it comes to the treatment regimen. For one, it's \"a commitment,\" he said. You cannot take a dose before exercising, and you can't skip doses, or you might have a severe reaction when you pick it up again.\n\nGlover noted, \"It's somewhat disruptive. You have to do it every day. Generally, we would take it after dinner.\" After giving the medicine, she added, parents must carefully monitor their children, preventing them from becoming too active or too hot.\n\nSicherer said, \"The family that does this really, really, really has to be a rule follower. It's not easy.\" It would still be worth it to many, he said.\n\nIf this ends up being the first approved treatment, if it is covered by insurance and if details of whom it works for best were all worked out and the risks and benefits were clear, \"that would be so amazing, because we haven't really had anything like that before,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not everything we would hope for, but it's still fantastic to be able to raise someone's threshold from a teeny tiny amount of peanut to a couple of peanuts or more,\" said Sicherer, who believes that other allergy products will be developed in time: \"I can tell my patients that this might be the right thing for them, but if not, we're looking at things that might be easier and better down the road.\"\n\nGlover acknowledges that \"it's not a perfect solution. I would say it's been some work to go through this study, just in terms of a time commitment.\" Still, if it had taken twice the amount of time, she would have done it: \"It's peace of mind.\"\n\nEven though she dislikes the medicine's taste, Ellis also believes it is worth it. \"It's definitely better,\" she would say to another kid with peanut allergy: \"You know you can be around your friends when they have peanut butter on them.\"", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story appropriately characterizes peanut allergy as a \u201cpotentially life-threatening\u201d condition, with peanut ingestion.

Lam, from the department of ophthalmology and visual sciences and Institute of Chinese Medicine at the Joint Shantou International Eye Center of Shantou University and Chinese University of Hong Kong, and his colleagues report their observations in the December issue of the Archives of Ophthalmology.\n\nIn the search for a better option than patch therapy, Lam and his associates set out to explore the potential benefits of acupuncture, noting that it has been used to treat dry eye and myopia.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2009, Lam and his colleagues recruited 88 children between the ages of 7 and 12 who had been diagnosed with anisometropia.\n\nAbout half the children were treated five times a week with acupuncture, targeting five specific acupuncture needle insertion points (located at the top of the head and the eyebrow region, as well as the legs and hands). The other half were given two hours a day of patch therapy, combined with a minimum of one hour per day of near-vision exercises such as reading.\n\nAfter about four months of treatment, the research team found that overall visual acuity improved markedly more among the acupuncture group relative to the patch group. In fact, they noted that while lazy eye was successfully treated in nearly 42 percent of the acupuncture patients, that figure dropped to less than 17 percent among the patch patients.\n\nNeither treatment prompted significant side effects, the authors said.\n\nThe team nonetheless pointed out that their study's tracking period was relatively short, and that acupuncture is a complicated system that may lend itself to different success rates, depending on the skills of the particular acupuncturist.\n\nAnd while theorizing that the apparent success of this alternative approach may have something to do with stimulating blood flow, retinal nerve growth and visual cortex activity, the authors acknowledged that the exact mechanism by which it works remains poorly understood.\n\nDr. Richard Bensinger, a Seattle-based ophthalmologist and spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, said that the finding is \"certainly suggestive and worth following up.\"\n\n\"This is kind of cool,\" he said. \"But I will say that I don't know of any study looking at acupuncture and vision. There are studies based on symptomatic things such as pain, and I think there's pretty good evidence that it does have benefit in that respect. But for vision therapy this is the first I've heard of it, and I don't know that anyone has ever tried this before. So this is like a teaser.\"\n\n\"Of course people in those parts of the country, like where I live, where there's fairly wide acceptance of alternative medicine might receive this type of treatment better than others,\" Bensinger cautioned. \"And no question patients will gravitate towards treatments that are covered by their insurance even if it's not the best treatment. And as an alternative approach, this may not be covered.\"\n\n\"But if it works,\" he added, \"people will certainly be excited -- although it certainly needs further testing and further studies to decide if it's really beneficial or not.\"\n\nFor his part, Dr. Stanley Chang, chairman of the ophthalmology department at Columbia University in New York City, did not seem to hold out much promise for acupuncture's potential as an alternative lazy eye therapy.\n\n\"Acupuncture I think definitely works for pain amelioration, but I'm not sure it works for some of these other things,\" he cautioned. \"They've tried it for the treatment of myopia and glaucoma, without much success. And so although there haven't been any really good trials comparing acupuncture with conventional therapies, my guess is that it's probably not going to do much for the treatment of lazy eye.\"\n\n\"However, I think it's worth considering or trying,\" Chang added, \"because nothing else seems to work very well for patients of that age, including patch therapy. But what will need is a very carefully controlled study that accounts for all the variables that might have an impact on the outcome of this approach.\"\n\nFor more on amblyopia, visit the National Eye Institute.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story repeats statistics provided in the study regarding the worldwide prevalence of amblyopia.\u00a0These figures do not appear to overstate or exaggerate the impact of amblyopia.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Feb. 1, 2012 -- A new drug appears to be effective for shrinking uterine fibroids and controlling the heavy menstrual bleeding they often cause, according to new research from Europe.\n\nIn one study, the drug ulipristal acetate proved to be much more effective than a placebo for shrinking the non-malignant uterine tumors.\n\nIn another, ulipristal acetate was found to be as effective as monthly injections of the drug Lupron for reducing heavy bleeding in women with uterine fibroids.\n\nBoth studies appear in the Feb. 2 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nUlipristal acetate is the active chemical in the emergency contraceptive sold in the U.S. as Ella, but the daily doses taken by the fibroid patients in the studies were much smaller than those in the contraceptive.\n\nIf trials now under way in the U.S. prove positive, New Jersey-based Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Swiss-based PregLem hope to market ulipristal acetate as a fibroid treatment under the trade name Esmya, says Watson spokesman Charlie Mayr.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering.

Johnson VA Medical Center\n\nN-acetylcysteine, when combined with group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), reduced symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), cravings, and depression significantly more than CBT alone in veterans with co-occurring PTSD and substance use disorder, a particularly difficult-to-treat population, according to the findings of a randomized controlled pilot trial conducted by researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) and the Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center.\n\nThis trial is the first to use NAC as a pharmacotherapy for PTSD and a broad range of SUDs. The results were published online ahead of print on October 11, 2016 by the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry.\n\nThe National Center for PTSD estimates that seven to eight percent of Americans will have PTSD at some point in their life. The numbers are even worse for veterans: it is estimated, for example, that 30 percent of Vietnam veterans will have experienced PTSD at some point in their life. Approximately 40 to 50 percent of veterans with PTSD also have a substance use disorder (SUD).\n\n\"Addiction goes along with virtually every psychiatric disorder at a higher percentage than it does in the general population\" said Peter W. Kalivas, Ph.D. the senior author on the article and chair of the Department of Neuroscience at MUSC. \"People who are prone to psychiatric disorders are also prone to addiction.\"\n\nCurrently, there are no well-explored pharmacological treatments for patients with co-occurring PTSD/SUD. Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been approved by the FDA for treatment of PTSD, pharmacological treatments for co-occurring PTSD/SUD have yielded suboptimal results.\n\nGroundbreaking basic science research by Kalivas has shown that levels of glutamate transporters are decreased in SUDs and that administration of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine can help restore those levels and guard against relapse in animal models of SUD. Because evidence suggests that SUDs and PTSD share overlapping neurobiological pathways, Sudie E. Back, Ph.D., lead author on the article, hypothesized that NAC treatment with CBT would be a novel approach to treat co-occurring PTSD and SUD. Back is a professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at MUSC and a staff psychologist at the Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center.\n\nIn the eight-week randomized controlled trial led by Back and Kalivas, 35 veterans with PTSD and SUD, all of whom were receiving cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for their SUD, were randomized to either 2400 mg/day of NAC or placebo. The average age of the veterans was 49 years and many were veterans of the Vietnam War. To be included, veterans had to have abstained from substance use for at least seven days. Of the veterans enrolled in the trial, 83% completed it, a very high rate for this difficult-to-treat population.\n\nVeterans in the NAC-treated group showed a 46% reduction in PTSD symptoms, compared with a 25% reduction in the placebo group on the Clinical-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), which assesses trauma history and symptom severity. The threshold CAPS score for diagnosis of PTSD is 50.\n\n\"As a group, the NAC-treated veterans were below diagnostic level for PTSD at the end of treatment,\" said Back. \"For PTSD, these are some of the best outcomes we have seen in the literature for a medication.\"\n\nCraving and depression were also reduced in the NAC-treated group. The amount of craving was reduced by 81% and the frequency of craving by 71% in the NAC group, compared with 32% and 29% in the placebo group. \"Craving is a key component of substance use in relapse,\" said Back. \"If you have a medication that can really reduce craving, that will go a long way to helping people stay clean and sober.\" Depression, gauged using the Beck Depression Inventory, was reduced 48% in the NAC group vs. 15% in the placebo group.\n\nVeterans in the study had low rates of substance use during the trial, and the study found little effect of medication on use, perhaps due to the fact that all participants were receiving SUD treatment and exhibiting low levels of use. This finding could also be due to the relatively limited number of participants or to the chronic nature of the participants' PTSD. \"This is a tough patient population with SUD to work with.\" said Kalivas. \"We have Vietnam vets that have had PTSD for 15 to 20 years. This is not an easy-to-turn-around population.\"\n\nAlthough these early, promising findings show that NAC reduced PTSD symptoms, craving, and depression, NAC should not be used as a monotherapy or substitute for evidence-based behavioral treatment, but instead be seen as an adjunct therapy that enhances it.\n\n\"We would not advocate using it instead of therapy,\" said Back. \"But this could be something to help prevent relapse when used alongside a behavioral treatment.\"\n\nNAC is available over the counter and does not cause side effects at the doses used in the study, but it degrades quickly when stored, is contraindicated in patients with asthma, and can cause nausea at higher doses and so should always be obtained and administered under a physician's supervision.\n\nThe next steps in Back's research are to run a longer-term trial of NAC in veterans with PTSD and SUD and to use MRS magnetic spectroscopy to better explore the effect of NAC on glutamate levels in patients with PTSD and SUD.\n\nFounded in 1824 in Charleston, The Medical University of South Carolina is the oldest medical school in the South.

It's designed to treat people with a lung disease called cystic fibrosis. While not quite a cure, the drug is extremely effective for some CF patients.\n\nBut the success of Kalydeco has been more than two decades in the making.\n\nA good starting point for the story is Aug. 24, 1989. That's the day scientists from the U.S. and Canada announced the discovery of the gene associated with the disease. It was the early days of gene hunting, and the CF gene was a big prize.\n\nCF is the most common genetic disease in Caucasians. When people inherit a damaged form of the CF gene, a critical protein inside cells doesn't work properly. As a result, sticky mucus builds up in a patient's lungs, causing infections and making it hard to breathe.\n\nThe announcement was supposed to be made in conjunction with three papers in the Sept. 8 issue of Science, but a reporter for Reuters got hold of the story early. Science took the unusual step of allowing the scientists to speak to the media before publication.\n\nAt the time, scientists predicted that a genetic test for CF was just around the corner. But they also thought a drug to treat the disease was in reach.\n\nThe first prediction turned out to be right. \"But it wasn't until 20 years later that we were able to find drugs that directly target the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis,\" says Fred Van Goor, who led the team at what is now Vertex Pharmaceuticals that developed Kalydeco. \"So it was a long time between the discovery of the gene and the discovery of Kalyedco.\"\n\nIt took awhile to find a drug that would help restore the function of the protein the CF gene makes. \"We tested over 600,000 chemicals in cells with the defective protein that causes cystic fibrosis,\" says Van Goor.\n\nOne of those chemicals ultimately became a successful drug, but it had to be modified so patients could take it by mouth, and so it would last the right length of time in a patient's body.\n\nFrom the start, Van Goor and his colleagues knew there was a problem with Kalydeco: It only works on a small subset of people with CF. They have to have a particular mutation in the CF gene, or the drug is of little use.\n\nBut for people who do have that mutation, the drug works remarkably well.\n\nEmily Schaller was in one of the early studies of Kalydeco. As part of the study, researchers first gave her a placebo, then switched her to the active drug. She knew within days that something was different.\n\n\"I was with my brother in Florida, and we were walking down the street, and I took a deep breath, and when I took a deep breath in and I let it out, I didn't cough,\" says Schaller. \"But not only did I not cough, but I felt that my lungs were clear, and that something huge had happened. It was just something I had never felt in my life before.\"\n\nSchaller isn't cured. She still has a damaged CF gene. The only way to fix that would be gene therapy, where a healthy form of the gene would supplant the damaged one. Although it seems simple in theory, in practice gene therapy has been incredibly difficult to accomplish.\n\nSchaller isn't particularly bothered by that. \"Everyone talks about curing a disease \u2014 cure CF, cure these other diseases. [But] Kalydeco controls CF at the basic defect, so I'm OK with the other 'c' word, control, because I'm living it and I've never felt better in my life.\"\n\nThe time from gene discovery to successful drug may be shortening, but there are only a handful of successful drugs so far, and for a while at least, the appearance of new ones will be slow.\n\nThey're also likely to be expensive.

(Aug. 22, 2017) - A study led by researchers at Cedars-Sinai and NeuroVision Imaging LLC provides the scientific basis for using noninvasive eye imaging to detect the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's. The experimental technology, developed by Cedars-Sinai and NeuroVision, scans the retina using techniques that can identify beta-amyloid protein deposits that mirror those in the brain.\n\nAccumulations of neurotoxic beta-amyloid protein can be detected with positron emission tomography, or PET scans, and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid, but these are invasive, inconvenient and costly, making them impractical for routine screening and follow-up evaluation.\n\n\"This is the first study demonstrating the potential to image and quantify retinal findings related to beta-amyloid plaques noninvasively in living patients using a retinal scan with high resolution. This clinical trial is reinforced by an in-depth exploration of the accumulation of beta-amyloid in the retina of Alzheimer's patients versus matched controls, and a comparison analysis between retina and brain pathologies. Findings from this study strongly suggest that retinal imaging can serve as a surrogate biomarker to investigate and monitor Alzheimer's disease,\" said Maya Koronyo-Hamaoui, Ph.D., an associate professor of Neurosurgery and Biomedical Sciences and a research scientist at the Maxine Dunitz Neurosurgical Institute at Cedars-Sinai, and a co-founder, inventor and scientist at NeuroVision. She is the senior leading author of an article in JCI Insight published online Aug. 17.\n\n\"As a developmental outgrowth of the central nervous system that shares many of the brain's characteristics, the retina may offer a unique opportunity for us to easily and conveniently detect and monitor Alzheimer's disease,\" said Keith L. Black, M.D., chairman of NeuroVision, chair of the Department of Neurosurgery and director of the Maxine Dunitz Neurosurgical Institute at Cedars-Sinai. \"We know that Alzheimer's begins as many as 10 or 20 years before cognitive decline becomes evident, and we believe that potential treatments may be more effective if they can be started early in the process. Therefore, screening and early detection may be crucial to our efforts to turn the tide against the growing threat of this devastating disease.\"\n\nSteven Verdooner, NeuroVision CEO, said the imaging system leverages the company's expertise in autofluorescence imaging of the retina using a specialized ophthalmic camera and sophisticated image processing software. \"It's exciting to see these studies demonstrating the power of the technology applied to the Alzheimer's field. Our goal is to develop a product that is easy to use, affordable and widely accessible. We look forward to the potential of retinal imaging playing a vital role in solving the problem of Alzheimer's, both in identifying and monitoring those who may be affected by the disease.

They also provide detailed analyses and several new findings on Alzheimer's pathology in the retina, results of research with donated eyes and brains of 37 deceased patients, 23 with confirmed Alzheimer's disease and 14 controls.\n\nAmong key findings, the researchers report a 4.7-fold increase in retinal plaque burden in patients with Alzheimer's, compared to controls, and they provide observations regarding geometric distribution and layer location of amyloid pathology in the retina. With the imaging technology's ability to detect autofluorescence signal related to retinal beta-amyloid, these findings may lead to a practical approach for large-scale identification of the at-risk population and monitoring of Alzheimer's, the researchers say.\n\nThe article provides new insights into the disease's manifestations in the retina and information on the optical imaging system. Here are several highlights:\n\u2022 The first histologic quantitative analysis of retinal plaque clusters, or \"hot spots,\" containing the most toxic forms of beta-amyloid with specific distribution patterns in superior peripheral regions that were previously unexplored.\n\u2022 The first report of certain Alzheimer's-related pathologies in the retina, including vascular amyloid pathology.\n\u2022 The demonstration of a significant correlation between retinal and brain plaques, and coexistence of neuronal loss.\n\u2022 The first feasibility study for noninvasively detecting presumed amyloid deposits in retinas of living patients.\n\u2022 The demonstration of a fully automated calculation quantifying retinal autofluorescence that showed a 2.1-fold increase in patients with Alzheimer's, compared with controls.\n\nResearchers from NeuroVision, Cedars-Sinai, the Doheny Eye Institute, Retina Vitreous Associates Medical Group, Retinal Consultants Medical Group, Sutter Neuroscience Institute, UCLA, Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, Veterans Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, and the University of Southern California contributed to the research and article.

The fact that it\u2019s not licensed for this has definitely kept doctors away.\u201d\n\nFor example, on Solvay Pharmaceutical\u2019s Web site for Omacor, www.solvay-omacor.com, the first question a user sees is, \u201cAre you a U.S. citizen?\u201d\n\nIf the answer is yes, the user is sent to a page where heart attacks are not mentioned. (In the United States, Omacor is licensed only to treat the small number of people with extremely high blood triglyceride levels.)\n\nSo community doctors do not learn how to use the drug. Lack of F.D.A. approval also means that insurers will not pay for treatment with Omacor. Approval from the agency for the use of the drug in heart disease is not expected soon.\n\nA study published last month in The Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine found that only 17 percent of family doctors were likely to prescribe fish oil to their patients, including patients who had suffered a heart attack. There was a great need, the authors concluded, to \u201cimprove awareness of this important advice.\u201d\n\nThe fact that fish oil is also sold as a nutritional supplement has made it harder for some doctors to regard it as a powerful drug, experts said.\n\n\u201cUsing this medicine is very popular here in Italy, I think partly because so many cardiologists in this country participated in the studies and were aware of the results,\u201d said Dr. Maria Franzosi, a researcher at the Mario Negri Institute in Milan. \u201cIn other countries, uptake may be harder because doctors think of it as just a dietary intervention.\u201d\n\nIn the largest study of fish oil \u2014 conducted more than a decade ago \u2014 Italian researchers from the Gissi Group (Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell\u2019Infarto), gave 11,000 patients one gram of prescription fish oil a day after heart attacks. After three years, the study found that the number of deaths was reduced by 20 percent and that the number of sudden deaths by 40 percent, compared with a control group.\n\nLater studies have continued to yield positive results, although some scientists say there are still gaps in knowledge.\n\nThis summer, a critical review of existing research in BMJ, The British Medical Journal, \u201ccast doubt over the size of the effect of these medications\u201d for the general population, said Dr. Roger Harrison, an author of the paper, \u201cbut still suggested that they might benefit some people as a treatment.\u201d\n\nDr. Harrison said he believed that people should generally increase their intake of omega-3 acids, best done by eating more fish.\n\nStill, he acknowledged that it was difficult to eat foods containing a gram of omega-3 acids each day. \u201cIf you ask me do I take omega-3 supplements every day, then, embarrassingly, the answer is yes,\u201d said Dr. Harrison, a professor at Bolton Primary Care Trust of the University of Manchester in England.\n\n\u201cI, too, am caught up in this hectic world where I have little time to shop and prepare the healthy foods I know I should be eating,\u201d he said.\n\nIt seems natural for Italy to be at the forefront of the fish oil trend and home to the largest clinical trials. Scientists have long noted that Mediterranean diets are salubrious for the heart and theorized that the high content of broiled and baked fish might be partly responsible.\n\nBut the landmark Gissi-Prevenzione trial of fish oil had methodological weaknesses: the patients treated with prescription fish oil pills were compared with untreated patients, rather than with patients given a dummy pill. This meant that, despite impressive results, the trial did not meet the F.D.A.\u2019s standards for approval. Yet by 2004, regulators in almost all European countries, including Spain, France and Britain, had approved Omacor for use in heart attack patients.\n\nMarylou Rowe, a spokeswoman for Reliant Pharmaceuticals, which owns the license for the drug in the United States, said that further trials of Omacor would be needed for it to be licensed for heart attack patients in the United States. But she refused to discuss a timetable.\n\nThe American College of Cardiology now advises patients with coronary artery disease to increase their consumption of omega-3 acids to one gram a day, but it does not specify if this should be achieved by eating fish or by taking capsules. But over-the-counter preparations of fish oil have much less rigorous quality control and are often blends of the two fish oils know to be beneficial in heart disease with other less useful fatty acids.\n\nFor that reason, Dr. Jacobson of Emory gives the prescription drug, \u201coff label,\u201d to cardiac patients, even though the F.D.A. has not approved it for that use. \u201cThen I know exactly what they\u2019re getting, and there is no mercury,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he tells patients who cannot afford the prescription version that they can take the over-the-counter supplements, although there is uncertainty about the dose and they probably need three to four pills a day.\n\nIn Europe, meanwhile, research on prescription fish oil, which is now thought to act by stabilizing cell membranes, has gained momentum.

Attacks can last anything from four to 72 hours.\n\nEach year more than 8.5 million people in the UK are thought to experience migraine \u2013 more than the number affected by asthma, diabetes and epilepsy combined.\n\nThe condition is linked to depression and sick days caused by migraine are estimated to cost the UK economy more than \u00a32bn per year.\n\nThe trial, called Strive, compared patients taking erenumab for six months with others given a non-active placebo dummy drug. \n\n\n\nThe research revealed that by months four to six, at least a 50% reduction in mean migraine days per month was achieved for just over 43% of patients injected under the skin with 70-mg of erenumab each month, while half of patients injected with the higher dose of 140-mg had such results. However, those given a placebo also saw benefits, with 26.6% of participants in this group experiencing such a reduction.\n\n\n\nLead investigator Prof Peter Goadsby, from King\u2019s College hospital, London, said: \u201cStrive \u2026 represents an incredibly important step forward for migraine understanding and migraine treatment.\u201d\n\nThe findings, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, clearly showed that blocking the CGRP pathway could reduce the impact of migraine, he said. \u201cThe results of Strive represent a real transition for migraine patients from poorly understood, re-purposed treatments, to a specific migraine-designed therapy.\u201d\n\nSimon Evans, chief executive of the charity Migraine Action, said: \u201cMigraine is too often trivialised as just a headache when, in reality, it can be a debilitating, chronic condition that can destroy lives.

They can often be found on sun-exposed areas of the body such as the face, scalp, arms, and legs.\n\nThe new gel, Picato (ingenol mebutate), is applied once daily for two or three days, depending on the area being treated. Other available topical treatments must be used for several weeks, and often irritate the skin. Cryotherapy, or freezing the affected skin area, is also used but can sometimes leave a scar.\n\nBecause the new gel is only used for a few days, any irritation is usually short-lived.

Could getting vaccinated be as easy as putting on a bandage? Could there be fewer, or at least smaller, needles in our future?\n\nSome companies and academic labs are working to make those things happen.\n\nThey're refining technologies that involve tiny needles, less than a millimeter long, and needle-free injectors that can send a dose of vaccine through your skin in a fraction of a second.\n\nSome of these technologies are already available on the market, while others are still being tested.\n\nA flu vaccine patch is not yet available to the public. But one version developed by Georgia Tech's Laboratory for Drug Delivery showed promising results in its first human clinical trial, according to a study published in The Lancet in June.\n\nThe patch, about the size of a small square bandage, has tiny, dissolvable needles filled with a dose of flu vaccine. It's placed on the arm and activated through pressure. The microneedles dissolve into the skin, releasing the vaccine.\n\nIn the study, 100 participants received either the flu vaccine patch, a standard flu shot or a placebo via a patch.\n\nSix months later, no one involved in the study had gotten the flu. People in the microneedle patch groups reported some redness, itching and tenderness but no serious side effects.\n\nPeople who received the flu patch had comparable immune responses to people who had gotten the flu shot.\n\nAbout 70 percent of the patients in the study preferred the patch to the regular shot, says Yasmine Gomaa, the lab's associate director.\n\nNow, Gomaa's lab is looking beyond the flu vaccine. She says the microneedle patch could be particularly helpful in developing countries because it uses a form of vaccines that doesn't need to be kept as cold as regular vaccines. It can be stored at temperatures as high as 104 degrees Fahrenheit for up to a year, she says.\n\nAnd the patch can be administered by people who aren't trained health professionals. A number of the people in the flu patch study applied it to themselves.\n\nIn 2015, Georgia Tech and the pharmaceutical company Micron Biomedical won $2.5 million in grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to develop a patch for polio immunization.\n\nGomaa's hope is that vaccine patches will cost less than vaccinations do now.\n\nA 2016 study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the use of vaccine patches could save on cooling costs and could cut down on waste. Its analysis concluded that a dose of measles vaccine with the patch would cost just under $1, while a typical shot would cost $1.65. But that didn't take into account the costs of getting the patch to market.\n\nThe potential cost savings wouldn't happen until the patches were in \"routine use,\" the CDC noted.\n\nOthers in the vaccine-delivery business are taking a different approach, using a new twist on a needle-free device called a jet injector that has been around for more than half a century.\n\nPortal Instruments, a company that is developing jet injectors, uses technology based on work done by Ian Hunter at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n\"Initially, we worked on microneedles,\" says the company's CEO Patrick Anquetil. \"And then Ian realized that why don't we just remove the needle altogether? And that's how this project came to be.\"\n\nNeedle-free jet injectors were actually used in the 1960s in mass smallpox vaccination campaigns. As described by the CDC, these devices use a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to penetrate the skin. The diameter of the stream is comparable to a mosquito bite.\n\nThe devices were used to quickly vaccinate large numbers of people, including members of the armed forces.\n\nAnquetil notes that the older devices sometimes made patients feel as if they had been punched.\n\n\"To create the jet, you have to instantaneously create 100 times more pressure than you've got in the tire of a car,\" he says. \"Patients actually hated them because they were more painful than a needle and syringe.\"\n\n\"My 85-year-old neighbor still remembers how painful it was,\" says Ron Lowy, CEO of PharmaJet, a company that makes an FDA-approved jet injector that administers a flu vaccine.\n\nThe older devices had another problem. They used the same nozzle for multiple injections, leading to concerns about the transmission of bloodborne pathogens between patients.\n\nToday's devices have made a lot of progress, Lowy says. Now, the syringe is changed for each patient and the injections are gentler.\n\n\"It feels like somebody snapped me with a rubber band,\" he says, adding that the injection happens too fast for some patients to register any sensation at all. It lasts about one-tenth of a second.\n\nHe says hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. have already received the flu vaccine via one of PharmaJet's injectors.\n\n\"If you have your choice, you want to get poked with a needle or you want to try this? Most of the people say, 'Yeah, I'll try that,' \" he says.\n\nCost remains an issue for some jet injectors. Portal is aiming to get its cost down to $3 or $4 per injection.\n\n\"In vaccines, what's really hard is that there's a very, very high volume, and you're competing with a needle and syringe, which is tremendously low cost,\" Anquetil says.\n\nPharmaJet says the ability to give precise doses helps to save money. The company says its flu vaccine \"starter kit,\" which can vaccinate 500 people, costs $900.\n\nFluMist, an FDA-approved flu vaccine delivered through a nasal spray, was widely used in the U.S. and, at one point, was even the preferred method of vaccination for children.\n\nThen last year, in a sharp turnaround, the CDC recommended that it not be used during the 2016-17 flu season after a study found it had not been very effective in the previous year, particularly among kids.\n\nThe vaccine's effectiveness was just 3 percent, so low that \"no protective benefit could be measured\" for children ages 2 to 17, the CDC said in a statement.\n\nIn contrast, the effectiveness of the flu shot was about 63 percent for kids in that age group.\n\nAstraZeneca, the parent company behind FluMist, says the CDC's data contradicts data from several other studies, which show the vaccine was about 48 percent effective during the same flu season. And the same vaccine continues to be recommended and used in European Union markets, AstraZeneca says.\n\nIn the U.S., the CDC continues to recommend against the nasal spray vaccine for the upcoming flu season. AstraZeneca hopes to reverse that decision before flu season begins.\n\n\"We continue to pursue a broad-based investigation to identify potential causes of lower effectiveness\" in recent years, the company said in a statement, adding that one of the four flu virus strains it used in the vaccine during the past two flu seasons may have been the problem.\n\nThe company has chosen a new strain of live virus that is similar to other strains that have proven effective in studies and clinical trials.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The headline \u201cBeyond the Nasty Needle\u201d seems over the top.\u00a0Still, it\u2019s true that some people are pathologically afraid of needles, and the rest of the headline and article don\u2019t approach the issue that dramatically.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "These children were more likely to be born to women who did not take folic acid. In the raw analysis, mothers who skipped the supplement were more than 2.1 times more likely to have a child with autistic disorder compared with mothers who took the supplement.\n\nAmong the 85,176 children in the study, 270 (or 0.32%) received an ASD diagnosis \u2013 114 (0.13%) had autistic disorder, 56 (0.07%) had Asperger syndrome and 100 (0.12%) were diagnosed with \u201cpervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified,\u201d or PPD-NOS.\n\nResearchers in Norway examined health records of more than 85,000 children born there between 1999 and 2009 to see whether they had some kind of autism diagnosis. They also looked at questionnaires completed by their mothers to see how much folic acid they were consuming in the month before they became pregnant and during the first eight weeks of pregnancy, a critical period of embryonic brain development. Health officials in Norway recommend that pregnant women (and women who are trying to get pregnant) take 400 micrograms of folic acid per day.\n\nMothers who took folic acid supplements around the time they became pregnant were less likely to have children with an autism spectrum disorder, a new study has found.\n\nBut not all mothers were equally likely to take folic acid supplements. Those who did were more likely to have attended college, to be nonsmokers, to be first-time mothers and to have planned their pregnancies. The researchers also found that the popularity of folic acid supplements rose as time went on. After the researchers controlled for factors like these, they calculated that taking the supplements was associated with a 39% lower risk of having a child with autistic disorder.\n\nThe raw numbers also showed that women who took extra folic acid were less likely to have kids with Asperger syndrome or PPD-NOS, but when other factors were taken into account, the association was no longer statistically significant and could have been due to chance, the researchers found.\n\nThe results were published in Wednesday\u2019s edition of the Journal of the American Medical Assn.\n\nThe study also looked at folic acid use later in pregnancy but found no correlation between that and the chances of a child developing an autism spectrum disorder. Nor did they find any link between fish oil supplements and risk of ASDs.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how these findings apply to mothers and children in the United States. Autism spectrum disorders are diagnosed much more frequently in the U.S. than in Norway.\n\nOn the other hand, pregnant women here are also far more likely to consume a healthy amount of the B vitamin because the Food and Drug Administration has required manufacturers of enriched breads, cereals and other grains to fortify them with folic acid since 1998. As a result, a cup of enriched white long-grain rice now contains 797 micrograms of folic acid, for example, and a cup of Cheerios has 493 mcg, according to this report from the Harvard Women\u2019s Health Watch.\n\nThe fact that autism cases have been on the rise in the U.S. even after folic acid supplementation became mandatory is a puzzle, according to three researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Division of Birth Defects and Developmental Disorders. In an editorial that accompanies the JAMA study, they write that the discrepancy \u201cmay be attributable to changes in diagnosis and surveillance but also may reflect a concurrent real increase in the risk of ASDs attributable to as-yet undescribed risk factors and exposures.\u201d They also note that data from the National Health Examination and Nutrition Survey published in 2009 show that the typical American consumes only 150 mcg of folic acid per day even with mandatory fortification.\n\nYou can read a summary of the study and the editorial on the JAMA website.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story mentions the puzzlement about why rates of autism appear to be rising in the US, thus giving readers a sense of how much remains unknown about potential causes or responses.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A study finds that use of virtual colonoscopy, a non-invasive way of scanning the colon for potentially cancerous growths, is on the rise.\n\nThat\u2019s a bit of a surprise, given that not all medical experts agree on whether the virtual screen is as reliable as a traditional colonoscopy, in which doctors insert a scope with a small camera into the colon. Plus, Medicare does not currently reimburse patients for routine screening with virtual colonoscopy, but does cover evaluations with colonoscopy. Add to that the aggressive public awareness campaign for colonoscopy screening led by celebrities like Katie Couric, who allowed TV cameras in as she got her first test, and it\u2019s clear why more people are familiar with the scope than with its virtual cousin.\n\nBut in spite of those challenges, Megan McHugh at the Health Research and Educational Trust in Chicago and her team report that about 17% of hospitals in the U.S. now offer the screening test, up from 13% in 2005.\n\nAs its name implies, virtual colonoscopy is way to survey the colon without actually using a scope. Patients lie in a CT scanner, which takes a series of pictures from a variety of different angles, and a computer compiles the snapshots in two different ways. The images can be viewed as two dimensional CT scans, which display any possible abnormalities protruding from the lining of the colon. Or, the images can be combined to generate a 3D view of the colon, allowing the doctors to \u201cfly through\u201d the organ looking for any suspicious growths or protrusions.\n\nThe prep for both the virtual and actual colonoscopy is the same \u2014 the dreaded \u201ccolon cleanse\u201d that many patients find is the worst part of the procedure. The night before the test, they start drinking clear liquids and take agents to loosen their stools and empty their colon so any remaining debris isn\u2019t mistaken for a tumor during the screen.\n\nWhile the virtual colonoscopy does not require the sedation and insertion of a scope that colonoscopy does, it involves exposure to a small amount of radiation. But according to Dr. Marc Gollub, director of CT and gastrointestinal radiology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, \u201cthe radiation is much lower than a regular CT scan and has not been proven to be of any risk. It\u2019s similar to [the exposure from cosmic radiation] you might get on a long airplane flight.\u201d\n\nWhile a growing body of data suggest that virtual colonoscopy is as sensitive as colonoscopy in picking up potential tumors, not all cancer experts agree that it\u2019s a good alternative to the gold-standard scope. While the American Cancer Society, the American College of Physicians and other gastroenterology experts recommend virtual screening every five years, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a congressionally mandated but non-federal, independent group of medical experts, concluded the evidence wasn\u2019t strong enough to justify Medicare coverage of the service.\n\nSo which one is right for you? Virtual colonoscopy is a good option for those who can\u2019t be sedated for colonoscopy, or who simply can\u2019t tolerate the scope. In McHugh\u2019s survey, hospitals reported that these patients make up the bulk of their use. And given the relatively low cost of investing in the software and other equipment required to run a virtual scan, more hospitals may be adding the option to their patient services. The virtual scan does involve radiation exposure, and if doctors find an abnormality that needs to be removed, you\u2019ll have to undergo a colonoscopy anyway (to avoid another colon cleanse, consider scheduling a colonoscopy on the same day in case tumors need to be removed). But Gollub notes that only about 8% of healthy adults getting regularly screened actually have tumors.\n\nGiven the fact that more hospitals are offering virtual colonoscopy, it\u2019s worth discussing with your doctor. In the end, it\u2019s a matter of personal preference \u2014 it\u2019s less important how you get screened, just that you do get screened.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No overt disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A study looked at the effects of weight-loss surgery on obese women most at risk for cancer. It found that bariatric surgery:\n\u2022 produced a mean weight loss of more than 100 pounds\n\nCHARLOTTESVILLE, Va., Oct. 1, 2015 - A study evaluating the effects of bariatric surgery on obese women most at risk for cancer has found that the weight-loss surgery slashed participants' weight by a third and eliminated precancerous uterine growths in those that had them. Other effects included improving patients' physical quality of life, improving their insulin levels and ability to use glucose - which may reduce their risk for diabetes - and even altering the composition of their gut bacteria.\n\nThe study speaks both to the benefits of bariatric surgery and to the tremendous toll obesity takes on health. \"If you look at cancers in women, about a fifth of all cancer deaths would be prevented if we had women at normal body weight in the U.S.,\" said Susan C. Modesitt, MD, of the University of Virginia Cancer Center. \"When you're looking at obesity-related cancers, the biggest one is endometrial cancer, but also colon cancer, breast cancer, renal cancer and gall bladder cancer. We think about 40 [percent] to 50 percent of all endometrial cancer, which is in the lining of the uterus, is caused by obesity.\"\n\nThe study looked at 71 women with a mean age of 44.2 years and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 50.9. Women are considered obese at a BMI of 30 and morbidly obese at 40 (which is typically about 100 pounds over a woman's ideal body weight), yet almost a third of women presenting for bariatric surgery did not identify themselves as obese.\n\nThe study looked at the effects of bariatric surgery in a relatively short timeframe, one to three years after surgery. A total of 68 participants underwent the procedure; two opted out of the surgery, and another died of a heart condition prior to surgery. The effects of surgery on body weight were dramatic: Mean weight loss was more than 100 pounds.\n\nTen percent of study participants who had not had a hysterectomy showed precancerous changes in the lining of the uterus, and all of those resolved with weight loss. \"We're talking about small numbers, really tiny numbers\" of study participants, Modesitt said, noting one limitation of the study. \"So I could never say that effect is definitive, but it is suggestive, given that we know already the incredibly strong link between endometrial cancer and obesity.\"\n\nModesitt, of the UVA's Division of Gynecologic Oncology in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, was most surprised by the dramatic changes seen in the patients' metabolic profiles derived from the gut microbiome, the population of microorganisms living inside us. \"The study results demonstrate that there is a huge alteration, but I don't even know what to say about that, except it is really new and intriguing area to look at in the link between obesity and cancer. For example, before groundbreaking work by Dr. John Marshall at UVA in the past, no one knew that ulcers were from bacteria. Who knows what role the gut bacteria play in promoting obesity, but metabolic parameter/markers of the bacteria definitely changed after [study participants] lost weight.\"\n\nWhile the study speaks to the transformative effect bariatric surgery can have, Modesitt urged people to avoid gaining weight in the first place and for those seeking to lose weight to exercise and eat more healthily before turning to surgery. \"We really should be working on diet and exercise from the get-go in our entire society, starting with our children. And exercise does seem to be protective -- even if you don't lose all the weight, it absolutely has beneficial effects,\" she said. \"There are lots of studies showing if you exercise, it improves your insulin, your glucose, all of those sorts of things that go along with the cancer-causing effect. Almost everybody agrees adding exercise would be wonderful and improve health on many levels.

But the researchers wanted to know if the drug, when combined with statin treatment, could also reduce the risk of heart disease in people with type 2 diabetes. People with type 2 diabetes are at high risk of cardiovascular-related events, such as heart attacks, stroke, and even death, often because their levels of triglycerides are so high, and their high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels are low.\n\nTo answer their question, the researchers followed 4,640 participants from the NHLBI-funded Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Lipid Study for five years after the conclusion of the trial in 2009.

The researchers say the optical attachment could be created by 3D-printing, and the device would only cost about $5.\n\nThe testing kit also includes a tiny weight scale that connects wirelessly to the testing app and measures the total number of sperm swimming in the sample.\n\nThe researchers tested the device on 350 clinical semen specimens in Massachusetts, including both trained and untrained users in their trial.\n\n\u201cThe accuracy of this approach was very similar to that of computer-assisted laboratory analysis, even when it was performed by untrained users with no clinical background,\u201d they wrote in the study.\n\nThe app is similar to a fitness tracker, in a sense, in that it stores any history of previous semen samples as well. The app\u2019s user experience is hard to forget: users can see vivid moving images of their sperm right on the screen.\n\nThough the system is in the prototyping stage, it could eventually shake up the world of fertility testing by allowing men to evaluate their sperm in their own homes and helping health centers with fewer resources offer easy, cheap testing.\n\nIn addition, the developers say it could also potentially be used by men who have had a vasectomy to monitor their progress at home following surgery.

Maybe his hay fever, too?\n\nHe went down to Mexico, bought 30 hookworms and let the larvae infect him.\n\nHookworm larvae are microscopic. But they have little spikes that puncture the skin and allow the larvae to burrow inside you. Then the critters head straight for a capillary.\n\n\"They basically ride your bloodstream back through your heart, into your lungs,\" where they hang out for a while, Velasquez-Manoff says.\n\nThen the larvae crawl out of the lung through your stomach and into the small intestine \u2014 where they bite onto the intestinal wall and start sucking blood \u2014 a few drops a day.\n\nAt that point, the worms do something amazing: They suppress the immune system, says P'ng Loke, an immunologist at the New York University School of Medicine.\n\n\"That's the really fascinating thing,\" he says. You see, the worms don't shut down the immune system completely \u2014 just enough so that the immune cells won't attack the worm.\n\nBut this can help with something else. It can keep the immune system from getting out of control and attacking the body.\n\n\"If you think about it, the worst thing that you want is an immune system that's out of control,\" Loke says.\n\nWhy? Because that's when you get autoimmune problems. So the hypothesis is that intestinal worms could possibly reverse these problems, by damping down the immune system.\n\nThe idea was so promising, that back in 2011 a pharmaceutical company decided to test it in clinical trials. Coronado Biosciences put together about six large studies.\n\nThe first study to finish was a big one in Europe that looked to see if pig whipworms helped with Crohn's disease.\n\nThe bottom line: \"The proportion of patients who improved with the worms was no different than the proportion of patients who were improved with placebo,\" says Dr. Stephen Hanauer at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, who was involved with one trial.\n\nThe whipworms were so ineffective at stopping Crohn's disease that Coronado canceled its other trials. The company's stock plummeted. And eventually the company changed its name and focus.\n\nOther trials with worms haven't gone so well either, says Hanauer. \"The controlled trials, thus far, in a variety of different diseases including childhood allergies and asthma have not been positive.\"\n\nIt's unclear why the worms haven't worked in these trials, Loke says. It could be that the whipworm larvae weren't prepared correctly. Or that the worms work for some people but not others. It may depend on a person's genes.\n\nBack in Berkeley, Velasquez-Manoff thought he might one of the lucky ones.\n\nA little while after he took the hookworms, his hay fever disappeared.\n\n\"Like just gone, gone, gone,\" he says.\n\n\"Then I had like, little bit of peach fuzzy hair growing here and there on my body,\" Velasquez-Manoff says.\n\nBut then the tide turned. \"Suddenly it's like one day, the whole thing reversed.\"\n\nHis hay fever came back. The hair didn't grow anymore.\n\nAnd having worms in his body wasn't pleasant. At first, he had diarrhea and cramps. That got better. But even months later, he still felt kind of bad.\n\n\"I never got back to feeling completely normal for that year [that the worms were inside],\" Velasquez-Manoff says.\n\nHe says the benefits of the worms definitely didn't outweigh the bad side effects. And he would never try treating his alopecia or hay fever with them again.\n\n\"The way I thought of it was, would I give this to my kids? And the answer is pretty easily and obviously: Hell no,\" Velasquez-Manoff says. \"I wouldn't want them to feel this way.\"", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The conditions listed are all real disorders, so the story doesn\u2019t disease monger.

And, for unknown reasons, the U.S. rate of preterm delivery has been going up in recent years.\n\nThat's why it's a pretty big deal that the Food and Drug Administration has OK'd a drug, called 17-HP, that experts say could make a dent in the preemie problem.\n\nNot a huge dent, but a significant one. The March of Dimes calculates that if all the women eligible to get the newly approved drug actually did, there would be 10,000 fewer preemies a year \u2013 out of more than half-a-million born that way.\n\n\"Although that may seem like a small percent, it's really a very extraordinary ability to impact on what is really a major public health problem,\" Dr. Alan Fleischman, the March of Dimes medical director, told Shots.\n\nAccording to the best research, the drug reduces the risk of premature birth by one-third among women who are at high risk because they had a previous preterm birth.\n\nThe drug is not for women whose prior premature births were of twins or other multiple births, or who are carrying more than one fetus in their current pregnancy. Nor is it for women who have other conditions that raise their risk of preterm birth, such as high blood pressure or infection.\n\nAnd even for the 30,000 or so women who are eligible, 17-HP, which will be marketed as Makena, isn't a magic bullet. The study showed that 37 percent of women who got weekly injections of it delivered prematurely, compared to 55 percent of women who got injections of a placebo.\n\nInterestingly, the drug is not new \u2014 it's just taken a long and circuitous route to approval.\n\nIn 1956, the FDA approved 17-HP for the treatment of certain cancers and other hormonal disorders, under the brand name Delalutin. But its manufacturer withdrew it from the market in 2000 \"for reasons unrelated to safety,\" as the FDA puts it.\n\nIn fact, as a Federal Register posting last year chronicled, there have been questions raised about whether 17-HP caused birth defects of various kinds. In the 1970s, the FDA required warnings on drugs containing progesterone, as 17-HP does, because of an increased risk of birth defects. They later revoked them.\n\nThe FDA is apparently satisfied that 17-HP is safe, but it's requiring its sponsors KV Pharmaceuticals and TherRx to conduct further studies of women who have taken it and children exposed during pregnancy.\n\nEveryone in this field is mindful of the long-running tragedy of vaginal and other cancers and male urinary disorders that resulted from the last drug thought to prevent premature birth \u2013 a synthetic estrogen called diethylstilbesterol, or DES. In 1971 researchers realized children exposed to DES in utero had a higher incidence of vaginal and breast cancers, and males were subsequently found to have urinary-tract problems.\n\nFleischman, the March of Dimes official, says there's no such risk from 17-HP, partly because it's not used before the 16th week of pregnancy, when fetal organs have already formed.\n\n\"We have been very aggressively tracking all the data,\" Fleischman says, \"and we have no reason to believe that this drug will increase birth defects.\"", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease-mongering of prematurity or its consequences.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Study: Honey better than drugs for kids' coughs For kids' coughs, silence is golden and sweet\n\nParents might consider giving their coughing child honey instead of medicine, according to a study released Monday.\n\nBuckwheat honey \u2014 a dark variety sold in most grocery stores \u2014 relieved children's coughs and helped them sleep better than dextromethorphan, the drug in most over-the-counter cough suppressants, according to a report published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended last month that children under the age of 6 not be given over-the-counter cough and cold medicines.\n\nFor the study, 105 children ages 2-18 with upper respiratory tract infections that kept them awake at night were given either a dose of buckwheat honey, honey-flavored cough syrup or no treatment half an hour before bedtime.\n\nOne dose measured one-half teaspoon for children aged 2-5, one teaspoon for children aged 6-11 and two teaspoons for children aged 12-18.\n\nParents of the 35 children who received honey, given either on its own or with a non-caffeinated drink, reported they coughed less and slept better than those who gave their children nothing. The group that used honey also reported more favorable results than those who used cough syrup, but since the study group was small, those differences weren't statistically significant.\n\nOne local pediatrician said she wouldn't discourage parents from trying honey with their children, but more studies are needed to draw solid conclusions.\n\n\"In older children, if it makes them comfortable and it helps them sleep at night, then there may be a potential benefit,\" said Dr. Sara Rizvi, assistant professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine who also works at a primary care clinic at Texas Children's Hospital. \"I would be reluctant to routinely recommend to all parents that they give honey, because in some rare cases children can have reactions to honey.\"\n\nPaul, a pediatrician who practices at Penn State Children's Hospital and teaches at the university's College of Medicine, said he began the study because he was frustrated no treatment had been proven beneficial to relieve the common children's cough.

Unlike older children, infants can't fight the bacteria.\n\nPaul's group tested buckwheat honey instead of the lighter, more popular varieties because it's known to have more antioxidant and antimicrobial effects, which have been shown in other studies to help wounds heal. Honey may suppress cough because its sweetness causes salivation that coats the throat, authors of the study suggested.\n\n\"It's kind of amazing that something so simple could be an answer,\" Paul said.\n\nThe study was paid for by the National Honey Board, an industry-funded agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Now Western doctors want proof that it works.\n\nThere is little dispute that people feel better after receiving the treatment, in which thin needles are inserted deeply into the skin at specific points on the body. But are they benefiting from acupuncture itself, or just getting a placebo effect?\n\nThe debate was fueled last week by a study in the journal Arthritis Care and Research. Researchers from MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston found that among 455 patients with painful knee arthritis, acupuncture delivered no more relief than a sham treatment.\n\nActually, patients got significant pain relief from both treatments \u2014 an average reduction of one point on a scale of 1 to 7. And critics contend that the study was poorly designed.\n\nFor one thing, they note, patients in both groups received treatment with needles and electrical stimulation; the main difference was that in the sham group, the needles were not inserted as deeply and the stimulation was far shorter in duration.\n\nIn the real world, however, a trained acupuncturist would customize the treatment to a patient\u2019s specific symptoms. But in this study, the patients in the \u201creal\u201d acupuncture group all received needles inserted in the same way.\n\nRather than proving that acupuncture does not work, in other words, the study may suggest that it works even when administered poorly. But the real lesson, acupuncture supporters say, is how difficult it can be to apply Western research standards to an ancient healing art.\n\n\u201cPeople argue that there really are no inactive acupuncture points \u2014 pretty much wherever you put a needle in the body is an active point,\u201d said Dr. Alex Moroz, a trained acupuncturist who directs the musculoskeletal rehabilitation program at New York University. \u201cThere is a body of literature that argues that the whole approach to studying acupuncture doesn\u2019t lend itself to the Western reductionist scientific method.\u201d\n\nBut the study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Maria E. Suarez-Almazor, notes that the sham treatment was developed with the help of trained acupuncturists. In a drug study, an equal response in the treatment and placebo groups would prove the drug does not work, she says.\n\n\u201cWe really worked with acupuncturists who are trained in the Chinese traditional style and asked them to come up with a sham that could be credible,\u201d Dr. Suarez-Almazor said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t plan a study trying to show that acupuncture didn\u2019t work. The results came out with no difference between the groups.\u201d\n\nThe MD Anderson research and other recent acupuncture studies have fueled speculation that the prick of a needle, whether from real acupuncture or a sham version, can influence the way the body processes and transmits pain signals. A 2007 study of 1,200 back-pain patients, financed by insurance companies in Germany, showed that about half the patients in both real and sham acupuncture groups had less pain after treatment, compared with only 27 percent of those receiving physical therapy or other traditional back care.\n\nWhen the German researchers tracked how much pain medicine the patients used, they detected a noticeable difference between real acupuncture and the sham treatment. Only 15 percent of patients in the acupuncture group required extra pain drugs, compared with 34 percent in the sham group. The group receiving conventional back therapy fared even worse than those receiving fake acupuncture: 59 percent of those patients needed extra pain pills.\n\nThe researchers, who published their findings in Archives of Internal Medicine, speculated that inserting needles in or around an area of pain may have caused a \u201csuper placebo\u201d effect, touching off a series of reactions that changed the way the body experienced pain.\n\nStill another study, this one financed by the National Institutes of Health and published in 2004, found that acupuncture significantly reduced pain and improved function in knee arthritis patients compared with a sham treatment or routine knee care.\n\nBut that result has been called into question because the patients in the sham group probably figured out they were not getting the real thing. They received only two needle insertions in the abdomen, while a needle was simply pressed along nine areas of the leg and taped to the skin to mimic acupuncture. A mock electrical stimulation machine whirred and blinked nearby, but didn\u2019t deliver any current to the body.\n\nThis year, researchers at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit solved the problem of creating a sham acupuncture treatment: they didn\u2019t have one. Instead, they compared acupuncture to a proven remedy \u2014 the drug Effexor, an antidepressant that has been shown to significantly reduce hot flashes in breast cancer patients.\n\nThe results were striking. Acupuncture relieved hot flashes just as well as Effexor, with fewer side effects. The acupuncture recipients reported more energy and even an increased sex drive, compared with women using Effexor.\n\n\u201cThere are some things you can\u2019t study the same way we do with drugs,\u201d said Dr. Eleanor M. Walker, director of breast radiation oncology at the Henry Ford Health System. \u201cThe thing that can\u2019t be argued in my study is the duration of the effect. It lasts, and the placebo effect doesn\u2019t last once you stop a treatment.\u201d\n\nBut acupuncture believers say it doesn\u2019t really matter whether Western scientific studies find that the treatment has a strong placebo effect. After all, the goal of what they call integrative medicine, which combines conventional and alternative treatments like acupuncture, is to harness the body\u2019s power to heal itself. It doesn\u2019t matter whether that power is stimulated by a placebo effect or by skillful placement of needles.\n\n\u201cIn general in integrative medicine, when patients are involved in their healing process, they have a tendency to do better,\u201d said Angela Johnson, a practitioner of Chinese medicine at Rush Children\u2019s Hospital in Chicago who is conducting a pilot study of acupuncture to relieve pain in children. \u201cI believe that\u2019s part of the reason why they get better.\u201d\n\nA version of this article appeared in print on August 24, 2010, on page D5 of the New York edition of The Times.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "      \n\n\n \n\n \nThe health conditions discussed in this article are vexing and real.

Major dietary sources of flavonoids include berries, apples, tea, red wine, chocolate , and citrus fruits.\n\nFeb. 14, 2011 -- Incorporating berries and other fruits in your diet may pay off by reducing the risk of Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nThe study, to be presented in April at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in Honolulu, looked at the relationship between flavonoid intake and Parkinson\u2019s disease in 49,281 men who participated in the Health Professional Follow-up Study and 80,336 women who participated in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study.\n\nThe participants were followed for 20-22 years and filled out questionnaires about the foods they ate.\n\nResearchers calculated total flavonoid intake based on the participants\u2019 consumption of five flavonoid-rich foods included on the questionnaires: tea, berries, apples, red wine, and oranges/orange juice.\n\nThe results showed that men who ate the most foods rich in flavonoids had a 35% lower risk of Parkinson\u2019s disease compared with those who ate the least. No link between overall flavonoid consumption and Parkinson\u2019s disease risk was found in women.\n\nBut when researchers looked at specific sub-groups of flavonoids, they found both men and women who ate the most foods rich in anthocyanins, which are found primarily in berries and apples, had a 22% lower risk of Parkinson\u2019s disease compared to those who ate the least.\n\nThe study doesn\u2019t prove that berries (or flavonoids in any other food) prevent Parkinson\u2019s disease. This was an observational study and therefore can\u2019t establish cause and effect. Nor is it clear why the results differed for men and women.\n\nThis study will be presented at a medical conference. The findings should be considered preliminary as they have not yet undergone the \"peer review\" process, in which outside experts scrutinize the data prior to publication in a medical journal.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There was no overt disease-mongering about Parkinson\u2019s disease in the story.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Last year, in an operating room at the University of Toronto, a 63-year-old woman with Alzheimer's disease experienced something she hadn't for 55 years: a memory of her 8-year-old self playing with her siblings on their family farm in Scotland. \n\n \n\n The woman is a patient of Dr. Andres Lozano, a neurosurgeon who is among a growing number of researchers studying the potential of deep brain stimulation to treat Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. If the approach pans out, it could provide options for patients with fading cognition and retrieve vanished memories.\n\nRight now, deep brain stimulation is used primarily to treat Parkinson's disease and tremor, for which it's approved by the Food and Drug Administration. DBS involves delivering electrical impulses to specific areas of the brain through implanted electrodes. The technique is also approved for obsessive-compulsive disorder and is being looked at for a number of other brain disorders, including depression, chronic pain and, as in Lozano's work, dementia.\n\nIn 2008, Lozano's group published a study in which an obese patient was treated with deep brain stimulation of the hypothalamus. Though no bigger than a pea, the hypothalamus is a crucial bit of brain involved in appetite regulation and other bodily essentials such as temperature control, sleep and circadian rhythms. It seemed like a reasonable target in trying to suppress excessive hunger. To the researcher's surprise, following stimulation the patient reported a sensation of deja vu. He also perceived feeling 20 years younger and recalled a memory of being in a park with friends, including an old girlfriend. With increasing voltages, his memories became more vivid, including remembering their clothes.\n\nUsing a 3-dimensional brain mapping technique called standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography, or sLORETA, Lozano's group uncovered an explanation for the unexpected findings. They found that stimulating the hypothalamus was in turn driving increased brain activity in the hippocampus, a key cog in the brain's memory circuitry. As Alzheimer's progresses, not only does the hypothalamus atrophy, but electrical communication between neurons in the region also gradually becomes impaired.\n\nThat our memories \u2014 so entwined with our personalities and senses of self \u2014 might be so vulnerable to a brown out is, existentially speaking, rather alarming. There's something palpably dehumanizing about reducing our past selves to the exchange of electricity between neurons, and also about retrieving memories by hot-wiring the brain.\n\nYet the prospect of the latter is undeniably intriguing. Given that Alzheimer's affects 1 in 9 people over the age of 65 and that current therapies are in many patients dismally ineffective, Lozano felt all but obligated to dig further. His group launched a test in six patients and published the results in the Annals of Neurology in 2010.\n\nThe study included patients with mild and severe disease who received stimulation in the fornix continuously for 1 year. \"The fornix is like the highway leading into the hippocampus,\" explains Lozano. \"It's easier to stimulate than the hippocampus itself and crucial to memory function.\" As expected those with more severe disease continued to mentally deteriorate, however it appeared that in those with mild disease, cognitive decline slowed with stimulation.\n\nNext, Lozano launched a randomized trial involving 42 patients from the US and Canada, all of whom had electrodes implanted in the fornix on both sides of the brain. In half the patients the stimulation was turned on right away. In the other half the stimulation wasn't turned on for a year, though they didn't know it.\n\nPreliminary results, published in December 2015 in the Journal of Neurosurgery, were mixed but encouraging.\n\nGiven that so few people have had electrical stimulation applied to memory circuits, perhaps the most significant finding was that both the surgery itself and DBS of the fornix appear safe. No serious long-term neurological side effects were seen in either patient group, supporting future research in the field.\n\nIn terms of efficacy, however, after one year there were no significant differences in cognition between the groups, as measured by two scales commonly used to measure Alzheimer's disease symptoms, the ADAS-Cog and CDR-SB. Alzheimer's tends to progress slowly and reversing or slowing the neurodegeneration associated with condition may take time to become noticeable. Lozano's final results won't be reported until four years out.\n\nMore intriguing for now were comparisons of glucose utilization. Glucose is our brains' primary fuel. The degree to which glucose is burned is a commonly used measure of brain activity. Patients with Alzheimer's typically have reduced glucose activity in their brains, as well as, again, shrinking memory circuits. The older patients in Lozano's study who had stimulation turned on exhibited markedly increased glucose use in the brain's memory regions. Not only that, the hippocampus of some study patients who received DBS actually increased in size.\n\nReversing withering hippocampi by encouraging the growth of new neurons is seen as a holy grail in Alzheimer's research, and Lozano's finding is supported by a recent animal study demonstrating that DBS in rats causes the release of growth factors that induce neuronal growth in the hippocampus.\n\nLozano acknowledges that retrieving childhood memories, which he says has occurred in about one-third of his patents \u2014 requires lofty voltages that he would be uncomfortable sending patients home on. Yet he's encouraged by the early findings that suggest the procedure is safe. \"We also know that in patients who receive stimulation there is an increase in glucose utilization in memory areas of the brain,\" he says, a finding that could mean there's a way to overcome some of the damage from Alzheimer's.\n\nEvidence supporting DBS in dementia is emerging from other research groups as well. A 2012 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that in seven patients receiving DBS to a brain region called the entorhinal cortex, spatial memory improved \u2013 meaning they could more easily remember the locations of newly learned landmarks. The entorhinal cortex works in concert with the hippocampus to solidify memories.\n\nA group at the University of Cologne in Germany is instead focusing on delivering DBS to a part of the brain called the nucleus basalis of Meynert, another region in which impaired neuron function is thought to contribute to Alzheimer's. Last year they published a study in Molecular Psychiatry in which four of six patients either remained cognitively stable or improved in response to DBS, as measured by the ADAS-cog. Like in Lozano's study no serious side effects were seen.\n\nDespite the mounting evidence for DBS, not everyone is convinced.\n\nReferring to Lozano's second clinical study, Dr. Nader Pouratian, a neurosurgeon and DBS researcher at UCLA, comments, \"The recent deep brain stimulation trial for Alzheimer's disease clearly demonstrates the safety of this approach for trying to treat the progression of disease. Unfortunately, [the findings] suggest that the therapy may not be as robust as initially proposed.\"\n\nHowever he acknowledges Lozano's results suggest that DBS to the fornix might be promising for a subgroup of patients, those being older people with less severe disease.\n\n\"The most promising areas are likely the fornix or the entorhinal area,\" he says. \"But I believe further studies are necessary to better elucidate the efficacy of this treatment before proceeding to a larger scale randomized trial.\"\n\nIn a 2008 episode of the medical television drama House, the show's main character Dr. Gregory House survives a bus crash that leaves his memory murky. In an attempt to remember the medical history of a fellow collision victim \u2013 and inspired by Lozano's initial paper \u2014 House voluntarily undergoes deep brain stimulation. Following the procedure the grouchy TV doctor's memory returns. As is customary on the show, he cracks the case.\n\nDBS for treatment of Alzheimer's and other dementias is a field in its infancy. Unlike on TV, in all likelihood it won't be widely used anytime soon to retrieve specific memories. \"Even though House did this, we're not doing it yet,\" cautions Lozano.\n\nYet the fact that the therapy can in some people rescue recollections \u2013 albeit random ones \u2013 and possibly induce new neuron growth in memory regions of the brain seems reason enough to pursue it further.\n\n\"We're hoping to use electricity to drive activity in areas of the brain involved in memory and cognition,\" says Lozano. \"We want to turn these brain networks back on.\"\n\nBret Stetka is a writer based in New York and an editorial director at Medscape.

But researchers say it can also improve vision in people with DME, a common form of diabetic retinopathy.\n\nThe study of 691 patients with DME found that 50 percent of those who received Lucentis eye injections, plus laser treatment if necessary, had substantial improvement in vision one year after treatment, compared with 28 percent of patients who received laser treatment alone. Results were similar after two years.\n\nFor 25 years, laser treatment has been the standard of care for DME, the main cause of vision loss in people with diabetes.\n\nThe study, published online in the journal Ophthalmology, was conducted by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research (DRCR) Network.\n\nAccording to the U.S. National Eye Institute, DME occurs when fluid leaks into the center of the macula, the portion of the eye dedicated to sharp, straight-ahead vision. The condition is common in people with diabetic retinopathy, which affects up to 45 percent of people with diabetes.\n\nThe results of the new study \"appear to be applicable to most people who have DME in the center of the macula with some vision loss, whether the person has type 1 or type 2 diabetes, is old or young, or is a woman or a man,\" Dr. Neil M.

Dr. Mark Pimentel of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles developed the tests.\n\n\"We now have a test to say, you have a disease,\" Pimentel told CBS News. \"Having a test like this shortens the time of suffering, it shortens the time of investigation and accelerates getting the patient directly to treatment.\"\n\nThe tests, which measure antibodies in the blood, were based on research suggesting that IBS may develop after infection from a bacterial toxin found in food poisoning.

Not only do we save lives, but we reduce the likelihood of needing more aggressive treatment,\" said study author Dr. Elisa Port. She directs the Dubin Breast Center at Mount Sinai and is chief of breast surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital, both in New York City.\n\nCurrently, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that biennial screenings start at age 50 for most women, while the American Cancer Society advises that annual screenings begin at age 45. Earlier guidelines had suggested annual screenings begin at age 40.\n\nPort noted that screening guidelines tend to be based on the ability of mammograms to save lives and how often they give a false positive result.\n\n\"But isn't there some benefit to getting tested earlier, like needing fewer lymph nodes removed and not needing chemotherapy? I think it's safe to say that most women, if they could be assured the same survival, would choose not to get more aggressive therapies,\" she said.\n\nPort's study included more than 1,100 women diagnosed with breast cancer at the Dubin Breast Center. All of the women were older than 40.\n\nThe women were separated into two groups. One group had a mammogram within the 24 months before their breast cancer diagnosis. The other group had a screening 25 months or more before their diagnosis. The second group also included women who had never had a mammogram.\n\nWomen in the second group were 50 percent more likely to need chemotherapy. They were also 32 percent more likely to need surgery to remove the whole breast (mastectomy), and 66 percent more likely to need lymph nodes removed. And the women who were screened earlier had smaller tumors.\n\nPort also looked at the 40- to 49-year-old age group, and found those who had never had a mammogram were much more likely to need chemotherapy. They were also more likely to have larger tumors (by 10 millimeters, on average) and to need a mastectomy than those in the 24 months or less group. But only 29 women fell into the \"never had a mammogram\" group.\n\nHowever, the study did not prove a cause-and-effect link between earlier mammograms and smaller tumors and less aggressive treatment.\n\nAnd Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, noted that this was an observational study that only looked at the experience of one institution.\n\nStill, \"the observations are consistent with what we have seen with the value of early detection.

George of the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, the lead author of the new study.\n\nThe biggest issue with studies so far, he explained, has been that it\u2019s tough to fake the sound and sensation of the real device in order to run a gold standard clinical trial in which some people get the treatment, and others get a sham treatment, no one knowing which.\n\nBut George and his team say they\u2019ve solved that problem by developing a dummy device that clicks in a similar way to the real thing and causes a person\u2019s eye muscles to twitch, just like real a TMS device.\n\nIn the May issue of the Archives of General Psychiatry, George and his colleagues report the results of their 190-patient study, the most rigorous investigation of TMS for depression so far. The researchers randomly assigned participants to receive 37.5 minutes of TMS delivered to a part of the brain region that plays a role in emotion, or 37.5 minutes of sham TMS, once a day for three weeks.\n\nAfter three weeks, 14 percent of patients in the real TMS group had recovered from their depression, compared to 5 percent of the sham TMS group; people who had the real treatment were four times as likely to get better as those who got the fake treatment.\n\nBased on the results, George and his team say, it would be necessary to treat 12 depressed patients with TMS in order to have one patient recover.\n\nEighty-eight percent of the study participants completed the first phase of the trial. Patients in both groups were equally likely to report side effects, which included headache, discomfort at the TMS site, and eye twitching.\n\nIn a second phase of the study, all patients were given the real TMS treatment. Thirty percent of the patients in the second phase recovered from depression.\n\nHow long the treatment should last is not yet clear. \u201cIt\u2019s very muddy now exactly how long we need to treat patients,\u201d George said. \u201cIt looks as if from this trial you at least need to try three weeks and maybe even six weeks before you would give up.\u201d\n\nPatients who got better were prescribed venlafaxine - marketed as Effexor \u2014 and a small dose of lithium, noted George, a combination that\u2019s been shown to help people stay well after their depression has remitted. George said he and his colleagues would like to study whether giving people TMS intermittently instead of putting them on antidepressants would produce equally durable effects.\n\nTMS works by producing an electrical current that can pass through the skull and into the target area of the brain. George said he believes the approach works by \u201cresetting\u201d electrical activity and restoring normal mood regulation.\n\nSomething similar is likely happening, he added, with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), or what is sometimes referred to as \u201celectroshock treatment.\u201d Sixty to 70 percent of depressed people who undergo ECT, in which electrodes placed on the front of the brain induce a convulsion while the patient is anesthetized, will recover.\n\nGeorge said he hopes that by better understanding where TMS should be delivered and by figuring out the best dose and duration of treatment, success rates closer to those of ECT might be achieved. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that it\u2019s pointing us in a path of understanding how to interact with the brain in a non-invasive way to get people well.\u201d", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "This story doesn\u2019t resort to disease-mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "FRIDAY, Dec. 7, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental antidepressant that targets the brain in a different way appears to both act fast and last long, researchers say.\n\nThe new drug -- called GLYX-13 -- is so far given in an intravenous form and was recently tested in patients who had not responded to other antidepressants. It began its work within hours and a single dose lasted about a week, Northwestern University researchers reported.\n\n\"We saw a robust, rapid-acting, long-lasting effect,\" said lead researcher Joseph Moskal, a research professor of biomedical engineering at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science and director of the school's Falk Center for Molecular Therapeutics. \"In addition, we have shown little or no side effects with our compound.\"\n\nOne expert said the drug might prove a valuable tool against depression.\n\n\"It sounds like an exciting development,\" Dr. Bryan Bruno, acting chair of psychiatry at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City said.

These include Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft and Lexapro. They work by improving levels of the hormone serotonin, which may be too low in people suffering from depression.\n\nAlthough SSRIs are effective in many people, not all respond to the same drugs and some people don't respond well.\n\nGLYX-13, the new drug, is still being studied and it isn't projected to be available before some time in 2016, Moskal said.

Given the results so far, he said, people won't need to take the drug every day, only once a week or less.\n\nThe GLYX-13 study is a phase 2 trial, which evaluates a drug's effectiveness while continuing to assess its safety.\n\nThe results were presented Thursday at the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology annual meeting in Hollywood, Fla.

An advantage is that the drug doesn't have the side effects of other drugs that target these same areas, such as hallucinations and schizophrenia-like symptoms, the researchers noted.\n\nMoskal's team developed a new way to target the brain's NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor to achieve these results. The clinical trial included about 120 patients, Moskal said. Patients were either given the drug or an inactive placebo.\n\nAntidepressant effects of the drug were seen within 24 hours and lasted an average of seven days. The effect of the drug was substantially better than seen with other antidepressants, the researchers found. The drug was so well received by patients that many who were in the trial have called asking to be in any further trials, Moskal said.\n\nA new trial that makes use of the drug in pill form is slated to get under way next year, Moskal noted.\n\nBecause the drug targets these areas of the brain it might also help people with other problems such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety and Alzheimer's disease, the researchers suggested.\n\nFor his part, Bruno cautioned that the long-term effects of the drug need to be studied before it can be used regularly in clinical practice.\n\nFindings presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nTo learn more about depression, visit the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story does not commit disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Omega-3s from fish pack a stronger punch than flaxseed and other oils when it comes to cancer prevention, according to a first-ever University of Guelph study.\n\nProf. David Ma has discovered that marine-based omega-3s are eight times more effective at inhibiting tumour development and growth.\n\n\"This study is the first to compare the cancer-fighting potency of plant- versus marine-derived omega-3s on breast tumour development,\" said the professor in the Department of Human Health and Nutritional Sciences. \"There is evidence that both omega-3s from plants and marine sources are protective against cancer and we wanted to determine which form is more effective.\"\n\nThere are three types of omega-3 fatty acids: a-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).

In Australia, it is the single leading cause of death in Australia, affecting 4.2 million Australians and killing one Australian every 12 minutes. Low-fat diets are often recommended as suitable food plans for those seeking to reduce their risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Similarly, the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) has been shown to deliver significant health benefits.\n\nIn this UniSA study, published by the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, researchers compared the health benefits of a MedDiet supplemented with two to three serves of dairy each day, and a generic low-fat diet.\n\nThe results show that the dairy-supplemented MedDiet (MedDairy) significantly improved blood pressure, heart rate, cholesterol, mood and cognitive function.\n\nPhD candidate Alexandra Wade says the new MedDairy diet challenges popular perceptions of what is considered healthy.\n\n\u201cThe MedDiet is fast earning a reputation as the world\u2019s healthiest diet and is renowned for delivering improved cardiovascular and cognitive health,\u201d Wade says.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s also higher in fat, which can be a deterrent for people seeking to adopt a healthier eating plan, especially if they don\u2019t realise the difference between healthy and unhealthy fats.\n\n\u201cIn Australia, low-fat diets are often recommended for improving heart health and they are still perceived as being healthy.\n\n\u201cThis study shows that the new MedDairy works better than a generic low-fat diet, ensuring better health outcomes for people at risk of cardiovascular disease.\u201d\n\nImportantly, the MedDairy diet also meets additional calcium requirements recommended by Australia\u2019s national health bodies.\n\nA typical MedDiet includes extra virgin olive oil, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, wholegrain breads, pastas and cereals, moderate consumption of fish and red wine, and low consumption of red meat, sweet and processed foods. It also includes 1-2 servings of dairy foods (700-820mg calcium), which is less than half the dairy recommended by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) for older Australians.\n\n\u201cLiving in Australia, we have different dietary requirements, notably a need for more calcium to protect against osteoporosis,\u201d Wade says.\n\n\u201cThese needs are unmet in the traditional MedDiet, which makes it difficult for people to adopt in the long term.\n\n\u201cThis study delivers healthier options for Australians by tailoring the nutrients in the MedDiet to meet the needs of a non-Mediterranean population.\n\n\u201cIn Australia, women up to age 50 years \u2013 and men up to age 70 years \u2013 should consume 1000mg per day of calcium per day and 1300mg thereafter, which is roughly between 3.5 and 4.5 serves a day.\n\n\u201cThe new MedDairy diet allows for three to four servings with dairy, which means Australians can more sustainably meet their recommended daily nutrient intakes while also maintaining the significant health benefits offered through the MedDiet.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes down to it, people want to be able to enjoy a colourful, tasty and nutritious diet.

However, a similar approach might work for some other mutations.\n\nDuchenne, which affects as many as 15,000 Americans, mainly boys and young men, is the most severe common form of muscular dystrophy, a disease made more prominent by years of Jerry Lewis telethons. Those with the disease make barely any dystrophin, a protein necessary for muscles to function. Patients typically lose the ability to walk as teenagers and die by age 30.\n\nWhile steroids, which reduce inflammation, can slow progression of the disease, they have undesirable side effects. Eteplirsen, which Sarepta says has shown no side effects so far, is vying with a similar drug being developed by GlaxoSmithKline to become the first medicine that works by directly countering the cause of the disease.\n\nEteplirsen could also be the first drug to reach the market for Sarepta since it was founded 32 years ago. It changed its name recently from AVI BioPharma to distance itself from its underachieving past.\n\nShares of Sarepta nearly tripled on Wednesday, closing at $44.93. And the stock had already roughly quadrupled since July, when Sarepta announced some interim results from the study.\n\nThe study measured how far the boys could walk in six minutes. Those who received the higher dose walked an average of 21 meters farther after 48 weeks of treatment than at the beginning of the trial, a gain of about 5 percent. The boys in the placebo group walked 68 fewer meters at the end than at the beginning, a decline of about 17 percent.\n\nOne possible reason for skepticism is that two of the boys on a lower dose of the drug rapidly lost the ability to walk, even though the level of dystrophin in their muscles increased substantially.\n\nWhile the company excluded those boys from its analysis as outliers, the Food and Drug Administration might not do so. That could make it harder for the Sarepta to win approval for the drug based only on this small trial, something the company hopes to do.\n\n\u201cIf you wait and require this company to do another two-year study, a lot of these boys are going to be in a wheelchair,\u201d Christopher Garabedian, the Sarepta chief executive, said in an interview.\n\nPatient groups may also put some pressure on the Food and Drug Administration to approve the drug quickly. But some also want Sarepta to make the drug available to more patients on a compassionate basis even before approval.\n\nTen-year-old Max Leclaire of Saxtons River, Vt., who has been receiving the highest dose in the trial, can now walk up stairs without having to pull himself up by the handrail, according to his mother, Jenn McNary. \u201cHe\u2019s no longer riding the handicap bus to school,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Ms. McNary said Sarepta had refused to provide the drug to Max\u2019s 13-year-old brother, Austin, who could not be in the trial because he already could not walk.\n\nMr. Garabedian said Sarepta did not have the money or the manufacturing capacity to make the drug available outside of clinical trials. \u201cThat would be the quickest path to insolvency,\u201d he said.\n\nIf eteplirsen gets to market, it would come nearly three decades after the 1986 discovery of the gene responsible for Duchenne. It would also represent a success, after decades of setbacks, for the technology eteplirsen uses, called antisense, which is a way of turning off specific genes.\n\nEteplirsen actually turns off just one part of the dystrophin gene, known as exon 51, which contains a mutation that in some patients stops production of dystrophin. By skipping over this exon, muscle cells can produce an imperfect form of dystrophin that nonetheless is at least partly functional.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering here", "answer": 1}, {"article": "SUNDAY, Aug. 29, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Most heart patients who take low-dose omega-3 fatty acid supplements don't appear to gain any additional protection against further cardiac trouble, new Dutch research cautions.\n\nIn fact, neither low doses of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which are found in fish oil, nor of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), derived from nuts and several vegetable oils, provided any benefit to the vast majority of heart patients, the study showed.\n\nThe scientists focused on patients who were already taking medications to control blood pressure, cholesterol and potential clotting. So, the researchers theorized that the poor performance of the supplements may simply reflect the overwhelming power of the medications.\n\nStudy author Daan Kromhout, from the division of human nutrition at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, is to present the findings Sunday at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Stockholm; the study will appear online in the New England Journal of Medicine simultaneously.\n\nIn the study, researchers focused on a group of more than 4,800 Dutch heart attack patients between the ages of 60 and 80, slightly more than three-quarters of whom were men.\n\nAll had experienced a heart attack at some point in the decade leading up to the study, and all were taking blood pressure medications, anti-clotting drugs and statins.\n\nAt the study's start, the patients were instructed to consume (over a period lasting a little over three years) one of four different types of margarines: one supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids; one supplemented with the plant-derived ALA; one supplemented with both omega-3 fatty acids and ALA; and one with no supplements.\n\nThe amount of supplementation added to the various margarines was deemed to be \"low-dose.\" During the study, the patients consumed an average of 18.8 grams of margarine per day, which meant ingestion of an average of 226 milligrams of EPA combined with 150 milligrams of DHA omega-3 fatty acids and/or 1.9 grams of ALA.\n\nBy the study's end, almost 14 percent of the heart attack patients had experienced another \"major cardiovascular event,\" with some cases ending in death.\n\nNone of the low-dose supplements seemed to stave off such events in most of the patients. One exception appeared to be among women ingesting ALA; researchers saw a 27 percent reduction in the risk for further cardiac complications, although that reduction did not quite reach statistical significance.\n\n\"The bottom-line finding of the Alpha Omega Trial is that [omega]-3 fatty acids did not reduce the primary endpoint major cardiovascular events,\" Kromhout said, noting that the ALA finding needs further confirmation.\n\nDr. Murray A. Mittleman, director of the cardiovascular epidemiology research unit at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said he was \"not that surprised by these results.\"\n\n\"Other studies have shown no benefit from omega-3, other than specifically protecting against cardiac death linked to arrhythmia among patients who have just survived a heart attack,\" Mittleman noted. It is during this acute post-attack period, he explained, when patients are most vulnerable to a subsequent event.\n\n\"But here, in some cases the patients they looked at are years following their first heart attack when they start taking these supplements,\" he stressed. \"So, that's a big difference in what kind of patient they're examining. And they're also not just looking at preventable fatalities but all heart-related events that follow. And on top of that, the supplement doses they use here are very low, much lower than those used in prior studies.\"\n\n\"So it might be big differences in study design that account for this new finding,\" Mittleman cautioned. \"In any case, I would say this is absolutely worth further investigation.\"\n\nDr. Gregg C. Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, agreed.\n\n\"It is possible that improvements in other treatments for heart attack patients have made fish oil supplementation less important for reducing cardiovascular risk,\" he acknowledged. \"But it's also possible that the different dosing used in this study relative to previous work made a difference in the outcome. The dosing here may have been just too low, whereas higher doses given immediately following an initial heart attack might have been protective.\"\n\n\"So I would say,\" Fonarow added, \"that this is by no means the final word regarding omega-3s and cardiovascular health.\"\n\nFor more on omega-3 fatty acids, visit the National Institutes of Health.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "\u00a0The story did not engage in over disease mongering.\n", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Scientists have used a form of stem-cell therapy to improve survival rates for the most severely sick lupus patients, a group that usually has no remaining treatment options.\n\nLupus is an autoimmune disease that attacks an individual's own organs, causing symptoms that range from swollen joints and skin rashes to severe damage to kidneys, lungs and other parts of the body.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "Presented an estimate for the number \nof people affected by lupus (1.5 million in the U.S.) as well as an estimate (5-10%) for the proportion of patients who did \nnot respond to standard treatment.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "More intensive treatment for patients with acute kidney injury did not bring better results in a large randomized, controlled clinical trial sponsored by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe findings will be published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine; they were released early online.\n\nThe trial was conducted from 2003 to 2007 and included 1,124 critically ill adult patients at 17 VA hospitals and 10 university hospitals.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Paul M.

It is less than half the cost of surgery but is rarely covered by insurance.\n\nThe idea is based on results from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

But most of the success so far has been with blood cancers like lymphomas and leukemias. Immunotherapy, as it\u2019s called, has yet to prove itself with solid tumors like breast, prostate, lung, colon and brain cancers.\n\nBut in a report published in the , researchers led by Dr. Behnam Badie from the City of Hope Beckman Research Institute and Medical Center say that the same immune-based therapy that is successful against blood cancers also helped a patient with advanced brain cancer.\n\nThe 50-year-old man with glioblastoma, a particularly aggressive type of brain tumor, had already been treated with surgery, radiation and anti-tumor drug therapies. Despite these treatments, his cancer had returned and also spread to other parts of his brain and spinal cord. Badie and his team extracted immune cells from him, then engineered them to express proteins on their surface that would recognize and destroy glioblastoma tumor cells. After surgery to remove the bulk of the brain tumor, Badie and his colleagues directly injected the site with the modified immune cells (called chimeric antigen receptor T cells, or CAR T cells) six times, and the remaining part of this tumor stopped growing.\n\nOther smaller growths in the brain continued to grow, however, so the patient received 10 more doses of the CAR T cells injected into the cavities in the brain, called the ventricles. This is the first time that immune cells have been injected into these brain regions, because introducing anything into the ventricles can cause dangerous and possibly deadly inflammation. The man did not develop such serious complications, however, and after about four months, these tumors too started to shrink. By six months, almost all had disappeared.\n\nIf the patient had not received the CAR T therapy, he likely would only have survived a few weeks after his cancer recurred, says Badie. But after being treated with the immune therapy, his cancer did not grow or recur for nearly eight months. \u201cIf we can do the same for other patients, that would be an amazing accomplishment that many decades of work and research on glioblastoma have never done,\u201d says Badie, whose own father passed away a decade ago from glioblastoma.\n\nThe patient is one of nine in the trial, and so far, many of the other people are having similar experiences on the therapy. Based on this man\u2019s case, his team is hoping to now inject not just the tumor site but also the ventricular space in the brain, since that may help control spread of the cancer.\n\nIt\u2019s also becoming clear that more than one type of modified immune cells may have to be enlisted. The tumors in the first patient remained under control for almost eight months, but the cancer returned after that in new parts of the brain. Badie says it\u2019s not obvious why, but his analysis showed that these tumors did not contain much of the protein targeted by the CAR T cells that were injected.

The comprehensive meta-analysis and assessment of human clinical trials, published in the official journal of the American Urological Association, The Journal of Urology\u00ae, assures practitioners and their patients that cranberry products are a low cost, low risk and effective way to help prevent recurrent UTIs.1\n\nTo answer the question, \"Can Cranberries Contribute to Reduce the Incidence of Urinary Tract Infections?\" a total of 28 studies showing results from nearly 5,000 patients were considered. Authors found a statistically significant risk reduction in repeat UTIs overall, but not significant for any particular subgroup. However, patients with recurrent UTIs who ingested cranberry products and had undergone gynecological surgery, experienced a significant reduction in UTIs.\n\n\"Our investigation supports that cranberry products can be a powerful tool to fight off frequent UTIs,\" explains lead author, Dr. \u00c2ngelo Lu\u00eds. \"While recommendations for dosage and duration of treatment require further study, the efficacy of the medicinal properties of cranberry products has been well-established.\"\n\nThe review explains that the medicinal properties of cranberries may be attributed to their unique polyphenol, proanthocyanidins - or PACs, for short. Their ability to keep infection-causing bacteria from sticking to the urinary tract walls may be the major reason for their effectiveness in limiting infection growth and recurrence.\n\nAccording to the authors, scientists and practitioners continue to explore the use of alternative therapies in the prevention of common infections as part of the global movement to reduce antibiotic use and resistance. It is estimated that one third of women in the United States will get a UTI by the age of 24.2\n\n\"Findings like this,\" adds Dr. Luis, \"give practitioners a viable, inexpensive, non-antibiotic option to help patients reduce the recurrence of an uncomfortable and potentially debilitating infection.\"\n\n\"As one of the oldest alternative therapies and U.S.-born berries, independent research such as this not only provides public health benefits, it revitalizes the enthusiasm for cranberry products year-round.

There is no correlation between getting the Gardasil vaccine and seriously adverse effects such as \u201cautoimmune diseases (including Guillain-Barre Syndrome and multiple sclerosis), anaphylaxis, venous thromboembolism, and stroke.\u201d\n\nMind you, all these things and more have been used by people who attack vaccines as an argument against it. And, just like essentially every claim made by the anti-vaccination movement, these arguments are wrong.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t stop them from making them, or from them getting attention by mainstream media; attention they most assuredly do not deserve.\n\nIt\u2019s very frustrating; mounds of data show these vaccinations are incredibly low-risk, but it only takes a little bit of doubt and fear to make vaccine rates drop. For example, a young girl died tragically not long after getting the vaccine, and it got a lot of press, but it was later found that she died of a completely unrelated cause. This, sadly, is expected; more than 178 million doses of Gardasil have been given worldwide, and given that huge number it\u2019s a statistical certainty that some young people will die not long after getting them. But as the saying goes, correlation is not causation. The vaccines are not to blame here.\n\nEven more frustrating about this vaccine is that it\u2019s being fought by an unusual group of people; while most anti-vax leanings are not affiliated with any particular political persuasion, Gardasil gets attacked additionally by conservatives who think that girls getting it will become more promiscuous, because HPV is a sexually transmitted disease.\n\nHowever, this has been shown to be false. Worse, these same people tend to promote abstinence-only education, which has been shown conclusively to be the worst possible sex education; kids taught his way tend to have more pregnancies and more STIs than ones who are taught progressive, healthy sex ed.\n\nIt\u2019s like Bizarro world, where everything is backward. All the evidence shows Gardasil to be safe and to be effective against a virus that causes horrific illnesses. It also shows that the claims made by anti-vaxxers are wrong, and that people fighting the vaccine because of their own sexual biases are making things far worse.\n\nAnd yet they dig in. They insist real science is wrong, that their anecdotes are better, that the entire medical industry is on the take (which is silly beyond reason).\n\nBut that\u2019s where we are. When it comes to health issues, especially ones tied to sexuality, reason goes out the window and emotions take over.\n\nThat\u2019s why I am very, very clear about this: I and my family are all up to date with our vaccinations, and my daughter has had all three stages of the Gardasil vaccine (we\u2019d have done that if she had been a boy, too). As a parent, as someone who knows and loves someone with an autoimmune disorder, and as a person who knows just how truly awful so many diseases are and how easily and safely they can be prevented, I am a strong advocate for vaccinations.\n\nIt\u2019s your body, but it affects literally everyone around you. Don\u2019t listen to the anti-vaxxers, who just want to scare you. Get the facts.

As most people age, an opaque film slowly forms over the lens -- the part of the eye that helps with focusing on images at various distances. It clouds vision and can lead to blindness.\n\nIn cataract surgery, which has been around for several decades, eye surgeons make an incision in the front of the eye and remove the lens from its supporting capsule. Then they replace it with an artificial lens.\n\nThe new procedure described in Nature involves making a slim incision at the side of the lens capsule, removing the entire lens, yet preserving the empty capsule bag or \"scaffold.\" A certain kind of stem cell, called endogenous stem/progenitor cells, when left intact, then begins to repopulate the damaged lens and essentially grow a new, healthy lens.\n\nStudy author Dr. Kang Zhang, the chief of ophthalmic genetics at UC San Diego's Shiley Eye Institute, told CBS News, \"Unlike [the] current way of cataract surgery, which destroys over half of lens stem cells and requires implantation of a plastic intranet ocular lens, we devised a new surgery to make a very small opening at the side of a cataractous lens bag, remove [the] cataract inside, allow the opening to heal, and promote dormant lens stem cells to regrow an entirely new lens with vision.\"\n\nThe experimental procedure was done in 12 infants who were born with a congenital cataract condition.\n\nBy using a less invasive procedure, Zhang and his colleagues report that they were able to leave the lens epithelial stem cells, also called LECs, intact. These LECs regenerated the eye's lens in the children, eliminating the need for implants. The same technique was also successfully performed in animals.\n\nIn little ones with congenital cataracts, eye surgeons need to intervene early so that light can get to the brain and allow for normal, healthy growth, said Suraj Bhat, associate professor of ophthalmology and director of the Vision Molecular Biology Laboratory at the UCLA Stein Eye Institute. Bhat was not involved in the new research, but said it's \"extremely exciting\" because it offers an alternative to \"an extraordinarily invasive\" procedure.\n\n\"In early childhood cataracts are very bad. We need light to enter into the eyes at a young age to get proper brain function, otherwise, information does not get transferred to the developing brain,\" said Bhat.\n\nTraditional surgery can cause opacity in the line of a child's vision and, because the eye is still growing, it is difficult to provide good vision with eye glasses, explained Julie T. Daniels, from University College London Institute of Ophthalmology, in an accompanying commentary in Nature.\n\nMany children also later go on to suffer from glaucoma.\n\nDaniels wrote that to correctly refract light onto the retina at the back of the eye, the cornea and lens must remain transparent throughout life. Current treatments for the cornea and lens involve donor transplants or artificial implants, but the procedures can be risky. She said the new procedure, which coaxes stem cells to regenerate normal tissue in the body, offers promise.\n\n\"The study's stem cell engineering has led to the regeneration of transparent lens tissue in children, showing that the concept offers a potential therapeutic approach,\" Daniels wrote.\n\nShe noted a second study in Nature that used transplant tissue grown in the laboratory from stem cells to treat damaged corneas, saying it also holds promise.\n\nZhang said their results need to be validated in a large number of patients \"and with a longer follow-up period.\"\n\nWill it work in older eyes?\n\nOne major question remains to be answered: Can it be applied to age-related cataracts, the leading cause of blindness?\n\nAccording to the National Eye Institute, about 24.4 million Americans suffer from cataracts. Between 2000 and 2010, the number of cataract cases in the U.S. went up by 20 percent, and it's expected to continue to grow as the population ages.\n\n\"We are now planning a study to test this approach in this old patient population. In addition, we are testing if this approach can be used in treating other leading causes of blindness, such as macular degeneration and glaucoma,\" said Zhang.\n\nHe hopes the surgery will be available to the general population within four to five years.\n\n\"I would anticipate that it may be available after several independent studies with a large number of patients,\" he said.\n\nSome other experts in the field saw great promise in the research.\n\n\"Everyone's working on this. Stem cells are like the Holy Grail of vision research,\" Dr. James Tsai, M.D., president of the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai, told CBS News. \"To me, it's very exciting data. They may be on to something.\"\n\nBut he tempered the hope the study offers by noting that the lens regeneration work is also \"very controversial\" and could impact a multimillion-dollar industry.\n\n\"This is potentially a new surgery. If you think about the implications in the long run, lens implants may not be necessary,\" he said. \"There are a lot of doctors who will want to see more data.\"\n\nHe also pointed out that the study involved infants, and that adults -- the most common cataract patients -- have a different regenerative capacity of lens epithelial stem cells.\n\nIn the meantime, Tsai said it's hopeful news for some babies with congenital cataracts like the children who participated in the study. \"As a glaucoma specialist, the way we do congenital cataracts, there's a great risk these babies will develop glaucoma for a lifetime and maybe with this new surgery, they won't have that glaucoma risk.\"\n\nDr. Maria Valeria Canto-Soler, assistant professor of ophthalmology and director of the Retinal Degeneration Research Center at Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute, said she was impressed by the research.\n\n\"The main excitement for me is the ability to regenerate an organ or a tissue within an organ,\" said Canto-Soler, a retina specialist.\n\n\"From what I know, I'd say this is the first demonstration where you can use endogenous stem cells for replacing tissue within the eye. It's something we are all looking for. They have actually done it in humans.\"\n\nShe said, even without answers to the question of whether it will work in aging eyes, it creates hope for children with congenital issues. \"If you can create it in children, that's a big thing. You are giving sight back to little kids and that change their lives.\"\n\nDr. Kathryn Hatch, an ophthalmologist at Massachusetts Eye and Ear in Boston, told CBS News the procedure \"seems very exciting,\" but more research is needed.\n\n\"I'd need to see a larger study with more eyes, and we need to see some reproducibility, and see how long it would take for the lens -- if it's able to regenerate -- what are the visual results. Because that's what patients really care about. Their vision. If it takes months to get to an outcome, it's not superior to the lens technologies we have now. I'm not sure what the advantage is. Most patients don't even want to wait. They want to get back to work, their life,\" Hatch added.\n\nShe also had questions about how the procedure was done with such a tiny incision. \"I don't understand how they're doing the surgery with such a tiny hole without tearing the capsule. If we make a three millimeter incision [in traditional cataract surgery], that's really small in an adult.\"\n\nCataract surgery is \"traditionally done by hand with a bent needle. That's one of the most difficult steps to learn as a surgeon. One of most important steps to learn,\" she said and there could be major eye damage if a surgery was compromised by a tear.\n\nShe also noted that baby eye surgery is different from adults in that the infant cataract is much softer compared to an adult's harder cataract.\n\nUCLA's Bhat noted another limitation in the study: \"These are all genetic cataracts. This study wasn't long enough. They [cataracts] may come back,\" he said, but it's also possible the genetic defect may not reappear.\n\nHe's said it's unclear if the results will be mirrored in older cataract patients, the same concern expressed by others in the field.\n\n\"Cell division is slower in older people,\" Bhat said. \"The biggest problem as we grow older, particularly beyond 50, is cell division which keeps on decreasing. Our ability to make new cells is significantly lost. The process that these people are depending upon is tremendously dependent on cell division.\"\n\nBhat said he also paused when he read the statement in the paper that claimed a 100 percent success rate three months after surgery.\n\n\"I don't know them. I can't second guess them.

A manmade virus-like vector is used to transfer special molecules to the T cells. One of the molecules, CD19, makes the T cells attack B lymphocytes -- the cells that become cancerous in CLL.\n\nAll this has been done before. These genetically engineered cells are called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. They kill cancer in the test tube. But in humans, they die away before they do much damage to tumors.\n\nWhat's new about the current treatment is the addition of a special signaling molecule called 4-1BB. This signal does several things: it gives CAR T cells more potent anti-tumor activity, and it somehow allows the cells to persist and multiply in patients' bodies. Moreover, the signal does not call down the deadly all-out immune attack -- the feared \"cytokine storm\" -- that can do more harm than good.\n\nThis may be why relatively small infusions of the CAR T cells had such a profound effect. Each of the cells killed thousands of cancer cells and destroyed more than 2 pounds of tumor in each patient.\n\n\"Within three weeks, the tumors had been blown away, in a way that was much more violent than we ever expected,\"June says in a news release.

They found patients who took vitamin B3 twice a day cut their chances of developing new skin cancers by 23 percent.\n\n\"That's a dramatic number,\" Dr. David Agus, director of USC's Norris Westside Cancer Center, told \"CBS This Morning.\" \"It could make a major impact.\"\n\nDr. Jae Jung, a dermatologist at City of Hope cancer center in Duarte, California, agreed. \"If you can reduce the new skin cancer rates for these patients, it would be an enormous benefit,\" she told CBS News.\n\nHow does it work? Sunlight's ultraviolet (UV) rays can damage the DNA in skin cells, increasing the risk for skin cancer. Researchers say vitamin B3 gives skin cells an energy boost -- \"turns back on the immune system,\" in Agus's words -- helping them repair the damage.\n\nNearly 5 million people are treated for skin cancer in the U.S. each year, and the Skin Cancer Foundation says 1 out of 5 Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime.\n\nThe two most common forms of the disease, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, can usually be treated successfully. The most dangerous type, melanoma, occurs in about 73,000 people in the U.S. each year and kills more than 9,900.\n\nOne patient who could benefit from the vitamin treatment is Charity Wiese, who has been diagnosed with skin cancer more than two dozen times in the last five years. She said she's had \"quite a few on the top of my head, a few on the back of my head, one behind each ear,\" even though she tries to stay out of the sun. Wiese had leukemia as a teenager and underwent radiation therapy, which put her at high risk for skin cancer later in life.\n\nWiese thinks the vitamin study sounds promising. \"I am absolutely willing to try it and hope for the best,\" she said.\n\nDoctors involved in the study are excited by their findings on vitamin B3 nicotinamide. \"It's safe, it's almost obscenely inexpensive, and it's already widely commercially available,\" Dr. Diona Damian, the senior author of the study and a professor of dermatology at the University of Sydney, told HealthDay.\n\nBut she said more reserach is needed to see if everyone benefits from it. \"It's not something we'd recommend at this stage for the general population,\" Damian said.

Published today in the Journal of Oncology Practice, the study also determined that a systemized process of referrals resulted in significant improvements in 30-day readmission rates, hospice referral, and receipt of chemotherapy after discharge in patients with advanced cancers. This is the first study to demonstrate that among advanced cancer patients admitted to an inpatient oncology service, standardized use of triggers for palliative care consultation is associated with substantial improvement on multiple quality measures.\n\nPatients with advanced cancers often have significant symptoms that affect their emotional status, quality of life, and functional ability. The integration of palliative care improves symptom control and decreases unwanted health care use, yet many patients are never offered these services.\n\n\u201cAs cancer progresses, patients are often at high risk for physical pain and emotional distress,\u201d said Cardinale B. Smith, MD, MSCR, Associate Professor of Medicine (Hematology and Medical Oncology), and of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. \u201cHealth care utilization is extremely high once cancer progresses, with hospital readmission rates as high as 40 percent and death in the acute care setting ranging from 30-50 percent \u2013 both measures of poor-quality cancer care.\u201d\n\nTo improve the quality of care, researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine developed standardized criteria or \u201ctriggers\u201d for palliative care consultation for patients admitted to the cancer unit at The Mount Sinai Hospital. Patients were eligible for this prospective cohort study if they met one or more eligibility criteria: advanced solid tumor cancer, prior hospitalization within 30 days, hospitalization for more than 7 days, or active symptoms.\n\n\u201cCare for patients with advanced cancer is often characterized by time spent on acute-care hospital wards and intensive care units, or receiving invasive procedures, chemotherapy infusions, and radiographic imaging. Such interventions drive escalating costs and are often directly in conflict with patients\u2019 prior stated wishes,\u201d said Dr. Smith.\n\nConsultation with the palliative care team included establishment of goals of care, advance care plans using standardized communication protocols, transition planning and symptom assessment and treatment using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS). The palliative team was composed of one board certified PC physician, one nurse practitioner, one social worker, a chaplain, and one to two trainees.\n\n\u201cOur results highlight the need to adopt this practice at acute care hospitals across the nation,\u201d said Dr. Smith. \u201cPalliative care involvement helps patients understand their prognosis, establish goals of care, and formulate discharge plans in line with those goals, and this study is the first to confirm the impact of using standardized criteria and automatic palliative care consultation on quality of cancer care.\u201d\n\nCo-authors of the study include Kerin Adelson, MD, Division of Hematology/Oncology at Yale University School of Medicine.\n\nAbout the Mount Sinai Health SystemThe Mount Sinai Health System is an integrated health system committed to providing distinguished care, conducting transformative research, and advancing biomedical education.

The findings may reduce the number of unnecessary treatments prescribed to otherwise healthy girls.\n\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder affecting up to 12% of women. Women with PCOS are more likely to suffer from irregular periods, have excessive levels of male hormones and may have difficulty in conceiving due to irregularities in the ovaries. Doctors are cautious when diagnosing PCOS in teenagers because the symptoms can be confused with normal pubertal changes. Having tools that make diagnoses more accurate can reduce unnecessary treatment for otherwise healthy teenagers at a critical stage in their lives.\n\nThe cause of PCOS is unknown and there is currently no cure for the condition. Previous studies have associated high levels of irisin, a newly discovered hormone which is released from muscles and regulates energy metabolism, with PCOS in adults.\n\nIn this study, Greek researchers from Aghia Sophia Children's Hospital in Athens compared the hormones of 23 teenagers with PCOS with 17 healthy teenagers of the same age and BMI. They found that teenagers with PCOS had significantly higher irisin levels compared to the control group, and that this was associated with higher levels of the male sex hormone testosterone, a key marker of PCOS.\n\nThe findings suggest that irisin could be a marker for PCOS allowing the condition to be diagnosed more easily. \"Teenagers who get an early diagnosis of PCOS can sooner start to deal with the physical and psychological symptoms caused by this lifelong condition,\" said lead researcher Dr Flora Bacopoulou. \"Whether it's through counselling or medication, girls can manage their symptoms and decrease the risk of further complications such as fertility problems, hirsutism (excessive hair growth) and type-2 diabetes\".\n\nThe group will next focus on confirming their results and investigate the biological role of irisin in PCOS. \"If high irisin levels in teenagers with PCOS is established, this could lead to the development of treatments for PCOS.

We rely on our sense of smell to make us aware of smoke in detecting a fire, natural gas leaks and to avoid eating rotten food. In the elderly, of whom there are estimates that greater than 50 percent of the population over the age of 65 has experienced smell loss, it can be difficult to get proper nutrition, as the sensation of flavor is closely tied to the sense of smell, and as flavor diminishes, appetite decreases in this population.\n\nA Cochlear Implant for the Nose\n\nMotivated by work conducted by research colleagues at Virginia Commonwealth University\u2019s School of Medicine, Mass. Eye and Ear physicians wanted to address the question of whether electrical stimulation of the olfactory bulb could induce the sense of smell in human subjects.\n\nThe findings described in the International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology report demonstrate this feasibility. In the report, the researchers describe endoscopic procedures to position electrodes in the sinus cavities of five patients with an intact ability to smell.

That means it's just waiting for a final okay from the FDA before the Amgen product can hit the market. The results of the trial were published Tuesday in Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\n[Personalized cancer vaccines have already helped treat three patients]\n\nIn a study of 436 patients with inoperable melanoma, Talimogene Laherparepvec had 16.3 percent of patients showing results at the six-month mark, compared to 2.1 percent taking the control therapy. Some patients were continuing to respond to T-VEC three years later.\n\nPatients with stage III and early stage IV melanoma treated with T-VEC (163 people in all) lived an average of 41 months. This compared with an average survival of 21.5 months in the 66 earlier-stage patients who received the control immunotherapy. Immunotherapy, where agents are used to boost a body's natural defense against a tumor, are already the best treatments against melanoma. But this is the first time a modified virus has been successful in carrying out that treatment.\n\n[One day, doctors might prescribe viruses instead of antibiotics]\n\nUsing a virus as a drug isn't a new idea. Phage therapy, where viruses that attack certain bacteria are used in place of antibiotics, is commonly used in Europe and on the rise in the United States. But cancer therapies like the one described in the new paper take things a step further, manipulating existing viruses to turn them into cancer-fighting tools.\n\nKevin Harrington, Professor of Biological Cancer Therapies at The Institute of Cancer Research and head of the trial, has been working on this particular virus for about a decade. Before he signed onto the project, it was primarily being investigated as a breast cancer treatment. But Harrington brought head, neck, and skin cancer patients into the mix, and melanoma seemed to have the best responses of all.\n\nHere's how T-VEC works: It starts with the herpes virus, which is magnificent at proliferating itself within cells and then causing them to burst (that's where the cold sores come from). But T-VEC has had two key genes removed. These keep it from replicating within healthy cells, which can quickly spot it because of the missing genes.\n\nBut cancer cells aren't as savvy, and T-VEC has its run of them. Meanwhile, T-VEC has also been modified to produce a molecule called GM-CSF, which serves as a red flag waved at the immune system.\n\nSo in addition to the destructive power of the T-VEC cells themselves, the therapy summons the immune system right to where it's needed -- the tumor.\n\n[Watch how the body\u2019s \u2018serial killers\u2019 stalk and attack cancer cells]\n\n\"This is a first in class agent, a brand new therapy,\" Harrington said. \"But it's just the farthest along of what we hope will be many more.\"\n\nHarrington expects the FDA to clear T-VEC within the year, and it could potentially be available to patients right away.\n\nBut there's more work to be done to determine just how T-VEC can fit into the cancer-treatment landscape. When the latest trial was started, Harrington explained, there was no standard of treatment for melanoma -- so it's compared to a treatment that no one expected to outpace T-VEC. Now that other therapies -- ones that target specific mutations in patients' cancer cells -- are showing more success than what was available when the trial was formed, researchers will have to see how T-VEC compares.\n\n\"The next steps are exciting, and already underway,\" he said. \"The next big frontier will be to combine this with existing immunotherapies. There's a strong rationale that other drugs on the market could act synogistically with ours.\"\n\nTrials are also underway to determine how T-VEC might do with other cancers.

The study included the participants' history of falls and their fear of falling, blood tests at the beginning and at end of the trial to measure 25-hydroxyvitamin D (biomarker for vitamin D in blood), and a monthly diary recording falls during the trial period.\n\nAt the beginning of this pilot study, the research team found that more than half of the participants had insufficient concentrations of vitamin D in the blood (less than 20 ng/ml), while less than a quarter had concentrations in the optimal range (30 ng/ml or more).\n\nThe study showed that the monthly vitamin D supplement was effective in increasing the concentrations of vitamin D in the blood from insufficient to sufficient levels in all but one of the 34 people who received it, and to optimal levels in all but five people. In addition, people in the vitamin D group reported approximately half the falls of those in the control group.\n\n\"Although these initial findings are encouraging, we need to confirm the results in a larger trial,\" Houston said.\n\nThe Wake Forest Baptist team currently is conducting a clinical trial to try to determine how vitamin D affects risk factors for falls such as balance and muscle strength and power.\n\nFunding for the study was provided by the Wake Forest Translational Science Institute and Center for Integrative Medicine and the Claude Pepper Older Americans Independence Center of Wake Forest Baptist.\n\nCo-authors are Janet Tooze, Ph.D., Jamehl Demons, M.D., Brooke Davis, M.S., Rachel Shertzer-Skinner, M.A., Stephen Kritchevsky, Ph.D., and Jeff Williamson, M.D., of Wake Forest Baptist; and Linda Kearsley, B.S., Senior Services Inc., Winston-Salem.", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The news release did not appear to exaggerate the severity of the problem.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Jay Konduros used to rush home several times a year after accidentally cutting or bumping himself. There he would inject himself with refrigerated blood-clotting factor to prevent internal bleeding and extensive bruising and swelling. \u201cI was walking on eggshells all the time,\u201d said the former aerospace engineer who has a blood disorder called hemophilia B.\n\nThen, last year, Konduros enrolled in a clinical trial, receiving an experimental gene therapy at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Almost immediately, he began producing the missing clotting factor. Several weeks later, after he dropped a heavy box on his shin, he watched a bruise develop and shrink within hours. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d he thought. \u201cLife's easy if this is what happens.\u201d\n\nKonduros, 53, who runs a bakery and cafe in southeastern Ontario, is one of 10 men in an early-stage trial sponsored by Spark Therapeutics. (The disorder is much more common in men than women.) On Wednesday, researchers reported that a single intravenous infusion of Spark's novel gene therapy enabled patients to safely produce sufficient clotting factor to prevent dangerous bleeding episodes.\n\nThe treatment also \u201cnearly universally eliminated\u201d the need for preventive infusions of clotting factor a few times a week, the scientists said. And its effects lasted; after a year and a half, the longest patient follow-up, the therapy was continuing to work.\n\nThe results, published Wednesday online in the New England Journal of Medicine, represent \u201canother example of the gene-therapy renaissance,\u201d Matthew Porteus, a pediatrician at Stanford University, wrote in an accompanying editorial. He said the data suggests that the treatment ultimately might provide an \u201cideal cure\u201d for hemophilia B.\n\nStill, he noted, the study has some limitations. The follow-up period was relatively short, from 28 to 78 weeks in the new report; longer-term studies are needed to prove safety and effectiveness over extended periods. In addition, he said, researchers need to find ways to provide the therapy to a broader group of people, including children, and to figure out how to reduce the costs involved.\n\nThe researchers presented earlier findings on the gene therapy a year ago at the American Society of Hematology's annual meeting, but the latest data covers a larger patient group and a longer time period.\n\nThe hemophilia gene therapy is one of several being tested for conditions including sickle cell anemia and Huntington's disease. The one-time treatments seek to fight the disease by adding correct copies of a patient's defective genes. If approved, such treatments are expected to command stratospheric prices. For example, a separate Spark gene therapy for a rare type of childhood blindness, which is on track for Food and Drug Administration clearance soon, could cost $1 million per patient for infusions in both eyes, according to some Wall Street analysts.\n\nStill, the therapies can produce at least some offsetting savings. Porteus noted in his editorial that the hemophilia therapy resulted in savings of about $200,000 a year per patient because of the elimination of clotting-factor infusions.\n\nOther experts also were impressed by the results. The hemophilia study \u201cis small but very promising, and it gives me the sense that gene therapy for hemophilia B is going to be at our disposal in no time, maybe a few years from now,\u201d said Aric Parnes, who is associate director of the Boston Hemophilia Center at the Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center and wasn't involved in the study. \u201cOne of the key things is, how long will the treatment last? Does it wane over time? So far, with a full year, it doesn\u2019t look like that is happening.\u201d\n\nLindsey George, the lead investigator and a hematologist at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said that nine of the 10 men in the trial didn't experience any bleeding episodes after the gene therapy treatment. The one patient who needed clotting factor because of bleeding used 91 percent less than before, she said.\n\n\u201cPeople were planning their lives around hemophilia, and now they are doing activities that they weren't before,\u201d George said. \u201cOne man who came in a wheelchair is now out of a wheelchair and is coaching Little League.\u201d\n\nPeople with hemophilia B inherit a gene mutation on the X chromosome that interferes with their ability to produce normal levels of blood-clotting factor IX. (Because women have two copies of the X chromosomes, the other one can compensate, so they may carry the disease but not suffer from it.) Bleeding episodes \u2014 which can result from injury or occur spontaneously \u2014 can cause extensive damage and be life threatening.\n\nThe therapy developed by Spark, a biotech company spun off from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in 2013, involves a bioengineered gene designed to prompt the body to produce increased levels of a different clotting factor. The gene is transported to the liver, where clotting factor is made, by a harmless virus called an adeno-associated viral vector. For the current trial, which is being funded by Spark and Pfizer, researchers used a clotting factor that is 8 to 10 times as strong as the normal version. The stronger factor is called Factor IX-Padua, because it was discovered in 2009 in an Italian family.\n\nPatients produced clotting-factor levels that were enough to allow blood to clot but not to spur an undesirable immune-system response, the researchers said.\n\nFDA advisers urge approval for first gene therapy for inherited disease\n\nIn a first, scientists edit genes inside a man's body to try to cure a disease.

The task force's guidelines are important because insurers and government programs often follow the panel's recommendations in deciding whether to cover certain preventive services.\n\nThe task force's final recommendation is likely to be controversial because some other groups say the screening should start earlier. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, for example, recommends that regular screenings begin at age 40, while the American Cancer Society calls for women to start yearly screening at age 45 and then move to screening every two years starting at age 55.\n\nCongress has sided with proponents of earlier screening. Last month, in anticipation of Monday's release of the task force\u2019s final recommendation, lawmakers took preemptive action: It directed insurers to ignore the task force's latest guidelines and, instead, to rely on its 2002 recommendation. That called for annual mammograms to begin at 40. As a result of the congressional action, women in their 40s will continue to be able to get annual mammograms at no cost.\n\nThe differences over when to start regular screening reflect the growing concern that the benefits of mammograms may have been oversold, and that they don't outweigh the anxiety and potential harm caused by over-diagnosis and false positives from the tests.\n\n[In major shift, these guidelines scaled back breast cancer screening for women in their 40s]\n\nThe debate over when to start regular screening involves only women of \"average risk\" who don't have specific risk factors for breast cancer such as the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic mutations or a family history of the disease. They're also not aimed at diagnostic mammography, which takes place once a woman has a symptom such as a lump. The screening recommendations are not binding on doctors, hospitals or insurers.\n\nIn releasing its final recommendations, the task force confirmed an earlier guidance it issued that said screening mammography had the greatest benefit for women ages 50 to 74. For women in their 40s, the likelihood of benefit is less and the potential harms are proportionally greater, it said. The most serious potential harm is unneeded treatment for a type of cancer that would not have become a threat to a woman's health during her lifetime.\n\nThe congressional action, which was included in the recently enacted spending law, has drawn criticism from some experts.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Congress thinks it's perfectly acceptable, even preferred, for a scientific document from 14 years ago to guide coverage policy on screening for breast cancer in women,\u201d says Kenneth Lin, a Georgetown University family medicine doctor who teaches preventive and evidence-based medicine.\n\nPart of the problem is the common perception that women deserve free mammogram coverage and that the scientific community is basing its decision on cost or rationing, said Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University law professor and expert on public health.\n\nFran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, said the task force's guidelines for women in their 40s \u2014 that they should discuss whether to get mammograms with their doctors and make individual decisions \u2014 come closest to following the evidence accumulated over the past three decades. Women should trust that process, she said.\n\nDespite the decades of marketing of mammography to women, \"women are capable of understanding the complexities of the issue, evaluating the evidence and making their own health decisions,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\"At some point we will have to decide that we are not going to pay for interventions that lack a high level of medical evidence,\" she said. \"At this time, what does concern us very much are attempts by Congress to interfere with the makeup and process of the US Preventive Services Task Force.\"\n\nThe task force first suggested in 2009 that breast cancer screening begin at 50 instead of 40, touching off enormous criticism. In 2010, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, which required that certain preventive services be provided for free \u2014 if those services got a strong recommendation from the task force. But it included an amendment that effectively directed insurers to use the 2002 recommendations for mammograms. That meant that women who were 40 and older could get mammograms at no cost.\n\nIn April 2015, the task force came out with its latest draft guidance, basically reaffirming its 2009 recommendations that the greatest benefit of mammography screening is for women between 50 and 74.\n\nWorried that millions of women under 50 could lose their free annual mammogram coverage if the guidelines became final, several health-care groups, including ACOG, the American College of Radiology and the Susan G. Komen Foundation, lobbied Congress to block that from happening.\n\nLanguage was included in the spending bill that says any recommendations of the task force related to breast cancer screening, mammography and prevention refers to those \u201cissued before 2009.\u201d\n\nSen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) was among the lawmakers who pushed for the language to be included. In a statement, she said her number one priority was to ensure that women can get mammograms if they and their doctors decide it's the right thing to do. \"This means making sure that cost is not a deterrent to care,\" she said.\n\nSeveral groups that lobbied for congressional action said in a statement last month that the task force recommendations conflict with those of other organizations.

Hall, M.D., M.Div., M.H.Sc., of the Veterans Affairs Pittsburgh Healthcare System and University of Pittsburgh, and colleagues examined the effect of a Frailty Screening Initiative (FSI) on death and complications by comparing the surgical outcomes of patients treated before and after implementation of the FSI.\n\nAs the U.S. population ages, the number of operations performed on elderly patients will likely increase. Frailty predicts postoperative mortality and illness more than age alone, thus presenting opportunities to identify the highest-risk surgical patients and provide tailored clinical care to improve their outcomes. This study included 9,153 patients (average age, 60 years) from a Veterans Affairs medical center who presented for major, elective, noncardiac surgery. Preoperative frailty was assessed with the Risk Analysis Index (RAI; a 14-item questionnaire), and the records of all frail patients (as determined by a certain RAI score) were flagged for administrative review by the chief of surgery (or designee) before the scheduled operation. On the basis of this review, clinicians from surgery, anesthesia, critical care, and palliative care were notified of the patient\u2019s frailty and associated surgical risks; if indicated, perioperative plans were modified based on team input.\n\nThe researchers found that overall 30-day mortality decreased from 1.6 percent (84 of 5,275 patients) to 0.7 percent (26 of 3,878 patients) after FSI implementation. Improvement was greatest among frail patients (12.2 percent to 3.8 percent), although mortality rates also decreased among the robust patients (1.2 percent to 0.3 percent). The magnitude of improvement among frail patients increased at 180 and 365 days.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate cause of the survival benefit is likely multifactorial, including changes in preoperative decision making, intraoperative management, and postoperative rescue,\u201d the authors write.\n\n\u201cThis study reveals the feasibility of facility-wide frailty screening in elective surgical populations. It also suggests the potential to improve postoperative survival among the frail through systematic administrative screening, review, and optimization of perioperative plans. The absolute reduction in 180-day mortality among frail patients was more than 19 percent, with improvement remaining robust even after controlling for age, frailty, and predicted mortality.\u201d\n\n: This investigation was supported by a grant from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration, Office of Research and Development, Health Services Research and Development.

Gastric bypass patients cut an average of 111 pounds, while duodenal switch patients dropped about 162.\n\nBut those extra pounds came with nearly double the complication rate.\n\nOf the 29 duodenal switch patients, 62 percent had problems like abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea and intestinal obstruction. And several suffered long-term malnutrition \u2014 something not seen in the gastric bypass group.\n\nDuodenal switch is not a popular procedure. In a 2008 study, it accounted for just 1 percent of weight-loss, or bariatric, surgeries done in the U.S., and 5 percent in Europe.\n\nThe technique is often reserved for \u201csuperobese\u201d patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 50 or higher \u2014 though some surgeons perform it with less severely obese patients too, explained Dr. Torgeir T. Sovik of Oslo University in Norway, the lead researcher on the new study.\n\n\u201cAs duodenal switch can be associated with more adverse events, this procedure should only be performed in carefully selected patients by a dedicated bariatric team,\u201d Sovik told Reuters Health in an email. \u201cAnd a closer follow-up after surgery is required after such procedures.\u201d\n\nBut an expert not involved in the study went further.\n\n\u201cThis is an operation that should probably go away,\u201d said Dr. Edward H. Livingston, a professor and surgeon at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.\n\nThe average weight loss seen with either gastric bypass or duodenal switch will improve or reverse obesity-related ills like diabetes, sleep apnea and knee arthritis, according to Livingston, who wrote an editorial published with the study.\n\nSo for those medical conditions, it probably wouldn\u2019t matter if a person lost 100 pounds or 150 pounds over two years.\n\nBMI is a measure of weight relative to height. A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal weight, and above 30 is obese.\n\nThe patients in the current study were a fairly healthy group despite having a BMI of 50 or more.\n\nAfter two years, those who\u2019d had a duodenal switch showed a greater improvement in their cholesterol levels. But those levels were near-normal (in both groups) to begin with, Livingston noted.\n\nThat begs the question, he said, of whether the extra weight loss \u201cactually accomplished anything.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S., where about 220,000 people underwent weight-loss surgery in 2009, gastric bypass is the most common form chosen.\n\nDuring gastric bypass, the upper portion of the stomach is stapled off to create a smaller pouch that restricts the amount of food a person can eat at one time. The surgeon also creates a bypass around the rest of the stomach and a portion of the small intestine, which limits the body\u2019s absorption of food.\n\nDuodenal switch is more extensive. The surgeon removes part of the stomach, and the remaining \u201csleeve\u201d-like stomach is attached to the final section of the small intestine; that puts even greater limits on the body\u2019s absorption of calories and nutrients.\n\nBoth surgeries carry the long-term risk of nutritional deficiencies, and people need to take supplements and carefully monitor their diets for a lifetime afterward.\n\nBut the risks of nutrient deficiencies are greater with duodenal switch, and include some not seen with gastric bypass, Livingston pointed out.\n\nSome people, for instance, may have severe calcium and vitamin D loss leading to weak and fragile bones. Other problems include severe protein deficiency and night blindness caused by vitamin A deficiency (which is also reversible with extra vitamin A treatment).\n\nIn this study, three of the 29 duodenal switch patients developed protein malnutrition, two developed night blindness, and one had a severe iron deficiency that needed to be treated with iron infusions.\n\nLivingston said his advice to people considering weight-loss surgery is to avoid duodenal switch. \u201cIt\u2019s just not a good operation,\u201d he asserted.\n\nBut he also questioned the value of weight-loss surgery, in general, for severely obese people who do not have medical conditions that stand to improve or resolve after surgery.\n\nIn general, experts say that surgery could be an option for anyone with a BMI of 40 or higher; that translates, roughly, to a man who is at least 100 pounds overweight or a woman who is 80 pounds overweight.\n\nLivingston said he thinks more caution is in order when a very obese person is otherwise healthy.\n\nAlong with the risks of surgery, he said, there is still uncertainty about whether it actually lengthens people\u2019s lives. Some studies have suggested it might, but not all.\n\nIn a study recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Livingston and his colleagues found no survival advantage among severely obese patients who\u2019d undergone weight-loss surgery versus those who hadn\u2019t.\n\nThe study involved 850 U.S. veterans who underwent some form of weight-loss surgery, at an average age of about 50, and more than 41,000 vets who had only non-surgical care. There was no evidence that surgery improved longevity over the next seven years.\n\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t even know if there\u2019s a survival benefit,\u201d Livingston said.\n\nThat, he added, makes the risks of duodenal switch seem even less worthwhile.\n\nBut according to Sovik, duodenal switch might be appropriate for some superobese patients.\n\nIn the U.S., he said, about one in three weight-loss surgery candidates have a BMI of 50 or higher. And studies suggest that a sizable percentage of those people will still have a BMI higher than 40 after gastric bypass.\n\nIn this study, one-quarter of gastric bypass patients still had a BMI that high two years after surgery \u2014 versus none of the duodenal switch patients.\n\nMore extensive monitoring after duodenal switch, Sovik noted, can help detect and manage side effects.\n\nHe pointed out, though, that larger, longer-term studies are still needed to show whether the extra weight loss with duodenal switch ultimately improves severely obese patients\u2019 health and extends their lives.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "This story does a good job of probing territory that is under-explored in most media accounts about obesity treatment.

Memory, in particular, was positively affected by the MedDiet including improvements in: delayed recognition, long-term, and working memory, executive function, and visual constructs.\n\n\"Why is a higher adherence to the MedDiet related to slowing down the rate of cognitive decline? The MedDiet offers the opportunity to change some of the modifiable risk factors,\" he explained.\n\n\"These include reducing inflammatory responses, increasing micronutrients, improving vitamin and mineral imbalances, changing lipid profiles by using olive oils as the main source of dietary fats, maintaining weight and potentially reducing obesity, improving polyphenols in the blood, improving cellular energy metabolism and maybe changing the gut micro-biota, although this has not been examined to a larger extent yet.\"\n\nMoreover, the benefits to cognition afforded by the MedDiet were not exclusive to older individuals. Two of the included studies focused on younger adults and they both found improvements in cognition using computerized assessments.\n\nThe researchers stress that research in this area is important due to the expected extensive population aging over the next 20-30 years.

It is very powerful.\u201d\n\nA lot of work lies ahead, researchers say \u2014 making sure the tests are reliable if they are used in doctors\u2019 offices, making sure the research findings hold up in real-life situations, getting doctors and patients comfortable with the notion of spinal taps, the method used to get spinal fluid. But they see a bright future.\n\nAlthough the latest PET scans for Alzheimer\u2019s are not commercially available, the spinal fluid tests are.\n\nSo the new results also give rise to a difficult question: Should doctors offer, or patients accept, commercially available spinal tap tests to find a disease that is yet untreatable? In the research studies, patients are often not told they may have the disease, but in practice in the real world, many may be told.\n\nSome medical experts say it should be up to doctors and their patients. Others say doctors should refrain from using the spinal fluid test in their practices. They note that it is not reliable enough \u2014 results can vary by lab \u2014 and has been studied only in research settings where patients are carefully selected to have no other conditions, like strokes or depression, that could affect their memories.\n\n\u201cThis is literally on the cutting edge of where the field is,\u201d Dr. DeKosky said. \u201cThe field is moving fast. You can get a test that is approved by the F.D.A., and cutting edge doctors will use it.\u201d\n\nBut, said Dr. John Trojanowski, a University of Pennsylvania researcher and senior author of the paper, given that people can get the test now, \u201cHow early do you want to label people?\u201d\n\nSome, like Dr. John Growdon, a neurology professor at Massachusetts General Hospital who wrote an editorial accompanying the paper, said that decision was up to doctors and their patients.\n\nSometimes patients with severe memory loss do not have the disease. Doctors might want to use the test in cases where they want to be sure of the diagnosis. And they might want to offer the test to people with milder symptoms who want to know whether they are developing the devastating brain disease.\n\nOne drawback, though, is that spinal fluid is obtained with a spinal tap, and that procedure, with its reputation for pain and headaches, makes most doctors and many patients nervous. The procedure involves putting a needle in the spinal space and withdrawing a small amount of fluid.\n\nDr. Growdon and others say spinal taps are safe and not particularly painful for most people. But, he said, there needs to be an education campaign to make people feel more comfortable about having them. He suggested that, because most family doctors and internists are not experienced with the test, there could be special spinal tap centers where they could send patients.\n\nThe new study included more than 300 patients in their 70s, 114 with normal memories, 200 with memory problems and 102 with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Their spinal fluid was analyzed for amyloid beta, a protein fragment that forms plaques in the brain, and for tau, a protein that accumulates in dead and dying nerve cells in the brain. To avoid bias, the researchers analyzing the data did not know anything about the clinical status of the subjects. Also, the subjects were not told what the tests showed.\n\nNearly every person with Alzheimer\u2019s had the characteristic spinal fluid protein levels. Nearly three quarters of people with mild cognitive impairment, a memory impediment that can precede Alzheimer\u2019s, had Alzheimer\u2019s-like spinal fluid proteins. And about a third of people with normal memories had spinal fluid indicating Alzheimer\u2019s. Researchers suspect that those people will develop memory problems.\n\nIn checking their findings against data gathered in a separate study, the researchers found that among 57 patients with mild cognitive impairment who went on to develop Alzheimer\u2019s within five years, 100 percent had the characteristic protein levels five years before.\n\nThe prevailing hypothesis about Alzheimer\u2019s says that amyloid and tau accumulation are necessary for the disease and that stopping the proteins could stop the disease. But it is not yet known what happens when these proteins accumulate in the brains of people with normal memories. They might be a risk factor like high cholesterol levels. Many people with high cholesterol levels never have heart attacks. Or it might mean that Alzheimer\u2019s has already started and if the person lives long enough he or she will with absolute certainty get symptoms like memory loss.\n\nMany, like Dr. DeKosky, believe that when PET scans for amyloid become available, they will be used instead of spinal taps, in part because doctors and patients are more comfortable with brain scans.\n\nAnd when \u2014 researchers optimistically are saying \u201cwhen\u201d these days \u2014 drugs are shown to slow or prevent the disease, the thought is that people will start having brain scans or spinal taps for Alzheimer\u2019s as routinely as they might have colonoscopies or mammograms today.\n\nFor now, Dr. DeKosky said, the days when Alzheimer\u2019s could be confirmed only at autopsy are almost over. And the time when Alzheimer\u2019s could be detected only after most of the brain damage was done seem to be ending, too.\n\n\u201cThe new biomarkers in CSF have made the difference,\u201d Dr. DeKosky said, referring to cerebral spinal fluid. \u201cThis confirms their accuracy in a very big way.\u201d", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "1clip_filelist.xml\"/>\n\n\n\nThis story does not exaggerate the prevalence or seriousness of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. However, by incorrectly stating that the test can identify people who are \"on their way to developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\" the story encourages confusion between risk factors for a disease and the disease itself.

It\u2019s a weird but handy trick for someone who swallows 25 pills a day, most of them purchases off the Internet.\n\nBurke credits the regimen with giving him the cognitive edge he needs to thrive in California\u2019s Silicon Valley, where he\u2019s the co-founder of a food service that caters to athletes and fitness devotees.\n\nHe used to get his edge from Adderall, but after moving from New Jersey to San Francisco, he says, he couldn\u2019t find a doctor who would write him a prescription. Driven to the Internet, he discovered a world of cognition-enhancing drugs known as nootropics \u2014 some prescription, some over-the-counter, others available on a worldwide gray market of private sellers \u2014 said to improve memory, attention, creativity and motivation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like every tech worker in Silicon Valley is taking nootropics to get ahead,\u201d Burke acknowledges. \u201cIt\u2019s the few who are getting ahead who are using supplements to do that.\u201d\n\nThe word \u201cnootropic\u201d was coined in 1972 by a Romanian scientist, Corneliu Giurgea, who combined the Greek words for \u201cmind\u201d and \u201cbending.\u201d Caffeine and nicotine can be considered mild nootropics, while prescription Ritalin, Adderall and Provigil (modafinil, a drug for treating narcolepsy) lie at the far end of the spectrum when prescribed off-label as cognitive enhancers. Even microdosing of LSD is increasingly viewed as a means to greater productivity.\n\nBut when aficionados talk about nootropics, they usually refer to substances that have supposedly few side effects and low toxicity. Most often they mean piracetam, which Giurgea first synthesized in 1964 and which is approved for therapeutic use in dozens of countries for use in adults and the elderly. Not so in the United States, however, where officially it can be sold only for research purposes.\n\nPiracetam is well studied and is credited by its users with boosting their memory, sharpening their focus, heightening their immune system, even bettering their personalities. But it\u2019s only one of many formulations in the racetam drug family. Newer ones include aniracetam, phenylpiracetam and oxiracetam. All are available online, where their efficacy and safety are debated and reviewed on message boards and in podcasts.\n\nA number of companies now market nootropic \u201cstacks,\u201d or formulas, some of which include piracetam, herbal remedies, amino acids and citicoline, a naturally occurring brain chemical that can be taken orally as a supplement, intravenously or as a shot.\n\nBecause they are sold as nutritional supplements and natural products that refrain from making health claims, they avoid close government scrutiny.\n\nWhen Burke began ordering piracetam online five years ago, it arrived in baggies filled with white powder. \u201cIt was as if I was buying coke off the street,\u201d he recalls. These days, he buys his stack from Nootroo, a San Francisco company.\n\nBut self-experimenters such as Burke often don\u2019t restrict themselves to medication alone. Dedicated brain hackers, as they call themselves, are willing to exploit their own biology to try to sharpen their mind. Their methods include meditation, cold-water plunges, periodic fasting and high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets.\n\n\u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to maximize their cognitive ability? Who doesn\u2019t want to maximize their muscle mass?\u201d asks Murali Doraiswamy, who has led several trials of cognitive enhancers at Duke University Health System and has been an adviser to pharmaceutical and supplement manufacturers as well as the Food and Drug Administration. He attributes the demand to an increasingly knowledge-based society that values mental quickness and agility above all else.\n\nBut while some studies have found short-term benefits, Doraiswamy says there is no evidence that what are commonly known as smart drugs \u2014 of any type \u2014 improve thinking or productivity over the long run. \u201cThere\u2019s a sizable demand, but the hype around efficacy far exceeds available evidence,\u201d notes Doraiswamy, adding that, for healthy young people such as Silicon Valley go-getters, \u201cit\u2019s a zero-sum game. That\u2019s because when you up one circuit in the brain, you\u2019re probably impairing another system.\u201d\n\nEarly studies attributed a lot of short-term benefits to nootropics \u2014 so much so that in 1983, Russian scientists turned to phenylpiracetam to boost the physical and mental performance of cosmonauts during space flight.\n\nA 1999 study found that piracetam had beneficial effects on the hippocampal membranes of patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The hippocampus, an area of the brain that plays a key role in the formation of new memories, typically shows severe shrinkage with Alzheimer\u2019s. The idea that piracetam might reverse that effect was exciting.\n\nAlthough piracetam has a history of \u201crelatively few side effects,\u201d it has fallen far short of its initial promise for treating any of the illnesses associated with cognitive decline, according to Lon Schneider, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California. \u201cWe don\u2019t use it at all and never have.\u201d\n\nAs for newer nootropic drugs, there are unknown risks. \u201cPiracetam has been studied for decades,\u201d says cognitive neuroscientist Andrew Hill, the founder of a neurofeedback company in Los Angeles called Peak Brain Institute. But \u201csome of [the newer] compounds are things that some random editor found in a scientific article, copied the formula down and sent it to China and had a bulk powder developed three months later that they\u2019re selling. Please don\u2019t take it, people!\u201d\n\nFor Burke and other brain hackers, the evidence for nootropics is strong enough.\n\nBurke, who begins each morning with a Bulletproof coffee \u2014 a rich brew of caffeine with dollops of butter and coconut oil \u2014 has created a San Francisco meetup group called Peak Performance \u201cto teach all my friends in the tech space about life hacks so they can kick a--better every day.\u201d\n\nLast spring, 100 people showed up at a Peak Performance event where psychedelic psychologist James Fadiman said the key to unleashing the cognition-enhancing effects of LSD \u2014 which he listed as less anxiety, better focus, improved sleep, greater creativity \u2014 was all in the dosage. He recommended a tenth of a \u201cparty dose\u201d \u2014 enough to give you \u201cthe glow\u201d and enhance your cognitive powers without \u201cthe trip.\u201d\n\nBurke says he definitely got the glow. \u201cThe first time I took it, I was working on a business plan. I had to juggle multiple contingencies in my head, and for some reason a tree with branches jumped into my head. I was able to place each contingency on a branch, retract and go back to the trunk, and in this visual way I was able to juggle more information.\u201d\n\nNot all brain hacking involves taking a pill, though.\n\nNootrobox, a San Francisco company that markets a nootropic mix of vitamins, minerals and amino acids, promotes fasting as a way to energize brain and body.\n\n\u201cWe stumbled upon fasting as a way to optimize cognition and make yourself into a more efficient human being,\u201d says Manuel Lam, an internal medicine physician who advises Nootrobox on clinical issues. He and members of the company\u2019s executive team have implanted glucose monitors in their arms \u2014 not because they fear diabetes but because they wish to track the real-time effect of the foods they eat.\n\n\u201cFasting forces your body to deplete its glucose storage and trains it to look inside for fuel,\u201d Lam enthuses. \u201cIt\u2019s like being strapped to a solar panel. The sun is always shining on you.\u201d\n\nNootrobox employees are encouraged to fast every Tuesday, then meet for breakfast on Wednesday at a local diner. Founded by two Stanford University computer graduates, the company has initiated an international fasting group on Facebook; at last count, there were 3,500 members.\n\nResearch on animals has shown that intermittent fasting \u2014 limiting caloric intake at least two days a week \u2014 can help improve neural connections in the hippocampus and protect against the accumulation of plaque, a protein prevalent in the brains of people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Research has also shown that intermittent fasting helped reduce anxiety in mice.\n\nMark Mattson, chief of the Laboratory of Neurosciences at the National Institute on Aging, has overseen a lot of the animal studies on fasting and is impressed with the evidence \u2014 so much so that he has personally adopted a regimen of intermittent fasting.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s pretty conclusive evidence from animal studies that intermittent fasting is beneficial for brain function and resistance to aging from neurogenerative diseases,\u201d he says.\n\nFasting has been deployed since the ancient Greeks to fast-track learning. As Plato is said to have stated, \u201cI fast for greater physical and mental efficiency.\u201d The philosopher Pythagoras reportedly demanded that his students fast 40 days before attending his lectures.\n\nFar easier to take a pill.\n\nLooking for an edge\n\nVinh Ngo, a San Francisco family practice doctor who specializes in hormone therapy, has become familiar with piracetam and other nootropics through a changing patient base. His office is located in the heart of the city\u2019s tech boom and he is increasingly sought out by young, male tech workers who tell him they are interested in cognitive enhancement.\n\nNgo has experimented with piracetam himself (\u201cThe first time I tried it, I thought, \u2018Wow, this is pretty strong for a supplement.\u2019 I had a little bit of reflux, heartburn, but in general it was a cognitive enhancer. . . . I found it helpful\u201d) and the neurotransmitter DMEA (\u201cYou have an idea, it helps you finish the thought. It\u2019s for when people have difficulty finishing that last connection in the brain\u201d).\n\nBut he has also seen patients whose propensity for self-experimentation to improve cognition got out of hand. One chief executive he treated, Ngo said, developed an unhealthy predilection for albuterol, because he felt the asthma inhaler medicine kept him alert and productive long after others had quit working. Unfortunately, the drug ended up severely imbalancing his electrolytes, which can lead to dehydration, headaches, vision and cardiac problems, muscle contractions and, in extreme cases, seizures.\n\n\u201cThere is that culture here [in Silicon Valley] that relies on being smarter than your own self,\u201d Ngo says. \u201cPeople want to find an edge over their competitor \u2014 that\u2019s how they got their position in the first place. I\u2019m trying to give them a little more wiggle room \u2014 but in a safe way.\u201d\n\nHe says he screens his patients for addiction and cardiovascular problems and creates individual treatment plans based on their health histories and blood tests.\n\nThere\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach. \u201cI don\u2019t have a rubber stamp for everyone, and not everyone is a candidate\u201d for cognitive enhancement, says Ngo, who requires that his patients sign waivers acknowledging possible health risks in taking nootropics.\n\nIf, for example, someone decides to go on medication \u2014 be it Adderall, albuterol or piracetam \u2014 the patient must understand that there is a risk for high blood pressure and heart problems.\n\n\u201cI want to empower them,\u201d Ngo says, but \u201cthere\u2019s a fine line between empowering them to make their own health decisions and staying healthy.\u201d\n\nSmart drugs are here.

The participants, who were generally healthy when the study began, either took 120 milligrams of ginkgo or placebo twice a day and were routinely tested for cognitive abilities.\n\nOver more than six years of follow-up, the researchers found no evidence that ginkgo delayed or prevented normal declines in memory, language, attention, visuospatial abilities or executive functions, such as anticipating outcomes and adapting to changing situations and thinking abstractly.\n\nThese results remained the same regardless of sex, age, race or education, the researchers noted.\n\nHowever, ginkgo was safe and no serious side effects were noted, DeKosky added. \"The good news is it appeared that it was fairly safe; the bad news was it didn't seem to do anything at least as far as trying to slow down the cognitive changes of aging.\"\n\nEarlier results from the same study found that ginkgo did not prevent or slow the development of Alzheimer's or other dementias, DeKosky said.\n\nThe American Botanical council took issue with the findings, however.\n\n\"There are many significant limitations of this study,\" Mark Blumenthal, council founder and executive director said in a statement.\n\n\"First, the data being published this week are drawn from a previous clinical trial which was not designed to determine the decline in cognition.

That\u2019s the final recommendation from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) after more than a year of study and lively public comment. The recommendations were published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nAspirin has been used for more than 100 years to ease fever and relieve pain. Many people with heart disease are advised to take a low-dose aspirin every day to prevent blood clots, the cause of heart attacks and most strokes. That\u2019s called secondary prevention. Whether healthy individuals should do the same thing, a strategy called primary prevention, is controversial.\n\nThe FDA is against taking aspirin for primary prevention, arguing that the risks, including bleeding in the brain and stomach, outweigh the benefits. The USPSTF recommends it for men and women aged 50 to 59 who are at risk of heart attack or stroke. The dueling recommendations kicked off a lively debate in the medical community.\n\nDespite the clashing opinions, experts agree on two things: Aspirin should be just one part of an overall strategy to prevent heart attack and stroke that includes weight control, healthy eating, exercising, and not smoking. And don\u2019t take aspirin without talking with your doctor.\n\nBeyond that, here\u2019s a sample of expert opinions.\n\nKirsten Bibbins-Domingo: Task force says some will benefit\n\nCharles H. Hennekens: Balance between benefits and harms still hazy\n\nDeepak L. Bhatt: No easy way to identify who will benefit or be harmed\n\nCynthia Boyd and Milo Puhan: Add personal preferences to the equation\n\nFreek W.A. Verheugt: Even doctors are confused\n\nBy Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo: Taking aspirin is easy, but deciding whether or not to take aspirin for prevention is complex. Aspirin can help prevent heart attacks, strokes, and colorectal cancer, but it also increases the risk of bleeding.\n\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force found that the benefits of taking low-dose aspirin daily clearly outweigh the harms for people who are 50 to 59 years old, who have increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and who are not at increased risk for bleeding. People who are 60 to 69 can also benefit from taking aspirin, but the risks for bleeding are higher in this age group. Some older individuals may be less likely to benefit from aspirin\u2019s ability to prevent colorectal cancer because it takes about 10 years of daily aspirin for it to affect this risk.\n\nIt is important to note that this draft recommendation applies to people who are not at increased risk for bleeding, have at least a 10-year life expectancy, and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily. Also, it is meant for people who do not already have cardiovascular disease.\n\nKirsten Bibbins-Domingo, MD, is vice-chair of the US Preventive Services Task Force. She is also professor of medicine and of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nBy Charles H. Hennekens: After more than 25 years of research on aspirin for primary prevention, we are not much further along than we were after the landmark findings from the Physicians Health Study in 1988. We know that taking aspirin will prevent a first heart attack and a first stroke, but we also know that aspirin can cause serious bleeding, mainly in the gastrointestinal system and, more rarely, in the brain.\n\nIn a meta-analysis of the six major randomized trials of aspirin for primary prevention, among more than 95,000 participants, serious cardiovascular events occurred in 0.51 percent of participants taking aspirin and 0.57 percent of those not taking aspirin. That corresponds to a 20 percent relative reduction in risk. At the same time, serious bleeding events increased from 0.07 percent among non-aspirin takers to 0.10 percent among those taking aspirin, or a 40 percent relative increase in risk.\n\nAlthough the totality of evidence is incomplete, it appears that aspirin has net benefits when the absolute 10-year risk of having a cardiovascular event is greater than 10 percent. Unfortunately, fewer than 5,000 of the trial participants have been in that risk category. (Individuals can calculate their 10-year risk using a relatively simple calculator from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute or a more complex one from the American Heart Association.)\n\nThese calculators don\u2019t tell the whole story. Clinicians should evaluate additional risks and benefits. For example, some individuals are at higher risk of bleeding, such as those with a history of ulcers. Others are at higher risk of having a cardiovascular event because they are obese, physically inactive, or have a family history of such events.\n\nSeveral ongoing trials will provide information on aspirin\u2019s benefit-to-risk ratio. This information is essential for making rational guidelines for aspirin in primary prevention.\n\nCharles H. Hennekens, MD, is professor of medicine at Florida Atlantic University. He was the principal investigator of the Physician\u2019s Health Study, which was the first to demonstrate that aspirin prevents a first heart attack in men, and the Women\u2019s Health Study, which was the first to demonstrate that aspirin prevents a first stroke in women.\n\nBy Deepak L. Bhatt: The use of aspirin for primary prevention is one of the most complex issues in medicine today. That\u2019s ironic because aspirin is ubiquitous and most patients perceive it to be safe and harmless. After all, it is sold over the counter.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: The lower an individual\u2019s risk of a future heart attack or ischemic stroke, the less he or she will benefit from taking daily low-dose aspirin. Yet the odds that aspirin will cause a problem, such as bleeding, remain relatively steady. That means for some low-risk individuals, taking daily aspirin could do more harm than good.\n\nIf there was a foolproof way to identify individuals at high risk for a future heart attack or stroke, as well as those at high risk for developing complications, we would know who should be taking aspirin for primary prevention and who should not. Unfortunately, no such tool exists.\n\nMany patients \u2014 and many health care providers \u2014 believe that the aspirin-for-primary-prevention issue is settled. Not so. In fact, several clinical trials now underway are looking at this very question. These include the ASCEND, TIPS-3, and ASPREE trials.\n\nThe data on aspirin for preventing colorectal cancer are provocative, but are even less robust than for primary prevention of cardiovascular events.\n\nDeepak L. Bhatt, MD, is executive director of interventional cardiovascular programs at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital Heart and Vascular Center and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.\n\nBy Cynthia Boyd and Milo Puhan: Combining guidelines for the use of aspirin to prevent three different conditions \u2014 heart attack, stroke, and colorectal cancer \u2014 into a single recommendation makes good sense for patients. But making such recommendations is difficult because they must take into account so many factors.\n\nPersonal preferences are one very important factor. Say your mother had a disabling stroke, and you are willing to do everything you can to prevent having a stroke, even if it puts you at risk of bleeding. This might tip the balance in favor of taking aspirin. In contrast, someone who isn\u2019t worried about having a cardiovascular event or developing colorectal cancer might want to stay away from aspirin to avoid bleeding.\n\nWith an international team of colleagues, we created an online tool that calculates whether the benefits of aspirin for primary prevention (preventing heart attack, ischemic stroke, and cancer) are greater than the harms (severe hemorrhagic stroke and severe gastrointestinal bleeds). The tool is based on research we recently published in BMC Medicine.\n\nTo use the tool, an individual enters his or her age group and sex and uses sliders to show how worried he or she is about six outcomes:\n\nGreen, orange, and red boxes represent the benefit-harm balance corresponding to the user\u2019s information.\n\nFor now, this tool is for research purposes only. It must be verified before it is ready for prime time. But it suggests a direction for decision aids that can help individuals choose whether to adopt preventive strategies like aspirin that come with potentially harmful side effects.\n\nCynthia M. Boyd, MD, is associate professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Milo A. Puhan, MD, is director of the Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute and professor of epidemiology and public health at the University of Zurich.\n\nBy Freek W.A. Verheugt: Who should take aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or ischemic stroke is a complex issue \u2014 even for cardiologists. A recent report with data on 120 medical practices serving 69,000 patients found huge variation in doctors\u2019 approaches. In some practices, 70 percent of patients were inappropriately taking aspirin. Part of my job, and that of other cardiologists and clinicians, is to help our patients make good choices about aspirin, guiding those at high risk toward aspirin use and those at low risk away from it.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that other therapies, such as statins, have also been proven to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events. These are often used in combination with aspirin. As I showed in a commentary in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, when combined with a statin, aspirin\u2019s net benefit in primary prevention is almost completely lost.\n\nFreek W.A.

She had also been taking the corticosteroid prednisone for two decades.\n\nExperts have already noticed an uptick in the incidence of this rare but devastating condition in patients using bisphosphonates.\n\nAccording to an editorial accompanying the study, this complication occurs in about 5 percent of cancer patients who are taking a high-dose bisphosphonate (Zometa or Aredia) to control or prevent spread of malignancy to the bone. It is much rarer in people who take a lower-dose bisphosphonate (such as Actonel, Boniva or Fosamax) for osteoporosis.\n\nThe 88-year-old woman described in the journal report had been experiencing pain in her jaw for a year and was subsequently diagnosed with osteonecrosis, a debilitating \"death\" of bone due to loss of blood flow.\n\nAfter eight weeks of treatment with Forteo, though, the pain went away and the osteonecrosis resolved, reported the authors, from Austin Health in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nThe editorial pointed out, however, that Forteo should not be used in patients whose cancer has already spread to the bone, as it might prompt even more spread.\n\nIt's also possible that the corticosteroid therapy she was taking could have contributed to the woman's bone loss, the authors stated.\n\nThe second paper involved 40 patients with severe gum disease that had affected their jaws, all of whom first underwent surgery on their jaw. They were then randomized to receive either Forteo or a placebo. All participants took calcium and vitamin D as well.\n\n\"These were patients with severe periodontal disease but who were otherwise systemically healthy,\" said study senior author Dr. Laurie K. McCauley, chair of the department of periodontic and oral medicine at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\n\nAfter six weeks of therapy, patients in the Forteo arm saw greater healing of their jawbone and this continued throughout one year of follow-up.\n\n\"There was a significant improvement in clinical measures of gum and bone,\" McCauley stated.\n\nBut, she pointed out, Forteo is not yet approved for this indication, so \"we can't recommend it next week.\"\n\nRight now, a bone graft is probably the most common type of therapy for this type of bone loss, she said.\n\n\"I think that it's really an important important proof-of-concept that you can inject locally and get a response,\" said Dr. Rena D'Souza, chair of biomedical sciences at Texas A&M Health Science Center Baylor College of Dentistry in Dallas. \"We could not only use this approach for the treatment of periodontal disease where the disease enters the bone and gum. but also other forms of periodontal disease.\"\n\n\"Bisphosphonates cut back on blood flow and blood vessels so that cancer doesn't have a chance,\" she said. \"That is why it's used very effectively for cancer but if you happen to injure the bone or take out a tooth you really need the blood vessels. The bone cells don't have the ability to lay down new bone.\"\n\nThe American Academy of Periodontology has more on gum disease.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story does not engage in disease-mongering.

And dietitians say too much chocolate can be harmful.\n\nStill, two of the three studies analyzed in the review provide yet another suggestion that health benefits lurk in chocolate, dark chocolate in particular, said review co-author Dr. Gustavo Saposnik.\n\nIf choosing among white chocolate, milk chocolate or dark chocolate, \"I'd definitely go with the dark chocolate,\" said Saposnik, director of the Stroke Research Unit at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto.\n\nThe review authors, who found three studies on chocolate consumption and stroke between 2001 and 2009, are scheduled to report their findings at the American Academy of Neurology's annual meeting in Toronto in April.\n\nOne study found no significant association between chocolate consumption and risk of stroke or death from stroke. But another found that the stroke rate was 22 percent lower in people who ate chocolate once a week, and a third reported that death from stroke was 46 percent lower in those who ate 50 grams of chocolate once a week.\n\nThe health benefit may come from antioxidants called flavonoids that are present in chocolate, Saposnik said. Antioxidants are thought to prevent cell damage.\n\nIn years past, \"the message was that chocolate consumption might be associated with higher LDL [bad] cholesterol or perhaps higher incidence of cardiovascular disease,\" he said. \"Today, we know that all chocolates are not the same.\"\n\nSo, should you and your sweetheart add dark chocolate to your diet? \"I'm not sure we can provide any recommendation at this time,\" Saposnik said.\n\nFor one thing, it's possible that some factor other than chocolate could be helping lower the risk of stroke. Those who eat more chocolate could be wealthier and have better access to health care, for instance, or go to the gym more often.\n\nSaposnik said more studies will help clarify the association between chocolate and stroke risk.\n\nFor now, said registered dietitian Katie Clark, \"caution should be taken not to promote chocolate as a health food,\" even though it's fine in moderation.\n\nChocolate is a major source of saturated fat, which raises bad cholesterol and boosts heart disease risk, said Clark, an assistant clinical professor at the University of California at San Francisco.\n\nBut Keith-Thomas Ayoob, an associate professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City who studies nutrition, said chocolate does have its benefits. \"Several studies indicate that even a little chocolate can help reduce blood pressure and increase blood flow through the arteries.

But few of those suicide survivors get the follow-up care they need at a time when they are especially likely to attempt suicide again.\n\nNow, a study shows that a simple intervention conducted by staff in emergency departments can reduce the risk of future attempts. The intervention involves creating a safety plan for each patient and following up with phone calls after discharge.\n\n\"It reduced the odds of suicidal behavior by half,\" says Barbara Stanley, a psychologist at Columbia University and the lead author of the study. \"That's a phenomenal difference.\"\n\nThe study, which was published Wednesday in JAMA Psychiatry, included 1,200 patients at five Veterans Affairs hospitals around the country. The findings offer a way for hospitals and clinics to help reduce the rising numbers of death by suicide across the country.\n\n\"When someone goes to the emergency room for a suicide attempt, they are at risk of another suicide attempt for the next three months,\" says Stanley. \"It's like a ticking time bomb.\"\n\nThis is the first large-scale study of the Safety Planning Intervention, which Stanley and her group developed in 2008 and which has been adopted at hospitals and clinics around the country. It can be provided by a physician, a nurse or a social worker and requires very little training.\n\n\"The interesting thing about the Safety Planning Intervention is that it is a relatively brief intervention and can be used in a lot of different [health care] settings,\" says Brian Ahmedani, director of behavioral health research at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, who wasn't involved in the new study.\n\nMany health care systems are starting to think about ways to prevent suicide, he says. That's because, as his own work has shown, almost 83 percent of people who die by suicide make a health care visit in the year before their death. Yet only 50 percent of those people have been diagnosed with a mental illness.\n\nThe intervention studied by Stanley and her group starts in the ER or a clinic, before the suicidal patient is released. First, a health care professional talks with the patient and tries to understand that person's warning signs for a suicide attempt.\n\n\"If they've grappled with being suicidal, they know what their warning signs are,\" says Stanley. For example, she says, someone might say, \" 'I find that I'm staying in my room, not answering the phone, not answering texts, not answering emails.' That could be a warning sign.\" Others might have repeated thoughts that they're not worthy.\n\nThe next step is for the patient \u2014 with help from the clinician \u2014 to come up with a set of coping strategies to help get through moments of intense suicidal ideation.\n\nFor most people, this intense state only lasts from a few minutes to a couple of hours, she says.\n\nThe coping strategy could be something as simple as playing video games, watching TV or talking to a loved one.\n\nIf people contemplating suicide can distract themselves with something they enjoy doing, they can bypass that narrow window during which suicidal thoughts can overpower them, notes Stanley. \"For suicidal people, the passage of time is their friend,\" she says.\n\nThe provider also tries to persuade patients to remove or distance themselves from their means of suicide. For example, if they own a gun, they should lock it away or give it to someone who can keep it away from them. \"If you make it really hard to use whatever means you were going to use, time passes and you give a chance for suicidal thoughts to subside,\" she says.\n\nSafety planning includes follow-up phone calls with the patient \u2014 the first call is made within 72 hours of being discharged from the ER. The provider asks the patient how the safety plan is being used and helps revise it if needed. The provider also makes sure the patient sees a mental health care provider for long-term care. A provider keeps calling until the patient has had a second appointment with a therapist or counselor.\n\nThat follow-up is key, says Julie Goldstein Grumet, a psychologist at the Zero Suicide Institute at the Education Development Center, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit.\n\n\"People often fall off and they don't follow up on their referrals,\" she says. \"And the times during these transitions from acute care settings is one of the highest risk times of suicides.\"\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, Stanley's team looked at five VA emergency departments across the country that used it and compared the outcomes with four VA emergency rooms that simply discharge patients after stabilizing them.\n\nAmong the nearly 1,200 people who received the intervention, half as many people had made suicide attempts (or had come very close) as those in the control group. In other words, the intervention had nearly halved the risk of suicide in the six months after discharge. Two-thirds of the people in the treatment group had used their safety plans, and they were also twice as likely to get follow-up mental health treatment when compared with the control group.\n\n\"The study is incredibly important ... because it shows brief interventions work,\" says Goldstein Grumet.\n\nRick, a father in Missouri, says a safety plan may have saved his 12-year-old daughter's life. (NPR is leaving off his last name to protect his daughter's privacy.)\n\nIn September 2017, she came very close to taking her own life. When he found out about this from her school principal the next day, Rick rushed her to the ER at Mercy Hospital Jefferson. \"The whole process was overwhelming, because you have your 12-year-old who's wanting to end her life,\" Rick says. \"And she'd not shared any of that with us.\"\n\nThe hospital wasn't part of the new study but was also using a safety planning intervention as part of its efforts to prevent suicides.\n\n\"The crisis counselor did such an amazing job of setting up a safety plan that my daughter felt comfortable with,\" he says.\n\nHe says his daughter didn't want to talk to him or her mother about her struggles, but she agreed to communicate with them in other ways. During times when she felt her urge to take her own life coming back, she agreed to watch TV with her mother or call or text her father.\n\nRick says she usually sends a specific emoji when she is having a bad day. And he responds by distracting her with something completely different.\n\nHe says she also agreed to use a crisis help line if things escalated.\n\n\"It was something that she could follow through with,\" he says. \"It gave her some confidence and it gave me some confidence.\"\n\nHe says the plan has helped his daughter get through her suicidal phase and even slowly open up to her parents.\n\n\"That's what is so powerful about a safety plan,\" says Ahmedani. \"The patient is the author of their safety plan, but it's guided by a provider.\"\n\nAs part of the 2012 National Strategy For Suicide Prevention, many health care providers have adopted the approaches to prevention outlined in the Zero Suicide Initiative, which includes safety planning based on previous evidence showing it works.\n\nWhile safety planning has begun to be used across the country, it ought to be adopted universally, says Goldstein Grumet.\n\n\"It is a brief intervention that hospital workers, primary care staff, outpatient behavioral health, can all be trained in to utilize,\" she says.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States overall and suicide rates have increased by more than 30% in half of U.S. states since 1999.

The new analysis singles out adults aged 75 and older and confirms that those with high blood pressure also benefit from the lower pressure target similar to the larger group studied in the earlier research: non-diabetic adults aged 50 and older. These additional results of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) appear in the current online issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).\n\nThe study shows that for adults aged 75 years and older with high blood pressure, a systolic blood pressure goal of less than 120 mm Hg reduced rates of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and heart failure, as well as stroke, by 33 percent. This lower blood pressure goal also reduced the risk of death among this group by 32 percent, compared to a target systolic pressure of 140 mm Hg. The benefits of a more aggressive blood pressure intervention occurred in both frail (individuals with several impairments or disorders) and non-frail older participants, the researchers note.\n\nAbout three-fourths of the U.S. population aged 75 and older live with hypertension, a leading contributor to cardiovascular disease and death. Although the standard blood pressure treatment goal is 140 mm Hg, various medical panels have provided inconsistent guidance about what is the optimal blood pressure goal for the senior population. One group has recommended a target blood pressure of 160 mm Hg for persons aged 80 or older, while another recommended a target of 150 mm Hg for adults aged 60 or older. Other experts have supported keeping the standard treatment goal at 140 mm Hg.\n\nTo address this issue, the SPRINT study tapped more than 2,600 volunteers aged 75 and older, assigning half to a target blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg and half to target of less than 120 mm Hg. While study participants with the lower blood pressure goal appeared to have better cardiovascular outcomes overall, the researchers caution all other hypertension patients to talk to their doctor to determine whether this lower goal is best for their individual care.\n\nIn addition to primary sponsorship by the NHLBI, SPRINT is co-sponsored by the NIH's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and the National Institute on Aging.\n\nWHO: Lawrence Fine, M.D., chief of the Clinical Applications and Prevention Branch at NHLBI and a co-author of the study, is available to comment on the findings and implications of this research.\n\nCONTACT: For more information or to schedule an interview, please contact the NHLBI Office of Science Policy, Engagement, Education, and Communications at 301-496-5449 or nhlbi_news@nhlbi.nih.gov (link sends e-mail).\n\nAbout the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI): NHLBI, a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), plans, conducts, and supports research related to the causes, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of heart, blood vessel, lung, and blood diseases; and sleep disorders.

However, this phase 4 trial, which used Avastin (bevacizumab) plus chemotherapy in a large population found these problems were minimal.\n\nPhase 4 trials are done after a drug is on the market, to look for any new problems.\n\n\"Today we have a new option to treat non-squamous lung cancer, incorporating Avastin in chemotherapy regimens and in maintenance therapy,\" said lead researcher Dr. Lucio Crino, director of medical oncology at S. Maria della Misericordia Hospital in Perugia, Italy.\n\n\"The practical implication is the possibility to incorporate Avastin with any chemotherapy regimen in the frontline therapy of metastatic non-squamous lung cancer,\" he added.\n\nThe report, which is funded by the maker of Avastin, F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., is published in the July 20 issue of The Lancet Oncology. The funder was involved in study design, coordination of data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, and writing of the report, the journal noted.\n\nAdvanced non-small-cell lung cancer is a common cancer that kills 1.18 million people every year worldwide, according to background information in the study. Avastin is a so-called monoclonal antibody that works by blocking vascular endothelial growth factor A, which stimulates the growth of the tumor's blood supply.\n\nWhen used as an adjunct to chemotherapy, Avastin had already shown cancer-fighting activity in two phase 3 trials, the researchers noted.\n\nFor the study, Crino's team studied Avastin in more than 2,200 patients with advanced or recurrent non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. The patients were treated at centers in 40 countries around the world.\n\nThese patients were given the drug every three weeks along with standard chemotherapy, for up to six cycles. Patients were then treated with Avastin alone until the cancer began to progress (\"maintenance\" therapy).\n\nThe researchers reported few clinically significant adverse events, meaning that most were no greater than what one would expect in the general population. One percent of patients experienced bleeding in the lungs and 4 percent had bleeding, Crino's group found.\n\nOverall, 3 percent of the patients died due to adverse events associated with Avastin. These included 1 percent who had blood clots and 1 percent who suffered bleeding.\n\nOther serious adverse events associated with Avastin were blood clots in the lungs and nosebleeds, low white blood cell counts, fever along with a low white blood cell count and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), all of which occurred in 1 percent of the patients.\n\nDr. Robert Pirker, from the department of medicine at the Medical University of Vienna in Austria, and author of an accompanying journal editorial, said that Avastin \"can be safely given when certain precautions are taken.\"\n\nHowever, several issues remain to be determined, including the optimal dose and the role of maintenance therapy with Avastin, he said.\n\n\"In addition, it is unknown whether bevacizumab [Avastin] increases survival when added to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer,\" Pirker said.\n\nOverall, Avastin, like several other targeted agents have led to therapeutic advances in lung cancer, he added. \"Hurdles in clinical development do occur but -- as shown for bevacizumab -- can be overcome,\" Pirker said.\n\nAnother expert, Dr. Norman H. Edelman, chief medical officer at the American Lung Association, and professor of preventive medicine, internal medicine, physiology & biophysics at Stony Brook University in New York, called the study \"very good bread-and-butter clinical research.\"\n\nThe efficacy of the drug has been proven previously, he noted, but this study provides an in-depth analysis of Avastin's safety profile under \"real life\" conditions, he added.\n\n\"Too often this step is shortcircuited in the rush to market of a new drug and we have to await the laborious collection of after-market data to find the real dangers of many new drugs,\" Edelman said.\n\n\"So, the researchers and sponsors are to be congratulated for doing this study. They find that there are real deleterious side effects but that they are manageable, and conclude the drug is worth using under the proper circumstances,\" he said.\n\nAvastin is in the spotlight Tuesday for another reason, as well. U.S. regulators could rescind approval of the drug for the treatment of breast cancer, based on follow-up studies reported Friday that failed to show the medication shrank tumors or extended lives, according to published reports.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday will ask a panel of outside experts to review the evidence on the Roche drug, the Associated Press said.

In about half of patients with melanoma that has spread, tumor growth is caused by genetic mutations that keep the BRAF protein -- part of the MAPK cell growth pathway -- constantly activated. Drugs that inhibit BRAF activity can rapidly stop and reverse tumor growth in about 90 percent of patients. But the response is temporary in most cases, and tumor growth resumes in six or seven months, the researchers explained.\n\nPrevious research suggested that this drug resistance develops because the MAPK pathway gets turned back on through activation of MEK, another protein that is part off the MAPK pathway.\n\n\"We investigated this (drug) combination because of research we and others have conducted into the molecular underpinnings of resistance to BRAF inhibitor therapy,\" study lead author Dr. Keith Flaherty, of the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, said in a hospital news release.\n\nThe phase 1 and 2 study was sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline, which developed both drugs.\n\n\"We found that adding the MEK inhibitor trametinib to BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib clearly delays the emergence of resistance. In fact, the combination was at least twice as effective as BRAF inhibition alone,\" he said.\n\nOne expert agreed that the results were encouraging.\n\n\"This study addresses the problem of resistance to the mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK] pathway. This study combined dabrafenib [a selective BRAF inhibitor] and trametinib, [a selective MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor]. These drugs can be safely combined, and the survival was significantly improved without untoward side effects,\" said Dr. Michele Green, a dermatologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\nThe study was conducted at 14 sites in the United States and Australia and included 162 patients who received different dose combinations of the drugs: two daily 150 milligram (mg) doses of dabrafenib plus one 2 mg dose of trametinib; the same dabrafenib dose with a 1 mg dose of trametinib; or treatment with dabrafenib alone.\n\nPatients who received dabrafenib alone were able to receive the full-dose combination treatment if their cancer resumed progression.\n\nTreatment with both combinations of dabrafenib and trametinib led to a four-month longer delay in drug resistance than treatment with dabrafenib alone. After one year of treatment, 41 percent of patients receiving the full-dose combination treatment had no progression of their melanoma, compared with 9 percent of those receiving dabrafenib alone.\n\nAmong patients receiving the combination treatment, the development of side effects such as skin rash and a less dangerous type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma was similar to that typically seen in patients taking only one of the drugs.\n\nThe study was scheduled for presentation Saturday at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Vienna and simultaneous publication in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThe drug combination is now being tested in a larger phase 3 study, which is required for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval.\n\nThe American Cancer Society has more about melanoma.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story notes that the treatment applies only to patients with a specific mutation that can be targeted by the drug.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Scientists working to develop a 'game-changing' new antibiotic have made a significant advance towards creating commercially viable drug treatments by producing two simplified synthetic versions of the substance which are just as potent at killing superbugs like MRSA as its natural form.\n\nThe breakthrough by researchers at the University of Lincoln, UK, marks another important step to realising the potential of teixobactin in aiding the global fight against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Teixobactin is a recently discovered natural antibiotic which many in the international scientific community believe could lead to creation of the first commercially viable new antibiotic drug in 30 years.\n\nThe Lincoln team has successfully synthesized new simplified versions of teixobactin which harness the same powerful antibiotic effects in a way that could be produced on a commercial scale. Their findings are published in the Royal Society of Chemistry's journal, Chemical Science.\n\nUntil now, scientists attempting to synthesise teixobactin believed they needed to use cationic (or positively charged) amino acids which bind to the bacterial target using a 'side chain'. This meant they had to use either the very rare amino acid found naturally in teixobactin, called enduracididine, or alternative ones which had lower potency against superbugs.\n\nEach amino acid sits at a specific place in teixobactin's structure, and the Lincoln team has now successfully replaced enduracididine - which holds position ten - with two alternative amino acids which are not positively charged. These amino acids lack the 'binding' part, over-turning the prior understanding that enduracididine is essential for to so-called 'target binding' to be highly potent against superbugs.\n\nWith this new knowledge, synthesised versions of teixobactin can be more easily developed, taking the process from up to 30 hours to just ten minutes for a single coupling step - a significant step towards turning teixobactin into a viable new drug. Importantly, the two new simplified forms of teixobactin have also proven to have identical potency against superbugs as the natural form of teixobactin.\n\nDr Ishwar Singh, a specialist in novel drug design and development from the University of Lincoln's School of Pharmacy, is leading the research team. He explained: \"When teixobactin was discovered it was ground breaking in itself as a new antibiotic which kills bacteria without detectable resistance including superbugs such as MRSA. We have been investigating a way to simplify the design while retaining the high potency against resistant bacteria such as MRSA.\n\n\"This simplified design and more efficient synthesise will enable work to be carried out at a commercial level. Enduracididine was severely limiting our ability to do this because of its scarcity, a complex multistep synthesis, and long and repetitive steps of between 16 and 30 hours with high failure rate and very low yields.\n\n\"We needed to make a change to the structure so that we could make the molecule more viable for drug development. We had tried replacing it with other amino acids with a similar make up, but they all were less potent in comparison to the natural form of teixobactin. Now, we have discovered that we can in fact use amino acids which are structurally different, and are commercially-available. They are also 16 times more potent than a clinically-used antibiotic in killing the superbug MRSA, and they were also highly potent against other antibiotic-resistant infections, such as vancomycin resistant enterococci, and tuberculosis.\"\n\nThe work builds on the success of the team's pioneering research to tackle antimicrobial resistance over the past 18 months. Dr Singh is working with colleagues from the School of Life Sciences and the School of Chemistry at the University of Lincoln to develop teixobactins into a viable drug.\n\nIt has been predicted that by 2050 an additional 10 million people will succumb to drug resistant infections each year. The development of new antibiotics which can be used as a last resort when other drugs are ineffective is therefore a crucial area of study for healthcare researchers around the world.", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The release doesn\u2019t disease monger.

But it does suggest that laparoscopy could actually save thousands of dollars for some patients, when all costs \u2014 including physician fees, hospital fees and readmissions \u2014 are considered.\n\n\u201cYou really want to look at the total cost, because that\u2019s what society has to pay,\u201d said Dr. Dmitry Oleynikov, who heads the Center for Advanced Surgical Technology at Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha and led the new study.\n\n\u201cOverall, this study shows benefit from laparoscopy on every aspect, including cost,\u201d he told Reuters Health.\n\nAppendix removals are one of the most common surgeries in the U.S., with some 750,000 procedures done every year, Oleynikov added.\n\nWith his colleagues, he looked back at some 40,000 such surgeries done at dozens of academic medical centers in the U.S. \u2014 roughly 14,000 open procedures and 26,000 laparoscopic ones.\n\nFor uncomplicated cases of appendicitis, in which the appendix is still intact, the tabs for the two surgeries came out about the same, at just over $7,800.\n\nPeople who had the laparoscopic procedures also had lower death rates, at 0.07 percent versus 0.17 percent, fewer readmissions and a slightly shorter stay at the hospital.\n\nWhen the appendix had burst, however, the open surgery racked up a considerably higher bill.

He is vice president for health care outcomes and policy at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, N.Y. Edge was co-chair of the panel that developed the new guidelines.\n\n\"The guideline is timely,\" said Dr. Janna Andrews, an attending physician in radiation medicine at Norwell Health Cancer Institute, in Lake Success, N.Y. \"The field of post-mastectomy radiation is changing. It's always up for discussion now as to who needs [post-mastectomy radiation therapy].\"\n\nThe new guidelines help clarify what used to be a gray area, Andrews explained. \"In the past, if a woman had a small tumor, less than 5 centimeters, and not more than three or four positive lymph nodes, many doctors would say she does not need [post-mastectomy radiation therapy],\" she said.\n\nThe guidelines don't offer a single formula for which patients need radiation therapy, Edge noted. But they do focus on the group of women for whom there is the most debate about the value of radiation.\n\n\"There is a great deal of controversy about whether women with one, two or three lymph nodes [with cancer] have sufficient risk to warrant radiation,\" he said. \"For women with four or more lymph nodes involved, everyone would recommend radiation.\"\n\nThe guidelines also strongly support input from all specialists who treat breast cancer in making the decision about radiation treatment. That typically includes the surgeon, radiation physician and an oncologist.\n\nDoctors need to weigh the risks and benefits, Edge added. Side effects can include redness of the skin, swelling and skin breakdown severe enough to compromise future breast reconstruction, he explained.\n\nEdge said that doctors need to consider patients individually. For instance, he explained, ''a woman 65 who has microscopic involvement in a single lymph node and an estrogen-receptor positive cancer would be very different from a 38-year-old who has three lymph nodes involved and so-called triple-negative breast cancer.\" The younger woman, he said, would typically be advised to get radiation.\n\nThe older woman, because her risk is lower, should have a discussion with her doctor to decide if the benefit outweighs the risk, Edge noted.\n\nAndrews said that one take-home message for patients is to expect the surgeon to have consulted with the radiation oncologist and others on her team. If a woman's doctor tells her she does not need radiation after a mastectomy, the woman should be told why and she should ask if the radiation oncologist weighed in on the decision.\n\nEdge was a panel representative from the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which created the guidelines along with the American Society for Radiation Oncology and the Society of Surgical Oncology.\n\nAll three groups published the guidelines online this week in their respective journals: the Journal of Clinical Oncology, Practical Radiation Oncology and the Annals of Surgical Oncology.\n\nTo learn more about radiation in breast cancer treatment, visit BreastCancer.org.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering here.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Much of the buzz over mobile health interventions seems to be about how we can use an ever-growing variety of shiny new smartphone apps and sensors to better manage our health.\n\nBut texting, that old-school technology, may deserve some of that spotlight, too.\n\nGetting texts with motivating and informative messages led patients with coronary heart disease to make behavior changes like exercising more and smoking less, according to a study published Tuesday in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association.

It can be hard to view those everyday decisions in light of more distant consequences, like having another heart attack or not living as long a life as desired. Encouraging text messages may help to inform those everyday decisions and keep a bigger goal in mind.\n\nChow and Eapen say the study has its limitations. It can't tell us whether text messaging could eventually lead to fewer subsequent heart attacks among the patients receiving those messages or whether the positive health outcomes would continue past the six-month study window.

But working out the unique mutations of each person\u2019s cancer, a time-consuming and complicated process, must first be identified before a vaccine can be developed for them.\n\nIn two studies published in the journal Nature, researchers have shown promising results from Phase I clinical trials. While they are very small scale\u2014one was on six participants, the other 13\u2014the findings mean researchers can move ahead with the vaccines, which could potentially lead to new, more effective cancer treatments.\n\nIn the first study, scientists led by Catherine Wu developed a vaccine for people who had been treated for melanoma with surgery, but who had received no other treatment. They sequenced the DNA from the tumors then created a personalized vaccine that contained neoantigens (targets for the immune response) for predicted mutations.\n\nSix patients were given a full series of vaccinations, including five priming injections and two booster vaccinations. Four of the six had no recurrence of the disease after 25 months.\n\nIn the other study, by Ugur Sahin and colleagues, tested a personalized vaccine based on RNA (an essential link in the production of proteins encoded by DNA). They used a similar approach to Wu and her team to identify the mutations, then tested the vaccine on 13 people who were being treated for melanoma. All participants were found to have a boosted immunity against the antigens specific to their tumors. Eight were still tumor free after 23 months.\n\nBoth vaccines were deemed safe and are expected to be taken forward for further research.\n\nThese vaccines are not necessarily the future of personalized cancer treatment.

Studies so far have come to conflicting conclusions as to whether vitamin E or other antioxidants may influence older adults\u2019 risk of dementia.\n\nHowever, the new study followed participants for a longer period than most previous studies on antioxidants and dementia. And it supports findings from some previous research that dietary vitamin E, in particular, might be related to a lower risk of dementia.\n\nResearchers have been interested in whether antioxidants like vitamins E and C and beta-carotene might help stave off dementia because, in theory, their actions might interfere with the process of brain-cell degeneration.\n\nAntioxidants neutralize unstable forms of oxygen called reactive oxygen species that can damage cells throughout the body. Reactive oxygen species are produced naturally in the body, as byproducts of metabolism; because the brain is an area of high metabolic activity, it is thought to be particularly vulnerable to accumulating oxidative damage over a lifetime.\n\nHowever, studies so far have come to mixed conclusions as to whether older adults with a high dietary intake of various antioxidants have a lower risk of dementia. And clinical trials looking at the effects of antioxidant supplements have found no evidence that they cut Alzheimer\u2019s risk.\n\nFor the new study, researchers led by Dr. Monique Breteler, of Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, used data from 5,395 adults age 55 and older who were dementia-free at the start of the study. At that point, they were interviewed about their usual diet habits, which the researchers used to estimate their intake of vitamins C and E and beta-carotene.\n\nOver the next decade, 465 study participants were diagnosed with dementia, including 365 with Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nAmong the one-third of men and women with the highest vitamin E intakes from food, 120 developed dementia. Of the third with the lowest intakes, 164 were diagnosed with dementia.\n\nWhen Breteler\u2019s team considered a number of other factors \u2014 including participants\u2019 age, education, weight, and smoking and drinking habits \u2014 high vitamin E intake was linked to a one-quarter reduction in dementia risk.\n\nThe one-third of study participants with the highest vitamin E consumption typically got 18.5 milligrams (mg) per day, just over the recommended daily intake of 15 mg.\n\nThe researchers acknowledge that they cannot exclude the possibility that factors other than vitamin E explain the connection. Nor is it clear why vitamin E, but not vitamin C or beta-carotene, was linked to a lower dementia risk.\n\nBut the finding is in line with a previous study of U.S. adults that found that a higher intake of vitamin E, but not vitamin C or beta-carotene, was related to a lower risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s over two years.\n\nAccording to Breteler\u2019s team, studies should continue to look at the relationship between antioxidant intake and dementia \u2014 including whether antioxidant consumption at different points in life might have different effects on dementia risk.\n\nFood sources of vitamin E include wheat germ, nuts such as almonds and hazelnuts, vegetable oils such as sunflower and safflower oils, and some green vegetables, such as spinach and broccoli.\n\nIn the current study, participants\u2019 primary vitamin E sources included vegetable oils, margarine and butter.\n\nIt is unlikely that people could get too much vitamin E from food.

It usually starts as a rash on one side of the face or body, often causing pain, itching and tingling. About a million cases occur in the United States each year, and attacks can last two to four weeks.\n\n\"Even after the rash has healed, the pain can last for months or even years,\" said lead study author HungFu Tseng, a research scientist at the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research and Evaluation in Pasadena, Calif.\n\nZostavax, as the vaccine is called, was approved in 2006, based on the results of clinical trials. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the shot for eligible people aged 60 and older.\n\nTseng's team wanted to test the vaccine's real-world performance, so they compared 75,761 vaccinated members of the Kaiser Permanente health plan to 227,283 members who elected not to have the shot. Kaiser funded the study.\n\nIn vaccinated individuals, the rate of shingles was 6.4 cases per 1,000 people in a year while it was twice that -- 13 per 1,000 -- in the unvaccinated population, the investigators found.\n\nThe vaccine also reduced the risk of ophthalmic herpes zoster (infection that affects the eye) by 63 percent and hospitalization by 65 percent.\n\nThose who had been vaccinated were more likely to be white, female and in better overall health than the unvaccinated people, the researchers noted. Lack of awareness, concerns about effectiveness or safety, and cost may have kept some people from getting the shot, Tseng said.\n\n\"People 60 and over can consider talking to their physician about the possibility of receiving the vaccine to reduce their risk, and the doctor can evaluate if they are eligible,\" said Tseng.\n\nPatients with leukemia, lymphoma, HIV or an allergy to any ingredients in the vaccine are ineligible for the shot.\n\n\"It does bolster our confidence that it's effective in the real world,\" said Dr. Bruce Hirsch, an attending physician in infectious diseases at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., who was not involved with the study.\n\nBut the vaccine can cost a couple of hundred dollars, he said, perhaps making it out of reach for those with limited resources.\n\nBecause shingles is not contagious and doesn't present a risk of death, Hirsch said he would recommend the flu vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine over this one for uninsured patients who would have to pay out-of-pocket.\n\n\"This study helps me in terms of advising patients and prioritizing,\" Hirsch added.\n\nWhile less reliable than some childhood vaccines, which are usually 90 percent effective in preventing certain illnesses, the shingles vaccination is still worthwhile, said Dr. Ciro Sumaya, professor of health policy and management at Texas A&M Health Science Center School of Rural Public Health.\n\n\"I think it's a very good vaccine, and it's a safe vaccine, but obviously there needs to be continuing surveillance of usage of the vaccine to make sure there are no adverse effects that are seen in one in a 100 million cases versus one in five or 10,000 people,\" said Sumaya, also a member of CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.\n\nFor now, he advises getting it. \"It's protecting against a severe disease, particularly in elderly adults,\" he said, \"so the benefit, I think, is overwhelming that we should be using this because it's recommended.\"\n\nThe CDC has more on the shingles vaccine.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "\n\n\nThe story accurately describes the population for which shingles vaccine is recommended.

GTPS is the current term for what used to be called greater trochanteric or subgluteal bursitis. This study is the first to directly compare these two treatments for the syndrome.\n\nThe medical community once thought that a swollen hip bursa--a fluid-filled sac that acts as a gliding surface to reduce friction between moving tissues in this joint--was the source of this hip pain. This conclusion led to the use of steroid injections to the bursa to help decrease swelling and pain. However, evidence now indicates that injuries to the muscles and tendons around the hip are the actual cause of this pain, and that inflammation is often not involved, calling injecting the bursa with a steroid into question.\n\nGTPS is estimated to affect 10% to 25% of the general population. This kind of hip pain has been reported to be more common in women and in patients with coexisting low back pain, osteoarthritis, Iliotibial band tenderness, and obesity. The study demonstrates that patients with GTPS can get similar results from dry needling as from a steroid injection.\n\n\"Evidence for dry needling of the hip in lieu of steroid injection is in its infancy,\" acknowledges lead author Kindyle L. Brennan, PT, PhD, with Baylor Scott & White Health. However, \"this study suggests dry needling as an effective alternative to cortisone injection.\"\n\nDr. Brennan adds that, \"The potential detrimental side effects of steroid injection, particularly repeated injections, are of concern for patients and providers alike.\" As a result, \"the identification of a comparable treatment alternative with minimal side effects, such as dry needling, offers valuable clinical advantages,\" she says.\n\nDr. Brennan and her fellow researchers treated 43 patients with GPTS and a total of 50 painful hips. The patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: one group receiving cortisone injection and the other group, dry needling. Treatments were administered over six weeks, and clinical outcomes were collected at the start of the trial and at one, three, and six weeks. The researchers measured pain and function. They also collected information about medication intake for pain in the involved hip, as well as the sex, age, and body mass index of study participants.\n\nThe baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. The results showed that cortisone injection did not provide better outcomes than dry needling for either pain or function in patients with GTPS. Both groups experienced a decrease in pain and an improved ability to move and complete daily activities.\n\nDr. Brennan cautions that while this study uses a larger sample than most, further studies are warranted. In particular, participants were only followed for six weeks; additional studies over longer time periods will be important.\n\nThe study is titled \"Dry Needling Versus Cortisone Injection in the Treatment of Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome: A Noninferiority Randomized Clinical Trial.\" Co-authors on the paper are Bryce C.

A total of 837 COPD patients were stratified by blood eosinophil counts and randomized to receive either 100 milligrams of mepolizumab or placebo, delivered under the skin every four weeks for one year.\n\nThe patients with high eosinophil counts who received mepolizumab had a statistically significant 18 percent lower rate of moderate/severe exacerbations (1.4 per year compared to 1.7 per year) than those in the placebo group. The exacerbation rate in the low eosinophil group treated with the biologic did not differ from placebo. The time to the first exacerbation also was higher with mepolizumab than placebo, but only in the high eosinophil group.\n\nIn a second, simultaneous trial, termed METREO, the team assessed the effect of a higher dose of mepolizumab in 675 patients with elevated eosinophil levels. Patients were randomized to receive 100 or 300 milligrams of mepolizumab or placebo, with the same delivery method and schedule as METREX.\n\nSimilar to METREX, the exacerbation rate was reduced by 20 percent in the high eosinophil group after 100 milligrams of mepolizumab. The METREO results narrowly missed statistical significance. The 300-milligram dose did not provide an advantage over the lower dose.\n\nAn analysis of data from both trials found that as baseline blood eosinophil counts increased, so did mepolizumab's reduction in the annual exacerbation rate. This finding indicates that patients with higher initial eosinophil counts benefited more from mepolizumab than those with lower eosinophil counts, Sciurba said. The safety profile of mepolizumab did not differ from placebo in either trial.\n\n\"In addition to providing a new treatment option for patients with treatment-resistant, moderate to severe COPD, the new results also are important because they identify a potential biomarker for the disease and demonstrate that eosinophilic inflammation plays a role in flare-ups in COPD,\" Sciurba said.\n\nPitt's Division of Pulmonology, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine has a legacy of pioneering treatments for lung disease.

The most common side effects of the drug were joint and muscle pain, headache, fatigue, diarrhea, throat pain, nausea, flu, low white blood cell count, fungal infections and reactions at the injection site.\n\nThe drug also comes with a more serious warning, as well. In a total of six clinical trials totaling about 6,200 participants, six suicides were reported by people receiving Siliq. People with a history of suicide attempts or depression had an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior.\n\nBecause of these events, the labeling for Siliq will include a Boxed Warning, and the drug will only be available through a restricted REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program. In order to prescribe it, doctors must be certified with the program and must counsel patients about this risk. Patients must also agree to seek medical attention should they experience new or worsening mood changes, anxiety or suicidal thoughts.\n\nA causal association between Siliq and increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior has not been established. Fried, a dermatologist and clinical psychologist, points out that psoriasis itself can be associated with mental health problems.\n\n\u201cEffective treatment has consistently shown reduction in the incidence and severity of depression and reduced likelihood of suicide,\u201d says Fried. He adds that the data on Siliq suggests that it is not only effective in treating psoriasis, but that many patients experience improvement in anxiety and depression, as well.\n\nSiliq, like other psoriasis medications, also affects the immune system. It can raise patients\u2019 risk of infections and shouldn\u2019t be used by people with certain chronic conditions, such as Crohn\u2019s disease or active tuberculosis infections. People should also avoid immunizations with live vaccines while being treated with Siliq.\n\n\u201cPatients and their health care providers should discuss the benefits and risks of Siliq before considering treatment,\u201d said Dr. Julie Beitz, director of the Office of Drug Evaluation III in the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in an agency press release.\n\nThe drug\u2019s recommended dosage schedule is an injection once a week for the first three weeks, followed by an injection every other week.

In both studies, the ring lowered HIV cases by about 30%, though its effectiveness appears to be much better for women who used the ring consistently.\n\nThe ring contains an antiretroviral medication called dapivirine, which prevents HIV from making copies of itself. In the ring, the drug is used as \u201cpre-exposure prophylaxis,\u201d or PrEP, slowly leaching out in the vagina and preventing the virus from taking hold in nearby cells.\n\nOne of the new studies, published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, tested the ring in more than 2,600 women in four countries \u2014 Malawi, SouthAfrica, Uganda, and Zimbabwe \u2014 over nearly two years. At the end of the study, the group of volunteers who had used the dapivirine ring had 27% fewer HIV infections than a control group who had a placebo ring with no drug, the study found.\n\nLooking by age, the researchers saw that the ring did not seem to help women younger than 21. But among women over the age of 21 who used it, new HIV cases went down by 61%.\n\nThe other study, which has not yet been published but was presented on Monday at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections meeting in Boston, studied 2,000 women in South Africa and Uganda. Like the other study, in this one the ring had no visible effect in women younger than 21, whereas new HIV cases dropped by 37% in women over 21.\n\nThese age differences are probably due in part to how the women used the drug, the researchers say. Much like the contraceptive NuvaRing, the dapivirine ring should be kept in every day and replaced once a month for maximum effectiveness.\n\n\u201cIf used perfectly, how much HIV protection could there be? We don\u2019t know that yet,\u201d Jared Baeten, professor of global health, medicine, and epidemiology at the University of Washington and lead author on the study, told BuzzFeed News.\n\nAdherence is also a big issue for the only other PrEP on the market, a once-a-day pill called Truvada. Initial trials for the pill showed it led to a 44% decrease in HIV infection rates overall. But it\u2019s now known that, when taken properly, Truvada cuts new cases of HIV by at least 92%. Because of its high effectiveness, the CDC has since recommended that 1 in 4 gay and bisexual men should be prescribed the drug to prevent the spread of HIV.\n\nThe ring adds a new HIV prevention tool, which some experts say will be particularly useful in African countries where women are at highest risk for HIV infection. More than half of the 35 million people living with HIV worldwide are women, and the vast majority live in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\u201cA prevention tool like a ring could be used discreetly, a woman would have control over it, and it could allow her to keep herself safe from HIV without having to ask a male partner to take on prevention strategies,\u201d Baeten said. \u201cThat individual control of prevention is so powerful.\u201d\n\nThe dapivirine ring has been in development for more than a decade, and the the new studies are the first to show that it prevents HIV transmission. Still, experts caution that the ring should not be a woman\u2019s sole source of protection.\n\n\u201cThere is absolute reason to celebrate. But 27% is a lower number than any of us would like to see,\u201d Mitchell Warren, executive director of AVAC, a global HIV-prevention advocacy group, told BuzzFeed News.\n\n\u201cWe obviously always want higher numbers. But 1 in 3 infections were prevented overall \u2014 and that\u2019s huge.\u201d\n\nWarren noted that other rings with antiretrovirals are also being developed, as well as rings that could offer multipurpose protection, against not only HIV but pregnancy.\n\nLike birth control, the more types of HIV prevention, the better, experts say.\n\n\u201cFor some women, a pill every day might work really well. For others, that may be not achievable,\u201d Baeten said. \u201cPills and rings should be sitting next to each other as options.\u201d", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There was no disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Regular fasting may be good for your heart.\n\nThat\u2019s the finding of a new study from doctors in Utah who looked at the relationship between periodic fasting and cardiovascular disease. The researchers interviewed 200 patients who were undergoing a diagnostic test called angiography, an X-ray exam of the blood vessels and heart chambers that can determine if a person has coronary heart disease.\n\nThe patients were asked if they engaged in regular fasting, and the researchers compared the answers to whether they eventually received a diagnosis of heart disease. Because about 90 percent of the patients were Mormons, a faith that encourages its members to fast for one day a month, the doctors expected to find a relatively high rate of regular fasting among the study participants.\n\nThe researchers found that people who fasted regularly had a 58 percent lower risk of coronary disease compared with those who said they didn\u2019t fast, according to the report presented at the American College of Cardiology conference in New Orleans this week.\n\nThe study showed only an association between fasting and better heart health, which means it\u2019s possible that fasting may not have a direct effect but might just be more common among people who are healthier to begin with. Devout Mormons, for instance, abstain from alcohol, smoking and caffeine, which are all factors that could affect heart health.\n\nBut the researchers say the findings are important because they affirm the results of an earlier, larger study, published in 2008 in The American Journal of Cardiology, that found a similar association between fasting and heart disease among 448 patients.\n\n\u201cThe first study we did was not a chance finding,\u2019\u2019 said Dr. Benjamin D. Horne, director of cardiovascular and genetic epidemiology for Intermountain Healthcare, a health services and managed care firm in Salt Lake City. \u201cWe were able to replicate the findings and show that people who fast routinely have a lower prevalence of coronary disease.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe downside of the study is that it didn\u2019t ask for specific details on the type and duration of fasting among the patients. However, preliminary interviews suggest that the most common form of fasting involved a monthly ritual of abstaining from all food and drinking only water for 24 hours.\n\nA second, smaller study conducted by the same research team suggests that the effects of fasting aren\u2019t just about having an overall healthy lifestyle, but that abstaining from food on a regular basis leads to metabolic changes that are good for the heart.\n\nFor that research, also presented at the New Orleans conference, 30 patients were asked to fast for 24 hours with water only. The scientists used blood tests before and after the fasting period to look at a number of different metabolic markers. Among other changes, they found that levels of human growth hormone, or HGH, surged after fasting \u2014 increasing 20 times in men and 13 times in women. The hormone is released by the body in times of starvation to protect lean muscle mass and trigger the body to start burning fat stores.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot more to be done to fill in the research on the biological mechanism,\u2019\u2019 Dr. Horne said. \u201cBut what it does suggest is that fasting is not a marker for other healthy lifestyle behaviors. It appears to be that fasting is causing some major stress, and the body responds to that by some protective mechanisms that potentially have a beneficial long-term effect on risk of chronic disease.\u201d\n\nDr. Horne noted that patients shouldn\u2019t take up fasting without discussing it first with their doctor. Any fast should include water because dehydration can raise risk for stroke.

The risk of death overall was 7% lower for women and 11% for men who took aspirin regularly, compared with those who did not. The risk of dying from cancer was 7% lower for women and 15% lower for men who took aspirin regularly, compared with those who didn't take a regular dose.\n\nThe strongest connection was with colorectal cancer: There was a 31% lower risk for women and 30% for men who were among regular aspirin takers, as other studies have showed. But it also lowered women's risk of dying from breast cancer by 11% and men's risk of dying from prostate cancer by 23%. Men's risk of dying from lung cancer was also lower.\n\n\"Evidence has been accumulating very rapidly showing aspirin works in reducing cancer and cardiovascular disease mortality,\" Cao said. \"It is good to remember, though, if a person wants to take a low-dose aspirin, especially if a person has had cancer, they will want to have an initial conversation with their doctor first.\"\n\nNot everyone can take aspirin, particularly if you are at high risk for ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding.

And, when suspected trouble foods were reintroduced into the diet, two-thirds of the children experienced a relapse in symptoms.\n\n\"A strictly supervised restricted elimination diet is a valuable instrument to assess whether ADHD is induced by food,\" wrote the study authors. \"We think that dietary intervention should be considered in all children with ADHD, provided parents are willing to follow a diagnostic restricted elimination diet for a five-week period, and provided expert supervision is available,\" they concluded.\n\nResults of the study are published in the Feb. 5 issue of The Lancet.\n\nADHD is a common childhood disorder, according to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). Children with ADHD have trouble paying attention, focusing and can be hyperactive. Parents have long suspected that sugary foods might be a culprit in inducing symptoms, but there's not a lot of evidence to support this theory, according to the NIMH. However, food additives and preservatives have recently been singled out as possibly having an effect on children's behavior, though the evidence isn't yet conclusive.\n\nSince some children have negative physical reactions to certain foods -- such as eczema, asthma and gastrointestinal problems -- that affect different organ systems, it has been suggested that foods may also affect the brain in a way that results in adverse behavior, according to information in the study.\n\nTo test this theory, the researchers recruited 100 children from Belgium and the Netherlands. The children were between the ages of 4 and 8, and all had been diagnosed with ADHD. Most of the children were boys.\n\nThe children were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group was placed on the restrictive elimination diet, and the other group served as a control group and received advice on healthy eating.\n\nThe restrictive diet began with a diet called the \"few foods diet,\" which includes just rice, meat, vegetables, pears and water. The researchers then complemented this diet with certain foods, such as potatoes, fruits and wheat. The restrictive diet lasted for five weeks.\n\nDuring the next four weeks, kids in the restricted diet group received two food challenge diets, in which certain foods were reintroduced into the diet. The researchers selected foods that were considered both low- and high-IgG foods.\n\nIgG is an antibody made by the immune system that some alternative medicine practitioners believe is linked to food hypersensitivities; however, IgG testing is controversial among many mainstream physicians and even some naturopaths, according to background information in the study.\n\nSome complementary medicine practices test for IgG and recommend eliminating foods high in IgG, explained Dr. Jaswinder Ghuman, who wrote an accompanying editorial in the same issue of the journal.\n\nForty-one children completed the restrictive phase of the diet. Of those, 78 percent had a reduction in their ADHD symptoms, compared with no improvement in the controls. Nine children (22 percent) didn't respond to the diet. On an ADHD symptom scale that ranges from 0 to 72 points, with a higher score indicating more severe symptoms, the average reduction was 24 points, according to the study.\n\nThirty children who had shown a response on the restrictive diet went on to the challenge test. Nineteen of those children had a relapse in symptoms on the challenge test. What's more, it didn't appear to matter if the children with challenged with a low- or high-IgG food.\n\n\"Measuring IgG levels in kids doesn't seem helpful,\" Ghuman said, but it does look as if the elimination diet may help some children.\n\n\"If parents have noticed that a child's behavior seems to get worse with certain foods, it may be worth considering,\" said Ghuman, who is an associate professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at the University of Arizona in Tucson.\n\n\"But, for this diet to work, you have to be very consistent with it, and you have to pay attention to nutrition. It should be done under the supervision of a primary care doctor, and if possible, a dietician,\" she advised.\n\nGhuman said that this study doesn't answer a number of questions, such as whether or not the elimination diet reduces symptoms long-term. And, she added, that clinical practice shouldn't be changed based on the results of one study.\n\nDr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York in New Hyde Park, echoed Ghuman's concerns.\n\n\"Since none of the children stayed on the diet beyond five weeks, it is hard to know if this dietary intervention offers sustained benefit,\" he said, adding, \"Since it is more difficult to enforce restricted diets in older children, this approach may not be suitable for the majority of older children with ADHD.\"\n\nAdesman also pointed out that this study is only applicable to children with ADHD, not to children who had ADD without the hyperactivity component.\n\nLearn more about ADHD from the National Institute of Mental Health.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "This story does not engage in disease mongering.

As a result, we set out to conduct a systematic search of all the scientific literature.\"\n\nThe team's review looked at all of the available data including five randomised trials and forty two observational studies of colorectal, breast and prostate cancers.\n\nProfessor Elwood said: \"Our review, based on the available evidence, suggests that low-dose aspirin taken by patients with bowel, breast or prostate cancer, in addition to other treatments, is associated with a reduction in deaths of about 15-20%, together with a reduction in the spread of the cancer.\n\n\"The results from six studies of other cancers also suggest a reduction, but the numbers of patients were too few to enable confident interpretation. A mutation - known as PIK3CA - was present in about 20% of patients, and appeared to explain much of the reduction in colon cancer mortality by aspirin.\n\n\"One of the concerns about taking aspirin remains the potential for intestinal bleeding. That's why we specifically looked at the available evidence of bleeding and we wrote to all authors asking for further data. In no study was serious or life-threatening bleeding reported.\"\n\nAs a result of the review, the team say their study highlights the need for randomised trials to establish the evidence needed to support low-dose aspirin as an effective additional treatment of cancer.\n\nProfessor Elwood added: \"While there is a desperate need for more detailed research to verify our review and to obtain evidence on less common cancers, we'd urge patients diagnosed with cancer to speak to their doctor about our findings so they can make an informed decision as to whether or not they should take a low-dose aspirin as part of their cancer treatment.\"\n\nThis is not the only significant study Professor Elwood led research examining ways to improve peoples' health.

Most researchers agreed that there was something in the wine that offered protection, and a few years later, even the highly cautious federal dietary guidelines say that moderate consumption of red wine can be beneficial.\n\nAs 60 Minutes reported in January, scientists across the country have identified a substance in red wine called resveratrol that they believe might do more than just protect the heart, but could in very high concentrations significantly extend life by preventing a number of age related illnesses.\n\nIf they're right, we all may soon be taking a pill that could give us an extra decade or two of healthy old age.\n\n\"If the promise holds true, I think this has the chance to change healthcare,\" Dr. Christoph Westphal tells\n\nDr. Westphal says we all may soon be taking a drug that just might beat the clock, a simple pill that could delay the inevitable. \"Our goal is to prevent and forestall many of the diseases that strike us as we reach 50, 60, and 70.

But I think if we're on a train heading one direction, we can slow down that train. I think we can slow down these genes that control the aging process.\"\n\nThat quest to put death on hold began in 2003 when Westphal met David Sinclair, a biochemist at Harvard who was studying the genetic components of aging. \"Five years ago I met David. And he had shown that you could extend life span in yeast. That's pretty exciting,\" Westphal recalls.\n\nYeasts are one thing, human beings are more complicated. So Sinclair focused on a gene present in almost all life forms: the sirtuin gene. It's normally inactive, but when it is active, Sinclair believes it triggers a survival mechanism that extends life. \n\nConvinced that something in nature could activate that gene, Sinclair randomly tested thousands of compounds and got a hit: resveratrol.\n\n\"When I Googled this resveratrol, I was shocked to find that red wine was the top hit,\" Sinclair remembers.\n\nRed wine is brimming with resveratrol. It is found in high concentrations in the skin of the grape, and seems to play a role in protecting it from invading bacteria and fungi.\n\nSinclair says he was aware of research into red wine and certain health benefits. \"I mean, that's why I almost fell off my chair when the link was made. And I thought that this was a potential explanation for the benefits of red wine.\"\n\nConvinced they were on the verge of a major scientific breakthrough, Sinclair and Westphal launched Sirtris, a Cambridge, Mass. research company. They, along with a handful of other cutting-edge biotech companies, are developing resveratrol-based drugs that they believe zero-in on the longevity gene.\n\n\"The important news here is not that we'd found something in red wine. The important thing is that we passed a milestone where we can now make drugs based on this knowledge and we can potentially slow down aging itself,\" Sinclair explains.\n\nEveryone from plastic surgeons to your friendly snake oil salesman have been promising a ticket to eternal youth for some time, so the prospect of a prescription pill based on red wine that could trigger a longevity gene sounds too good to be true.

Unfortunately, the procedure provided no benefit to patients, though it caused substantial pain to two of the study participants.\n\nDr. Jonathan D. Glass, a professor of neurology and pathology at the Emory University School of Medicine and the director of the Emory ALS Center, specifically focused on human spinal cord-derived neural stem cells.\n\n\"We put them into the spinal cord, and they came from a human spinal cord. The idea was that they would find a familiar and supportive environment,\" explained Glass.\n\nIn previous studies , Glass and his colleagues had transplanted such stem cells into the spinal cords of rodents with ALS and discovered that the treatment delayed the disease and improved survival.\n\nNext, in a study of 12 patients , Glass tested the safety of injecting the stem cells into the spinal cords of humans. What he discovered during that experiment was that none of the patients suffered long-term effects (from either the surgical procedure or the implantation of stem cells), and no unusual acceleration of disease occurred. Importantly, one patient showed some improvement, though he and his colleagues noted that this outcome \"must be interpreted with caution\" since the study wasn't designed to measure effectiveness of the treatment.\n\nFor the new study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, Glass and his colleagues tested increasing amounts of stem cells injected into 15 patients who were not enrolled in his previous study.\n\nWhat ALS does to the body\n\nWhen someone gets ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, their motor network rapidly disintegrates. Nerve cells that communicate and control the voluntary muscles of the body (such as those in the arms, legs and face) degenerate or die. When communication between the brain and muscles ceases, the result is a gradual weakening and wasting away of muscles.\n\n\"My father was actually 69 when he was diagnosed. Someone can go for two years without being diagnosed properly, and that was the case with my father,\" Pharr said.\n\nNeither his primary care physician nor his neurologist could identify the cause of his deterioration. In fact, they first believed he had suffered a stroke. After all, ALS is rare, and in up to 90% of all cases, there is no family history and no known risk factors, as was the case with Pharr's father.\n\nALS affects men more often than women, usually between the ages of 40 and 70. Though more common between the ages of 60 and 69, this neurodegenerative disease can develop at any age, progressing rapidly. Most people with ALS die within three to five years after their symptoms begin, though about 10% survive for 10 years or longer. In Pharr's father's case, the progress of disease was rapid.\n\n\"He did not want to go on the ventilator,\" she said, adding that many people prefer a \"natural death.\" ALS often ends with respiratory failure since muscles in the diaphragm and chest walls eventually stop functioning. \"There's no cure, and we don't even have a treatment,\" she said.\n\nAccording to Goldstein, this isn't entirely a negative. \"One of the things ALS has going for it is, since it has no effective treatment or cure, you throw anything you can at it,\" he said. While for many other diseases, the researchers are focused on just one modality, ongoing ALS research uses each of the four key modes of medical treatment: small molecules, proteins and biologics, gene therapy and stem cells.\n\nWas this research necessary -- and ethical?\n\nThe ethics of human experimentation were thoroughly examined before the study began.\n\n\"Ethical review happens at several levels: at the NIH, at the Food and Drug Administration and most importantly at University Institutional Review Boards at each institution where a faculty member is participating in a trial,\" Glass explained.\n\nIn Pharr's opinion, this and other stem cell studies are certainly fair from a participant's perspective, since beforehand, \"patients are presented with all the risk factors involved so they can make an informed decision.\" Besides, she added, \"you automatically assume anyone with ALS can participate, but not everyone meets the criteria for a particular study.\"\n\nThe results of the study: Most participants fared well. However, severe complications occurred in two of the patients as a result of the surgery involved. One developed partial paralysis, and another experienced \"incapacitating pain.\"\n\n\"People who do these studies should be considered medical heroes,\" Goldstein said, adding, \"The selflessness of these people when they're told they're gonna die.\"\n\nSadly, disappointment is part of it, according to Pharr, who typically hears the frustration of people who go through a study that worked for another person but not for them. \"It may have had a different effect on someone else,\" she said. \"But that's why we don't have a treatment yet: because it doesn't work for everyone.\"\n\nThese early stages may be painful for some of the \"medical heroes\" involved, but the goal is clear: providing an effective and safe treatment for future patients who suffer from a devastating condition.\n\n\"Importantly, people should understand that, at least for neurological diseases like ALS, we are just now getting started with testing our hypotheses about using stem cells as therapeutics,\" Glass said. \"We do not know if these treatments will work, and it will take time to test these therapies in a systematic and safe way.\"", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story does not engage in disease mongering.

Every year 4.9 million babies are born with a birth defect worldwide and one in four pregnant women suffer a miscarriage in Australia. In the vast majority of cases the cause of these problems has remained a mystery. Until now.\n\nThis breakthrough, led by Professor Sally Dunwoodie from the Victor Chang Institute, has identified a cause of recurrent miscarriages as well as heart, spinal, kidney and cleft palate problems in newborn babies.\n\n \n\n\u201cThe ramifications are likely to be huge. This has the potential to significantly reduce the number of miscarriages and birth defects around the world, and I do not use those words lightly,\u201d says Professor Dunwoodie.\n\nThe landmark study found that a deficiency in a vital molecule, known as NAD, can prevent a baby\u2019s organs from developing correctly in the womb.\n\nNicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is one of the most important molecules in all living cells. NAD synthesis is essential for energy production, DNA repair and cell communication. Environmental and genetic factors can disrupt its production, which can cause a NAD deficiency.\n\nWorld first research at the Victor Chang Institute has found that this deficiency can be particularly harmful during a pregnancy as it can cripple an embryo when it is forming.\n\n\u201cNow, after 12 years of research, our team has also discovered that this deficiency can potentially be cured and miscarriages and birth defects prevented by taking a common vitamin,\u201d Professor Dunwoodie revealed.\n\nAt the heart of the paramount discovery is the dietary supplement vitamin B3, also known as niacin. Scientists at the Victor Chang Institute have discovered simply boosting levels of this nutrient during pregnancy can potentially prevent recurrent miscarriages and birth defects.\n\nVitamin B3 is required to make NAD and is typically found in meats and green vegetables as well as vegemite. However, a recent study[i] found that despite taking vitamin supplements at least a third of pregnant women have low levels of vitamin B3 in their first trimester, which is the critical time in organ development. By the third trimester, vitamin B3 levels were low in 60% of pregnant women. This indicates pregnant women may require more vitamin B3 than is currently available in most vitamin supplements.\n\nUsing a preclinical mouse model, scientists at the Victor Chang Institute investigated the effect of vitamin B3 on developing embryos. The results were astounding.\n\nBefore vitamin B3 was introduced into the mother\u2019s diet, embryos were either lost through miscarriage or the offspring were born with a range of severe birth defects. After the dietary change, both the miscarriages and birth defects were completely prevented, with all the offspring born perfectly healthy.\n\nThis discovery is akin to the revolutionary breakthrough made last century that confirmed folic acid supplementation can prevent spina bifida and other neural tube defects in babies. As a result, consumption of folic acid has been adopted by expectant mothers worldwide, and the addition of folate to our food supply has led to a 70% decrease in the number of babies born with neural tube defects.\n\nAccording to the Executive Director of the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, Professor Robert Graham, the implications are profound.\n\n\u201cJust like we now use folate to prevent spina bifida, Professor Dunwoodie\u2019s research suggests that it is probably best for women to start taking vitamin B3 very early on, even before they become pregnant. This could change the way pregnant women are cared for around the world,\u201d said Professor Graham.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this breakthrough will be one of our country\u2019s greatest medical discoveries. It\u2019s extremely rare to discover the problem and provide a preventive solution at the same time. It\u2019s actually a double breakthrough,\u201d said Professor Graham.\n\nThe next step will be to develop a diagnostic test to measure NAD levels. This will enable doctors to identify those women who are at greatest risk of having a baby with a birth defect, and ensure they are getting sufficient vitamin B3.\n\nThe findings have been released today by the New England Journal of Medicine \u2013 the most prestigious clinical research publication in the world. http://www.nejm.org/\n\nThis study would not have been possible without the generous support of the Chain Reaction Foundation, the Key Foundation and the National Health and Medical Research Council.\n\u2022 4.9 million babies are born with a serious birth defect worldwide every year\n\u2022 3.3 million children under five die from serious birth defects annually\n\u2022 Congenital heart disease is the most common form of birth defect, affecting 1 in 100 babies\n\u2022 42 babies are born with a heart defect in Australia every week\n\u2022 30 babies will undergo heart surgery in Australia every week\n\u2022 Heart defects account for 30% of deaths in children under five\n\n[1] Baker H, DeAngelis B, Holland B, Gittens-Williams L, Barrett T Jr. Vitamin Profile of 563 Gravidas during Trimesters of Pregnancy.

Despite its longtime use, warfarin remains tricky to dose because a person's genetic makeup influences how the drug is processed in the body. Too much warfarin can cause internal bleeding; too little warfarin fails to prevent blood clots.\n\nNow, a new study led by Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis shows that dosing warfarin (Coumadin and others) is safer -- producing fewer adverse events such as hemorrhage -- when key elements of a patient's genetic makeup are considered.\n\nThe research, published Sept. 26 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, reports results from the clinical trial known as GIFT (Genetics Informatics Trial of Warfarin to Prevent Deep Venous Thrombosis).\n\n\"Physicians have been prescribing warfarin since the Eisenhower administration,\" said first author Brian F. Gage, MD, a professor of medicine at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. \"It's a widely used anticoagulant, but it causes more major adverse events than any other oral drug. Thousands of patients end up in the emergency department or hospital because of warfarin-induced bleeding. But we continue to prescribe it because it is highly effective, reversible and inexpensive. So our goal is to make warfarin safer. GIFT showed that precision-medicine based on clinical factors and three genes improves the safety of initiating warfarin therapy.\"\n\nPatients in the trial were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group received warfarin dosing based on standard factors such as age, height and weight; the second group was dosed based on these clinical factors plus genetic variants. Participating sites in the trial included Washington University School of Medicine, Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, Intermountain Healthcare, University of Utah, and Rush University Medical Center.\n\nOf the 789 patients who were dosed in the traditional manner, 116 experienced at least one adverse event (14.7 percent). Of the 808 patients whose warfarin dosing was guided by genetic testing, 87 experienced an adverse event (10.8 percent). Compared with patients receiving traditional warfarin dosing, patients dosed with the genetic approach had a 27 percent reduction in adverse events, which was statistically different. The adverse events were bleeding, formation of blood clots in the veins and warfarin overdoses. No patient died during the trial.\n\nEarlier studies looking at whether genetic testing could improve warfarin dosing had produced conflicting results. However, these studies were smaller and considered fewer genes than GIFT. GIFT enrolled 1,600 patients age 65 and older at high risk of blood clots because they underwent hip- or knee-replacement surgeries.\n\nUnlike prior studies, GIFT took into account genetic variants in three genes for 11 days of warfarin therapy. Genetic variants were assessed on a commercial platform called GenMarkDx. Variants in one gene affect vitamin K recycling. Variants in another gene affect warfarin sensitivity. Variants in the third gene alter warfarin metabolism in the liver and can cause an overdose if the dose is not adjusted soon enough.\n\n\"There are additional genetic variants that may help to guide warfarin dosing, especially among patients with African ancestry,\" Gage said. In the future, we hope to quantify how these variants affect warfarin.\"\n\nGage also noted how health-care costs relate to dosing warfarin in a genetically guided manner. \"Although genetic testing is more expensive than clinical dosing, the cost is falling,\" he said. \"In our study, we estimated that genetic testing costs less than $200 per person, which is less than one month of a newer anticoagulant.\"\n\nThis work was supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), grant numbers R01HL097036 and UL1TR000448; the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, grant number CAG-00400N; and GenMarkDx, which supplied instrumentation.\n\nGage BF, Bass AR, Lin H, Woller SC, Stevens SM, Al-Hammadi N, Li J, Rodriguez Jr. T, Miller JP, McMillin GA, Pendleton RC, Jaffer AK, King CR, DeVore B, Porche-Sorbet R, Napoli L, Merritt K, Thompson AM, Hyun G, Anderson JL, Hollomon W, Barrack RL, Nunley RM, Moskowitz G, Davila-Roman V and Eby CS for the GIFT investigators.

Kite announced Wednesday that the treatment's brand name will be Yescarta and its price will be $373,000.\n\nIn late August, the FDA cleared the first CAR T-cell therapy, which is designed for children and young adults whose leukemia doesn't respond to standard treatments. About 600 patients in the United States fall into that category every year. Kymriah, which costs $475,000, is manufactured by Novartis.\n\nBiotech analysts had expected the Kite price to be lower than Kymriah's, in part because the number of eligible patients is larger and the response rates are lower. Even so, Yescarta's cost is likely to stoke the ongoing debate about high drug prices.\n\nThe FDA approval is the latest step forward for the fast-moving field of immunotherapy, which aims to bolster the immune system to attack malignancies.

An independent review committee found that 72 percent of patients treated with a single infusion responded to therapy, including 51 percent who then showed no evidence of remaining cancer.

Twenty-eight percent had neurological \u201cevents,\u201d such as severe confusion; three patients died of complications caused by the treatment.\n\n\u201cThese are patients who knew they were out of options,\u201d he said, noting that lymphoma patients who relapse or don't respond to treatment have just a 50 percent chance of surviving for six months.\n\nBecause of the side effects, the treatment will carry a boxed warning, the FDA's most serious.

Study results are published online in Menopause, the journal of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS).\n\nCollectively known as the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), the various genital and urinary problems associated with menopause have created a market for new therapies and treatments to help women regain sexual function and bladder control. Vaginal laser surgery represents one of the newer and more hotly contested approaches.\n\nIn the case of microablative fractional CO2 laser surgery, a series of microscopic laser beams using fractionated energy penetrate the skin to remove old and damaged skin cells, intended to rebuild the vaginal pathway. In this new study, GSM symptoms were evaluated up to12 months after the last laser surgery and compared based on the number of total therapies applied (up to a total of five).\n\nThe results of this small, retrospective, non-sham-controlled study demonstrated that this type of laser surgery was particularly effective in reducing the intensity of dyspareunia (painful sex) and dryness. It further demonstrated that four or five laser therapies may be superior in lowering the intensity of GSM symptoms compared with three laser therapies in both short- and long-term follow-up. Study results are published in the article \"Microablative fractional CO2 laser for the genitourinary syndrome of menopause: up to 12-month results.\"\n\n\"This study adds to the literature on vaginal laser therapy for GSM.

But the men in this study had an average age of about 65, when the disease is less common and more likely to kill.\n\nWilliam B. Isaacs, a professor of urology and oncology at Johns Hopkins University and an author of the new report, said that if research validates what has been found, men may want to get the new genetic test when they are young, 35, say. Those at high risk because of their genetics might then choose to start prostate-cancer screening earlier than the usual age of about 50, using a blood test that looks for proteins secreted by prostate tumors.\n\n\u201cI think that makes sense,\u201d said Dr. Howard Sandler, a professor of radiation oncology at the University of Michigan and a spokesman for the American Society of Clinical Oncology.\n\nBut others worry that more frequent testing could exacerbate what is already a major problem: most prostate cancers grow so slowly that they would have been harmless if left alone. But since doctors cannot tell which are dangerous, they treat nearly all that they find. And treatment has serious side effects, including, often, impotence and incontinence. Nonetheless, researchers say, the test is a harbinger of things to come.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the boutique medicine of the future,\u201d said Dr. Peter C. Albertsen, a surgery professor and prostate cancer specialist at the University of Connecticut. \u201cWe can know what diseases we will have to face in the rest of our lives.\u201d\n\nThat worries him, as it does Dr. Edward P. Gelmann, deputy director of the Comprehensive Cancer Center at Columbia University. \u201cTechnology today enables us to find out a huge amount of information,\u201d Dr. Gelmann said. \u201cBut how does the public deal with this information? How does it help them make decisions? And if they make a decision, does that lead to a day, a week, a month, of life saved?\u201d\n\nThe study, by scientists at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, the Harvard School of Public Health, and Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, will appear in the Feb. 28 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. It was released online on Wednesday, a journal spokeswoman said, because \u201cit is a very active area of research with a lot of competition.\u201d\n\nResearchers long knew that the disease often runs in families. Though scientists spent years looking for genes, they found none that were reproducibly associated with a marked effect.\n\nWith new technology to scan the entire length of a person\u2019s DNA, researchers tried a new approach. They began looking for small variations in tiny DNA regions that were associated with prostate cancer. That resulted in the discovery, by several groups of investigators in Iceland and the United States, of the gene variants, small alterations in gene sequences. Unlike traditional genetic links to disease, the variants are not mutations that destroy a gene\u2019s function. In fact, no one knows what their effect is.\n\nThe next step was to ask whether those variants really could predict who had prostate cancer. So Dr. Jianfeng Xu, a professor of epidemiology and cancer biology at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, and his colleagues studied a Swedish population of 2,893 men with prostate cancer and 1,781 men who did not have it. That led to their finding that each of the five variants independently predicted prostate cancer risk.\n\n\u201cEach confers a moderate risk,\u201d Dr. Xu said, adding that the effect of having just one of the variants \u2014 a 10 or 20 percent increase in a man\u2019s chance of having prostate cancer \u2014 was not enough to justify using a single variant for screening. But, he added, because each conferred an independent risk, the risks added up so that the more men had, the greater their risk. Then they found that family history of the cancer added an independent risk. \u201cThat was very, very surprising to us,\u201d Dr. Xu said.\n\nThe next step, Dr. Isaacs said, is to look in other populations. \u201cWe think that can happen almost instantaneously,\u201d he said, explaining how scientists have blood samples and family histories of thousands of men who were tested for prostate cancer.\n\nBut some said that if the test leads to more screening, it is not necessarily a good thing. There is already too much prostate-cancer screening, they say, resulting in too much treatment. \u201cTo me, it is a nightmare,\u201d Dr. Albertsen said. \u201cWe are just feeding off of this cancer phobia.\u201d\n\nWhat is needed, and what the new test does not provide, is a way to decide which cancers are dangerous and which are not, Dr. Isaacs said. Still, he said the new test could help patients if it was used with caution. \u201cWe may be premature with this idea \u2014 everyone has a different way of thinking about this \u2014 but it should not take five years to know if we are on the right track.

Cut It Out (Surgically)\n\nAt 32, it just didn't make sense that Daniel Sheiner was exhausted literally from the moment he woke up. \"It didn't get any better over the course of the day, and I knew that was not normal,\" Sheiner says.\n\nSheiner is a software designer and programmer. His job suffered as a result of his fatigue.\n\n\"I would miss conversations,\" Sheiner says. \"I would ask a question that had already been answered.\"\n\nSheiner suspected he had sleep apnea because it ran in his family. But he was not overweight, which is the biggest risk factor for the disorder \u2014 some 60 percent to 90 percent of patients diagnosed with apnea have a body mass index, or BMI, over 28.\n\nA sleep study confirmed Sheiner had one of the worst cases of apnea his doctors had ever seen. After trying a number of different treatments, his doctors finally tried a surgery using robots to treat his stubborn apnea \u2014 with positive results.\n\nAccording to Erica Thaler, an ear, nose and throat surgeon at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Sheiner's sleep study found that he woke up about 112 times every hour. That meant Sheiner stopped breathing for at least 10 seconds about two times every minute.\n\nSleep apnea is a chronic and common sleep disorder. People with this condition stop breathing while sleeping.\n\nLike Sheiner, they often find themselves suddenly and repeatedly gasping for breath during the night. Their airway is clogged, sometimes because their tonsils and tonsilar tissue in the back of their throat are enlarged.\n\nThis was exactly the case for Sheiner.\n\n\"Daniel's obstruction was both at the level of the soft palate and at the back of the tongue,\" Thaler says. \"He had very large tonsils, but his tonsil tissue was also enlarged in the palate area and also at the back of his tongue.\"\n\nSheiner was put on a nighttime breathing machine. In bed he wore a face mask, which was connected to a tube that was connected to a device that pumped air into his nose and mouth.\n\nThe Continuous Positive Airway Pressure machine, or CPAP, as it is often referred to, works for about half of all patients who try it. It can be cumbersome, Thaler says.\n\nBut Sheiner was extremely committed to trying it. In fact, he tried a number of different types of machines, but none of them worked.\n\nSo Thaler suggested a type of robotic surgery currently used to remove cancerous tumors at the back of the throat. Thaler was starting to perform it on sleep apnea patients, to remove tonsils and excess tissue.\n\n\"What the robot allows you to do is get into a small, confined space without using hands,\" Thaler says. \"Human hands are huge, and robot hands are tiny, and yet they can do exactly the same thing if you control them remotely.\"\n\nSo, about a year ago, Thaler performed surgery on Sheiner, removing both his tonsils and excess tissue. Sheiner is one of only about a half-dozen patients to have this robotic surgery for apnea.\n\nAfter surgery, Sheiner says, \"it was a whole new life.\" He had energy, an ability to focus and get things done. \"I find myself solving problems much more quickly and more confidently.\"\n\nHe's exercising at the gym three times a week, lifting weights. He is also starting to experiment with recipes and cooking, something he had absolutely no energy or interest in doing before the surgery.\n\nSurgery Not For Everyone\n\nThe surgery Sheiner had isn't right for everyone. Rashmi N. Aurora is a sleep specialist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. She is also chairwoman of the Standards of Practice Committee of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.\n\n\"I wouldn't send a middle-age obese man for surgery as their first option,\" Aurora says. \"I would say let's lose the weight; let's use CPAP and see a nutritionist; let's avoid the alcohol and let's see how you do.\" The apnea can probably be taken care of with these noninvasive techniques, she says, and invasive surgery can be avoided.\n\nBut when she sees a young, thin person with severe apnea, Aurora says, surgery might be the answer.\n\n\"The upper airway starts with the nose and mouth and runs down to the vocal chords, so there's a lot of room for obstruction to occur,\" Aurora says. Some patients may require surgery to remove the uvula or the tonsils or excess tissue, or all of them, she says. Then, there's surgery to remove blockage in the nasal passage.\n\nOftentimes, Aurora says, patients need a series of surgeries to completely treat apnea. And even then, success rates aren't high; they're effective only 20 to 30 percent of the time.\n\nThe only surgery proved effective more than 90 percent of the time is a significant and highly invasive surgery. Maxillomandibular advancement, or MMA, involves literally slicing the jaw in half and moving it forward in order to widen the patient's airway.\n\nFor patients with recessed chins, small jaws and airways narrowed by facial structure, this might be the surgery for them. But it can take nearly a year to recover, and many patients opt not to have it.\n\nThe \"new\" CPAP machines are more sophisticated, Aurora says. They're less cumbersome, less noisy and can actually \"sense\" the magnitude of blockage and adjust air pressure being blown into the nose or mouth, she says. Noninvasive measures are always the first lines of defense, she says.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No overt disease-mongering.\u00a0 And at least the story disclosed that the patient profiled had \u201cone of the worst cases of apnea his doctors had ever seen.\u201d", "answer": 1}, {"article": "For the first time, scientists have precisely identified and targeted an area of the brain which is involved in \"hearing voices\", experienced by many patients with schizophrenia. They have been able to show in a controlled trial that targeting this area with magnetic pulses can improve the condition in some patients. This early clinical work is presented at the ECNP conference in Paris on Tuesday 5th September, with later publication in Schizophrenia Bulletin*.\n\n\"This is the first controlled trial to precisely determine an anatomically defined brain area where high frequency magnetic pulses can improve the hearing of voices\", said lead researcher, Professor Sonia Dollfus (University of Caen, CHU, France).\n\nSchizophrenia is a serious long-term mental health problem. People with schizophrenia experience a range of symptoms, which may include delusions, muddled thoughts and hallucinations. One of the best-known is hearing voices, also known as Auditory Verbal Hallucination (AVH), which around 70% of people with schizophrenia experience at some point. These voices, may be 'heard' as having a variety of different characteristics, for example as internal or external, friendly or threatening, they may be continuously present or present only occasionally, and so on.\n\nTranscranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been suggested as a possible way of treating the hearing of voices in schizophrenia. TMS uses magnetic pulses to the brain, and has been shown to be effective in several psychiatric conditions. However, there is a lack of controlled trials to show that TMS works effectively with AVH sufferers.\n\nThe French research team worked with 26 patients who received active TMS treatment, and 33 as a control group, who received sham (placebo) treatment. The researchers interviewed the patients using a standard protocol - the Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale - which revealed most of the characteristic features of the voices which they were hearing. The treated patients received a series of 20 Hz high-frequency magnetic pulses over 2 sessions a day for 2 days. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the pulses were targeted at a specific brain area in the temporal lobe, which is associated with language (the exact area is the crossing of the projection of the ascending branch of the left lateral sulcus and the left superior temporal sulcus)\n\nAfter 2 weeks, the patients were re-evaluated. The researchers found that 34.6% of the patients being treated by TMS showed a significant response, whereas only 9.1% of patients in the sham group responded ('significant response' was defined as a more than 30% decrease in the Total Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale score).\n\nProfessor Sonia Dollfus said: \"Auditory Verbal Hallucinations, or \"hearing voices\" can be a disturbing symptom of schizophrenia, both for patients and for those close to sufferers. This is the first controlled trial to show an improvement in these patients by targeting a specific area of the brain and using high frequency TMS. This means two things; firstly it seems that we now can say with some certainty that we have found a specific anatomical area of the brain associated with auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia. Secondly, we have shown that treatment with high frequency TMS makes a difference to at least some sufferers, although there is a long way to go before we will know if TMS is the best route to treat these patients in the long-term\".\n\nCommenting, Professor Andreas Meyer-Lindenberg, Central Institute of Mental Health, Mannheim and member of the ECNP executive board, said: \"This work builds on previous studies that have shown a critical role of excessive activity of subregions of the temporal lobe in the generation of voice hallucinations in schizophrenia. To move this into treatment, controlled trial such as the one by Dollfus and coworkers are important. While response rates were moderate, TMS is a welcome addition to the therapeutic repertoire especially for patients who do not respond to medication.\"\n\nNOTE: The full title of this release is \"Scientists discover brain area which can be targeted for treatment in patients with schizophrenia who 'hear voices'\" It has been shortened in some versions to comply with Eurekalert title limits.\n\n*This work has been accepted in the peer-reviewed journal Schizophrenia Bulletin: The Journal of Psychoses and Related Disorders.

In effect, you\u2019re trading one problem (addiction) for another (undertreatment of chronic pain).\n\nA new study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, however, offers a cause for optimism: Reviewing the research so far, it found that it may be possible to reduce doses for patients in long-term opioid therapy and improve their pain outcomes. So doctors can potentially pull back the opioids that launched the current drug overdose crisis and still successfully treat pain patients.\n\nNow, by this latest study\u2019s own admission, the evidence is of generally poor quality. Most of the studies reviewed were of poor methodology or sample size, while only a few were of \u201cfair\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d quality. The review also only looked at patients who volunteered to taper off opioids, meaning this research does not prove that involuntarily pulling patients off the drugs will lead to similar outcomes.\n\nSuffice to say, then, a lot more research is necessary before this issue is settled.\n\nBut the new study does offer a glimmer of hope in a fairly grim opioid epidemic: Maybe it is possible to reduce the amount of dangerous opioids that patients are consuming and still alleviate people\u2019s pain.\n\nFor the latest review of the evidence, researchers looked at 67 studies that collectively provided data on more than 12,000 pain patients who were weaned off at least some opioids. Though the researchers found a lot of studies to pool from, they generally graded these studies as \u201cvery low\u201d in quality and methodology.\n\nResearchers then identified the studies \u2014 none of which were graded as \u201cgood\u201d quality \u2014 that evaluated pain-related outcomes for patients after long-term opioid therapy was tapered. Focusing on the \u201cfair-quality\u201d studies, they found that after opioid dose reductions, patients on average saw improved pain, function, and quality of life.\n\nThe authors provide a few possible explanations for this: Perhaps the non-opioid pain treatments, such as physical therapy and meditation, that accompanied dose reductions simply produced better results than the opioids did. Maybe the opioids themselves caused problems that negatively impacted function or quality of life, \u201csuch as constipation, fatigue, poor sleep, and depressed mood.\u201d It\u2019s possible that opioid dose reduction also resolved what\u2019s known as opioid-induced hyperalgesia, \u201ca paradoxical response in which patients receiving opioids become more sensitive to painful stimuli.\u201d\n\nOr, the researchers suggested, the observational studies simply showed reverse causation \u2014 \u201cthat is, patients successfully tapered opioids because pain severity decreased.\u201d\n\nThe findings do not mean that doctors can now simply yank patients off opioids and expect them to get better. For one, the reviewed studies generally looked at the results of tapering, when patients are slowly weaned off opioid painkillers \u2014 a process that, Stanford psychiatrist Anna Lembke told me, can take months or even years.\n\nCrucially, the studies also looked at what happened when these reductions in opioid doses were paired with alternative treatments, including alternative medicines like acupuncture, interdisciplinary pain programs, and medication-assisted treatment for addiction. This is very, very different from a situation in which a patient is taken off opioids and effectively left stranded without any other form of care.\n\nAs the researchers readily admit, the study also had several major limitations. Most of the studies analyzed were of poor quality \u2014 meaning there\u2019s a serious need for better research in this area. And the studies only evaluated voluntary reductions in opioid doses; it\u2019s entirely possible that involuntary reductions in opioid doses would lead to sharply different outcomes.\n\n\u201cWe should be cautious in interpreting the findings,\u201d Joseph Frank, lead author of the study, told me. He emphasized that more research needs to be done to fill \u201cimportant gaps\u201d in our knowledge. He added, \u201cI want patients and their doctors to use caution in applying this.\u201d\n\nA few pain patients will still benefit from opioids\n\nOne of the study\u2019s implications is that opioids actually aren\u2019t a good treatment for chronic pain. This isn\u2019t new. As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded in its 2016 summary of the research, there are simply no good long-term studies looking at the effects of opioids on long-term pain outcomes, while there are many studies showing that long-term opioid use can lead to bad results in other areas, including addiction and overdose.\n\nThat does not mean opioids are never an effective treatment for chronic pain.\n\nAs addiction and pain experts often tell me, health care can vary vastly from patient to patient. Some patients feel worse on opioids, while others report quick pain relief. Some patients experience grueling withdrawal if taken off opioids, while for others the symptoms are much less severe. Some patients are at unusually high risk for addiction, while many \u2014 most, in fact \u2014 aren\u2019t. And so on.\n\nIn a few cases, then, opioids will still be the best answer for some individual chronic pain patients. When prescribed carefully on a schedule that works to diminish the excessive buildup of tolerance, they can work for some people. But as Stanford pain specialist Sean Mackey emphasized to me, opioids should not be a first-line treatment due to the risks, and alternatives should be tried first.\n\nThis, then, is another key caveat to the study: Its findings shouldn\u2019t be applied to every patient. Like much of health care, each case will typically require individual evaluations to see what works.\n\n\u201cThere are people who do well with tapering [opioids],\u201d Stefan Kertesz, an addiction researcher at the University of Alabama Birmingham who was not involved in the study, told me. \u201cThere are people who do not do well with tapering.\u201d\n\nBut the study suggests that getting some patients off opioids could improve their pain outcomes. The key is convincing patients that this truly can work so they buy into the treatment and genuinely follow through with it \u2014 and making non-opioid treatments for pain accessible enough that patients see them as realistic options.\n\nAlternative pain treatments need to be made more accessible\n\nThe reality, though, is non-opioid pain treatments are often out of reach for many Americans. Patients may not have insurance to cover the treatment. Even if they do have insurance, their health plan might not cover comprehensive pain care. And even if they do have insurance and their health plan covers pain treatments, there may not \u2014 particularly in rural areas \u2014 be a nearby pain clinic or doctor who can actually provide the care these patients are seeking.\n\nThis is something the study\u2019s authors readily acknowledge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an important part of this challenge,\u201d Frank said. \u201cThese non-opioid strategies that were tested in these research studies are not adequately available. Several of the studies were done in pain centers where they have expert programs, and those just are not widespread.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the lack of access to non-opioid strategies may be one big reason that doctors resorted to opioids in the first place. The drugs offered an easy answer \u2014 if ultimately an ineffective one \u2014 to the many problems doctors faced, including patients who had complicated pain problems that physicians didn\u2019t fully understand and tight schedules driven by the current demands of the health care system that made it hard to take the time to work through a patient\u2019s individual problems. (More on all that in my interview with Lembke.)\n\nTo address this, Frank argued that patients need better access to pain treatments. And doctors, especially primary care doctors who are frequently the first people patients see in the health care system, also need to be better trained to deal with chronic pain.\n\nThese solutions could help a lot of people: According to one study from the Institute of Medicine, 100 million US adults suffer from chronic pain. The opioid epidemic shows that if this care isn\u2019t made available, patients may end up resorting to drugs that can literally get them killed \u2014 or, as has been reported in other tragic cases, they may kill themselves once the pain grows too bad. (The newest study, however, noted that there is no good research yet looking at these two potential outcomes if pain patients are taken off opioids.)\n\n\u201cNot only do we lack the data, but I have seen and heard of countless cases of overdose and suicide from people who have been involuntarily discontinued,\u201d Kertesz said, emphasizing this is strictly based on anecdotal observations. \u201cOne day in June, in my inbox were 42 deaths.\u201d\n\nThe findings show the balancing act of opioid policy: Even if doctors need to pull back opioids, they must be careful to ensure patients suffering from debilitating pain and other problems can still meet their other care needs.\n\nIt\u2019s not just pain care. When dealing with opioid users who are addicted, doctors and policymakers also need to ensure that addiction treatment is available. Otherwise, these patients will likely try to find another source of drugs \u2014 even if it means resorting to a riskier opioid, such as heroin or fentanyl, to satisfy their cravings.\n\nThere\u2019s good evidence this happened to many \u2014 but not all \u2014 opioid painkiller users: A 2014 study in JAMA Psychiatry found 75 percent of heroin users in treatment started with painkillers, and a 2015 analysis by the CDC found people who are addicted to painkillers are 40 times more likely to be addicted to heroin.\n\nThe fundamental problem is many of these patients don\u2019t get addiction treatment once they lose access to painkillers or before they progress to heroin or fentanyl. Without the option of treatment, opioid users\u2019 only answer to averting dependence-induced withdrawal becomes harder drugs. Yet based on a 2016 report by the surgeon general, only 10 percent of Americans with drug use disorders get specialty treatment.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that reducing prescriptions is a mistake. By stopping doctors from unscrupulously prescribing the drugs, governments can potentially stop opioids from flowing to new users who didn\u2019t really need the drugs and could have developed addictions had they been allowed to get painkillers.\n\nBut the reduction has to be paired with increased access to addiction care \u2014 and it frequently hasn\u2019t been.\n\nBeyond addiction treatment, Kertesz argued that policymakers should also address some of the underlying conditions that drive addiction. He emphasized the need for broader mental health care, given that people often have mental health issues that can make addiction more likely.\n\n\u201cWho is at higher risk \u2014 John with PTSD and a dose of 10 milligrams a day, or James, who has no PTSD and is on 200 milligrams a day?\u201d Kertesz said. Based on his reading of the data, \u201cit\u2019s John with PTSD on the 10 milligrams.\u201d\n\nBut as is true for addiction and pain treatments, adequate mental health care is also out of reach for many patients \u2014 showing just another way that the US health care system isn\u2019t built to adequately address the full needs of patients.\n\nAll of this shows why the policy solution to the opioid epidemic isn\u2019t as easy as simply pulling back prescription opioids: To avoid exacerbating existing problems or causing new ones, policymakers need to consider the other needs of people who were perhaps getting opioids they didn\u2019t really need.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "We didn\u2019t see any gratuitous wording about the opioid epidemic or treating painkiller addiction in this story.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "How to treat patients who have microinvasive breast cancer - tumors that are 1 mm or less in size (the thickness of a dime) -- is somewhat controversial.

This amount of zinc is equivalent to what biofortified crops like zinc rice and zinc wheat can add to the diet of vulnerable, nutrient deficient populations.\n\nThe study, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, was led by CHORI Senior Scientist Janet King, PhD. King and her team are the first to show that a modest increase in dietary zinc reduces oxidative stress and damage to DNA.\n\n\"We were pleasantly surprised to see that just a small increase in dietary zinc can have such a significant impact on how metabolism is carried out throughout the body,\" says King. \"These results present a new strategy for measuring the impact of zinc on health and reinforce the evidence that food-based interventions can improve micronutrient deficiencies worldwide.\"\n\nZinc is ubiquitous in our body and facilitates many functions that are essential for preserving life. It plays a vital role in maintaining optimal childhood growth, and in ensuring a healthy immune system. Zinc also helps limit inflammation and oxidative stress in our body, which are associated with the onset of chronic cardiovascular diseases and cancers.\n\nAround much of the world, many households eat polished white rice or highly refined wheat or maize flours, which provide energy but do not provide enough essential micronutrients such as zinc. Zinc is an essential part of nearly 3,000 different proteins, and it impacts how these proteins regulate every cell in our body. In the absence of sufficient zinc, our ability to repair everyday wear and tear on our DNA is compromised.\n\nIn the randomized, controlled, six-week study the scientists measured the impact of zinc on human metabolism by counting DNA strand breaks. They used the parameter of DNA damage to examine the influence of a moderate amount of zinc on healthy living. This was a novel approach, different from the commonly used method of looking at zinc in the blood or using stunting and morbidity for assessing zinc status.\n\nAccording to King, these results are relevant to the planning and evaluation of food-based solutions for mitigating the impact of hidden hunger and malnutrition. King believes that biofortification can be a sustainable, long-term solution to zinc deficiency.\n\nIn addition to King, the study's other authors are Sarah J Zyba, Swapna V Shenvi, David W Killilea, Tai C Holland, Elijah Kim, Adrian Moy, Barbara Sutherland, Virginia Gildengorin, and Mark K Shigenaga, conducting the research at CHORI's Nutrition and Metabolism Center.\n\nUCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland (formerly Children's Hospital & Research Center Oakland) is a premier, not-for-profit medical center for children in Northern California, and is the only hospital in the East Bay 100% devoted to pediatrics.

High levels of PSA can be a marker for prostate cancer, although it's far from a perfect screening tool, experts say. Men with both high and low levels of PSA can have cancer or not have cancer.\n\nThe thought was that since high PSA levels are correlated with prostate cancer, rapidly rising levels of PSA, called \"PSA velocity,\" from one year to another would also be an indicator of prostate cancer.\n\nHowever, the new study found that PSA velocity doesn't add any useful information beyond what physicians can already tell from other methods of prostate cancer screening, including the one-time PSA level test and digital rectal exams.\n\nCurrent screening guidelines that recommend biopsies for men who have high PSA velocity but no other signs of prostate cancer -- such as a suspected abnormality during a digital rectal exam or high PSA level during a single test -- are leading to many unnecessary biopsies, the researchers said.\n\n\"We found there was no strong association between PSA velocity and prostate cancer, and virtually none with aggressive prostate cancer,\" said study author Andrew Vickers, of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. \"The velocity didn't add anything more to detecting aggressive prostate cancers.\"\n\nThe study is published online Feb. 24 in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nThe whole issue of prostate cancer screening -- including the PSA test, the digital rectal exam and PSA velocity -- has been controversial, said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society (ACS).\n\nPart of the difficulty is, while current screening methods are good at detecting cancer, they can't distinguish between aggressive, life-threatening prostate cancers and those that are slow-growing and relatively benign. And many prostate cancers are just that -- of little risk to men during their lifetimes, Brawley said.\n\nCurrent ACS prostate screening cancer guidelines recommend that men make an informed decision with their doctor about whether to be tested for prostate cancer. \"Research has not yet proven that the potential benefits of testing outweigh the harms of testing and treatment,\" according to the ACS.\n\nAs for PSA velocity, the ACS doesn't have a position on what PSA velocity warrants a biopsy.\n\nBut the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American Urological Association guidelines do recommend biopsies based on high PSA velocities, even in the absence of an elevated PSA or a suspicious digital rectal exam, according to background information in the study.\n\nAnd many internal medicine and primary-care doctors, in part because of fears of litigation, do order biopsies based on fast-rising PSA levels, Brawley said.\n\n\"It's something that has become almost a community standard. If a guy has a PSA of .8 last year, and a year or so later you've repeated it and it's 1.9, because it has increased by a factor of 1 he gets sent to biopsy,\" Brawley said.\n\nIn the study, researchers used data on more than 5,500 men in their 60s and 70s who took part in a drug trial for a prostate cancer prevention drug. The men in the study were all from the placebo arm, meaning they had not received the drug. As part of the trial, all of the men agreed to have a biopsy at the end of the trial, needed or not.\n\nResearchers did find a statistical association between PSA velocity and the chances of a biopsy coming back cancerous. But when they factored in other things that can influence risk, including a family history of the disease, being older, being black, PSA level and results of a digital rectal exam, there was virtually no association between PSA velocity and biopsy outcome.\n\n\"PSA velocity measurement is not useful,\" Brawley said.\n\nGrace Lu-Yao, a cancer epidemiologist at the Cancer Institute of New Jersey who wrote an accompanying editorial, said she agreed with the authors' conclusions that PSA velocity does not seem to be a good predictor of prostate cancer.\n\nIn addition, tracking PSA levels overtime can also cause anxiety to men, who often worry if their PSA level has suddenly shot up.\n\n\"According to the data, PSA velocity does not add any value, but it may add more anxiety,\" Lu-Yao said.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute has more on the PSA test.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story did not engage in overt disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Scientists have grown blood vessels for kidney patients from their own cells, making it easier and safer for them to use dialysis machines, a new study says.\n\nSome experts said the results suggested that doctors might one day be able to custom-produce blood vessels for patients with circulatory problems in their hearts or legs. Todd McAllister of Cytograft Tissue Engineering in California and colleagues implanted lab-grown blood vessels into 10 patients with advanced kidney disease in Argentina and Poland from 2004 to 2007.\n\nEarly results for two of these patients were announced in 2005. In 2007, the scientists published preliminary findings for another 4 patients in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nIn this most recent study, published Friday in the medical journal Lancet, scientists reported on the new blood vessels in those same patients and 4 others.\n\nDialysis patients need a vessel, or shunt, to connect them to dialysis machines. This can be made from their own vessels. But because dialysis is done so regularly, kidney patients often run out of healthy vessels and need an artificial one, often made out of gortex. Those are prone to infection and inflammation.\n\nIn the study, doctors took a small snippet of skin from patients. Cells from those samples were grown in a lab, to help them produce proteins like elastin and collagen. From those, scientists made sheets of tissue that were rolled into blood vessels 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 centimeters) long.\n\nThe vessels were finished after 6 to 9 months. All of the vessels were implanted into patients' upper arms, to connect them to dialysis machines.\n\nThe vessels failed in three of the patients, which experts said was not surprising in patients so seriously ill. One other patient withdrew from the study and another died of unrelated causes.\n\nIn the five remaining patients, the vessels worked for at least 6 to 20 months after they were implanted. Afterwards, those patients needed fewer interventions, including surgeries, to maintain the vessels than regular dialysis patients.\n\nMcAllister said he and colleagues plan to test similar devices in patients with heart and leg problems. \"It's basically a piece of plumbing to bypass blockages,\" he said.\n\nThe study was was paid for by Cytograft Tissue Engineering.\n\n\"This technology is very, very promising,\" said Vladimir Mironov of the Medical University of South Carolina, who co-wrote an accompanying commentary in the Lancet that praised the study as \"a revolutionary milestone.\"\n\n\"It's difficult to predict what will happen next, but they are on the right track,\" Mironov said.

Newly published research in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition showed that a hearty bowl of instant oatmeal helped curb food intake at lunch better than a leading oat-based, cold cereal -- even when each bowl provided the same number of calories.\n\nThe statistically significant results of the randomized, controlled crossover study (n=47) showed that a 250-calorie instant oatmeal serving (with an additional 113 calories of skim milk) enhanced satiety and feelings of fullness, reduced the desire to eat and may even lead to a lower caloric intake at lunch, compared to a 250-calorie serving of cold, oat-based cereal, also served with an additional 113 calories of skim milk.\n\n\"The satiety benefits of instant oatmeal alone were important findings,\" remarked lead author Candida Rebello, MS, RD, of Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University. \"When we took it a step further and evaluated the intake four hours post-breakfast, we found that after consuming instant oatmeal, the participants chose to eat significantly less at lunch compared to those who ate the oat-based, cold cereal.\"\n\nAfter an analysis of the types of fiber in each cereal, the researchers suspected that the higher molecular viscosity of the beta-glucan in the instant oatmeal contributed to its satiating effect over the oat-based, cold cereal. Authors stated that the processing of the cold cereal might lead to changes in the oat fiber that reduced its ability to enhance satiety.\n\nResearchers presented the participants with a lunch meal of their choice - turkey, ham, roast beef or vegetable patty sandwiches and a calorie-free or calorie-containing beverage, alongside potato crisps and cookies.

They are alive, with no evidence of cancer, 18 months later. Fifteen other patients who got the same treatment died.\n\nThe report, published online by the journal Science, is the latest result of a three-decade effort by surgeon Steven A.

Zeitzer's latest study, published Monday in the Journal of Clinical Investigation , could make treatment easier by providing light exposure during sleep, before the trip, without changing or interrupting your routine.\n\nThe circadian system is synchronized to the outside world through exposure to light; it controls sleep timing, hormone release and mood, said Zeitzer, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences. Jet lag occurs when sleeping and waking patterns are not synchronized to circadian rhythms.\n\nTo adapt to a new time zone, most people try to get as much light exposure as possible corresponding to their destination, either by waking up early before a trip or staying up late when they arrive, Zeitzer said. Or they do nothing and suffer the exhausting consequences; the body eventually adjusts at a slow pace of about one hour a day, taking up to three days to catch up.\n\nThrough light therapy, the technique Zeitzer is experimenting with, a person's brain can be tricked into adjusting more quickly to disturbances in sleep cycles by increasing how long he or she is exposed to light prior to traveling to a new time zone. The treatment \"exploits biology in the eye\" to speed up the brain's adjustment to time changes, he said.\n\nThis study builds on previous research published in 2014, which found that light therapy works best at night because the body's circadian rhythms are more sensitive to light at night, even through closed eyelids. In this latest study, Zeitzer and Raymond Najjar, a former postdoctoral scholar at Stanford now at Singapore Eye Research Institute, found that short flashes of light at night are more effective than continuous light exposure and could speed up the process of adjusting to a different time zone before a trip.\n\n\"The previous study was proof of principle: Can we elicit these kinds of changes and can we do it without interfering with sleep?\" Zeitzer said. This time around, researchers tried to further optimize the process.\n\nTo determine which would provide the fastest method of adjusting sleep cycles, researchers recruited 39 participants ages 19 to 36. They put them on a routine sleep-wake cycle, going to bed and waking up at the same time every day for about two weeks. They then had the volunteers sleep in the lab, where some were exposed to continuous light for an hour and others were exposed to a sequence of flashes of various frequencies for an hour.\n\nThey found that exposing people to two millisecond flashes of light, similar to a camera flash, every 10 seconds elicited two hours of change in circadian timing, compared with 36 minutes for those exposed to continuous light. Participants were able to sleep through the flashes of light without waking.\n\n\"You get more effectiveness out of flashes of light. It will enable us to have more potent countermeasures to jet lag than continuous light, which is the current prescribed light therapy treatment,\" Zeitzer said.\n\nThe treatment could benefit not only travelers but also overnight shift workers and people with constantly changing schedules, he said, but that's a long way off.

It notes the prevalence of hepatitis C among children, which \u201cvaries from 0.05%-0.36% in the United States and Europe and up to 1.8%-5.8% in some developing countries.\u201d It would have been even better with specific numbers.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Over the past two decades, the number of Americans having total hip replacements has more than doubled, to more than 300,000 a year. Though most patients eventually walk again without pain or the aid of a cane, recovery and rehabilitation can be rigorous, painful and lengthy.\n\nThe surgery is extensive: As its name suggests, it involves removing the joint \u2014 the damaged bone and cartilage \u2014 and replacing it with prosthetic parts made of metal, plastic or ceramics. Typically, surgeons enter the joint from the rear, which requires cutting through muscle and cartilage. But with a relatively new procedure, surgeons enter from the front and only stretch the muscles aside, avoiding the cutting and minimizing pain and recovery time. According to those who use this anterior technique, the benefits are substantial.\n\nAnthony Unger, medical director at the Institute of Bone and Joint Health at Sibley Memorial Hospital and a clinical professor of orthopedic surgery at George Washington University Hospital, says the anterior approach is \u201ctruly minimally invasive.\u201d Unger, who has done about 4,000 hip replacements over 26 years and has used the anterior technique for the past eight years, says \u201cpatients have better overall functionality, can sleep on their sides and be confident the new hip won\u2019t dislocate.\u201d\n\nBut, as with many transitions in medical techniques, some surgeons have been reluctant to change. Although agencies and hospitals don\u2019t track hip replacements by the type of procedure used, Unger says that, based on statistics from the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons, only 20 percent of its members choose the anterior approach.\n\nJoshua Jacobs, a vice president of the American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons and chairman of orthopedic surgery at Rush University in Chicago, says the AAOS doesn\u2019t \u201cendorse or promote one specific technique or procedure over another.\u201d Jacobs prefers the posterior approach, which he says has been reliable for him.\n\nHe says that while he\u2019s heard about the benefits of the anterior approach, he\u2019s \u201cnot aware of a randomized, controlled trial comparing the posterior and anterior approach that shows a definite superiority of one over the other.\u201d What\u2019s key is that \u201csurgeons need to do the approach they\u2019re most comfortable with to get the best outcomes.\u201d\n\nA study by Unger in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery in 2011 found that with the anterior procedure, there was less muscle damage and inflammation both in the immediate postoperative period and two days later than with the posterior approach.\n\nOthers surgeons who prefer the anterior procedure say it preserves more of the normal anatomy, which also means fewer medications and shorter hospital stays. Michael Bollinger, who operates at Palm Drive Hospital in Sebastopol, Calif., switched methods a few years ago.\n\nWith the anterior approach, Bollinger says, \u201cwe can take\n\nX-rays during the operation, to see if the new hip is placed correctly and adjust it, when necessary.\u201d Many surgeons use a special operating table that makes this possible.\n\nAlthough surgeons can also take X-rays during the posterior procedure, it is much more difficult, and they wait until patients are in the recovery room, where, Bollinger says, \u201cthere\u2019s not much that can be done.\u201d He explains that while the body \u201ctolerates an imperfect alignment pretty well, if a new hip gets dislocated, it\u2019s often because it\u2019s not in perfectly.\u201d\n\nRobert Saunders, a nurse at Alta Bates Summit Medical Center in Berkeley, Calif., sees about 200 hip replacement patients a year. He says that \u201cnurses love the anterior approach\u201d because there\u2019s less worry about dislocating the joint. \u201cWith the posterior approach, we have to spread patients\u2019 legs apart and strap them to a pillow to keep the new joint in place. If they want to move or roll over, they can\u2019t,\u201d he says.\n\nSaunders says the anterior patients also have an easier time with physical therapy, which can start the same day as the surgery. \u201cThose who\u2019ve had the posterior procedure have a lot of pain, since, when they sit up, they\u2019re right on top the incision,\u201d he explains.\n\nPatrick Kennelly, a physical therapist with Smartherapy in Chevy Chase, says people who have the anterior procedure \u201cdon\u2019t feel so weak, because their hip muscles haven\u2019t been cut. If they\u2019ve had the posterior procedure, even if they don\u2019t consciously feel weak, they tend to shift their weight onto one foot and teeter like [Charlie] Chaplin.\u201d\n\nGiven benefits such as these, why haven\u2019t more surgeons switched methods? Unger says that most surgeons have used the posterior approach for years, have fine results, and see no need to switch. Also, he says, they work in a \u201cvery high-stress, high-liability environment. For this reason, new techniques are adapted slowly with extreme care, and in some cases, not at all.\u201d\n\nUnger adds that surgeons are naturally cautious and typically wait to see results from many studies before they switch methods. Besides his study, there have only been a few others. One, a prospective, randomized study by William Barrett, an orthopedic surgeon in the Seattle area, compared the two approaches in a peer-reviewed paper he presented at the 2012 annual AAOS meeting and found benefits with the anterior approach.\n\nAnother obstacle to the widespread use of the newer approach is that if established surgeons want to switch, they face time and cost constraints. They must get training in classes and cadaver labs, and the learning curve can be steep. Unger says his was relatively short \u2014 about 20 cases. Others say it took about 50 cases.\n\nAnd this creates economic issues. \u201cIf you\u2019re a busy surgeon, you have a volume to maintain,\u201d Bollinger says, \u201cand it\u2019s hard to go from doing three a day to one during the learning period.\u201d\n\nChristopher Chen, a surgeon who uses the anterior approach at Alta Bates Summit, adds that most doctors \u201cstill use the posterior approach because it\u2019s the one they were taught.\u201d And, he says, the majority of younger surgeons learn the older approach because established surgeons are typically the ones who staff the residency training programs and demonstrate the method they know best.\n\nMost surgeons don\u2019t profit from choosing one approach over another, Chen says. \u201cIf there is a financial incentive\u201d for promoting the newer technique, he says, \u201cit is that more patients will want the anterior approach, so that the surgeon does more surgeries, and therefore collects more professional fees for that.\u201d\n\nWilliam Hamilton, who operates at the Anderson Orthopaedic Clinic at Inova Mt. Vernon Hospital, trains young surgeons to do the anterior approach in a year-long hip and knee replacement fellowship program. Hamilton says that \u201cduring this time, they\u2019re taught both approaches.\u201d But he adds that \u201csince 2009, of the 13 fellows he trained, 12 use the anterior procedure as their primary approach in their practices.\u201d\n\nHamilton says that \u201ca decade ago, very few residencies and fellowships taught the anterior approach. Now, several institutions around the country have at least one surgeon teaching it. So when students leave and begin their practices, it\u2019s no longer foreign to them.\u201d\n\nHamilton, who has performed 1,100 anterior procedures and strongly supports the method, says that despite growing interest, \u201cit will take a generation of new surgeons\u201d before use of the anterior approach is widespread.\n\nMany patients aren\u2019t aware of the option. The case of Daniel Ellsberg \u2014 who in 1971 released the Pentagon Papers, a secret study about U.S. involvement in Vietnam \u2014 is instructive. His hip had been hurting for about a year, and when he decided to have surgery, his primary-care physician recommended a respected surgeon. Just days before the operation last July, a friend told him about the anterior approach.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never heard of it, and neither my doctor nor surgeon mentioned it. I called the surgeon\u2019s office, learned he did the posterior procedure, asked for and got a recommendation for one who performs the anterior one, and my experience was amazing. The same day as the operation, I walked down the hall with a walker. I was home in three days, and a week later, [I] walked one or two blocks without pain or a cane. In a month, I bodysurfed at the beach,\u201d says Ellsberg, who is 81 .\n\nMargot Machol, who is two decades younger and lives in Washington, had both hips replaced \u2014 the first with the posterior procedure several years ago, the second with the anterior procedure last October. Unger performed both surgeries.\n\n\u201cAfter the first, I needed pain medicine when I came home from the hospital. Also, I had a long list of restrictions of what I could and couldn\u2019t do so the hip wouldn\u2019t pop out. For six weeks, I had to sleep on my back, couldn\u2019t cross my legs and wasn\u2019t able to drive.\n\n\u201cAfter the second, I didn\u2019t take any pain pills once I was home, slept on my side soon after the surgery, had almost no rules and drove my car in two weeks. I even wanted to ski over Christmas, because I felt fine,\u201d Machol says.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There is no disease mongering in this story.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Dermatologists will soon get some high-tech help deciding which suspicious-looking moles should be removed and checked for melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved a first-of-its-kind device, called MelaFind, that makes detailed, digital images of skin growths and uses a computer to analyze them for signs of cancer, offering a sort of second opinion to doctors. The device is approved only for dermatologists and only for use on growths that don't have obvious signs of cancer but still have one or two worrisome traits.\n\nThe hope is to find more melanomas sooner. Nearly all patients diagnosed with early-stage melanoma can be treated and cured, but 85 percent of patients with late-stage melanoma die from it within five years.\n\nMore than 70,000 people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with melanoma this year, and 16 percent are diagnosed only after the disease has spread to other parts of the body, according to estimates from the National Institutes of Health.\n\nTo diagnose the disease, doctors decide which moles to remove and biopsy using an entirely visual set of guidelines involving size, shape and color. Most dermatologists easily spot late-stage lesions that have obvious signs of cancer, including irregular edges, uneven color and a width greater than 6 millimeters. But many others are tough calls.\n\n\"Every day patients come in with 20 moles on their back and the dilemma is, which ones are suspicious and need to be biopsied?\" said Dr. David Pariser, former president of the American Academy of Dermatology. \"The diagnosis of melanoma is the most serious one a dermatologist makes, and we have sleepless nights worrying about it,\" said Pariser, who consulted for the device's maker, Mela Sciences Inc. of Irvington, N.Y., on its presentation to FDA.\n\nThe device's handheld attachment, about the size of a blow dryer, emits light that penetrates below the surface of the skin, taking multicolored images that reflect the depth and shape of skin growths. A computer compares these to a database of 10,000 archived images and recommends whether a biopsy should be done.\n\nIn a company-sponsored study published last year involving around 1,300 patients, some with multiple growths, doctors reported that MelaFind correctly suggested biopsies on 125 of 127 melanomas that doctors had removed. MelaFind correctly identified about 10 percent of non-cancerous growths, which was better than doctors in the study who were correct less than 4 percent of the time, on average. The study was published in the Archives of Dermatology.\n\nThe company's study was not intended to show that screening with the device saves lives, only that it can help improve a doctor's ability to spot melanoma.\n\nFor now, experts say MelaFind will help dermatologists make better decisions on which moles to remove.\n\n\"There is no such thing as 100 percent certainty in medicine,\" said Dr. George Elias, a melanoma expert at Georgetown's Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center who had no ties to the company or the device.\n\n\"Ultimately it's the responsibility of the dermatologist to use his clinical judgment to make the best decision. This machine is there to help him, not replace him.\"\n\nElias voted with the majority of an FDA panel that narrowly endorsed the device last year.\n\nDermatologists say it's too early to tell whether MelaFind will lead to fewer unnecessary biopsies.\n\n\"A biopsy takes a few minutes in my hands, so if there's an issue with any lesion we will always biopsy, whether we have a MelaFind picture or not,\" said Dr. Leonard Goldberg, a dermatologist at the Texas Medical Center and vice president of the Skin Cancer Foundation, a disease awareness group that accepts donations from makers of sunscreen.\n\nMelaFind underwent a contentious, years-long review by the Food and Drug Administration, which initially rejected the device and concluded it could \"potentially cause more harm than good.\"\n\nRegulators worried that the device could give physicians a false sense of certainty, leading to fewer biopsies. Another concern was that doctors could misinterpret the device's feedback, particularly error messages when a mole cannot be scanned. About 8 percent of growths scanned in the company study came back as \"unevaluable.\"\n\nAt a meeting last fall, FDA scientists said Mela Sciences had not shown how its device would influence day-to-day decisions by doctors. The agency also worried about its use by general doctors not accustomed to identifying suspicious skin moles. Despite these concerns, the panel of advisers narrowly backed the overall safety and efficacy of the device in a 8-7 vote.\n\nRegulators said this week that they ultimately approved the device after Mela Sciences agreed to limit its use to board-certified dermatologists who undergo a specialized training course.\n\n\"The device is only good for certain lesions, and that's why you have to be a dermatologist to be able to classify and categorize those lesions appropriately,\" said Christy Foreman, director of FDA's Office of Device Evaluation.\n\nForeman said an FDA-required follow-up study would help determine how much of a benefit MelaFind represents for patients.\n\n\"This device represents new technology. At the end of the day I don't know that this will be the best technology out there, but it is a step forward to allow continued innovation in this area,\" Foreman said.\n\nDon't expect to see a MelaFind machine at your next doctor's appointment. The company plans to bring them next year to just 200 dermatologists on the East coast, all of whom must undergo company training before they can begin using the device.\n\nDoctors will pay a one-time fee of $7,500 to lease and receive training on the device. Patients will pay $150 out of pocket for a MelaFind scan, which analysts say may limit use to more affluent patients who are willing to pay extra for the latest medical care.

It is led by Enrique Schisterman of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Results are in the current online issue of Human Reproduction.\n\nRusso says, \"One of our main findings is that there was no overall relationship between most types of physical activity and the likelihood of becoming pregnant for women who had already had one or two pregnancy losses, except for walking, which was associated with higher likelihood of becoming pregnant among women who were overweight or obese.\"\n\nWhitcomb, whose research on the determinants of fertility and pregnancy outcomes usually involves studying biomarkers at the molecular level, adds, \"Lifestyle is definitely relevant to these outcomes because it can have an effect at the molecular level. What we eat and what we do are potential factors we can change to shape our health. So this sort of research is important because it helps provide information on the things people can actually do something about.\"\n\nFurther, he says, \"We were happy to be able to add scientific evidence to general recommendations about physical activity. This is especially true for the results about walking for even limited blocks of time. Walking has great potential as a lifestyle change because of its low cost and availability.\"\n\nFor the 1,214 women in the study, the association of walking with the ability to become pregnant, known as fecundability, varied significantly by body mass index, the authors report. Among overweight/obese women, walking at least 10 minutes at a time was associated with improvement in fecundability. Further, in statistically adjusted models, women reporting more than four hours a week of vigorous activity had significantly higher pregnancy chances compared to no vigorous activity.\n\nModerate activity, sitting and other activity categories were not associated with fecundability overall or in BMI-stratified analyses, they add. Russo and Whitcomb say one finding that is still not clear is the different associations related to vigorous compared to moderate and low-intensity activities. Whitcomb says, \"We don't know what to make of the finding that high intensity physical activity may have different biological effects than walking, but our study doesn't offer enough detail to get at why vigorous activity would work differently than other levels.\"\n\nAmong a number of cautions the researchers point to in this work is that physical activity is related to other behaviors and lifestyle factors, and women who are more physically active may be different from women who are less active in many ways. Russo says, \"We did our best to try to account for the differences and to address them statistically.\"\n\nThe researchers also note that the overall generalizability of this work is limited because the study population may not be representative of the general population with regard to fecundability, and exercise habits may differ in women with prior miscarriage compared to those without.\n\nWhitcomb says another way in which this study is distinct from other work in this area has to do with who was included in the study. The EAGeR trial focused on women with a history of one or two prior pregnancy losses. However, he adds, \"We were happy to be able to conduct research considering women having the most difficulty getting and staying pregnant, and to provide messages about common lifestyle factors they may be able to address.\"\n\nThe researchers conclude that \"these findings provide positive evidence for the benefits of physical activity in women attempting pregnancy, especially for walking among those with higher BMI. Further study is necessary to clarify possible mechanisms through which walking and vigorous activity might affect time-to-pregnancy.\"", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "OKLAHOMA CITY, Sept. 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Arthrokinex announces the release of IRAPjoint\u2122 therapy in the USA.

Doctors can begin treatment immediately, trying to save the most important organ in the body. The brain, however, is also vulnerable to many more, much less visible ailments.\n\nConsider the case of Allie Orlando, a 23-year-old social service coordinator, who has received a plethora of diagnoses since she first saw a psychologist at 14. First, it was generalized anxiety disorder. Next, she was told she had depression. Then, when she was 17, it was settled: She suffered from borderline personality disorder. But when Orlando traveled out of state for college, she began seeing a new psychologist who strongly disagreed with her borderline diagnosis. Meanwhile, she continued to struggle and entered the hospital for suicidal ideation her sophomore year. The doctors there agreed: Borderline wasn\u2019t the right diagnosis, and maybe she should stop taking the meds she had been prescribed.\n\n\u201cI was just frustrated because the stigma attached to borderline is very strong,\u201d Orlando says. She had been open about her diagnosis in high school, but felt the \u201cborderline\u201d label may have scared some people off. She recalled her boyfriend at the time searching the web for her diagnosis and saying: \u201cOh God, no.\u201d After that, she kept quiet about her diagnosis, worried it would drive friends away. \u201cI\u2019m sure it also affected what meds I was prescribed. It took a few years to find the right \u2018formula\u2019 of meds.\u201d While the doctors recommended some medication that helped, it was a matter of trial and error, since Orlando still doesn\u2019t have a concrete diagnosis today.\n\nThe problem is that mental health diagnosis has essentially remained unchanged for 100 years, relying on symptoms and clinical interviews. Mental disorders lack what most other health diagnoses rely on: biological markers. A tumor seen on a scan, bacteria identified by a throat culture, a fracture captured on an X-ray: They\u2019re all clear signs something is wrong. Mental health disorders are difficult to diagnose even by the most well-trained, well-meaning psychiatrists, because all they have to go on are questions and, sometimes, answers. \u201cDiagnosis is really asking lots and lots of questions about their [patients\u2019] experience, looking at patients\u2019 answers both from what they say and how they say it,\u201d says Dr. Michael Dulchin, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the New York University Medical Center. The uncertainty can lead to dangerous misdiagnoses.\n\nWithout such signs to confirm their diagnosis, patients with mental illnesses are often burdened by the perception that they somehow have something less \u201creal\u201d than most other ailments. For years, researchers searched, in vain, for concrete signs in the brain that could tell them the difference between, for example, bipolar and depression. Now some believe the key may be realizing that mental illnesses are not necessarily contained in the brain: Biomarkers may be found throughout the entire body.\n\nDr. Sabine Bahn, a professor of neurotechnology at Cambridge University, leads a team researching this premise. As a Ph.D. student, she investigated the postmortem brains of psychiatric patients and was surprised to find differences in glucose regulation processes and certain parts of cell production in the brains of schizophrenia patients.\n\nBahn\u2019s team then looked at the cerebrospinal fluid of early-stage schizophrenia patients who had not yet taken any medication and again saw abnormalities in glucose handling. Bahn says it was a revelation that such changes could be spotted in the blood of patients in such early stages of the disease. What if, her team began to think, it could come up with a blood test for schizophrenia? Having this kind of tool would be invaluable\u2014with the current interview-based methods of diagnosis, subtle symptoms of schizophrenia are missed until too late, delaying treatment by months, or even years.\n\nArmed with her previous research, Bahn and her team detailed a panel of blood biomarkers in individuals who have an increased risk of schizophrenia but have no visible symptoms yet. The test, says Bahn, can accurately predict whether someone will \u201cdevelop schizophrenia over the next two years.\u201d\n\nBahn\u2019s finding is one of several recent advancements toward a comprehensive system of biological mental health diagnostic tools. One group of researchers, for example, recently worked backward to take on the problematic overlap between depression and bipolar disorder\u2014many bipolar patients are initially and incorrectly diagnosed with depression. The team took urine samples from patients who had been diagnosed with one of the two disorders and looked for differences between the two groups. The results, published in the Journal of Proteome Research, showed that 20 different metabolites differentiated the two groups. Another team of scientists identified differences in the throat bacteria of schizophrenic and healthy people. Previous research had suggested tentative links between immune disorders, which are influenced in part by microbes in the body, and schizophrenia; the new study, published in PeerJ, furthered the possibility that differences in oral bacteria could be associated with the disorder.\n\nDespite these exciting preliminary findings, there aren\u2019t yet any biological tests for mental illness widely used in medical practice. In some cases, the reason is primarily financial. \u201cThe problem with schizophrenia is that although about 1 percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia, the number of new patients per year is quite low, at 0.02 percent,\u201d says Bahn. \u201cAs the development costs of a test are very high, there is a risk that the test will not be commercially viable.\u201d For severe mental illnesses like schizophrenia, it\u2019s also the case that even if a test made it through development and hit the market, it may not be successfully integrated into psychiatric practice. That\u2019s because, Dulchin says, if a patient comes in with schizophrenia symptoms that a doctor knows can be alleviated with drugs, the doctor is not likely to deny that patient treatment\u2014no matter what a biological test says.\n\nThose working on these sorts of tests see them being implemented in a different setting entirely: when a patient comes into their internist seeking treatment for other conditions. \u201cPsychiatric disorders often present with other diseases such as diabetes and some immune disorders,\u201d says Bahn. If there was a blood test for depression, it could just become part of a standard panel\u2014and thus help achieve earlier diagnoses, and in turn earlier treatment, across the board.\n\nBut, if biological tests for mental illness do come to fruition, even those already living with a condition could benefit. \u201cI think if this biological aspect was attached to it, then people would see that stigmatizing someone for their depression is as ridiculous as stigmatizing someone for their diabetes,\u201d Orlando says. \u201cPeople often need concrete, tangible facts, and that\u2019s what scares them about mental illness and what causes the stigmatization\u2014they just don\u2019t understand it.\u201d", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There is no disease mongering in this piece, and we give it high marks for how it approaches the topic of mental health.

It's necessary for strong bones, and Rosen is a leading bone specialist. So he was surprised recently when his wife's new physician thought she might be deficient in vitamin D.\n\n\"She's a runner. She's in great shape,\" Rosen says. \"She drinks dairy. She gets a lot of sun exposure.\" Sun exposure is key for vitamin D, known as the sunshine vitamin. When skin is exposed to sun, it makes vitamin D.\n\nStill, the doctor wanted to run a blood test to see if Rebecca Rosen had adequate vitamin D.\n\n\"So my wife said, 'Well, why do I need to have a vitamin D [test]?' And the physician said, 'Well, that's part of our measurement for wellness.' \"\n\nIt's not just Rebecca's doctor, and it's not just in Portland, Maine. Increasingly, doctors all over the country are convinced that checking patients' vitamin D levels is as important as monitoring their cholesterol.\n\nMedicare payments for vitamin D testing, at $40 a pop, nearly quadrupled between 2006 and 2008, to $129 million. A decade ago, Medicare payments were only about $1 million. The figures for 2009 and this year are bound to be higher.\n\n\"There's overwhelming evidence ... that increasing your vitamin D intake can make substantial improvement in your overall health and welfare,\" says Dr. Michael Holick of Boston University. \"And there is no downside to increasing your vitamin D intake. As a result I think that most people are now getting on the bandwagon.\"\n\nHolick is leading the band. Forty years ago, he discovered the active form of the vitamin, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. He has written several popular books on the subject and has another one, The Vitamin D Solution, coming out next month. Its cover calls vitamin D deficiency \"our most common health problem.\"\n\n\"In my opinion, everybody should be taking either a vitamin D supplement, take a prescription that the doctor recommends,\" Holick says. \"All adults should be taking at least 1,000 to 1,500 international units a day.\" Dietary intake, mainly through sources such as vitamin D-fortified dairy products and juice, may add up to 200 to 400 units a day.\n\nHolick is convinced that if people boost their vitamin D levels, they'll be substantially less likely to develop not only osteoporosis but also many types of cancer, heart attack, diabetes (both types), autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's, autism, even tuberculosis and the flu.\n\nNot so fast, other experts say.\n\nDr. JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital, points out that nearly all of the proliferating studies involving vitamin D are what scientists call \"observational.\" That is, they compare people with high and low levels of vitamin D and correlate those levels with whether or not the person has a disease.\n\nBut these studies, she points out, are fraught with possible error. People with higher vitamin D levels may be healthier because they exercise more, have better diets, are out in the sun more. Those who are sick may have low levels because they don't have those healthy habits.\n\n\"We don't yet have the large-scale, randomized clinical trials showing benefits in terms of prevention of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, cognitive decline, depression, autoimmune disease,\" Manson says.\n\nManson and her colleagues are launching such a trial. The National Institutes of Health is devoting $22 million for a five-year study. Twenty-thousand people across the country will be randomly assigned to take daily doses of vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acid \u2014 also linked in many studies to lower levels of heart disease \u2014 together or alone. Others will be assigned to take inert placebo pills. Neither study subjects nor investigators will know until the end which regimen they are on.\n\n'Promising But Not Yet Proven'\n\nManson says she thinks there is promising evidence that vitamin D supplements may protect against heart disease and perhaps some cancers. The evidence is strongest for colorectal cancer, she says. The fact that the government is funding the study is an indicator that the idea has traction.\n\nUntil those results are in, Manson advises patients and doctors to view vitamin D claims as \"promising but not yet proven.\"\n\n\"We need to keep in mind the lessons of history,\" she says. \"It was believed that megadoses of vitamin E, beta-carotene, selenium, folic acid and the B vitamins would confer a large array of health benefits. And in fact, the trials were very disappointing for all those nutrients.\"\n\nIn the case of beta-carotene, scientists were surprised to find that when the results of randomized trials were in, those taking the supplement actually had a higher risk of lung cancer.\n\nHolick and others say there is little or no downside to ingesting even high levels of vitamin D.\n\n\"I've been treating patients with 50,000 units of vitamin D once a week for eight weeks followed by 50,00 every other week for over a decade, and I've not seen any untoward toxicity,\" Holick says.\n\nHe says he has seen dramatic results in patients he has treated with vitamin D supplements for disorders such as fibromyalgia, involving generalized muscular aches and pains, and multiple sclerosis. He is convinced that the vitamin D supplements lower patients' risk of cancer and heart disease, although he acknowledges that's harder to show.\n\nHow Much Is Enough?\n\nHolick himself takes 3,000 international units of vitamin D every day.\n\nSet by the National Institute of Medicine in 1997, the current recommended intake is 400 units a day for adults ages 50 to 70, and 200 units a day for younger adults. The American Academy of Pediatrics currently recommends 400 units a day for infants.\n\nThe recommendations may change soon. An Institute of Medicine panel is working on a vitamin D update, which may come out this summer. The panel may raise the Dietary Reference Intake, which has replaced the old Recommended Dietary Allowance. But the group is not expected to embrace the newer claims being made for vitamin D supplementation.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine panel has a difficult task. \"We don't know exactly where to draw the line in terms of calling someone deficient in vitamin D,\" says Manson, who is a member of the committee, as is Rosen, the Maine bone specialist.\n\nMeanwhile, an increasing number of patients are getting their vitamin D levels tested, and more are being told they need to take supplements.\n\n\"I've been surprised at the number of patients who are significantly vitamin D deficient,\" says Dr. Elizabeth Ross, a cardiologist in Washington, D.C., who has been testing patients routinely for the past year. \"Whether or not we'll affect the incidence of cardiovascular disease or other diseases remains to be seen.

Similar programs have been used to treat depression, but this may be the first one tested to prevent it, the researchers say.\n\nOnline programs for mental health problems can be as effective as face-to-face treatment and offer some advantages: Low cost, available at any time and customizable. But they're not panaceas.\n\nIn this experiment, half of the participants were asked to do six half-hour-long exercises that were based on cognitive behavioral therapy and problem-solving therapy, which are techniques commonly used for in-person therapy.\n\nIn the cognitive behavioral therapy, participants were asked to identify positive activities they used to engage in and then are asked to actively plan those activities again. At the next session, participants reflect on their experiences.\n\nFor the problem-solving therapy, people were asked to create a list of the things that matter most to them in their lives and brainstorm on how to incorporate those things into daily life. They next were asked to categorize problems and worries into \"manageable\" and \"unmanageable\"; the main focus in problem-solving therapy is to tackle those problems that are considered manageable.\n\nBoth cognitive-behavioral therapy and problem-solving therapy are intended to change negative thinking in order to alter mood and behavior.\n\nAfter completing each exercise, participants in the intervention group received written individualized feedback from an online trainer. The trainers did not offer any therapeutic advice, only motivation and encouragement to continue the exercises. Participants also could repeat the online sessions as often as they liked.\n\nThe control group received information about depression but was under no obligation to read it.\n\nThe study, which was conducted by researchers from Leuphana University in Lueneburg, Germany, recruited 406 people with subthreshold depression, which is defined as having some symptoms of depression but not enough to be diagnosed with major depressive disorder. It was published Tuesday in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nOf the 406 participants that began the study, 335 completed the telephone follow-up at the end of 12 months. Twenty-seven percent in the intervention group experienced depression compared with 41 percent in the control group.\n\nIt is unclear if the people who went on to develop major depressive disorder had experienced it before. Lead author Claudia Buntrock, a PhD candidate in clinical psychology at Leuphana, says that because the study only tracked participants' mental health over the course of 12 months, the long-term effectiveness of the intervention is unknown.\n\nIt's also not clear if this kind of program could be scaled up. It took the trainers about 30 minutes to provide feedback for each session, and they also stayed in touch with participants via instant messaging, Buntrock says.\n\nOther experiments with online therapy have found that people didn't continue it if it wasn't guided by an actual human. One reason could be that when people are depressed, they can have a hard time getting motivated to do things.\n\n\"More studies are needed to evaluate the preventive effects of unguided web-based interventions on the onset of major depressive disorder,\" Buntrock wrote in an email. Still, Buntrock seems pleased with the results, especially since the German insurance company BARMER GEK that sponsored the trial is now providing it to its customers.\n\n\"I was surprised by the big response to our study,\" Buntrock wrote. \"And of course, I'm surprised about what happens now; that a health insurance company offers the intervention to its members.

The paid for the study.\n\nDoctors and patients alike find it easy to accept more cancer treatment on the basis of a study, Dr. Morrow said, but get scared when the data favor less treatment.\n\nThe new findings are part of a trend to move away from radical surgery for breast cancer. Rates of , removal of the whole breast, began declining in the 1980s after studies found that for many patients, survival rates after and radiation were just as good as those after mastectomy.\n\nThe trend reflects an evolving understanding of breast cancer. In decades past, there was a belief that surgery could \u201cget it all\u201d \u2014 eradicate the cancer before it could spread to organs and bones. But research has found that breast cancer can begin to spread early, even when are small, leaving microscopic traces of the disease after surgery.\n\nThe modern approach is to cut out obvious tumors \u2014 because lumps big enough to detect may be too dense for drugs and radiation to destroy \u2014 and to use radiation and chemotherapy to wipe out microscopic disease in other places.\n\nBut doctors have continued to think that even microscopic disease in the lymph nodes should be cut out to improve the odds of survival. And until recently, they counted cancerous lymph nodes to gauge the severity of the disease and choose chemotherapy. But now the number is not so often used to determine drug treatment, doctors say. What matters more is whether the disease has reached any nodes at all. If any are positive, the disease could become deadly. Chemotherapy is recommended, and the drugs are the same, no matter how many nodes are involved.\n\nThe new results do not apply to all patients, only to women whose disease and treatment meet the criteria in the study.\n\nThe tumors were early, at clinical stage T1 or T2, meaning less than two inches across. Biopsies of one or two armpit nodes had found cancer, but the nodes were not enlarged enough to be felt during an exam, and the cancer had not spread anywhere else. The women had lumpectomies, and most also had radiation to the entire breast, and chemotherapy or hormone-blocking drugs, or both.\n\nThe study, at 115 medical centers, included 891 patients. Their median age was in the mid-50s, and they were followed for a median of 6.3 years.\n\nAfter the initial node , the women were assigned at random to have 10 or more additional nodes removed, or to leave the nodes alone. In 27 percent of the women who had additional nodes removed, those nodes were cancerous. But over time, the two groups had no difference in survival: more than 90 percent survived at least five years. Recurrence rates in the armpit were also similar, less than 1 percent. If breast cancer is going to recur under the arm, it tends to do so early, so the follow-up period was long enough, the researchers said.\n\nOne potential weakness in the study is that there was not complete follow-up information on 166 women, about equal numbers from each group. The researchers said that did not affect the results. A statistician who was not part of the study said the missing information should have been discussed further, but probably did not have an important impact.\n\nIt is not known whether the findings also apply to women who do not have radiation and chemotherapy, or to those who have only part of the breast irradiated. Nor is it known whether the findings could be applied to other types of cancer.\n\nThe results mean that women like those in the study will still have to have at least one removed, to look for cancer and decide whether they will need more treatment. But taking out just one or a few nodes should be enough.\n\nDr. Armando E. Giuliano, the lead author of the study and the chief of surgical oncology at the Cancer Institute at St. John\u2019s Health Center in , Calif., said: \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t come as a big surprise, but it will. It\u2019s hard for us as surgeons and medical oncologists and radiation oncologists to accept that you don\u2019t have to remove the nodes in the armpit.\u201d\n\nDr. Grant W. Carlson, a professor of surgery at the Winship Cancer Institute at , and the author of an editorial accompanying the study, said that by routinely taking out many nodes, \u201cI have a feeling we\u2019ve been doing a lot of harm.\u201d\n\nIndeed, women in the study who had the nodes taken out were far more likely (70 percent versus 25 percent) to have complications like infections, abnormal sensations and fluid collecting in the armpit. They were also more likely to have lymphedema.\n\nBut Dr. Carlson said that some of his colleagues, even after hearing the new study results, still thought the nodes should be removed.\n\n\u201cThe dogma is strong,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little frustrating.\u201d\n\nEventually, he said, genetic testing of breast tumors might be enough to determine the need for treatment, and eliminate the need for many node biopsies.\n\nTwo other breast surgeons not involved with the study said they would take it seriously.\n\nDr. Elisa R. Port, the chief of breast surgery at in Manhattan, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal in the world of breast cancer. It\u2019s definitely practice-changing.\u201d\n\nDr. Alison Estabrook, the chief of the comprehensive breast center at St. Luke\u2019s-Roosevelt hospital in New York said surgeons had long been awaiting the results.\n\n\u201cIn the past, surgeons thought our role was to get out all the cancer,\u201d Dr. Estabrook said. \u201cNow he\u2019s saying we don\u2019t really have to do that.\u201d\n\nBut both Dr. Estabrook and Dr. Port said they would still have to make judgment calls during surgery and remove lymph nodes that looked or felt suspicious.\n\nThe new research grew out of efforts in the 1990s to minimize lymph node surgery in the armpit, called axillary dissection. Surgeons developed a technique called sentinel node biopsy, in which they injected a dye into the breast and then removed just one or a few nodes that the dye reached first, on the theory that if the was spreading, cancer cells would show up in those nodes. If there was no cancer, no more nodes were taken. But if there were cancer cells, the surgeon would cut out more nodes.\n\nAlthough the technique spared many women, many others with positive nodes still had extensive cutting in the armpit, and suffered from side effects.\n\n\u201cWomen really dread the axillary dissection,\u201d Dr. Giuliano said. \u201cThey fear lymphedema. There\u2019s numbness, , and some have limitation of motion. There are a fair number of serious complications. Women know it.\u201d\n\nAfter armpit surgery, 20 percent to 30 percent of women develop lymphedema, Dr. Port said, and radiation may increase the rate to 40 percent to 50 percent. Physical therapy can help, but there is no cure.\n\nThe complications \u2014 and the fact that there was no proof that removing the nodes prolonged survival \u2014 inspired Dr. Giuliano to compare women with and without axillary dissection. Some doctors objected. They were so sure cancerous nodes had to come out that they said the study was unethical and would endanger women.\n\n\u201cSome prominent institutions wouldn\u2019t even take part in it,\u201d Dr. Giuliano said, though he declined to name them. \u201cThey\u2019re very supportive now.

It does not change the treatment plan, improve survival or make the cancer less likely to recur.

Sometimes the situation is truly life-threatening. But often the problem is that labor simply isn't progressing. That was the case for Valerie Echo Duckett, 35, who lives in Columbus, Ohio. After receiving an epidural for pain, Duckett's contractions stopped. By late evening she was told she'd need a C-section to deliver her son, Avery. Duckett says she has vague memories of being wheeled into the operating room, strapped down and shaking from cold.\n\n\"They were covering me up with warm blankets,\"she says. \"I kind of slept in and out of it.\" Her only memory of meeting her newborn son for the first time was from some pictures her husband took.\n\nThis is the experience many women have. The cesarean section is the most common surgery in America \u2014 about 1 in 3 babies is delivered this way. But for many women, being told they need a C-section is unpleasant news. Duckett says she felt like she missed out on a pivotal moment in her pregnancy.\n\n\"It took me a long time even to be able to say that I gave birth to Avery,\" she says. \"I felt like I didn't earn the right to say I gave birth to him, like it was taken from me somehow, like I hadn't done what I was supposed to do.\"\n\nDuckett's reaction to her C-section is unfortunately a common one, says Betsey Snow, head of Family and Child Services at Anne Arundel Medical Center, a community hospital in Annapolis, Md.\n\n\"I hear a lot of moms say, 'I'm disappointed I had to have a C-section.' A lot of women felt like they failed because they couldn't do a vaginal delivery,\" says Snow.\n\nNow some hospitals are offering small but significant changes to the procedure to make it seem more like a birth than major surgery.\n\nIn a typical C-section, a closed curtain shields the sterile operating field. Mothers don't see the procedure and their babies are immediately whisked away for pediatric care \u2014 a separation that can last for close to half an hour. Kristen Caminiti, of Crofton, Md., knows this routine well. Her first two sons were born by traditional cesarean. She was happy with their births because, she says, it was all she knew. Then, just a few weeks into her third pregnancy, Caminiti, who is 33, saw a post on Facebook about family-centered cesarean techniques catching on in England.\n\n\"I clicked on the link and thought, 'I want that,' \" she says.\n\nThe techniques are relatively easy and the main goals simple: Let moms see their babies being born if they want and put newborns immediately on the mother's chest for skin-to-skin contact. This helps stimulate bonding and breast feeding. Caminiti asked her obstetrician, Dr. Marcus Penn, if he'd allow her to have this kind of birth. He said yes.\n\nWhen Caminiti told Penn what she wanted, his first thought was it wouldn't be that difficult to do. \"I didn't see anything that would be terribly out of the norm,\" he says. \"It would be different from the way we usually do it, but nothing terrible that anyone would say we shouldn't try that.\"\n\nFamily-centered cesareans are a relatively new idea in the U.S., and many doctors and hospitals have no experience with them. Penn and the staff at Anne Arundel Medical Center quickly realized the procedure would require some changes, including adding a nurse and bringing the neonatal team into the operating room.\n\nAnd there were a bunch of little adjustments, such as moving the EKG monitors from their usual location on top of the mother's chest to her side. This allows the delivery team to place the newborn baby immediately on the mother's chest. In addition, Penn says, the mother's hands were not strapped down and the intravenous line was put in her nondominant hand so she could hold the baby.\n\nAt the beginning of October, Caminiti underwent her C-section. She was alert, her head was up and the drape lowered so she could watch the delivery of her son, Connor. Caminiti's husband, Matt, recorded the event. After Connor was out, with umbilical cord still attached, he was placed right on Caminiti's chest.\n\n\"It was the most amazing and grace-filled experience to finally have that moment of having my baby be placed on my chest,\" Caminiti says. \"He was screaming and then I remember that when I started to talk to him he stopped. It was awesome.\"\n\nAnd the baby stayed with her for the rest of the procedure.\n\nChanges like this can make a big difference, says Dr. William Camann, the director of obstetric anesthesiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and one of the pioneers of the procedure in the U.S. At Brigham and Women's, their version of the family-centered cesarean is called the gentle cesarean. Moms who opt for it can view the birth through a clear plastic drape, and immediate skin-to-skin contact follows.\n\nCamann says the gentle C-section is not a replacement for a vaginal birth; it's just a way to improve the surgical experience. \"No one is trying to advocate for C-sections. We really don't want to increase the cesarean rate, we just want to make it better for those who have to have it,\" he says.\n\nSo why has the procedure been slow to catch on? Hospitals aren't charging more for it \u2014 so cost doesn't seem to be a major factor. What's lacking are clinical studies. Without hard scientific data on outcomes and other concerns like infection control, many hospitals may be wary of changing their routines. Betsey Snow of Anne Arundel Medical Center says the family-centered C-section represents a cultural shift, and her hospital is helping break new ground by adopting it.\n\n\"It is the first time we have really done anything innovative or creative with changing the C-section procedure in years,\" she says.\n\nKristen Caminiti says her hope is that these innovations become routine. She says she'd like nothing more than to know that other women having C-sections are able to have the same amazing experience she had.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There is potential for disease-mongering in the concept of the family-centered C-section.

Using this technology is still seen as a stopgap, however, while a biological solution to diabetes is sought.\n\n\"We have pioneered the development of a closed-loop artificial pancreas because we believe it will significantly impact the lives of individuals with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, by providing exquisite control of blood sugar,\" Dr. Richard A. Insel, executive vice president for research at the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF), said during a noon teleconference Saturday.\n\nA symposium on advances in the technology -- co-sponsored by the American Diabetes Association and the JDRF -- is slated for Sunday as part of the American Diabetes Association's annual meeting, in Orlando, Fla.\n\nFor people with type 1 diabetes, controlling their blood sugar levels is a full-time job. Too much insulin can cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), which can be life-threatening, while too little causes the serious damage of diabetes such as kidney, vision and circulation problems.\n\n\"The promise in the near term of these technologies is not only to help us reduce significantly the risk of long-term diabetic complications, but also to reduce the risk of having a catastrophic hypoglycemic event, and further help people with diabetes live easier,\" Aaron Kowalski, research director of the JDRF's Artificial Pancreas Project, said during the teleconference.\n\n\"This will help keep people healthy while we drive toward a biological approach, which will take longer,\" he said.\n\nIn the first report, Dr. Roman Hovorka, a principal research associate in the department of pediatrics at the University of Cambridge, reported that the technology can significantly improve overnight blood sugar control in adults without the fear of developing hypoglycemia. With the technology, patients maintained their blood sugar levels within the target range for 70 percent of the time, compared to 47 percent of the time among those not using the technology.\n\nMoreover, glucose control was demonstrated in real-life situations such as after a large meal and having a glass of white wine.\n\n\"We let them consume about three-quarters of a bottle of wine to simulate what happens after a large meal,\" Hovorka said during Saturday's teleconference. \"What has been shown is that drinking alcohol in the evening causes hypoglycemia early in the morning.\"\n\nThese results were similar to findings in children where the system extended the amount of time spent at target blood sugar levels, he added. \"We reduced hypoglycemia by half,\" he said.\n\n\"Our plan is to move into home studies, which hopefully will happen later on this year,\" Hovorka said.\n\nMeanwhile, Marilyn Ritholz, a senior psychologist at the Joslin Diabetes Center and an assistant professor of psychology at the Harvard Medical School, reported on a study on psychological barriers to continuous blood sugar monitoring.\n\n\"So far, studies have not shown which factors predict which factors are associated with successful or unsuccessful continuous glucose monitoring [CGM],\" she said during the teleconference.\n\nRitholz's team found that people who were better at coping with the frustration of using the device were more successful at keeping their blood sugar under control.\n\nFrustrations included warning alarms and problems at the insertion point of the device. \"We found that the people who did well used a more problem-solving approach and persisted in trying to learn how to use the CGM,\" she said.\n\nPeople who were not successful used \"emotion-based coping,\" Ritholz said. \"They easily became overwhelmed and they just gave up.\"\n\nIn addition, successful people had more involvement and support from their spouse or \"significant other,\" she added. All patients felt self-conscious wearing the device, Ritholz noted.\n\n\"We know that CGM success or failure is as dependent on the human experience as it is on the perfection of the technology,\" she said.\n\nSpeaking at the Saturday teleconference, Dr. William Tamborlane, chief of pediatric endocrinology at Yale University School of Medicine and co-chair of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's Continuous Glucose Monitoring Group, said the system only works if worn almost every day.\n\nStudies have shown that children and adults over 25 who used CGM were able to reduce their blood sugar levels. However, teenagers did not see a benefit, probably because they were less likely to wear the device, Tamborlane said.\n\nPeople who used the device more than six days per week saw improvement, regardless of age, he added.\n\nTo get more people to use CGM, \"the industry needs to come up with better systems and better devices,\" he said.\n\nArtificial pancreas technology combines CGM with an insulin pump and a sophisticated computer program that controls when and how much insulin to deliver.\n\nThe device delivers two hormones that are deficient in type 1 diabetes -- insulin, which keeps blood sugar levels from going too high after a meal, and glucagon, a naturally occurring hormone that prevents blood sugar levels from dropping too low.\n\nHowever, the complicated computer algorithm for the pump system is still being developed.\n\nFor more information on type 1 diabetes, visit the American Diabetes Association.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No overt disease mongering.

Hands-only CPR is simpler and easier to remember and removes a big barrier for people skittish about the mouth-to-mouth breathing.\n\n\"You only have to do two things. Call 911 and push hard and fast on the middle of the person's chest,\" said Dr. Michael Sayre, an emergency medicine professor at Ohio State University who headed the committee that made the recommendation.\n\nHands-only CPR calls for uninterrupted chest presses - 100 a minute - until paramedics take over or an automated external defibrillator is available to restore a normal heart rhythm.\n\nThis action should be taken only for adults who unexpectedly collapse, stop breathing and are unresponsive. The odds are that the person is having cardiac arrest - the heart suddenly stops - which can occur after a heart attack or be caused by other heart problems. In such a case, the victim still has ample air in the lungs and blood and compressions keep blood flowing to the brain, heart and other organs.\n\nA child who collapses is more likely to primarily have breathing problems - and in that case, mouth-to-mouth breathing should be used. That also applies to adults who suffer lack of oxygen from a near-drowning, drug overdose, or carbon monoxide poisoning. In these cases, people need mouth-to-mouth to get air into their lungs and bloodstream.\n\nBut in either case, \"Something is better than nothing,\" Sayre said.\n\nThe CPR guidelines had been inching toward compression-only. The last update, in 2005, put more emphasis on chest pushes by alternating 30 presses with two quick breaths; those \"unable or unwilling\" to do the breaths could do presses alone.\n\nNow the heart association has given equal standing to hands-only CPR. Those who have been trained in traditional cardiopulmonary resuscitation can still opt to use it.\n\nSayre said the association took the unusual step of making the changes now - the next update wasn't due until 2010 - because three studies last year showed hands-only was as good as traditional CPR. Hands-only will be added to CPR training.\n\nAn estimated 310,000 Americans die each year of cardiac arrest outside hospitals or in emergency rooms. Only about 6 percent of those who are stricken outside a hospital survive, although rates vary by location. People who quickly get CPR while awaiting medical treatment have double or triple the chance of surviving. But less than a third of victims get this essential help.\n\nDr. Gordon Ewy, who's been pushing for hands-only CPR for 15 years, said he was \"dancing in the streets\" over the heart association's change even though he doesn't think it goes far enough. Ewy (pronounced AY-vee) is director of the University of Arizona Sarver Heart Center in Tucson, where the compression-only technique was pioneered.\n\nEwy said there's no point to giving early breaths in the case of sudden cardiac arrest, and it takes too long to stop compressions to give two breaths - 16 seconds for the average person. He noted that victims often gasp periodically anyway, drawing in a little air on their own.\n\nAnonymous surveys show that people are reluctant to do mouth-to-mouth, Ewy said, partly because of fear of infections.\n\n\"When people are honest, they're not going to do it,\" he said. \"It's not only the yuck factor.\"\n\nIn recent years, emergency service dispatchers have been coaching callers in hands-only CPR rather than telling them how to alternate breaths and compressions.\n\n\"They love it. It's less complicated and the outcomes are better,\" said Dallas emergency medical services chief Dr. Paul Pepe, who also chairs emergency medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.\n\nOne person who's been spreading the word about hands-only CPR is Temecula, Calif., chiropractor Jared Hjelmstad, who helped save the life of a fellow health club member in Southern California\n\nHjelmstad, 40, had read about it in a medical journal and used it on Garth Goodall, who collapsed while working out at their gym in February. Hjelmstad's 15-year-old son Josh called 911 in the meantime.\n\nHjelmstad said he pumped on Goodall's chest for more than 12 minutes - encouraged by Goodall's intermittent gasps - until paramedics arrived. He was thrilled to find out the next day that Goodall had survived.\n\nOn Sunday, he visited Goodall in the hospital where he is recovering from triple bypass surgery.\n\n\"After this whole thing happened, I was on cloud nine,\" said Hjelmstad. \"I was just fortunate enough to be there.\"\n\nGoodall, a 49-year-old construction contractor, said he had been healthy and fit before the collapse, and there'd been no hint that he had clogged heart arteries.\n\n\"I was lucky,\" he said. Had the situation been reversed, \"I wouldn't have known what to do.\"\n\n\"It's a second lease on life,\" he added.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The segment does nothing to exaggerate the frequency or severity of sudden cardiac arrest.

Similar approaches are also being tried at other centers, including the and in New York.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to have a cure, but we can\u2019t say that word,\u201d said Dr. Carl June, who leads the research team at the University of Pennsylvania. He hopes the new treatment will eventually replace bone-marrow transplantation, an even more arduous, risky and expensive procedure that is now the last hope when other treatments fail in leukemia and related diseases.\n\nThree adults with chronic leukemia treated at the University of Pennsylvania have also had complete remissions, with no signs of disease; two of them have been well for more than two years, said Dr. David Porter. Four adults improved but did not have full remissions, and one was treated too recently to evaluate. A child improved and then relapsed. In two adults, the treatment did not work at all. The researchers were presenting their results on Sunday and Monday in at a meeting of the American Society of Hematology.\n\nDespite the mixed results, cancer experts not involved with the research say it has tremendous promise, because even in this early phase of testing it has worked in seemingly hopeless cases. \u201cI think this is a major breakthrough,\u201d said Dr. Ivan Borrello, a cancer expert and associate professor of medicine at the School of Medicine.\n\nDr. John Wagner, the director of pediatric blood and marrow transplantation at the , called the Pennsylvania results \u201cphenomenal\u201d and said they were \u201cwhat we\u2019ve all been working and hoping for but not seeing to this extent.\u201d\n\nA major drug company, , is betting on the Pennsylvania team and has committed $20 million to building a research center on the university\u2019s campus to bring the treatment to market.\n\nHerv\u00e9 Hoppenot, the president of Novartis Oncology, called the research \u201cfantastic\u201d and said it had the potential \u2014 if the early results held up \u2014 to revolutionize the treatment of leukemia and related blood cancers. Researchers say the same approach, reprogramming the patient\u2019s immune system, may also eventually be used against like breast and .\n\nTo perform the treatment, doctors remove millions of the patient\u2019s T-cells \u2014 a type of white blood cell \u2014 and insert new genes that enable the T-cells to kill cancer cells. The technique employs a disabled form of H.I.V. because it is very good at carrying genetic material into T-cells. The new genes program the T-cells to attack B-cells, a normal part of the immune system that turn malignant in leukemia.\n\nThe altered T-cells \u2014 called chimeric antigen receptor cells \u2014 are then dripped back into the patient\u2019s veins, and if all goes well they multiply and start destroying the cancer.\n\nThe T-cells home in on a protein called CD-19 that is found on the surface of most B-cells, whether they are healthy or malignant.\n\nA sign that the treatment is working is that the patient becomes terribly ill, with raging fevers and chills \u2014 a reaction that oncologists call \u201cshake and bake,\u201d Dr. June said. Its medical name is cytokine-release syndrome, or cytokine storm, referring to the natural chemicals that pour out of cells in the immune system as they are being activated, causing fevers and other symptoms. The storm can also flood the lungs and cause perilous drops in \u2014 effects that nearly killed Emma.\n\nSteroids sometimes ease the reaction, but they did not help Emma. Her temperature hit 105. She wound up on a ventilator, unconscious and swollen almost beyond recognition, surrounded by friends and family who had come to say goodbye.\n\nBut at the 11th hour, a battery of blood tests gave the researchers a clue as to what might help save Emma: her level of one of the cytokines, interleukin-6 or IL-6, had shot up a thousandfold. Doctors had never seen such a spike before and thought it might be what was making her so sick.\n\nDr. June knew that a drug could lower IL-6 \u2014 his daughter takes it for . It had never been used for a crisis like Emma\u2019s, but there was little to lose. Her oncologist, Dr. Stephan A. Grupp, ordered the drug. The response, he said, was \u201camazing.\u201d\n\nWithin hours, Emma began to stabilize. She woke up a week later, on May 2, the day she turned 7; the intensive-care staff sang\n\nSince then, the research team has used the same drug, tocilizumab, in several other patients.\n\nIn patients with lasting remissions after the treatment, the altered T-cells persist in the bloodstream, though in smaller numbers than when they were fighting the disease. Some patients have had the cells for years.\n\nDr. Michel Sadelain, who conducts similar studies at the Sloan-Kettering Institute, said: \u201cThese T-cells are living drugs. With a pill, you take it, it\u2019s eliminated from your body and you have to take it again.\u201d But T-cells, he said, \u201ccould potentially be given only once, maybe only once or twice or three times.\u201d\n\nThe Pennsylvania researchers said they were surprised to find any big drug company interested in their work, because a new batch of T-cells must be created for each patient \u2014 a far cry from the familiar commercial strategy of developing products like or medicines, in which millions of people take the same drug.\n\nBut Mr. Hoppenot said Novartis was taking a different path with cancer drugs, looking for treatments that would have a big, unmistakable impact on a small number of patients. Such home-run drugs can be approved more quickly and efficiently, he said, with smaller studies than are needed for drugs with less obvious benefits.\n\nBut such drugs tend to be extremely expensive. A prime example is the Novartis drug Gleevec, which won rapid approval in 2001 for use against certain types of leukemia and gastrointestinal tumors. It can cost more than $5,000 a month, depending on the dosage.\n\nDr. June said that producing engineered T-cells costs about $20,000 per patient \u2014 far less than the cost of a bone-marrow transplant. Scaling up the procedure should make it even less expensive, he said, but he added, \u201cOur costs do not include any profit margin, facility depreciation costs or other clinical care costs, and other research costs.\u201d\n\nThe research is still in its early stages, and many questions remain. The researchers are not entirely sure why the treatment works, or why it sometimes fails. One patient had a remission after being treated only twice, and even then the reaction was so delayed that it took the researchers by surprise. For the patients who had no response whatsoever, the team suspects a flawed batch of T-cells. The child who had a temporary remission apparently relapsed because not all of her leukemic cells had the marker that was targeted by the altered T-cells.\n\nIt is not clear whether a patient\u2019s body needs the altered T-cells forever. The cells do have a drawback: they destroy healthy B-cells as well as cancerous ones, leaving patients vulnerable to certain types of infections, so Emma and the other patients need regular treatments with immune globulins to prevent illness.\n\nSo far, her parents say, Emma seems to have taken it all in stride. She went back to school this year with her second-grade classmates, and though her grades are high and she reads about 50 books a month, she insists impishly that her favorite subjects are lunch and recess.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for her to be a kid again and get her childhood back,\u201d Mr. Whitehead said.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "While certainly a terrible disease, acute lymphoblastic leukemia is\u00a0a treatable cancer.

In July 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration mandated that Chantix carry a \"black box\" warning about the potential risks of depression and suicidal thoughts. Recently, the drug was linked to a small but significant risk of heart attack and stroke among people with pre-existing heart disease. Chantix costs roughly $3 per pill.\n\nThe results of the new study were released online in Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research prior to publication in the May print issue.\n\nThe study included 15 healthy participants who took part in six sessions.

It diagnoses prostate cancer that's going to actually cause harm,\" said Dr. H. Ballentine Carter, urology chief at Johns Hopkins University, who led the research published Tuesday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nThe study is far from proof that making health decisions based on so-called PSA velocity can really save lives.\n\nBut Carter contends the findings suggest that men should consider getting a baseline PSA test around age 40, instead of the more usual 50, to use as a comparison for future changes.\n\nPSA tests are used to screen men for prostate cancer, but they're imprecise. Too much PSA, or prostate-specific antigen, in a man's blood can indicate that he has either a benign enlarged prostate or cancer. Only a biopsy can tell the difference.\n\nIt's not even clear when is the best time to do a biopsy. Some men have cancer despite a \"normal\" PSA count of 4 or below. Yet routinely biopsying men with low PSA would worsen another problem, overdiagnosis. Many specialists say too many men today are undergoing side effect-prone treatment for tumors too small and slow-growing to ever threaten their lives.\n\nTwo years ago, Boston researchers reported that men whose PSA levels jumped more than 2 points the year before diagnosis were more likely to relapse and die despite prostate surgery. But those were men whose PSA levels were already fairly high.\n\nHopkins' Carter wondered if doctors could catch such men far sooner, when the cancer might be more treatable.\n\nHe turned to a study of aging that has been collecting and freezing blood samples from participants since 1958. The Hopkins team tracked PSA changes in that blood from 980 men, 20 of whom eventually died of prostate cancer and 104 of whom survived it.\n\nHow fast a man's PSA was rising a decade before his cancer was diagnosed \u2014 even before it reached that biopsy-triggering level of 4 \u2014 predicted his survival 25 years later, regardless of his ultimate cancer treatment, Carter concluded.\n\nThose with a higher PSA velocity \u2014 the level rose more than a count of 0.35 a year \u2014 had a 54 percent survival rate, while those whose PSA rose more slowly had a 92 percent survival rate.\n\nWhat does that mean for men today? That it's a good idea to order a biopsy for a man with a low but fast-rising PSA, Carter said. And men diagnosed with prostate cancer whose PSA is rising slowly may be ideal candidates for monitoring instead of surgery or other treatment, he added.\n\nA study with just 20 deaths is far too small to prove the value of PSA velocity, cautioned Dr. Durado Brooks, a prostate specialist with the American Cancer Society.\n\nStill, growing numbers of doctors are using the method already to help decide when to order a biopsy, and \"I think the study does raise the question as to whether PSA velocity may at some point be a helpful factor in determining prognosis,\" he said.\n\nThe work is \"another step on the road to more sophisticated\" prostate cancer screening and treatment, Dr. Timothy Church of the University of Minnesota wrote in an editorial accompanying the work.\n\nSome 234,000 U.S. men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year, and just over 27,000 of them will die, the cancer society estimates.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The article nicely describes the dilemma around whether or not to find and/or treat prostate cancer. Many prostate cancers are slow-growing and will never threaten a man's life.\u00a0 This is often lost in the enthusiasm over PSA testing.\u00a0 The article also provides some estimates of the number of men who will be diagnosed and die from prostate cancer this year, giving some framework for the relative burden of prostate cancer (or showing that despite a relatively larger number of men who will be diagnosed, a minority of them will die from the disease).\u00a0 However, the article misses an opportunity to emphasize or re-state what the numbers really mean and that they demonstrate there should be caution about widespread screening.\u00a0 ", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Allos defends the price, saying it made a significant investment to develop the first approved drug for this type of cancer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very aggressive disease, and patients right now have no options,\u201d said James V. Caruso, the chief commercial officer for Allos, a 17-year-old publicly traded company based in Westminster, Colo., that has no other drugs on the market.\n\nMr. Caruso also said the price of Folotyn was not out of line with that of other drugs for rare cancers. Patients, moreover, are likely to use the drug for only a couple of months because the tumor worsens so quickly, he said. So the total cost of using Folotyn will be less than for many other drugs with lower monthly prices.\n\n\u201cWe believe we are fairly priced,\u201d he added, \u201cand we\u2019re benchmarked\u201d against other drugs. In a conference call with analysts last month, Mr. Caruso said Allos had \u201cnot had pushback of any type at this point\u201d from insurers.\n\nSome drugs for rare cancers are close to Foltyn\u2019s price. Genzyme\u2019s Clolar for pediatric leukemia costs about $34,000 a week, though the company says that only two weeks of treatment are typically needed. Genzyme\u2019s drug Campath, for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, costs about $5,000 a week for several weeks.\n\nGlaxoSmithKline is charging up to $98,000 for a six-month treatment course of Arzerra, a drug approved in late October for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which strikes about 15,000 Americans a year. About $60,000 of the cost would be incurred in the first eight weeks, when the drug is given more frequently.\n\nGloucester Pharmaceuticals, which won approval in November for a drug to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, another rare cancer, declined to discuss what it would charge when that treatment, called Istodax, goes on sale in January.\n\nDespite such comparisons, Dr. Lee N. Newcomer, senior vice president for oncology at the big insurer UnitedHealthcare, called the price of Folotyn \u201cunconscionable.\u201d He said that Folotyn alone would cost as much as UnitedHealthcare now typically spends in total to treat a lymphoma patient from diagnosis until death. That median expenditure now, he said, is $87,000 for a little over a year of treatments.\n\nBut Dr. Newcomer said insurers would be obligated to pay for Folotyn because there were no alternatives.\n\nFolotyn has not yet shown an effect on longevity. In the clinical trial that led to approval of the drug, 27 percent of the 109 patients experienced a reduction in tumor size. The reductions lasted a median of 9.4 months.\n\nBut considering all the patients in the trial, only 12 percent had a reduction in tumor size that lasted for more than 14 weeks. The trial did not compare Folotyn to another drug or a placebo.\n\n\u201cThis drug is not a home run,\u201d Dr. Brad S. Kahl, a lymphoma specialist at the University of Wisconsin, said during a meeting of an advisory committee to the F.D.A. on Sept. 2. \u201cIt\u2019s not even a double. It\u2019s a single.\u201d\n\nSaying that even a single was helpful, Dr. Kahl was part of a majority on the panel that recommended approval of the drug, 10 to 4.\n\nBut after recently learning what Allos planned to charge for Folotyn, Dr. Kahl said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the \u201cexcessive\u201d price.\n\n\u201cIt dampens my enthusiasm for using that drug,\u201d he said. \u201cIt creates these huge ethical quandaries about trying a drug that has a modest benefit for the average patient at enormous expense.\u201d\n\nFolotyn is given by a rapid intravenous procedure once a week for six weeks out of every seven. Even to try the drug for the first seven-week cycle to see if it works would cost over $50,000. In the clinical trial, the median duration of use was 70 days, which would cost roughly $70,000 to $80,000. But some patients used the drug for many months.\n\nIn a note to clients in October, Joshua Schimmer, an analyst at Leerink Swann, estimated that a typical treatment would last 3.5 months and cost $126,000, or about $36,000 a month.\n\nFor investors, a high price is usually a good thing. Mr. Schimmer\u2019s note was entitled \u201cFolotyn Prices High, Reiterate Outperform.\u201d He estimated annual sales of the drug in the United States reaching about $300 million by 2014.\n\nPatient advocacy groups say that while they wish prices were lower, high prices might be needed to encourage companies to develop new drugs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a two-edged sword that we have to live with and deal with,\u201d said Louis J. DeGennaro, chief scientific officer of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, which has received donations from Allos and other companies. \u201cA peripheral T-cell lymphoma patient,\u201d he said, \u201cat first blush will see this therapy as a very good thing.\u201d\n\nAllos, which is still unprofitable, has lost $350 million since its founding in 1992 and failed to win approval of a previous drug.\n\n\u201cEvery dime that goes into the company supports Folotyn,\u201d Mr. Caruso said.\n\nAt the time Folotyn was approved in September, stock in Allos briefly peaked above $8.50 but has slipped since then, closing up 16 cents at $6.62, or an increase of nearly 2.5 percent, on Friday.\n\nAfter the approval, Allos raised $93 million in a secondary stock offering. In the prospectus for that offering, the company said that one of the risks for investors was \u201cthe relative price of Folotyn as compared to alternate treatment options.\u201d It said there was a risk it might have to lower the price or offer discounts to successfully market Folotyn.\n\nLike many other companies with high-priced drugs, Allos has established a program to help patients arrange insurance reimbursement. It says it will give the drug free to uninsured patients who cannot pay for it any other way.\n\nAnd because a patient\u2019s out-of-pocket co-payments alone \u2014 Medicare\u2019s is 20 percent \u2014 could be thousands of dollars a month for Folotyn, Allos is financing a co-payment assistance program run by the National Organization for Rare Disorders, a patient advocacy group.\n\nWhile this helps patients, it also helps the company sell more of its drug. If the 20 percent Medicare co-payment is made, then Medicare will pay the other 80 percent of the drug\u2019s price \u2014 or about $24,000 a month.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story accurately represents the seriousness and prevalence of peripheral T-cell Lymphoma, which is quite rare and serious.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "PSA stands for prostate-specific antigen, a substance produced only by the prostate gland and found in the ejaculate. Its purpose is to liquefy the semen to release sperm, freeing them to fertilize an egg. The PSA level, measured in nanograms per milliliter of blood, reflects how much of this antigen is being produced and released into the bloodstream. The larger a man\u2019s prostate, the more PSA is produced, which makes the test very confusing in older men with benign enlargement of this gland.\n\nAside from cancer and prostatic growth with age, factors that can change PSA measurements include inflammation or infection of the prostate; a decline in testosterone levels or the drug finasteride, taken for hair loss, both of which lower the PSA; and variations in laboratory assays and in the inherent biology of a person. Biological variability can result in as much as a 15 percent difference between readings, and in nearly half of men with an abnormal PSA, the test will normalize in one to four years without any treatment.\n\nBut Dr. H. Ballentine Carter, a urologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, notes that no significant changes in PSA result from recent sexual intercourse or ejaculation, a digital rectal examination or riding a bicycle. \u201cEven long-distance bikers do not have prostate trauma\u201d that causes their PSA to increase, Dr. Carter said.\n\nCurrent guidelines recommend that all men have an annual PSA test starting at age 50 and that biopsies be conducted if the level exceeds 4 or if a \u201csignificant rise\u201d occurs between two tests. The guidelines also suggest limiting screening to men with more than a 10-year life expectancy.\n\nThis approach has resulted in many biopsies in men who did not have cancer \u2014 about 70 percent of those with elevated PSAs are cancer free \u2014 and debilitating prostate surgery in men with cancers that would never have become a threat in their remaining years of life.\n\nOn the Way: New Guidelines\n\nBased on recent studies, the American Urological Association will soon release revised guidelines that, experts hope, will reduce unnecessary biopsies and prostate surgeries, which even in the best hands can leave a man impotent and incontinent. The revised guidelines are expected to reduce the cost of screening, the cost per life saved and overall deaths from prostate cancer.\n\nThe new guidelines will no longer rely on a single reading. Rather, they will suggest that doctors focus on changes in levels over time. They will also suggest that testing start at 40 to obtain a baseline measurement, with the test repeated at 45 and 50, after which it should be given annually until 70.\n\n\u201cIf a 70-year-old man has a PSA history that hasn\u2019t changed over the years, maybe he doesn\u2019t need further testing,\u201d Dr. Carter suggested. \u201cPSA testing of men over 70 is not rational.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to a Scandinavian study showing that among men older than 65, to prevent one death from prostate cancer over 10 years, 330 men would have to have prostate surgery.\n\n\u201cThis has created a huge dilemma in urology,\u201d Dr. Carter said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to miss the possibility of a life-threatening disease, but we end up diagnosing and treating disease that would never have caused harm.\u201d\n\nThe new guidelines will lower the PSA level at which a biopsy should be considered, because, as Dr. Carter put it, \u201cthere\u2019s no level below which we can tell a man he doesn\u2019t have prostate cancer or life-threatening prostate cancer.\u201d\n\nAs one important trial showed, among men with a very low PSA \u2014 that is, a reading below the current cutoff of 4 \u2014 biopsies found that 15 percent had prostate cancer. Among that 15 percent, Dr. Carter said, 15 percent had high-grade, potentially life-threatening cancers. That means that 2.25 percent of the total number of men with a PSA less than 4 had life-threatening cancers.\n\nBut, he added, \u201cIf we biopsied every man with a PSA below 4, we\u2019d be looking at a sea of cancers that would never grow to be life threatening.\u201d\n\nThese facts and the results of a recent study by Dr. Carter, among others, indicated that rather than acting on the basis of a single PSA test, the rate of change in levels over time is a better indicator of who might have a serious cancer. This rate, known as PSA velocity, will be part of the new guidelines, which will suggest that in men with low readings, doctors consider the changes in levels over the course of three measurements.\n\n\u201cWe need at least 1 \u00bd to 2 years\u2019 worth of data\u201d to make a meaningful judgment about how to proceed, Dr. Carter said.\n\nHe explained that in men with an initially high level \u2014 say 10 or higher\u2014 velocity is not an issue. For them, if other factors like prostate infection are not the cause of the high level, a biopsy is in order. But in men with a PSA from 0 to 4, knowing the velocity of changes can add useful information, he said.\n\nAnother approach to assessing the meaning of a PSA reading is to analyze how much antigen is traveling free in the blood and how much is bound to a companion protein, Dr. Scardino suggested. If more than 25 percent of the PSA is free, chances are that it is being produced by a benignly enlarged prostate. The lower the amount of free PSA, the more likely cancer is the cause and the more likely the disease is aggressive, requiring treatment, according to Dr. Patrick C.

The researchers believe the DTI technique may expand the options for older women, who are less likely to undergo breast reconstruction.\n\nGood Results with DTI Breast Reconstruction in Women over 65\n\nDirect-to-implant breast reconstruction has emerged as a single-stage approach to immediate breast reconstruction after mastectomy. So far, however, most studies of DTI have focused on younger women.\n\n\"Half of all breast cancers occur in women over 65, yet only four to 14 percent of these women undergo reconstruction,\" Dr. Moreira and coauthors write. Most studies of breast reconstruction in older women have focused on multiple-step techniques such as tissue expander implant (TEI) reconstruction.\n\nThe researchers identified women over age 65 who underwent DTI reconstruction at the Cleveland Clinic between 2012 and 2015. They identified a total of 24 breasts reconstructed by DTI in 19 patients, all with at least 30 days' follow-up and most with one year of follow-up\n\nPatient characteristics and outcomes were compared to those of 109 breasts with TEI reconstruction in 98 patients. The women undergoing DTI reconstruction were older (73.5 versus 69.2 years) and had a higher body mass index, compared to the TEI group.\n\nBoth DTI and TEI were safe and effective options for breast reconstruction. Complication rates were similar between groups, including blood and fluid collections (hematoma and seroma), infection, unplanned surgery, and failed reconstruction.\n\nHowever, DTI had some important advantages. Women in the DTI group were less likely to be readmitted to the hospital and spent fewer total days in the hospital. In the year after surgery was completed, women in the DTI group made an average of 6.5 office visits, compared to about 12 visits in the TEI group.\n\nThe DTI group also spent fewer days with a surgical drain in place: average about 13 days, compared to 23 days in the and had fewer total days in the hospital. That's an important consideration, as drains require antibiotic treatment to prevent infection, in addition to causing discomfort for the patient.\n\nThe authors note some important limitations of their study--particularly the fact that it was a review study of one hospital's experience with a relatively new procedure. Dr. Moreira and colleagues write, \"These reported cases include our learning curve patients as we familiarized ourselves with appropriate patient selection and surgical technique.\"\n\nThe researchers emphasize that DTI isn't an option for every patient, depending on breast shape and other factors. Despite these limitations, their experience suggests that complications of the DTI approach in older women are similar to those of the more commonly used TEI technique.

Patients on blood-thinning drugs, such as dabigatran (Pradaxa), who suffer a type of bleeding that occurs inside the skull (intracranial hemorrhage) are at high risk of complications or disability. Idarucizumab (Praxbind) is an antibody that chemically binds and neutralizes the blood-thinning effects of dabigatran.\n\nAn interim analysis of the first 90 patients in a study called RE-VERSE AD (REVERSal Effects of idarucizumab in patients on Active Dabigatran) showed that idarucizumab effectively reversed dabigatran's anticoagulant effects, said Richard A. Bernstein, M.D., Ph.D., lead study author and director of the stroke program at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nBernstein presented the results of 90 brain hemorrhage patients enrolled in the REVERSE-AD study. This included 11 men and seven women (average age 79).\n\nIn patients who received two 2.5-gram of idarucizumab infusions in a 15-minute period, blood tests revealed that dabigatran's blood-thinning effect was 100 percent reversed in all 18 patients with brain bleed.\n\n\"This is definitely good news,\" Bernstein said. \"Idarucizumab rapidly and completely reverses the effect of dabigatran in patients with brain hemorrhage. Once the dabigatran is reversed, we can focus on taking care of the patient without worrying about the blood thinner.\"\n\nThe new results are part of a large on-going phase III study testing idarucizumab in a range of patients who take dabigatran and have dangerous bleeding or need urgent surgery or other procedures that carry serious bleeding risks.\n\nIdarucizumab was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in October 2015 as the first medicine designed to reverse dabigatran.\n\nResearchers say before idarucizumab was available, patients on dabigatran who needed emergency surgery were given purified clotting factors, which carry the risk of patients' clotting systems forming dangerous blood clots.\n\n\"Idarucizumab gets rid of the dabigatran, but doesn't seem to carry with it any tendency to increase clotting. This should make perioperative management easier and safer,\" Bernstein said.\n\nIdarucizumab's success so far might persuade more people to take a blood thinner when their doctors recommend it. \"The biggest problem we face in preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation is that almost half of patients don't take any blood thinner at all,\" Bernstein said. \"I see the biggest impact of idarucizumab as providing reassurance to patients that if bleeding while taking dabigatran does occur, we can quickly reverse the dabigatran.

But after the robotic job earlier this month, she was out of the hospital in a few days and feeling chipper.\n\n\"The robot is the way to go,\" Jackson said. \"Yes, indeed.\" Using a robot enables a surgeon to work on a patient without splitting open the chest and using a heart-lung machine, as happens with traditional surgery. The robotic tools are inserted through small openings made in the patient's body, minimizing trauma and significantly reducing recovery time.\n\nWhile surgical robots have been available for most of this decade, few are used to do cardiac bypass surgery, even though that was their focus when the machines were introduced.\n\nThe robot - not a kind of mechanical being but a system that enables a surgeon at a control panel to manipulate microtools - has proved more challenging to integrate into coronary bypass surgery than expected, illustrating how technological advancements can be difficult to readily adapt.\n\nNow, the University of Chicago Medical Center, where Jackson had her surgery, has launched a major new effort to make robotic bypass surgery more widely available.\n\nIt has hired the nation's foremost master of robotic bypass surgery to help lead a revolution in coronary bypass. Dr. Valluvan Jeevanandam, the chief of cardiothoracic surgery at the U. of C. Medical Center and in charge of the hospital's initiative, acknowledges he has set a difficult task.\n\nInstead of opening up a patient and working directly on his heart, the robotic-assisted surgeon sits at a console near the patient, looking at three-dimensional high-definition images on a screen and using his hands and feet to control the microtools inserted within the patient's chest. Tiny laser lights and video cameras provide the surgeon's view of what's happening.\n\n\"Using the robot isn't easy,\" Jeevanandam said. \"A drop of blood can block your view and you have to take out the camera and clean it.\" Heart surgeons tend to be confident, competent people used to taking hold of a problem and moving ahead directly. Many who trained to use robots to do coronary bypass run out of patience after three or four procedures, Jeevanandam said, which is why he decided to hire Dr. Sudhir Srivastava, who performed hundreds of robotic bypasses while working at a center in Odessa, Texas.\n\n\"We're a top center,\" said Jeevanandam. \"If they can do this in Odessa, why not Chicago?\"\n\nSrivastava brings a focus and determination to mastering robotic surgery that Jeevanandam wants to spread to other heart surgeons at Chicago.\n\n\"He practices yoga,\" Jeevanandam said. \"It comes in handy.\" But Dr. Pat Pappas, chief of cardiac surgery at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, Ill., wonders if Jeevanandam may be overestimating robotic capabilities.\n\n\"At some point it may happen,\" he said. \"But given the current state of the technology, I don't think that's the case now.\" Pappas started using a surgical robot in 2001, and he intended to use the machine to do minimally invasive coronary bypass procedures, but he found it too difficult. Instead, he has used the machine to do hundreds of heart valve repairs.\n\nThe robots have proven popular for urologic, gynecologic and some general surgery, Pappas said, but few coronary surgeons use them for valve repairs and fewer still do bypass procedures. The problem, he said, is a surgeon cannot feel what he's doing.\n\n\"There's no tactile feedback,\" Pappas said. \"The exactness of bypass surgery is so high that many people are reluctant to do it without tactile as well as visual feedback.\"\n\nSrivastava said it is true that the normal sense of touch is missing from robotic work, and that is a shortcoming, but it can be overcome with practice. Before working on humans in Odessa, he practiced on dozens of pig hearts.\n\n\"After doing it hundreds of times,\" Srivastava said, \"I almost feel the machine is no longer between me and the patient. My hands and feet move in a way that's totally intuitive. That is achievable. You almost develop this sixth sense where looking at what you're doing gives you pseudo-tactile feedback.\"\n\nWhile some have suggested that younger physicians who grew up playing video games may find robotic surgery more natural, Srivastava disagrees. He said that experienced cardiac surgeons who have mastered conventional bypass surgery are the best candidates for learning to use robots because they have the skills and confidence to get themselves out of difficult situations that may arise.\n\n\"Skill set is important, but mental attitude is very important,\" he said. \"I've been in practice more than 20 years, and five years ago we launched robotics. This old dog learned.\"\n\nThe maker of the robotic systems, Intuitive Surgical Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., is an enthusiastic backer of the University of Chicago's initiative.\n\nRecent concerns raised over the safety of medicated stents used in coronary angioplasty procedures have caused more patients and physicians to consider bypass surgery as a better therapy for blocked coronary arteries, said Chris Rabbitt, cardiac marketing director for the company.\n\nAngioplasty, which uses a balloon to open blocked arteries, has been a popular alternative to bypass surgery in part because it brings less trauma to the patient. Stents are small devices used to keep arteries open after the balloon breaks up the blockage. Many stents are infused with chemicals intended to keep the arteries open, but some studies suggest the medication introduces new risks to cardiac health.\n\n\"Patients are more educated,\" Rabbitt said. \"It used to be that when you fell ill, you'd get angioplasty and be stented. But patients understand they have more options.\"\n\nUsing robotics to bypass major blocked arteries and putting stents in other blocked arteries is gaining some currency, Rabbitt said, although few surgeons have come close to Srivastava's familiarity with the robot.\n\nEven though they cost, on average, $1.5 million, the robot systems are gaining popularity. There are 504 systems in North America, 108 in Europe and 44 in the rest of the world.\n\nIf he can train several cardiac surgeons and their teams at the University of Chicago to do robotic coronary bypass procedures, Srivastava said it will change the face of bypass surgery because consumers who hear the benefits of avoiding a cracked sternum will demand the minimally invasive approach.\n\nFinding satisfied patients is probably the easiest aspect of robotic surgery.\n\nJohn Farrell, 70, of Valparaiso, Ind., had severe back pain and needed surgery this summer, but his cardiologist said that blockage of his coronary arteries need to be fixed before he could undergo the back operation. By opting for robotic surgery, Farrell was able to get his back repaired just 10 days after his heart.\n\n\"The heart operation was no problem at all,\" he said.\n\nFor Mary Lou Coulter, 77, of Westville, Ind., the main aftereffect of her robotic procedure was some soreness and numbness.\n\n\"When I left the hospital, I asked them when I could drive,\" she said, \"and they said `Whenever you feel like it,' which really surprised me.\"\n\nFirst published on September 5, 2007 at 12:00 am", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "Quoting the marketing director of the company that makes the robotic systems, the story suggests that bypass surgery may be safer than using a stent to keep an artery open, generating fears about the safety of stents.

It affects about 700,000 Americans, according to the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation (CCF).\n\nThe illness causes inflammation, irritation, swelling and sores on the lining of the large intestine. Symptoms include diarrhea with blood or pus and abdominal discomfort, according to CCF.\n\n\"There is still a substantial unmet need for new treatments for patients with ulcerative colitis,\" said study lead author Dr. William Sandborn. He is professor of medicine and chief of the division of gastroenterology at the University of California, San Diego.\n\nXeljanz targets certain proteins involved in the body's inflammatory and immune responses that other so-called biologic drugs don't, the researchers said.\n\n\"Treatment with oral tofacitinib is potentially a new treatment option for patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, pending review by the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration],\" Sandborn said.\n\nThe study was funded by Pfizer, Inc., the maker of Xeljanz. Sandborn said he has received research grants from the company and served as a consultant for Pfizer.\n\nWhether Xeljanz should be used as a first treatment is still not clear, said Dr. Arun Swaminath, director of the inflammatory bowel disease program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\nBecause Xeljanz comes as a pill, it could have an advantage for patients, Swaminath said. But so far it has only been tried with patients who have not responded to other treatments, he said.\n\n\"How it is used in the real world may be different than how it was used in these studies,\" Swaminath said. \"I am not going out on a limb and say this should be the first choice, because we don't have enough data to say that's the way it should be positioned.\"\n\nThe researchers randomly assigned more than 1,700 people with ulcerative colitis to one of three phase 3 trials.\n\nThe first two trials looked at more than 1,100 patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who had failed with conventional treatment or treatment with newer \"tumor necrosis factor antagonist\" drugs, such as Remicade (infliximab). They received Xeljanz or a placebo twice a day for eight weeks.\n\nIn the third trial, nearly 600 patients who responded to Xeljanz were assigned to a maintenance dose (one group with 5 milligrams [mg] and another group with 10 mg) of the drug, or placebo for a year.\n\nIn the first trial, nearly 19 percent of the patients taking Xeljanz experienced a remission of their condition in eight weeks. That compared to just 8 percent of patients receiving placebo.\n\nIn the second trial, almost 17 percent of those taking Xeljanz had a remission, compared with nearly 4 percent of those taking placebo, the researchers found.\n\nIn the third trial, more than 34 percent of patients taking 5 mg of Xeljanz had disease remission after one year. Forty percent of those taking a 10-mg dose of the drug had remission at a year. Only 11 percent of patients on placebo saw a remission.\n\nHowever, in all of the trials, more patients taking Xeljanz suffered from infections, such as shingles, than those receiving placebo, researchers found.\n\nIn addition, five patients taking Xeljanz developed nonmelanoma skin cancer, compared with one patient receiving placebo. Five patients taking the drug experienced heart problems compared with no one on the placebo.\n\nAlso, compared with placebo, Xeljanz was associated with an increase in levels of cholesterol.\n\nThe report was published May 4 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nDr. Sonia Friedman is an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. She's also the author of an editorial accompanying the study.\n\n\"Tofacitinib is a promising new class of medical therapy that has efficacy in ulcerative colitis. It is an oral, small-molecule drug that is different from current biologic therapies, such as infliximab [Remicade], adalimumab [Humira], golimumab [Simponi] and vedolizumab [Entyvio],\" Friedman said.\n\nAn advantage of Xeljanz is that it is a pill. Other biologic drugs are given by infusion or injection. In addition, patients cannot develop antibodies to Xeljanz as they can with other biologic drugs, Friedman said.\n\n\"Tofacitinib may be used in the future as rescue therapy from failure of biologics,\" she said. \"Only future studies will determine whether it can be used as initial therapy for ulcerative colitis and what patients it would help the most.\"\n\nFor more information on ulcerative colitis, visit the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering here.

Now, the field includes a slew of new drinks promising a better night's sleep using such ingredients as melatonin, valerian root and - think turkey - tryptophan.\n\nThey have apt names such as Unwind, iChill and Dream Water, and offer such flavors as Berry-Berry Tired, Snoozeberry and Lullaby Lemon. They're the inverse of energy drinks. Consumers can wake up with Red Bull and then wind down with Slow Cow.\n\nBut can consumers trust these fruity concoctions to give them their z's?\n\nAccording to Steven M. Scharf, director of the Sleep Disorders Center at the University of Maryland in Baltimore, the answer is a resounding maybe.\n\n\"The issue is this: Some of them probably have some biologic effect, but they haven't been as well studied as you'd like,\" Scharf says. \"Nobody's ever compared valerian root to [the prescription sleep aid] Ambien.\"\n\nThe chief ingredient in many of these beverages is melatonin, a hormone that induces sleepiness and helps coordinate the body's biological clock. It's typically released by the pineal gland around 10 p.m.; secretion stops around 4 or 5 a.m., helping to trigger the body to wake up, Scharf says.\n\nThe body produces about three-fourths of a milligram of melatonin a day. The manufacturer of the sleep aid Snooz'n says its 2.5-ounce \"shots\" contain five milligrams of melatonin; Unwind, a \"relaxation blend,\" has three milligrams per 12-ounce can.\n\nOral doses of melatonin haven't worked much better at inducing sleep than a placebo in most studies, Scharf says, and a single, concentrated shot of the stuff doesn't exactly mimic the body's time-release system. However, a study published in January in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society found that a pre-bedtime cocktail of magnesium, zinc and a five-milligram dose of melatonin significantly improved sleep among a group of 43 elderly Italian insomniacs.\n\nJason Healy, the head of InterMark Brands, which markets Snooz'n, says he drinks his product on nights when he is stressed-out or when he is traveling internationally. The back of the Snooz'n bottle says the beverage will \"combat stress, energy drinks and sleeplessness\" and takes about 30 minutes to take effect. When it launches nationally in March, Snooz'n will be available in grocery and convenience stores and pharmacies, like most of these drinks.\n\n\"We attack [insomnia] from two angles,\" Healy says. \"You've got to turn off all the stimulants and also get into a natural sleep cycle.\"\n\nMelatonin is used for the latter, while ingredients such as valerian root and chamomile take care of the former, Healy says. Both of those herbs are associated with soporific effects, according to the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database. Valerian root has properties that resemble the benzodiazepine class of medications (such as Valium and Xanax), but Scharf says he has no idea how they compare with standard sleeping pills because of the lack of comparative studies.\n\nContainers of relaxation drinks look similar to those of energy drinks. Many mimic the diminutive shape of the 5-Hour Energy shot or the bright graphics and tall, narrow can of Rockstar or Monster. Flavors range from a pleasant, fruit-flavored soda to just shy of cough syrup.\n\nMany relaxation beverages contain safety labels that warn consumers that they should neither drive or operate machinery after drinking them, nor mix them with alcohol. Some say they aren't intended for people younger than 18 or for pregnant or nursing women - a warning that the Food and Drug Administration has also made about melatonin.\n\nIn January 2010, the FDA sent a warning letter to the Innovative Beverage Group, which makes the relaxation beverage Drank, saying the melatonin it uses is an \"unapproved food additive\" and not \"generally recognized as safe.\"\n\nDrank is still being sold with melatonin in it. In a statement, Drank inventor Peter Bianchi says \"the safety of Drank's consumers remains a top priority\" and the company is working to modify the product's packaging and marketing \"to reflect its classification as a dietary supplement.\"\n\nThe FDA regulates conventional beverages' ingredients and labeling claims more strictly than those of dietary supplements. Drank is still classified as a beverage.\n\nThe relaxation drink market is tiny compared with the energy drink market, says Garima Goel Lal, a senior analyst at the consumer research firm Mintel.\n\nA Mintel survey found that 48 percent of all \"functional beverage\" users said they were looking for beverages to release stress.\n\nA functional beverage - the term is used for sport, energy and relaxation drinks - is a nonalcoholic drink that claims to have health benefits. The number of nonalcoholic beverages making relaxation claims continues to rise; 40 new ones came on the market in 2010, according to Mintel. The field is too young to identify the leaders and the losers, Goel Lal says.\n\n\"They're trying to find a niche,\" she says.\n\nKatherine Zeratsky, a registered dietitian at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., has blogged about relaxation drinks. She says that people with certain health conditions, such as high blood pressure, should consult their physician before downing a can of Unwind or any of the other sleep beverages.\n\n\"A person can just go to the convenience store and purchase this,\" Zeratsky says. \"There's this perception that it's safe and, depending on the person, it might not be a good choice.\"", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story did not exaggerate the impact of\u00a0disordered sleep.

People feel less stimulation at lower pulse widths. At higher pulse widths than this device used, people might feel their muscles contract.\n\nWhen researchers excluded the lowest pulse width, they found 64 percent of people in the other active treatment groups had at least a 50 percent pain reduction two hours after treatment, compared with 26 percent of people in the placebo group.\n\nAt the highest level of stimulation, 58 percent of the people who started out with moderate to severe pain reported little or no pain after treatment.

Survival was shown to be greatest among those prescribed first-generation nonselective beta-blockers. According to The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center investigators, the drugs block the effects of stress pathways involved in tumor growth and spread. With further research, they may also prove beneficial in conjunction with other treatment regimens and across other cancer types.\n\nPublished today in the journal CANCER, the findings are the result of a multi-institutional retrospective analysis of the medical records of 1,425 women with ovarian cancer treated between 2000 and 2010. Researchers compared overall survival among patients with documented beta-blocker use during chemotherapy and those without. Among the 269 patients who received beta-blockers, 193 (71.7 percent) received beta-1-adrenergic receptor selective agents (SBBs) and the remaining patients received nonselective beta antagonists (NSBBs). The research team found:\n\u2022 For patients receiving any beta-blocker, the median overall survival was 47.8 months versus 42 months for nonusers.\n\u2022 Median overall survival based on beta-blocker receptor selectivity was 94.9 months for those receiving NSBBs versus 38 months for those receiving SBBs.\n\u2022 Even among patients with hypertension, a longer median overall survival was observed among users of NSBBs compared with nonusers (90 months versus 38.2 months).\n\nThis study builds on a large body of research by principal investigator Anil Sood, M.D., professor in Gynecologic Medical Oncology and Cancer Biology at MD Anderson. It showed that stress hormones fuel progression of ovarian and other cancers, and that beta-blockers - among the most proven drugs in cardiovascular medicine - might be a new way to stifle that effect.\n\n\"Beta-blockers treat a variety of conditions, such as heart disease, high-blood pressure, glaucoma and migraines. They target a receptor protein in heart muscle that causes the heart to beat harder and faster when activated by stress hormones,\" Sood said. \"Our research has shown that the same stress mechanisms impact ovarian cancer progression, so these drugs could play a new role in cancer treatment.\"\n\nAccording to Sood, the usefulness of beta-blockers was unclear until now. \"The ability to show improved survival using nonselective agents - which inhibit a specific stress pathway - is the culmination of years of research into ovarian cancer biology and pathogenesis.\"\n\nHe added that beta-blocker users in the study presented at a higher stage of disease, had an increased average BMI and were more likely to be hypertensive. All these factors were associated with decreased survival, yet those who received beta-blockers had either equivalent or improved overall survival. Further examination revealed that NSBB users had improved overall survival regardless of the presence of such prognostic factors or comorbidities. This was not true for patients who took SBBs.\n\nAlthough further study is needed, these results highlight the importance of adrenergic receptor-\u03b22 (ADRB2), a signaling pathway important to ovarian carcinogenesis and targeted by NSBBs (versus the ADRB1 pathway targeted by SBBs).\n\nOvarian cancer is the 5th most deadly cancer among women, accounting for more deaths than any other female reproductive system cancer. An estimated 21,290 new cases are diagnosed, and some 14,180 women die from the disease each year in the U.S., according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nFuture trials will seek to identify patients who would benefit most from beta-blocker use and the best beta-blocker for a specific tumor type based on adrenergic receptor expression. Then they potentially could be used as an adjuvant therapy during surgical recovery and chemotherapy to decrease tumor growth, delays in wound healing and metastasis. Beta-blockers may also reduce cancer-related psychological distress in newly diagnosed patients, according to the study authors.\n\nThere are currently two clinical trials, one led by MD Anderson, evaluating the combination of chemotherapy and propranolol (a type of NSBB) on cancer biology and on stress modulators in patients with newly diagnosed EOC. According to Sood, the preliminary data from these feasibility trials will be used to design prospective, randomized clinical trials examining NSBBs on patient outcomes.\n\n\"The stratification of patients by beta-blocker use and selectivity in this study makes it unique among all other studies examining the impact of these drugs on cancer. It also builds on the mounting evidence that beta-blockers may become a key treatment component for many patients in the future,\" said Sood.\n\nPortions of this study were supported by National Institutes of Health grants (CA140933, CA104825, CA109298, P50CA083639, U54CA151688, U54CA96300, U54CA96297, and CA016672), an Ovarian Cancer Research Fund program Project Development Grant, the Department of Defense (grants OC073399, W81XWJ-10-0158, and OC100237), the Betty Ann Asche Murray Distinguished Professorship, the RGK Foundation, the Gilder Foundation, the Blanton-Davis Ovarian Cancer Research Program, and a Gynecologic Cancer Foundation-St. Louis Ovarian Cancer Awareness grant.
