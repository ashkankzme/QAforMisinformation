[{"article": "June 22, 2010 -- Drinking lots of coffee probably isn't entirely good for you, but it does lower your risk of mouth and throat cancer.\n\nThat's probably not what University of Milan researchers Carlotta Galeone, ScD, PhD, and colleagues thought they'd find when they analyzed nine studies comparing 5,139 people with head and neck cancer to 9,028 people without cancer.\n\nBut the numbers came out this way: People who drink more than four cups of coffee each day have 39% lower odds of getting mouth or throat cancer, compared to people who don't drink coffee. The protection was seen for oral and pharyngeal cancer, but not for cancer of the larynx.\n\nDrinking less than five cups of coffee a day had a smaller but statistically significant protective effect: about 4% lower odds of mouth and throat cancer for each cup drunk daily.\n\nWas it the caffeine? Probably not. Though there weren't enough data on decaf drinkers to draw conclusions, drinking tea -- even massive quantities -- was not protective.\n\nGaleone and colleagues note that coffee contains more than a thousand chemicals. Some, such as cafestol and kahweol, have anti-cancer properties. But whether these substances actually protect against cancer in humans is a question for future studies.\n\nMost head and neck cancers are linked to alcohol consumption and to smoking. Interestingly, the protective effect of coffee was not diminished in drinkers and smokers. Nor was the effect boosted by consumption of fruits and vegetables, also shown to protect against head and neck cancers.\n\nGaleone and colleagues report their findings in the July issue of Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers, & Prevention.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "Not applicable \u2013 there really wasn\u2019t any background given on the types of cancer in question.

Currently, CT scans of the brain are the standard way of diagnosing TBI, but they can\u2019t pick up every case. And because the expose patients to radiation, doctors are often reluctant to use them on every patient, especially young children, who come to the emergency room with a head injury.\n\nBut in a study published in , scientists report on a promising blood test that could distinguish the more serious cases of TBI that require further evaluation. Led by Dr. Linda Papa, director of clinical research and an emergency physician at Orlando Regional Medical Center, the research team focused on two blood proteins that have already been linked to brain injury. Papa and her team expanded on that work by studying how levels of these two proteins, or biomarkers, change immediately after head trauma.\n\nThey collected blood from 584 people coming to the Orlando Regional Medical Center, which is a Level 1 Trauma Center, for trauma-related injuries. About half them had brain-related injuries, and half had other traumas, including broken bones and chest injuries. Papa wanted to test several things about the blood test, including whether they were specific to brain injuries or whether they changed during any trauma to any part of the body. All of the people had their blood drawn 19 times, starting at within four hours of their injury and up to 7 days later. By tracking changes in the levels of the two proteins over this time, Papa could see how they changed, and correlate that with the people\u2019s symptoms.\n\nMORE: Concussion Expert: Over 90% of NFL Players Have Brain Disease\n\nIn all people, regardless of the type of injury they had, the levels of the proteins, called GFAP and UCH-L1, rose within the first hour after the injuries. GFAP, which is specific to cells known as astrocytes that form a matrix for nerves in the central nervous system (which includes the brain and spinal cord), peak at 20 hours after the injury and then decline steadily but are still detectable seven days later. UCH-L1 is released by brain nerves when they\u2019re stressed, and its levels rise more rapidly immediately after injury and peak at eight hours.\n\nWhen Papa then looked just at people who showed signs of TBI on CT scans, she found that their levels of GFAP and UCH-L1 were significantly higher than those of people with other types of trauma, suggesting that the two markers can be relatively specific to TBI and not trauma in general.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to do any unnecessary procedures on people who don\u2019t need them,\u201d says Papa of using CT scans to distinguish people with more serious head injuries from those how just have hit their head but don\u2019t experience any symptoms. \u201cI don\u2019t think a blood will be the be-all and end-all but it would be a beautiful tool for us to have in the clinic to support a lot of our decision making.\u201d\n\nTesting for levels of UCH-L1, for example, might be helpful for emergency medical teams in an ambulance trying to assess whether a patient has any serious head injuries, since its levels peak in the hours immediately after a trauma. It might also help coaches or athletic trainers are sports events to determine which athletes who have had a concussion are able to return to the game and which, if they have higher levels of the blood marker, should not.\n\nMORE: A New Blood Test to Diagnose Concussions On The Field\n\nIn the emergency room, a blood test for UCH-L1 could also help doctors decide which patients should get a CT scan \u2014 the higher their levels of the protein are, the more likely they are to have TBI and would benefit from a scan, while those with lower levels probably don\u2019t need one.\n\nAnd because levels of GFAP tend to remain higher for many days, Papa says it might be useful in cases where patients don\u2019t come in immediately after a head injury, thinking they\u2019re okay, but see the doctor several days later because they\u2019re concerned. Even at that point, the study shows, GFAP levels might be higher than normal and therefore might indicate TBI and need for further tests.\n\n\u201cWe may not use these blood tests in a hundred percent of cases but probably in eighty percent of cases where there is a question mark, a blood test could definitely help,\u201d she says.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No obvious disease mongering in this story.

However, for the first time, a clinical trial has revealed metformin can promote a patient's ability to repair their own damaged blood vessels by increasing vascular stem cells.\n\nHeart disease is the leading cause of illness in diabetic patients, accounting for more than half of all fatalities. Metformin may be used to lower Type 1 diabetic patients' risk of developing this complication.\n\nFindings of the clinical trial are published today in the journal, Cardiovascular Diabetology.

Participants were advised to adjust their insulin to keep blood glucose levels safe.\n\nScientists measured patients' stem cells directly in the blood and also grew stem cells in a test tube, observing how they behaved. Another cell type was also counted to assess damaged blood vessels.\n\nThe participants were matched with nine patients within the same age bracket who took standard insulin treatment and 23 healthy non-diabetic people aged 20-64.\n\nExperts found that the stem cells of patients who took metformin were able to promote the repair of the blood vessels and there was an improvement in how vascular stem cells worked.\n\nType 1 diabetes is a lifelong autoimmune condition that develops when the pancreas does not produce any insulin, causing a person's blood sugar level to become too high. It is estimated around 400,000 people in the UK have the condition.\n\nDr Weaver said: \"We have shown that all our patients in the study had their insulin doses reduced after taking metformin and have not suffered any serious adverse effect.\n\n\"Patients with Type 1 diabetes may wish to consider discussing with their GP the possibility of adding metformin, even at a very low dose, to the insulin that they are taking. However, care needs to be taken to adjust insulin dose to prevent too low glucose levels.\"\n\nA pilot study was funded by Diabetes Research and Wellness Foundation and the extended study was financially supported by the Diabetes Research Fund in Gateshead.\n\nDr Eleanor Kennedy, Research Manager at Diabetes Research and Wellness Foundation, said: \"The Diabetes Research and Wellness Foundation is delighted to have funded the initial pilot study that led Dr Weaver and her colleagues to conduct this small clinical trial.\n\n\"The results, which indicate that metformin, a drug commonly used in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, could also have a powerful effect in people with Type 1 diabetes is unexpected.\n\n\"We hope that these results can lead to a much larger clinical trial.\"\n\nQuantity surveyor Alex Laws was part of the Newcastle University clinical trial and is delighted with the results of the study.\n\nThe 31-year-old, of Gateshead, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at the age of just seven and has good control of her condition.

Results of the technique, called deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS), will be presented Sunday at ENDO 2017, the Endocrine Society's 99th annual meeting in Orlando, Fla.\n\nThis study expands on the researchers' previous finding that dTMS reduced food cravings and induced weight loss in obese individuals. Unlike deep brain stimulation, dTMS does not need an operation or implantation of electrodes. Instead, an electromagnetic coil is placed on the scalp and sends magnetic pulses to stimulate specific deep regions of the brain. Currently approved in the U.S. for treating major depression, dTMS is being studied in some countries for the treatment of other neuropsychiatric disorders, especially addiction.\n\n\"We need new safe and effective therapies for obesity,\" said principal investigator Livio Luzi, M.D., professor and head of endocrinology at the IRCCS Policlinico San Donato and the University of Milan in Milan, Italy. \"Despite numerous preventive and therapeutic interventions, none has stopped obesity from reaching epidemic proportions.\"\n\nAn underlying cause of obesity may be an impaired gut microbiota composition, an imbalance in the complex mix of beneficial and harmful microorganisms that inhabit the digestive tract. Luzi said scientists now know that an impaired gut microbiota can alter the brain's signals for appetite and satiety, or fullness. He and his co-workers studied whether dTMS could improve the gut microbiota composition in obese persons and, if so, by what underlying mechanisms.\n\nIn their study, funded by the Italian Ministry of Health, the investigators recruited three men and 11 women, ages 22 to 65, with obesity as shown by a body mass index (BMI) of 30 to 45 kg/m2. They randomly assigned the study subjects to two groups for five weeks to receive 15 sessions--three times per week--of either dTMS (to the insula and prefrontal cortex deep in the brain) or a sham stimulation as a control. Before and at the end of treatment, subjects provided stool samples for microbiota analysis.\n\nThe research team also measured blood levels of glucose (sugar), insulin, pituitary gland hormones and neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine. Pituitary hormones play a key role in regulating appetite, and recent research shows that norepinephrine and other neurotransmitters affect microbiota composition, Luzi said.\n\nAfter five weeks of treatment, subjects receiving dTMS lost more than 3 percent of their body weight and more than 4 percent of their fat--significantly more than controls did, Luzi reported.\n\nResults of the fecal analysis demonstrated that, after five weeks, dTMS-treated subjects had greatly increased quantities of several beneficial bacterial species with anti-inflammatory properties, such as are found in healthy people. The control group, however, had no clinically relevant alterations in their microbiota composition, Luzi said. He also reported that changes in the abundance of other bacterial species correlated with improvement of metabolic and hormonal parameters, including glucose, insulin, several pituitary hormones and norepinephrine.\n\n\"These changes suggest a beneficial effect of dTMS on both weight loss and change in microbiota composition,\" Luzi said. \"Our research shows the innovative ability of dTMS in exerting anti-obesity effects through alteration of the gut-brain axis.\"\n\nEndocrinologists are at the core of solving the most pressing health problems of our time, from diabetes and obesity to infertility, bone health, and hormone-related cancers.

But finding a remedy for back pain can be a lot like a guessing game.\n\nHe says it was only through Alexander Technique lessons that he trained his body to move in a way that eased his aching back.

Those who had six Alexander lessons showed some improvement. And those who went the distance got the best results.\n\n\"The people who had 24 lessons had gone down from about 21 days of pain that the usual care group reported to about 3 days in pain,\" says Little. \"So a really dramatic difference there is reported days in pain.\"\n\nLittle's research was published in the British Medical Journal in 2008.

Along with obesity, high levels of blood fats can lead to heart disease and other health problems, including diabetes.\n\nThe U.S. government currently recommends screening for high cholesterol in children with a family history of heart disease or high cholesterol (with at least one parent or grandparent who has suffered a premature heart event such as heart attack or stroke, or at least one parent with total cholesterol levels above 240 mg/dL). The guidelines also recommend that youngsters whose parents are not aware of their family history of heart disease be screened.\n\nIn the new study, led by Dr. William Neal of West Virginia University, scientists observed a group of more than 20,000 fifth-graders in West Virginia and found that 71% were eligible for cholesterol screening based on national criteria. Experts believe using family history is a good way to identify children who may be at greatest risk of high cholesterol \u0097 and therefore of future heart disease. Based on the results of the screen, doctors may then advise families to change their children's diet or exercise routines or prescribe medication to lower their cholesterol.\n\nBut because West Virginia has one of the nation's highest rates of death from heart disease, since 2000, the state has offered free, universal cholesterol screening to all fifth-graders enrolled in public schools. That allowed Neal and his team to determine how many children who actually had high cholesterol would have been missed if they had been screened based on federal guidelines.\n\nAmong the 5,798 children who would not have been screened, nearly 10% had elevated LDL cholesterol levels (above 130 mg/dL), according to the study, published in the August issue of Pediatrics. And 1.7% had levels high enough (above 160 mg/dL) to warrant cholesterol-lowering medications. Indeed, of all the children in the study whose LDL levels were above 160, one-third were in the group who would not have been screened.\n\nThe current guidelines were put in place in the 1990s, and at the time, experts predicted that high cholesterol would be missed in as many as 25% of children, says Neal. But doctors assumed that in most cases, these children would have only slightly elevated cholesterol levels that would eventually be detected when they became adults and would be lowered with diet and exercise.\n\nNeal's data show that may not be the case. Further, Neal says, the findings apply not only to heart-disease risk but also to the risk of diabetes, since high cholesterol at a young age is a strong predictor of prediabetes and diabetes. \"We worry about that because if these children don't change their ways, then they are going to have Type 2 diabetes,\" he says. \"It's something we would become more aware of if more children were screened.\"\n\nNot everyone agrees that universal screening is the answer. Rather than calling for all youngsters to have their cholesterol tested, which would entail considerable expense on the national level, Dr. Ralph Sacco, president of the American Heart Association (AHA), suggests looking more critically at current screening guidelines. \"Maybe the way we are doing family screening, with a very simplistic questionnaire about any parent having early heart disease or having high blood cholesterol, is not effective,\" he says. \"I think we need more effective screening tools. We need to assess these options before jumping to possible universal screening.\"\n\nSacco notes that both the AHA and the American Academy of Pediatrics now recommend cholesterol screening in children with risk factors for heart disease other than family history, such as obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes. \"The weight of the child, his waist circumference and whether he has siblings who are overweight would help to select a group that is at greater risk of having high cholesterol,\" he says. \"Now that we have this data, it does call into question these original guidelines from the government.\" The next update of the recommendations is expected in spring 2011.\n\nSee TIME's Pictures of the Week.\n\nSee the Cartoons of the Week.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "1clip_filelist.xml\" rel=\"File-List\"/>\n\n\n\n \nThe lead of the story focuses on the number of children with elevated cholesterol who might be missed based on current national guidelines and does not jump to the conclusion that these children would necessarily benefit from treatment.

Oddly, the lead sentence says current guidelines \u201cmay miss nearly 10% of those who have high levels of LDL, or bad cholesterol,\u201d but the researchers put the figure at closer to a third.

Most of those trials were funded and run by the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture Prozac and Effexor \u2014 Eli Lilly and Wyeth, respectively.\n\nThey included 12 studies of Prozac in adults and four each in elderly patients and youth, as well as 21 trials of immediate- or extended-release Effexor in adults. About 9,000 participants were included.\n\nMore adults and kids taking Prozac, known generically as fluoxetine, had at least a 50 percent improvement in scores on depression tests after six weeks compared to those assigned to take a placebo pill.\n\nFifty-five percent of adults on Prozac responded to treatment, compared to 34 percent in the placebo group. In youth, 30 percent on Prozac had significant symptom improvement, compared to just six percent of the comparisons.\n\nThe benefits were seen regardless of how severe patients\u2019 symptoms were before starting treatment.\n\nHowever, in the elderly the differences between the treatment and placebo groups were much smaller, and the researchers calculated that 17 older patients would have to be treated with Prozac for one to gain from it.\n\n\u201cClearly the efficacy of antidepressants is age-dependent, (and) largest, most interestingly, in youth, which I don\u2019t think would be the mainstream view in psychiatry,\u201d Gibbons told Reuters Health.\n\nThe findings, he added, \u201craise other questions that need to be followed up (including), what\u2019s going on in the elderly?\u201d\n\nBoth types of Effexor, or venlafaxine, also seemed to help adults with mild to severe depression, with slightly more patients responding to the immediate-release dose.\n\nSome of the study\u2019s authors have testified for or received funding from drug companies, though the report itself was funded by national health agencies.\n\nThe researchers said they couldn\u2019t be sure there would be similar improvements with other types of antidepressants \u2014 especially given the more limited data in kids and the elderly \u2014 or that the longer-term benefits would be as clear.\n\nOne recent study suggested that up to a fifth of patients on the antidepressant Cymbalta (duloxetine) might actually benefit more from placebo pills (see Reuters Health story of December 9, 2011.)\n\nIrving Kirsch, who studies antidepressants and placebos at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said the new report didn\u2019t make him more optimistic about the drugs.\n\nIf five or more patients need to be treated with an antidepressant for one to substantially improve, most don\u2019t get much out of it, he pointed out.\n\n\u201cMore than 80 percent of the patients are not getting a significant benefit from the drug \u2014 either they\u2019re not getting better or they would get the same benefit with placebo,\u201d he told Reuters Health.\n\n\u201cThere are alternative treatments for depression that also produce about the same symptom reduction as the drugs do, but without the risk of side effects,\u201d Kirsch added, including psychotherapy and exercise.\n\nStill, Gibbons said that the improvement in symptoms for the average patient wasn\u2019t insignificant.\n\n\u201cDefinitely it doesn\u2019t look like antidepressants are placebos,\u201d he concluded.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering about depression here.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Yoga enthusiasts link the practice to a long list of health benefits, including greater flexibility and range of motion, stronger muscles, better posture and balance, reduced emotional and physical stress, and increased self-awareness and self-esteem.\n\nBut definitively proving these benefits is challenging, requiring years of costly research.

So in 2005, Dr. Fishman began a small pilot study of yoga moves that turned up some encouraging results. Eleven practitioners had increased bone density in their spine and hips, he reported in 2009, compared with seven controls who did not practice yoga.\n\nKnowing that more than 700,000 spinal fractures and more than 300,000 hip fractures occur annually in the United States, Dr. Fishman hoped that similar findings from a much larger study might convince doctors that this low-cost and less dangerous alternative to bone-loss drugs is worth pursuing.\n\nThose medications can produce adverse side effects like gastrointestinal distress and fractures of the femur. Indeed, a recent study published in Clinical Interventions in Aging found that among 126,188 women found to have osteoporosis, all of whom had Medicare Part D drug coverage, only 28 percent started bone drug therapy within a year of diagnosis.\n\nMany of those who avoided drugs were trying to avoid gastrointestinal problems.\n\nOn the other hand, yoga\u2019s \u201cside effects,\u201d Dr. Fishman and colleagues wrote recently, \u201cinclude better posture, improved balance, enhanced coordination, greater range of motion, higher strength, reduced levels of anxiety and better gait.\u201d\n\nWeight-bearing activity is often recommended to patients with bone loss, and Dr. Fishman argues that certain yoga positions fit the bill.\n\n\u201cYoga puts more pressure on bone than gravity does,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cBy opposing one group of muscles against another, it stimulates osteocytes, the bone-making cells.\u201d\n\nMost experts argue that it\u2019s difficult, perhaps impossible, for adults to gain significant bone mass. Undeterred, Dr. Fishman invested a chunk of his own money and with three collaborators \u2014 Yi-Hsueh Lu of The Rockefeller University, Bernard Rosner of Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, and Dr. Gregory Chang of New York University \u2014 solicited volunteers worldwide via the Internet for a follow-up to his small pilot study.\n\nOf the 741 people who joined his experiment from 2005 to 2015, 227 (202 of them women) followed through with doing the 12 assigned yoga poses daily or at least every other day. The average age of the 227 participants upon joining the study was 68, and 83 percent had osteoporosis or its precursor, osteopenia.\n\nThe 12 poses, by their English names, were tree, triangle, warrior II, side-angle, twisted triangle, locust, bridge, supine hand-to-foot I, supine hand-to-foot II, straight-legged twist, bent-knee twist and corpse pose. Each pose was held for 30 seconds. The daily regimen, once learned, took 12 minutes to complete.\n\nThe researchers collected data at the start of the study on the participants\u2019 bone density measurements, blood and urine chemistry and X-rays of their spines and hips. They were each given a DVD of the 12 yoga poses used in the pilot study and an online program in which to record what they did and how often.\n\nA decade after the start of the study, bone density measurements were again taken and emailed to the researchers; many participants also had repeat X-rays done. The findings, as reported last month in Topics of Geriatric Rehabilitation, showed improved bone density in the spine and femur of the 227 participants who were moderately or fully compliant with the assigned yoga exercises.\n\nImprovements were seen in bone density in the hip as well, but they were not statistically significant.\n\nBefore the study, the participants had had 109 fractures, reported by them or found on X-rays.\n\nAt the time the study was submitted for publication, \u201cwith more than 90,000 hours of yoga practiced largely by people with osteoporosis or osteopenia, there have been no reported or X-ray detected fractures or serious injuries of any kind related to the practice of yoga in any of the 741 participants,\u201d Dr. Fishman and his colleagues wrote.\n\n\u201cYoga looks like it\u2019s safe, even for people who have suffered significant bone loss,\u201d Dr. Fishman said in an interview.\n\nFurthermore, a special study of bone quality done on 18 of the participants showed that they had \u201cbetter internal support of their bones, which is not measured by a bone density scan but is important to resisting fractures,\u201d Dr. Fishman said.\n\nThe study has many limitations, including the use of self-selected volunteers and the lack of a control group. But all told, the team concluded, the results may lend support to Dr. Fishman\u2019s long-held belief that yoga can help reverse bone loss.\n\nEven if bone density did not increase, improvements in posture and balance that can accrue from the practice of yoga can be protective, Dr. Fishman said.\n\n\u201cSpinal fractures can result from poor posture, and there\u2019s no medication for that, but yoga is helpful,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition, \u201cYoga is good for range of motion, strength, coordination and reduced anxiety,\u201d he said, \u201call of which contribute to the ability to stay upright and not fall. If you don\u2019t fall, you greatly reduce your risk of a serious fracture.\u201d\n\nFor more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No evident disease mongering in this story, except to say that osteoporosis and it\u2019s precursor osteopenia are often heavily mongered diseases simply because bone density is one of many risk factors for hip fractures (that is treatable with drugs) but it is not the most important one. In fact, some argue that bone density is such a low predictor for hip fractures it is worthless as a measure of bone health and simply shouldn\u2019t be employed.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The blood test is also part of a larger debate about who should be treating allergy sufferers. Blood testing would allow pediatricians and other primary care doctors to diagnose allergies and treat many patients. But allergists contend that these generalists are not qualified to assess the laboratory results.\n\nDr. Dean Mitchell, an allergist in Manhattan, has virtually abandoned the skin-prick test. He was converted, he says, after taking a patient to the emergency room for a severe reaction to his skin test. Dr. Mitchell began to imagine a nearly needle-free office.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a longstanding fear of skin testing, and it turns off a lot of allergy sufferers from getting help,\u201d said Dr. Mitchell, the author of \u201cAllergy and Asthma Solution\u201d (Marlowe, 2006), which advocates oral immunotherapy, or allergy drops, instead of shots.\n\nFor that reason, he and other experts say, most sufferers never even see an allergist. (And many sufferers of seasonal and pet allergies know what they\u2019re allergic to, so they don\u2019t need a diagnosis.) For them, care has focused on treating symptoms with antihistamines and decongestants, not diagnosing the allergy and avoiding its triggers.\n\n\u201cThe question is, why aren\u2019t we identifying more children and adults suffering from allergic rhinitis and asthma to help them?\u201d Dr. Mitchell said.\n\nIn Europe, 60 percent of asthma patients are tested for allergies, compared with only 5 percent to 10 percent in this country. A lack of diagnosis may contribute to the worsening of symptoms in children \u2014 the so-called allergy march.\n\nIt begins with eczema in infants and toddlers, and progresses to respiratory problems and asthma in preschoolers and beyond. Half of babies who have eczema in the first two years of life will develop asthma in childhood, said Dr. Thomas A. E. Platts-Mills, president of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology.\n\nIn skin testing, a practitioner makes rows of pricks on a patient\u2019s back or forearm so allergen-containing extracts can seep into the skin. If the antibody IgE is bound to the immune system\u2019s mast cells in the skin, the patient will get an itchy, hivelike wheal surrounded by redness. The size of the wheal and the diameter of the redness help determine if the patient is allergic.\n\nA patient typically gets 15 to 20 skin pricks, but sometimes many more. Because the test comes with a small risk of a serious reaction, it should not be performed in very young children and pregnant women, among others.\n\nThe blood test, which is not without its own ouch factor, measures levels of circulating IgE. The lab sends the physician a report with these figures and the patient\u2019s risk of a reaction.\n\nThe first generation of blood tests were developed in the 1970s. Because they were not considered very sensitive, physicians were left with a lasting impression that blood testing was inferior to skin testing.\n\nA more sophisticated test with improved sensitivity, called ImmunoCAP, became available in 1992. It has performed equally well in comparison studies with skin-prick testing, said Dr. Jay M. Portnoy, chief of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology at Children\u2019s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Mo.\n\nStill, most allergists prefer skin testing. \u201cSkin testing is more sensitive and tells you more,\u201d said Dr. Dean D. Metcalfe, chief of the laboratory of allergic diseases at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. With blood tests, he went on, \u201cyou\u2019re not really measuring an allergic reaction, but a potential for a reaction.\u201d\n\nSkin testing produces an answer in about 20 minutes, compared with 48 hours for a blood test. The quick turnaround allows doctors to offer a diagnosis and immediate advice.\n\nBut skin-testing results can vary from one allergist to the next, and most allergists don\u2019t rely on a prior allergist\u2019s results when a patient switches practices.\n\nSome experts contend that allergists resist blood testing in part to protect their revenue. \u201cA barrier to allergy testing in the states has been the economics in our system,\u201d said Dr. Richard G. Roberts, professor of family medicine at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. If an allergist does an in-office skin-prick test, he gets the fees for those tests. If he requests a blood test, the laboratory gets the fee.\n\nBut others say allergists are simply more familiar with skin testing. \u201cThey have been trained to do skin testing, they\u2019re comfortable with it, and they get an answer in 20 minutes,\u201d said Dr. Portnoy.\n\nAllergists say some patients previously treated by primary care physicians were taken off foods like peanuts, though they never had an allergic reaction to them. Diagnosing requires a thorough medical history and interpreting the test results within that context; generalists may lack the time to do a complete history, especially under the pressures of managed care.\n\nDr. Roberts says that if primary-care physicians used the blood test, many more patients would be treated appropriately. While most allergy patients are seen by these generalists, he says, many allergies are not adequately diagnosed.\n\n\u201cCould we do a better job collectively?\u201d he asked. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\nSome allergists have made the switch to blood testing \u2014 especially in the area of food allergies, where blood testing is replacing the so-called food challenge test, a two- to six-hour procedure in which patients are given increasing amounts of suspect foods like egg or milk to determine whether they will have an allergic reaction.\n\nDr. Hugh Sampson, a food allergy expert at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, is seeking to add a level of precision to diagnosis. He correlates levels of specific IgE with a probability that the person is allergic to a food \u2014 a technique, he says, that reduces the need for food challenge testing by half.\n\nDr. Mitchell, the Manhattan allergist, called that approach promising. \u201cA lot of academic allergists are very conservative,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Hugh Sampson\u2019s work may turn the tide.\u201d\n\nAs for Sarah Marcus, starting last summer she was weaned from allergy shots so she would no longer need them when she went away to college, at the University of Pennsylvania. She has been shot-free and allergy-free since Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cAll in all,\u201d said her mother, \u201cif I could go back, if I had a 2-year-old now, I\u2019d never put her through the skin testing.\u201d", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story commits disease mongering by not emphasizing that the blood and skin tests are only used in those with severe allergies.

Newly postmenopausal women who received estrogen via a skin patch had reduced beta-amyloid deposits, the sticky plaques found in the brains of people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, a Mayo Clinic study published this month in the Journal of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease found. Ultimately, these deposits harm neurons, leading to cognitive problems.\n\nIn the study, women with APOE e4 \u2014 one form of the most common gene associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease \u2014 had lower levels of amyloid deposits.\n\n\u201cThis study showed, for the first time, that the brain amyloid deposition \u2500 a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2500 is reduced in newly postmenopausal women who received 17beta-Estradiol patch form of hormone therapy,\u201d says lead author Kejal Kantarci, M.D., a Mayo Clinic radiologist. \u201cWomen with APOE e4, who have a greater genetic risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, particularly benefited from this therapy.\u201d\n\nMenopause is defined as occurring 12 months after a woman\u2019s last menstrual period and marks the end of menstrual cycles. In the U.S., the average age of menopause is 51. A rapid decline in estrogen with menopause may be associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease risk in women.\n\nThe Women\u2019s Health Initiative study by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) reported that menopausal hormone therapy started in women 65 or older increased the risk of dementia. In contrast, the multicenter Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study tested the hypothesis that healthy and younger women would respond to menopausal hormone therapy more favorably.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic study used data from the Kronos study to determine the effects of menopausal hormone therapy shortly after menopause, during the critical window of rapid estrogen depletion \u2014 five to 36 months past menopause. Researchers investigated the brain amyloid deposition in 68 women ages 42 to 59 who participated in the Kronos trial during this critical window. The researchers used positron emission tomography, also known as a PET scan, to look for the brain amyloid deposits three years after the trial ended.\n\nOf the 68 women, 21 received estrogen via a skin patch, 17 received estrogen orally and 30 received a placebo. Amyloid deposition was lower in women who received the patch, compared to the placebo, and the effect was most apparent in women with the APOE e4 genotype. The oral treatment was not associated with lower amyloid deposition.\n\nThe authors are seeking funding to perform amyloid PET imaging at eight more Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention study sites around the U.S.\n\n\u201cIf our results are confirmed in the larger group of women, this finding has the potential to change the concepts for preventive interventions that drive the Alzheimer\u2019s disease field today,\u201d Dr. Kantarci says. \u201cIt also may have a significant impact on women making the decision to use hormone therapy in the early postmenopausal years.\u201d\n\nStudy co-authors are Val Lowe, M.D.; Timothy Lesnick, M.S.; Nirubol Tosakulwong; Kent Bailey, Ph.D.; Julie Fields, Ph.D.; Lynne Shuster, M.D.; Samantha Zuk; Matthew Senjem M.S.; Michelle Mielke, Ph.D.; Clifford Jack Jr., M.D.; Walter Rocca, M.D.; and Virginia Miller, Ph.D., all of Mayo Clinic; and Carey Gleason, Ph.D., of University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health.\n\nThis study is funded by the Aurora Foundation to the Kronos Longevity Research Institute and NIH.

But it takes no position on MRI imaging for women who have had breast cancer, saying there is not enough evidence to recommend one way or the other.\n\nStudying the effectiveness of MRI screening on all three groups of women, Dr. Wendy DeMartini, an assistant professor of radiology at the University of Washington Medical School, said MRI imaging found proportionally more cancers in women who had been treated for breast cancer than in the women considered at very high risk.\n\n\"Women in the personal history group [who had MRI] were also less likely to be recalled for additional testing, and less likely to have a biopsy for a false positive finding,\" she said.\n\nDeMartini was scheduled to present the findings Sunday at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America in Chicago.\n\nFor the study, her team reviewed initial breast MRI exams of 1,026 women, conducted from January 2004 to June 2009. Of these, 327 had a genetic or family history; 646 had a personal history of breast cancer that had been treated.\n\nOverall, the MRI detected 25 of 27 cancers, DeMartini said.

The latest investigation from the US team pinpoints which cells are important and how they might work.\n\nIn the first of a series of experiments in mice, Cai showed that neural stem cells, which are found in a handful of brain regions at birth, disappear from the hypothalamus over time. The stem cells are known to form fresh brain cells in youth, but the process slows down dramatically in adults. Though small, the hypothalamus forms a crucial connection between the body\u2019s nervous and hormonal systems.\n\nTo test whether the decline in stem cells was causing ageing, and not itself a result of old age, the researchers injected mice with a toxin that wiped out 70% of their neural stem cells. The effect was striking. Over the next few months the mice aged more rapidly than usual, and performed much worse than control animals on a battery of tests of endurance, coordination, social behaviour and ability to recognise objects. \u201cBehaviourally mice aged faster when these cells were removed during early ageing,\u201d Cai told the Guardian. The animals died months earlier than healthy control animals.\n\nNext, the scientists looked at what happened when aged mice received injections of fresh neural stem cells. This time the mice lived longer than controls, typically several months more, an increase of about 15%. If a similar extension was achieved in humans, a person with a life expectancy of 80 years could live to 92.\n\nHaving proved that it was neural stem cells that were important for ageing, the scientists ran further tests to work out what the cells were doing. They found that molecules called microRNAs, or miRNAs, that are released from neural stem cells were responsible for most of the ageing effects. When the molecules are produced in the hypothalamus, they flow into the clear fluid in the brain and spinal cord and affect how genes operate.\n\n\u201cThe mechanism is partially due to these cells secreting certain miRNAs which help maintain youth, and the loss of these leads to ageing\u201d said Cai, whose study is published in Nature. The next step is to create human neural stem cells in the lab for testing.\n\n\u201cIt is a tour de force,\u201d said David Sinclair at Harvard Medical School. \u201cIt\u2019s a breakthrough. The brain controls how long we live. I can see a day when we are implanted with stem cells or treated with stem cell RNAs that improve our health and extend our lives.

We are hopeful that in the future, nanoparticles can be utilized to personalize care to patients and reduce the late effects of therapy.\"\n\nNeuroblastomas are cancers that start in early nerve cells and commonly form in the tissue of the adrenal glands, near the kidneys. About 700 new cases of neuroblastoma are diagnosed each year in the United States and most cases appear in children younger than 5 years old. High-risk neuroblastoma is hard to cure and is more likely to become resistant to standard therapies or recur. These cancers are also associated with late effects after treatments have ended, including developmental delays, hearing loss, or other disabilities.\n\nCurcumin has been shown to have substantial anti-cancer ability, but its low solubility and poor stability have made its use in medicinal applications challenging. Researchers from Nemours and UCF found that nanoparticles can be used to deliver curcumin to tumor sites.\n\n\"This shows that nanoparticles can be an effective delivery vehicle for cancer drugs,\" said Professor Sudipta Seal, who directs of UCF's NanoScience Technology Center and Advanced Materials Processing Analysis Center, and is a collaborator on the study. \"More research is needed, but we are hopeful it could lead to more effective treatment of this devastating disease in the future.\"\n\nIn the study, researchers loaded Cerium oxide nanoparticles with curcumin and coated them with dextran to test in cell lines of a high-risk form of neuroblastoma, known as MYCN-amplified, as well as non-amplified neuroblastoma. This formulation induced substantial cell death in neuroblastoma cells while producing no or only minor toxicity in healthy cells. Overall, the nano-therapeutic treatments showed a more pronounced effect in MYCN-amplified cells, which are traditionally more resistant to drug therapies.\n\nNanoscience research, which explores the unusual properties of materials at the nanoscale, has led to advancements in medicine, energy, information storage, computing and other fields.

By comparison, a sheet of paper is about 75,000 nanometers thick.\n\nThis study was conducted in a laboratory setting in Orlando, Fla., at Nemours Children's Hospital and the University of Central Florida in cells from children with neuroblastoma, but researchers hope to begin to use these curcumin nanoparticles with micro RNA in animal models to direct the molecule to a tumor site.

Several studies indicate that babies born prematurely receive too little DHA, and some studies have found that premature babies fed DHA after birth show better cognitive performance or visual coordination later on than preemies who aren\u2019t given DHA.\n\nBut the new study, which mainly assessed full-term babies, found no cognitive difference at 18 months whether mothers received DHA supplements or placebos. The lead researcher, Dr. Maria Makrides of the University of Adelaide in Australia, said this suggested that full-term babies already get enough DHA in the womb, and that \u201cthere\u2019s no extra boost\u201d from getting more.\n\nNonetheless, several experts said they would continue to support taking DHA in pregnancy, especially since it is safe and apparently has few downsides. They cited a smaller 2003 Norwegian study that found I.Q. increases at age 4, although no cognitive benefit was seen in infants or 7-year-olds.\n\nThat study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Ingrid Helland of Oslo University Hospital, said that perhaps the benefit shown at age 4 existed at 7 but was difficult to identify amid other developmental factors. She said babies in her study might have received more DHA than those in this study. Dr. Oken said the new study might have shown no benefit in 18-month-olds because effects in infants might be \u201chard to measure\u201d or \u201cit may be that the benefit of DHA is not as important as when you\u2019re 4.\u201d\n\nDr. Makrides\u2019s team plans assessments at 4 and 7.

But most of those fears are related to the use of a combination of two hormones, estrogen and progestin, which are prescribed to relieve hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause, and have been shown to increase a woman\u2019s risk of breast cancer.\n\nThe new findings, reported Tuesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association, come from 10,739 women in the Women\u2019s Health Initiative study who had previously had a hysterectomy, the surgical removal of the uterus. Nationwide, about one-third of women in their 50s have had a hysterectomy.\n\nThe Women\u2019s Health Initiative was begun in 1991 by the National Institutes of Health as a sweeping investigation of hormone use and other health issues of postmenopausal women.\n\n\n\nWhile most women in the hormone study were taking combination hormone therapy, women without a uterus took estrogen alone or a placebo for about six years and were followed for nearly 11 years. The estrogen-only group was not given progestin, which is prescribed only to protect the uterus from the harmful effects of estrogen. Although all the women in the estrogen study stopped using the treatment in 2004, the investigators have continued to monitor their health, as is typical in large clinical trials.\n\nThe most surprising new finding relates to breast cancer. The women with hysterectomies who used estrogen alone had a 23 percent lower risk for breast cancer compared with those who had taken a placebo. This is in stark contrast to the higher risk of breast cancer shown in the estrogen-progestin part of the trial.\n\n\u201cThe decreased risk of breast cancer in this group is something we totally didn\u2019t expect when we started the W.H.I. hormone therapy trials,\u201d said Andrea Z. LaCroix, the study\u2019s lead author and a professor of epidemiology at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. \u201cThis study differentiates estrogen alone from estrogen and progestin in a very big way. I hope it gets across to women, because we are not reversing ourselves.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the investigators emphasized that the results do not change recommendations concerning combination hormone therapy for the two-thirds of menopausal women who still have a uterus. The Women\u2019s Health Initiative data have consistently shown that the combination of estrogen and progestin raises breast cancer risk, and that the treatment should be used only to relieve severe menopause symptoms, using the lowest dose for the shortest possible time.\n\nBut the data are reassuring for millions of middle-aged women without a uterus who take estrogen to relieve hot flashes and other menopause symptoms.\n\nAn accompanying editorial in the journal was skeptical about the results, arguing that the design of the initiative, which is skewed toward older women and stopped all forms of hormone treatment after several years of use, does not match the way doctors typically prescribe treatment to women in their 50s at the onset of menopause.\n\nDr. Graham Colditz, an author of the editorial and professor of surgery at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said he thought data collected from observational studies that show a higher risk of breast cancer associated with estrogen use were more reliable than the data gathered from the Women\u2019s Health Initiative clinical trial.\n\n\u201cThe finding doesn\u2019t reflect how hormones are used in the U.S. at the moment,\u201d Dr. Colditz said.\n\nThe trial has, however, been held up for years as the gold standard for medical research, and its findings linking combination hormones to breast cancer and heart problems led to significant changes in the way doctors around the world treated menopause.\n\nA major caveat in interpreting the new estrogen data is that the study used conjugated equine estrogens, which are estrogen compounds derived from the urine of pregnant mares and marketed by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals under the brand Premarin. The brand has fallen out of favor with many women who are choosing treatments that contain estradiol, which is chemically similar to a woman\u2019s natural estrogen. It is not known whether the benefits of estrogen shown in the Women\u2019s Health Initiative would be replicated using a different type of estrogen.\n\nNobody knows why estrogen treatment alone appeared to lower breast cancer risk in the study, but one explanation may be that in menopausal women with low levels of natural estrogen, the effects of estrogen drugs induce cell death in existing tumors. Nobody is suggesting that women start using estrogen to prevent breast cancer, but the finding opens a potentially new avenue of research in the prevention of the disease.\n\n\u201cWe need to look closely at these findings to see if we can learn more about ways to prevent breast cancer in women,\u201d said Dr. JoAnn Manson, a Women\u2019s Health Initiative investigator and an author of the study who is chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston.\n\nIn the final analysis of the estrogen-only trial, use of the hormone was not associated with any significant risks or benefits pertaining to blood clots, stroke, hip fracture, colon cancer or overall death rates.\n\nBut there were surprising differences in the risks and benefits of estrogen use on heart risk when comparing the youngest and oldest women in the study. Women who were in their 50s when they first started using estrogen also had significantly fewer heart risks, including almost 50 percent fewer heart attacks, compared with those assigned to the placebo group.\n\nThe data indicate that for every 10,000 women in their 50s, those using estrogen would experience 12 fewer heart attacks, 13 fewer deaths and 18 fewer adverse events like blood clots or stroke in a given year, compared with those taking a placebo.\n\nBut the risks of estrogen use were pronounced in older women. For every 10,000 women in their 70s, using estrogen would cause 16 extra heart attacks, 19 extra deaths and 48 serious adverse events.\n\n\u201cThe big message there is that the data look much more favorable for younger women and much riskier for older women,\u201d said Dr. LaCroix.\n\nDr. Rowan Chlebowski, another author of the study and a medical oncologist at Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute, said the findings underscored the fact that the risks and benefits of menopause hormones change depending on a woman\u2019s health status, her age and the type of hormone used.\n\nDr. Chlebowski previously led research that showed cancer risks associated with combination hormone therapy, but he says the new data on estrogen alone show that in certain women, estrogen use to relieve menopausal symptoms is a \u201cgood choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the debate, people are saying hormones are good or not good \u2014 it\u2019s been all or nothing.

The study appears in Scientific Reports.\n\nGestational diabetes occurs only in pregnancy and results when the level of blood sugar, or glucose, rises too high. Gestational diabetes increases the mother\u2019s chances for high blood pressure disorders of pregnancy and the need for cesarean delivery, and the risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes later in life. For infants, gestational diabetes increases the risk for large birth size. Unless they have a known risk factor, such as obesity, women typically are screened for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nIn the current study, researchers evaluated whether the HbA1c test (also called the A1C test), commonly used to diagnose type 2 diabetes, could identify signs of gestational diabetes in the first trimester of pregnancy. The test approximates the average blood glucose levels over the previous 2 or 3 months, based on the amount of glucose that has accumulated on the surface of red blood cells. According to the authors, comparatively few studies have examined whether the HbA1c test could help identify the risk for gestational diabetes, and these studies have been limited to women already at high risk for the condition. The test is not currently recommended to diagnose gestational diabetes at any point in pregnancy.\n\nThe researchers analyzed records from the NICHD Fetal Growth Study, a large observational study that recruited more than 2,000 low-risk pregnant women from 12 U.S. clinical sites between 2009 and 2013. The researchers compared HbA1c test results from 107 women who later developed gestational diabetes to test results from 214 women who did not develop the condition. Most of the women had tests at four intervals during pregnancy: early (weeks 8-13), middle (weeks 16-22 and 24-29) and late (weeks 34-37).\n\nWomen who went on to develop gestational diabetes had higher HbA1c levels (an average of 5.3 percent), compared to those without gestational diabetes (an average HbA1c level of 5.1 percent). Each .1 percent increase in HbA1c above 5.1 percent in early pregnancy was associated with a 22-percent higher risk for gestational diabetes.\n\nIn middle pregnancy, HbA1c levels declined for both groups. However, HbA1c levels increased in the final third of pregnancy, which is consistent with the decrease in sensitivity to insulin that often occurs during this time period.\n\n\u201cOur results suggest that the HbA1C test potentially could help identify women at risk for gestational diabetes early in pregnancy, when lifestyle changes may be more effective in reducing their risk,\u201d said the study\u2019s senior author, Cuilin Zhang, Ph.D., of the Epidemiology Branch at NIH\u2019s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.\n\nExercise and a healthy diet may lower blood glucose levels during pregnancy. If these measures are not successful, physicians may prescribe insulin to bring blood glucose under control.\n\nThe authors noted that further studies are needed to confirm whether measuring HbA1c levels in early pregnancy could determine a woman\u2019s later risk for gestational diabetes. Similarly, research is needed to determine whether lowering HbA1c with lifestyle changes, either in early pregnancy or before pregnancy, could reduce the risk for the condition.\n\nAbout the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD): NICHD conducts and supports research in the United States and throughout the world on fetal, infant and child development; maternal, child and family health; reproductive biology and population issues; and medical rehabilitation.

They hope the technology can be commercialized and marketed to prevent the spread of seasonal flu in public places, such as schools, hospitals, and airports.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known for a century that UV light is extremely efficient at killing microbes, bacteria, and viruses,\u201d says study leader David Brenner, director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. For that reason, UV devices are often used for sterilization \u2014 for medical equipment in hospitals, for example, or drinking water for backcountry campers.\n\nBut conventional germicidal lamps aren\u2019t safe for humans to be around. With prolonged exposure, they can cause skin cancer and cataracts in the eyes. \u201cSo up until now, they\u2019re only really practical when people aren\u2019t around,\u201d say Brenner. \u201cYou can sterilize a hospital room, but not when anyone\u2019s inside.\u201d\n\nAbout five years ago, Brenner says, the Columbia team came up with a potential solution. Light on the far end of the UV-C spectrum, known as far-UVC, has very short wavelengths. The researchers suspected that it can penetrate and destroy microscopic bacteria and viruses, but can\u2019t travel through the protective outer layers of human skin or eyes.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to get all the benefits of UV light in terms of killing microbes, but none of the health hazards,\u201d says Brenner. Earlier studies, on animals and humans, have shown that exposure to far-UVC light does indeed appear to be safe. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any biological damage to skin cells or eye cells, whereas with conventional UV light we\u2019ve always seen lots of biological damage,\u201d he says. Previous research has also shown that far-UVC light can kill MRSA bacteria, a common cause of infections after surgery.\n\nNow, Brenner and his colleagues have show that UVC light can effectively kill airborne influenza. In their new study, aerosolized particles of the H1N1 seasonal flu virus were released into a test chamber and exposed to very low doses of far-UVC light. The light inactivated the viruses with about the same efficiency as conventional germicidal UV light, while a control group of bacteria not exposed to light remained active.\n\n\u201cWe think that this type of overhead light could be efficacious for basically any public setting,\u201d says Brenner. \u201cThink about doctor\u2019s waiting rooms, schools, airports and airplanes\u2014any place where there\u2019s a likelihood for airborne viruses.\u201d And unlike the flu vaccine, he says, far-UVC light is likely to be effective against all airborne microbes, including newly emerging virus strains.\n\nBrenner says his team is working with a company to develop a commercially available version of the lamp, which could become a cost-effective way to battle flu epidemics on a population level. \u201cThe lamp we\u2019re using at the moment costs less than $1,000, and you can imagine that if it were put into general circulation, the price would drop dramatically,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t see cost as being a limiting factor here.\u201d\n\nUVC lamps could also have potential implications in clinical settings, as well \u2014 in the operating room during surgeries, for example. \u201cNo matter how well you sterilize a room beforehand, the medical staff can still bring in dangerous bacteria like MRSA,\u201d says Brenner. \u201cIf you have a lamp over the surgical site that can sterilize the air, you can prevent the bacteria from floating down and contaminating the wound.\u201d\n\nBrenner can\u2019t predict how long it might take for these lamps to be commercially available, but he says he\u2019s \u201cextremely optimistic\u201d about the technology. \u201cThere has been no way of killing viruses in the air in public spaces, and this is an approach that may solve that problem.\u201d", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "LONDON (Reuters) - Iranian scientists say they have developed a way of using a simple blood test to predict accurately when women will reach the menopause, offering the chance for women to plan for family and career far in advance.\n\nThe test, which measures levels of a hormone produced by cells in the ovaries, was able to predict the age at which women reached menopause to within an average of 4 months, according to data to be presented at the conference of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Rome on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe results ... could enable us to make a more realistic assessment of women\u2019s reproductive status many years before they reach menopause,\u201d said Ramezani Tehrani of the Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences in Tehran, who led the study.\n\nExperts commenting on the work agreed it was promising, but said its findings would need to be confirmed in larger trials.\n\n\u201cThe possibility of an accurate predictor for menopause is very exciting.

In 2009, he had routine blood work that revealed an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. When PSA is above 4 nanograms per milliliter of blood, it can be one of the first signs of a prostate tumor. Harder\u2019s PSA was 9.\n\nBy the time Harder saw a urologist, it had skyrocketed to 20. His doctor recommended the traditional next step: a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy, which involves taking random tissue samples from 12 cross sections of the prostate.\n\nOver the course of two years, Harder, 60, an MRI technologist, would have three TRUS biopsies. They were all inconclusive.\n\n\u201cIt is frustrating to have a bunch of biopsies with a rising PSA and no proof of cancer,\u201d Harder said.\n\nAfter Harder\u2019s third biopsy, his urologist was ready to throw in the towel, and that\u2019s when Harder was referred to Jinxing Yu, M.D., at VCU Health. By then, Harder\u2019s PSA was around 30.\n\nYu is the director of oncologic and prostate imaging in the Department of Radiology at VCU. Over the past five years, he has developed diagnostic techniques using MRI technology to investigate difficult cases like Harder\u2019s.\n\nAfter one MRI, Yu found Harder\u2019s tumor. After that, Yu performed a targeted biopsy guided by the MRI scanner, allowing him to take tissue samples directly from the tumor.\n\nIn 2012, he started on a treatment plan: hormone therapy for six months to shrink the tumor and prostate, and then external beam radiation to finish the job. Today, his PSA is normal.\n\nOther patients who continue to hit a brick wall with negative results from TRUS biopsies yet persistently high PSA levels may not be as fortunate.\n\n\u201cA patient had 10 TRUS biopsies and his doctors still couldn\u2019t find a tumor,\u201d Yu said. \u201cIf you do not have this kind of advanced imaging, sometimes a patient runs into a situation when a tumor can\u2019t be found and treated because it\u2019s too late \u2014 it has already metastasized. He ends up diagnosed with cancer only after the tumor has spread to his bone or lymph nodes years later.\u201d\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging and targeted biopsy for the prostate have provided relief for patients like Harder who have not been able to get an accurate diagnosis. When caught early, prostate cancer is highly treatable.\n\nMuch like someone would have an MRI to investigate the cause of back pain, the technology gives doctors eyes on what is happening in prostate tissue. VCU Medical Center is one of the major teaching hospitals in the country doing advanced multiparametric MRI, which involves taking three different types of imaging sequences of the prostate.\n\nEach of the sequences \u2014 T2 weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic contrast enhanced imaging \u2014 tells a story, and together they can be used to make a diagnosis with more than 90 percent accuracy.\n\nInterpreting a prostate MRI to be able to correctly diagnose cancer is a skill that can take years to develop. Yu and his team look for certain patterns that are typical of cancer on each of the different sequences.\n\n\u201cIf we put those characteristic features together from each sequence then we can say with a high degree of confidence that this area is concerning for cancer and potentially target it for biopsy,\u201d said Sarah Winks, M.D., an attending physician in the Department of Radiology.\n\nAn MRI can also help determine how aggressive a tumor is, Yu said, and indicates if the tumor extends outside of the prostate and involves other areas \u2014 all information that helps urologists and radiation oncologists determine the best course of treatment.\n\nIn addition to enhancing detection of prostate cancer, magnetic resonance technology also enhances the biopsy process with a procedure called magnetic resonance/ultrasound fusion biopsy. MRI scans are overlaid with real-time ultrasound images to guide the biopsy needle to the tumor.\n\nIn 2014, VCU Health\u2019s Department of Radiology, supported by the Division of Urology in the Department of Surgery, purchased ultrasound/MRI fusion biopsy equipment. Prior to this, Yu\u2019s team had performed targeted MRI biopsies with the patient being moved in and out of the MRI scanner as the needle was guided to the target area \u2014 a sort of stop-motion procedure that could take up to an hour. The new equipment has simplified and shortened the process to about 20 minutes.\n\nA study published in 2015 by the Center for Cancer Research found that fusion biopsy is 30 percent more accurate in diagnosing high-risk, aggressive cancers than a TRUS biopsy. It is also much better at finding tumors in the anterior part of the prostate, near where Harder\u2019s tumor was located.\n\nYu credits the technology and also having a dedicated team that can perform multiparametric-MRI, read the MRI scans and conduct biopsies with a very high success rate.\n\n\u201cAt most places, there will be a radiologist reading the MR image and a clinician performing the biopsy. The person reading the image and person putting in the needle is different,\u201d Yu said. \u201cSometimes you don\u2019t get the same result. We do both. That\u2019s one of our strengths.\u201d\n\nYu has seen how MRI technology has changed prostate patients\u2019 care. \u201cFive years ago, 95 percent of patients with prostate cancer or a high PSA would never get any imaging,\u201d Yu said. \u201cRight now, I think probably 50 or 60 percent get imaging.\u201d Sometimes, these are patients pushing their doctors for a referral as one of Yu\u2019s patients did last year.\n\nLast August, Jim Grandon of Colville, Washington, discovered he had a PSA of 5.3. It was elevated from the 4.1 measurement that he had registered for a few years. The rising PSA was cause for concern. Instead of going through with an immediate TRUS biopsy recommended by his urologist, he decided to research next steps.\n\n\u201cWith just going in and doing a blind biopsy like most urologists will do, you have anywhere from 35 to 45 percent success rate,\u201d Grandon said. \u201cI found three or four places around the country with a biopsy success rate of over 85 percent. When I went back to my urologist, he said, \u2018Why spend money flying around the country when we can take care of you here?\u2019 I said, \u2018Because 85 percent is better than 40 percent.\u2019\u201d\n\nVCU Medical Center was one of the places Grandon had researched to get his diagnostic testing done, and a few phone calls later, he was on a plane flying across the country to see Yu.\n\nOn his second day in Richmond, Grandon had an MRI that showed a lesion. The next day, Yu biopsied it. On the fourth day, Grandon flew home and began researching treatment options. He opted for brachytherapy followed by external radiation at a clinic closer to home, and recently completed his treatment.\n\nMore and more, physicians are hearing about and understanding the benefits of MRI technology for prostate care, which has also been helpful in preventing overdiagnosis and overtreatment. According to the Center for Cancer Research study, MRI targeted biopsies detect 17 percent fewer low-risk tumors. These are tumors that would have never developed into a life-threatening cancer, but might lead a doctor and patient to treat it unnecessarily.\n\nWhen Yu started prostate MRI screening in 2011, his team performed about 50 scans per year. Now, with the support of Massey Cancer Center, Urology and Radiation Oncology, they are doing about 1,200 multiparametric-MRI and 200 imaging guided biopsies per year. He estimates the volume will continue to increase because VCU will attract patients not only from the Greater Richmond area but also patients such as Grandon from other parts of the country.\n\nYu hopes the advanced technology means positive changes in the standard of care. He speculates that in the same way women have a baseline mammogram, men would have a baseline prostate MRI and periodic magnetic resonance scans if warranted by bloodwork and family history.", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "While prostate cancer is serious, this news release seems calculated to instill fear.

A new study from the University of Cincinnati (UC), published online this week in the Journal of Athletic Training, assessed the use of colored lenses in post-concussion patients and found wearing certain color-tinted sunglasses may be a good alternative to dark sunglasses.\n\n\"While sunglasses can provide some relief, they are not very practical indoors or in low light environments,\" says Joe Clark, PhD, professor in the Department of Neurology and Rehabilitation Medicine at the UC College of Medicine and lead author of the study. \"What is needed is a light mitigation strategy that can be readily employed indoors, which can optimize relief in those who suffer from photophobia, or light sensitivity.\"\n\nClark and researchers at the College of Medicine assessed visual symptoms of 51 concussion patients and used frames with varying colored lenses to find out if certain hues provided relief from photophobia.\n\n\"We found that 85 percent of patients reporting photophobia had relief of the symptoms with one or more colors-- blue, green, red and purple--with no reported adverse events,\" Clark says.\n\n\"Sensitivity to light can be common and impact activities of daily life suggesting that light mitigation might improve quality of life in many of these patients.

Studies so far have come to conflicting conclusions as to whether vitamin E or other antioxidants may influence older adults\u2019 risk of dementia.\n\nHowever, the new study followed participants for a longer period than most previous studies on antioxidants and dementia. And it supports findings from some previous research that dietary vitamin E, in particular, might be related to a lower risk of dementia.\n\nResearchers have been interested in whether antioxidants like vitamins E and C and beta-carotene might help stave off dementia because, in theory, their actions might interfere with the process of brain-cell degeneration.\n\nAntioxidants neutralize unstable forms of oxygen called reactive oxygen species that can damage cells throughout the body. Reactive oxygen species are produced naturally in the body, as byproducts of metabolism; because the brain is an area of high metabolic activity, it is thought to be particularly vulnerable to accumulating oxidative damage over a lifetime.\n\nHowever, studies so far have come to mixed conclusions as to whether older adults with a high dietary intake of various antioxidants have a lower risk of dementia. And clinical trials looking at the effects of antioxidant supplements have found no evidence that they cut Alzheimer\u2019s risk.\n\nFor the new study, researchers led by Dr. Monique Breteler, of Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, used data from 5,395 adults age 55 and older who were dementia-free at the start of the study. At that point, they were interviewed about their usual diet habits, which the researchers used to estimate their intake of vitamins C and E and beta-carotene.\n\nOver the next decade, 465 study participants were diagnosed with dementia, including 365 with Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nAmong the one-third of men and women with the highest vitamin E intakes from food, 120 developed dementia. Of the third with the lowest intakes, 164 were diagnosed with dementia.\n\nWhen Breteler\u2019s team considered a number of other factors \u2014 including participants\u2019 age, education, weight, and smoking and drinking habits \u2014 high vitamin E intake was linked to a one-quarter reduction in dementia risk.\n\nThe one-third of study participants with the highest vitamin E consumption typically got 18.5 milligrams (mg) per day, just over the recommended daily intake of 15 mg.\n\nThe researchers acknowledge that they cannot exclude the possibility that factors other than vitamin E explain the connection. Nor is it clear why vitamin E, but not vitamin C or beta-carotene, was linked to a lower dementia risk.\n\nBut the finding is in line with a previous study of U.S. adults that found that a higher intake of vitamin E, but not vitamin C or beta-carotene, was related to a lower risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s over two years.\n\nAccording to Breteler\u2019s team, studies should continue to look at the relationship between antioxidant intake and dementia \u2014 including whether antioxidant consumption at different points in life might have different effects on dementia risk.\n\nFood sources of vitamin E include wheat germ, nuts such as almonds and hazelnuts, vegetable oils such as sunflower and safflower oils, and some green vegetables, such as spinach and broccoli.\n\nIn the current study, participants\u2019 primary vitamin E sources included vegetable oils, margarine and butter.\n\nIt is unlikely that people could get too much vitamin E from food.

It is produced when enzymes act to convert a precursor molecule, angiotensinogen. Lisinopril is a member of a drug family called ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors. Other examples of ACE inhibitors are benazepril (Lotensin), enalapril (Vasotec) and ramipril (Altace).\n\nReducing angiotensin production by giving ACE inhibitors can lower blood pressure. The same effect can be achieved with drugs that block the cell receptors through which angiotensin acts. Called angiotensin receptor blockers, these drugs have a greater protective effect against dementia than ACE inhibitors, the study found. Such drugs include candesartan (Atacand), irbesartan (Avapro), losartan (Cozaar) and valsartan (Diovan).\n\nIn the study, men taking an angiotensin receptor blocker had a 24 percent lower incidence of dementia than those taking other cardiovascular drugs. The risk was 19 percent lower for men taking ACE inhibitors. The risk was nearly halved for those taking both angiotensin-targeting drugs.\n\nIn men with Alzheimer's disease, use of an angiotensin receptor blocker reduced admission to nursing homes by half. Combined angiotensin medication therapy reduced nursing home admissions by two-thirds.\n\nWolozin said that it's not clear why the drugs would have a beneficial effect on the brain, but improved blood flow probably plays a role.\n\n\"If you get no blood to the brain, you're not going to think well,\" he said. \"Also, in brain cells there is more than one kind of angiotensin receptor. By blocking bad receptors, you are left with the good ones so that helps neurons become more resilient.\"\n\nBut the evidence is not sufficient to support routine use of angiotensin receptor blockers to prevent Alzheimer's disease, Wolozin said. The new report describes an observational study, one that lacks the strict controls that are needed for convincing proof.\n\n\"Any study like this is hypothesis-generating,\" he said. \"You only know for sure when you have done clinical prospective trials.\"\n\nHis advice for anyone considering angiotensin receptors blockers to reduce dementia risk: \"They should consult with their physicians.\" There are potential hazards, such as too-low blood pressure that can lead to damaging falls, Wolozin said.\n\nCaution was urged by Dr. Richard B. Lipton, vice chairman of neurology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, who has done work on the genetics of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThe angiotensin hypothesis makes sense, Lipton said, because improved blood flow to the brain helps nerve cells and reduces formation of Alzheimer's-related amyloid protein.\n\nBut there have been a number of observational studies implicating various molecules, including estrogens, in dementia, he said. \"The sequence is that when you do the randomized trial, you don't get the same effect,\" Lipton said.\n\nOn the other hand, such randomized trials usually include people who are close to having Alzheimer's disease, and \"it could be different if you gave the drugs earlier,\" Lipton said.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has more on blood pressure medications.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There is no overt disease-mongering of dementia in the story.

For those who just can\u2019t give up grains (or regular eating), a new study indicates that being less restrictive is actually better for your waistline.\n\nRelated: How to Lose Weight and Keep it Off? Eternal Dieting Vigilance\n\nResearchers from The University of Tasmania in Australia found that breaking up with your diet for two weeks could lead to more weight loss\u2014and help you keep it off, too.\n\nFor the small study just published in the International Journal of Obesity, the team enlisted 51 obese men from the ages of 25 to 54 years old. All participants had maintained their current weight for six months leading up to the study and did not exercise regularly. One group of men followed the diet, which reduced calorie consumption by about one-third of their individual needs, for 16 weeks straight. The experimental group stuck to the eating plan for two weeks, before ditching the diet for two weeks. They repeated the cycle until they had also dieted for 16 weeks; however, in their case, each bout of restriction was followed by a period of eating enough calories for weight maintenance.\n\nAt the end of the study, the men following the intermittent diet plan lost 47 percent more weight than the control group. And while it\u2019s common to regain a few pounds after returning to previous eating habits, the two-week dieters kept the pounds off, maintaining a nearly 18-pound loss six months after the study.\n\nKrista Varady, an outside researcher who studies intermittent fasting (not the same as intermittent dieting) and weight loss at the University of Illinois, believes the results were significant.\n\n\"I was really impressed that they still saw almost a two kilogram weight loss during that last period at the end of the four months,\" she tells Newsweek. \"At that point we see almost zero weight loss,\" she explains of her own research. \"Somehow they\u2019re kind of keeping the body on its toes.\"\n\nThis trick may help combat the dreaded weight loss plateau that plagues dieters looking to lose those last five pounds. As we cut calories and lose weight, our resting metabolic rate eventually slows and our bodies become less efficient at shedding mass in a process known as adaptive thermogenesis.

The test is administered like a tuberculin skin test (TST), and results are interpreted by measuring the size of the skin induration two or three days later.\n\nThe TST is the most commonly used test to detect TB infection, with about 50 million tests worldwide each year, according to the World Health Organization. The test is easy to administer but produces too many false positives to achieve the WHO's goal of reducing TB deaths by 95 percent and new cases by 90 percent by 2035, Dr. Ruhwald said.\n\nIntroduced a decade ago, IGRAs have high specificity, producing few false positives, but require blood samples and complicated lab work, which has limited their widespread use. There is also a dramatic price difference between the two diagnostic tests. According to Dr. Ruhwald, a TST costs about $2; an IGRA is 20 to 40 times more expensive depending on setting.\n\nIn the first clinical trial, Dr. Ruhwald and colleagues conducted a double-blinded study of C-Tb in 979 participants enrolled at 13 clinical trial sites in Spain. Participants, all adults, ranged in TB status from presumed uninfected through intermediate and high risk of latent TB to active disease.\n\u2022 Both C-Tb and the IGRA had a specificity of 97 percent.\n\u2022 C-Tb was highly concordant to IGRA in 95 percent of study participants.\n\u2022 The specificity of C-Tb, unlike the TST, was not impacted by the BCG vaccine, the partially effective vaccine that many residents in the developing world receive. TST specificity in this group was only 62 percent.\n\u2022 The sensitivity of C-Tb was comparable to the IGRA in confirmed TB cases (77 percent vs. 81 percent), indicating similar abilities to detect infection.\n\nIn the second double-blinded trial, researchers were primarily concerned with testing how accurate C-Tb was in HIV-positive patients and in young children--populations in which the accuracy of the TST and the IGRA is known to be compromised. The study, conducted in South Africa, enrolled 1,090 participants, including 299 patients with HIV and 402 children as young as 28 days.\n\u2022 Among participants with HIV, the ability of all three tests to detect TB infection was diminished, though the C-Tb appeared more robust in HIV-infected participants with low CD4 T cell counts.\n\u2022 Among children under 5, C-Tb was comparable with the other two tests in identifying those infected.\n\nDr. Ruhwald said another advantage of C-Tb is that the measurement of infection, a 5mm or larger induration, is universal across patients with different risk factors, including HIV infection. With TST, the size of the induration is often adjusted to increase its accuracy in measuring infection in different patient populations.\n\nRegulatory approval for C-Tb is currently being sought and Statens Serum Institute is actively seeking a commercial partner for marketing of C-Tb. The cost of a C-Tb test is to be determined; however, it is expected to be significantly less than an IGRA.\n\nDiagnostic Accuracy of the Novel C-Tb Skin Test for Latent M.tuberculosis Infection; Results from Two Phase III Clinical Trials \n\nM.

C-Tb combines the field friendliness of the PPD-based Tuberculin Skin Test (TST), with the high specificity of the interferon gamma release assays (IGRA).\n\nThis presentation outlines the results from two recently completed phase III trials (TESEC-05 and -06). The results have not previously been published or presented.\n\nThe TESEC-06 trial included 979 participants from 13 clinical trial sites in Catalonia, Galicia and Basque Country (Spain) with various risk profiles of M.tuberculosis infection. The TESEC-05 trial included 1090 participants with symptoms of TB and 100 endemic controls from Cape Town (South Africa).\n\nIn both trials C-Tb and TST were administered in a double-blinded fashion to one or the other forearm. Skin indurations were read 2 to 3 days later. A reading ?5mm was considered positive for the TST and C-Tb (cut off preset in phase II). Blood for IGRA testing (Quantiferon, QFT-GIT) was drawn prior to skin testing.\n\nThe safety profile of C-Tb was acceptable and not different from TST. Test specificity was assessed in 212 presumed unexposed Spanish controls. Here, C-Tb had comparable specificity to QFT-GIT (both 97%, p=1.0, and there was no impact of BCG vaccination). By contrast, previous BCG vaccination subverted TST specificity [62% (67/108) in BCG vaccinated compared to 95% (99/104) in BCG unvaccinated persons; (p<0.001)].

On Monday, June 12, I took the train down to Washington to be hooked up while the annual meeting of the American Diabetes Association was in town.\n\nThe device, made by Medtronic MiniMed, is called the Paradigm Real-Time, a combination insulin pump and continuous glucose sensor. The sensor doesn\u2019t control the pump but allows a diabetic to make quicker, presumably better decisions. I\u2019d already been on a stand-alone MiniMed pump for a few years, but I found it only an incremental improvement over taking insulin by injection.\n\nLike the pump, the sensor requires injecting a tiny catheter (less than an inch long) into the midsection of the body, and changing it every three days to avoid infection. The sensor has a coated tip that measures the electrical conductivity of the interstitial fluid, the juice floating between fat cells right under the skin. As luck would have it, the conductivity is directly proportional to how much glucose is floating around in the juice.\n\nEven with the help of an expert trainer from MiniMed, I found that injecting the catheter took much more dexterity than injecting one for a pump. It has to be placed above the hip or the buttocks, which makes reaching it awkward, and then the wire leading from the sensor has to be connected to a transmitter that wirelessly sends the information to the pump.\n\nWhen everything was in, I had two catheters and the transmitter all taped to my body, plus the pump hanging on my belt. Kind of weird, but kind of cool, in a sci-fi way, and I remained thrilled at the prospect of seeing my first glucose reading.\n\nThen the waiting began. The sensor needs three hours to settle in before it can begin transmitting data. By late afternoon, when it was supposed to start, I got an error message instead. When I tried to recalibrate it a half-hour later, it still wasn\u2019t working right, so I had to remove it and inject a second one. It was after 9 p.m. before the second one finally began working.\n\nAt first, I was transfixed by the numbers as they were updated every five minutes. That night, however, the sensor kept beeping me awake, nearly every hour, warning that my glucose level was too high.\n\nI kept following the recommendations of the embedded calculator, taking only very small amounts of insulin to bring my sugar level down. But by morning, I was still high, so I followed my own usual guesstimate and took much more.\n\nTwo hours later, while attending a session at the diabetes association meetings, in which four experts talked about the new sensors, I heard mine beep again, this time warning me that my glucose level was plummeting. I quickly drank a juice box, and within minutes my numbers started leveling off. I had avoided my first low. All the hassles of the past 24 hours were forgiven. This bionic diabetic was in rapture.\n\nOver the next six weeks of testing, I came down to earth as I realized that while the sensor enabled me to drastically cut my usual number of lows, it did not eliminate them.\n\nThe main problem was that the sensor was simply not as accurate as a blood-glucose tester. MiniMed\u2019s studies show the sensor\u2019s accuracy can be off by as much as 18 percent. Another sensor, just approved by the F.D.A. and made by DexCom, is said by some researchers to be a bit more accurate, as is a third device, from Abbot, which has not yet been approved. But none are as accurate as a standard blood-sugar test.\n\nI also had three sensor catheters slip out and require early replacement, which would be especially annoying to anyone paying the $35 that each sensor costs; I wasn\u2019t, because MiniMed had supplied everything free for testing, but everybody else will, since the sensors are not yet covered by insurance. With each catheter intended to last just three days, the bill comes to $350 a month.\n\nBut the bottom line is that over the entire six weeks I had only a few lows that left me feeling woozy, the kind I used to put up with two or three times a week.\n\nOn July 24, my test period over, I felt like Mr. Magoo without his glasses. I made it through our annual Cape Cod vacation without incident, but Annie kept a wary eye on me. I think I owe it to her to start shelling out that $350 per month, at least until the insurance companies figure out what a lifesaver this transformative new technology can be.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The level of monitoring and use of injections as described in this article are beyond what has been tested in randomized controlled trials.

How you live your life... has a real impact on how quickly your condition can decline.\"\n\nIf the findings are confirmed by larger studies, they could vastly improve the ability to detect dementia in middle age.\n\nAnd the scans would be \"well set up for routine testing,\" according to Chiesa. \"It's very easy to do, and it's very quick to do.\"\n\nWhen healthy, arteries around the heart can regulate the blood being pumped from the organ, ensuring that it flows smoothly and at a constant rate to the brain.\n\nBut damage to the arteries means blood flows more aggressively and irregularly through vessels and into the brain, which can damage its network of blood vessels and cells. Over time, the researchers believe this led more frequently to cognitive decline in participants in the study.\n\n\"What we do know is that the blood supply in the brain is incredibly important, and that maintaining a healthy heart and blood pressure is associated with a lower risk of developing dementia,\" said Carol Routledge, Director of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK, who was not involved in the research.\n\nVascular dementia is directly caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, and this can also play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease, studies have found. Those two conditions make up the vast majority of cases of dementia.\n\nDementia is an umbrella term used to describe symptoms related to the loss of brain function. Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia make up the vast majority of cases.\n\nIn the United States, the condition is the sixth biggest cause of death among all adults, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while in the UK it has overtaken heart disease as the leading cause of death, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nThe study's findings have been met with cautious optimism by dementia organizations.\n\n\"Getting a diagnosis of dementia can be time consuming and quite frustrating for many people, so it's promising that earlier indicators of cognitive decline are in development,\" said Paul Edwards, Director of Clinical Services at Dementia UK.\n\nBut he added that focus should also be paid to dementia sufferers after their diagnosis, saying: \"The elephant in the room is the lack of support for people and their families once they get a diagnosis of dementia.\"\n\nThere is currently no cure for dementia, though medication can be used to temporarily treat its symptoms.\n\n\"Often, a diagnosis is made and then people are sent home with no information, no follow-up appointments and no clue about what is going to happen next.\"\n\nMore research is needed to determine whether neck scans should become a part of routine testing for dementia.\n\n\"While these findings are interesting, as the full data from this research is yet to be published it is difficult to assess how useful this kind of scan could be,\" said Routledge.\n\nRoutledge added that current evidence shows that not smoking, only consuming alcohol within recommended limits, staying active, monitoring cholesterol levels and eating a balanced diet can all help with the health of the heart and brain.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering here.

This finding could lead to the first advance in the treatment of calcium oxalate stones in 30 years.\n\nJeffrey Rimer, associate professor of chemical engineering at the University of Houston, was lead author of the study, published Aug. 8 in the online edition of Nature. The work offers the first evidence that the compound hydroxycitrate (HCA) is an effective inhibitor of calcium oxalate crystal growth that, under certain conditions, is actually able to dissolve these crystals. Researchers also explain how it works.\n\nThe findings are the result of a combination of experimental studies, computational studies and human studies, Rimer said.\n\nKidney stones are small, hard mineral deposits that form inside the kidneys, affecting up to 12 percent of men and seven percent of women. High blood pressure, diabetes and obesity can increase the risk, and the reported incidence is on the rise.\n\nPreventive treatment has not changed much over the last three decades. Doctors tell patients who are at risk of developing stones to drink lots of water and avoid foods rich in oxalate, such as rhubarb, okra, spinach and almonds. They often recommend taking citrate (CA), in the form of potassium citrate, a supplement that can slow crystal growth, but some people are unable to tolerate the side effects.\n\nThe project grew out of preliminary work done by collaborator John Asplin, a nephrologist at Litholink Corporation, who suggested HCA as a possible treatment. HCA is chemically similar to CA and is also available as a dietary supplement.\n\n\"HCA shows promise as a potential therapy to prevent kidney stones,\" the researchers wrote. \"HCA may be preferred as a therapy over CA (potassium citrate).\"\n\nIn addition to Rimer and Asplin, authors on the paper include Giannis Mpourmpakis and his graduate student, Michael G. Taylor, of the University of Pittsburgh; Ignacio Granja of Litholink Corporation, and Jihae Chung, a UH graduate student working in Rimer's lab.\n\nThe head-to-head studies of CA and HCA determined that while both compounds inhibit the growth of calcium oxalate crystals, HCA was more potent and displayed unique qualities that are advantageous for the development of new therapies.\n\nThe team of researchers then used atomic force microscopy, or AFM, to study interactions between the crystals, CA and HCA under realistic growth conditions. According to Rimer, the technique allowed them to record crystal growth in real time with near-molecular resolution.\n\nChung noted that the AFM images recorded the crystal actually shrinking when exposed to specific concentrations of HCA. Rimer suspected the initial finding was an abnormality, as it is rare to see a crystal actually dissolve in highly supersaturated growth solutions. The most effective inhibitors reported in the literature simply stop the crystal from growing.\n\nIt turned out that Chung's initial finding was correct. Once they confirmed it is possible to dissolve crystals in supersaturated solutions, researchers then looked at reasons to explain why that happened.\n\nMpourmpakis and Taylor applied density functional theory (DFT) - a highly accurate computational method used to study the structure and properties of materials - to address how HCA and CA bind to calcium and to calcium oxalate crystals. They discovered HCA formed a stronger bond with crystal surfaces, inducing a strain that is seemingly relieved by the release of calcium and oxalate, leading to crystal dissolution.\n\nHCA was also tested in human subjects, as seven people took the supplement for three days, allowing researchers to determine that HCA is excreted through urine, a requirement for the supplement to work as a treatment.\n\nWhile Rimer said the research established the groundwork to design an effective drug, questions remain. Long-term safety, dosage and additional human trials are needed, he said.\n\n\"But our initial findings are very promising,\" he said. \"If it works in vivo, similar to our trials in the laboratory, HCA has the potential to reduce the incidence rate of people with chronic kidney stone disease.\"", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The release is in line with common estimates when it states that up to 12 percent of men and 7 percent of women are affected by kidney stones, and that the incidence is rising.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Eating tomatoes in your daily salad or regularly enjoying a healthy red sauce on your spaghetti could help reduce your risk of stroke, according to research published this week in the journal Neurology.\n\nTomatoes contain a powerful antioxidant that is good for brain health, the researchers say, and cooked tomatoes seem to offer more protection than raw.\n\n\"This study adds to the evidence that a diet high in fruits and vegetables is associated with a lower risk of stroke,\" says study author Jouni Karppi, of the University of Eastern Finland in Kuopio. \"A diet containing tomatoes... a few times a week would be good for our health. However, daily intake of tomatoes may give better protection.\" \n\n \n\n Karppi says it's the chemical lycopene that gives tomatoes and other fruits/vegetables their rich red color, that is helping to protect the brain. Tomatoes are particularly high in the powerful antioxidant that acts like a sponge, soaking up rogue molecules called free radicals that if left unchecked can damage cells.\n\nResearchers tested the level of lycopene in the blood of more than 1,000 Finnish men aged 46 to 65, starting in 1991. Scientists then followed the men on average for more than a decade to record the number who had strokes.\n\nThe scientists found that those with the highest levels of lycopene were 55% less likely to have a stroke than those with the lowest amounts in their blood.\n\nThough the study looks promising, experts say that we can't necessarily give all of the credit to lycopene.\n\n\"It's a compelling study and it fits with other data that we have about risk of stroke and vegetable and fruit consumption,\" explains Dr. Daniel Labovitz, director of the Stern Stroke Center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York. \"But it's not proof that if you eat tomatoes you're going to have less risk of stroke.\"\n\nLabovitz also points out that the group of men who had fewer strokes were younger, had lower blood pressure and smoked less than the group more prone to stroke. Though the researchers tried to take these lifestyle factors into account when calculating their findings, it may be that these things influenced the outcomes.\n\nIn other words, perhaps better health habits - not necessarily just the lycopene - lead to fewer strokes.\n\nLycopene has attracted a lot of attention in recent years because it's such a powerful antioxidant. If we don't eat enough lycopene-packed foods, experts suspect too many free radicals get left in the body, damaging blood vessels by helping to form fatty deposits. When these deposits build up, a blockage forms. If that vessel is in the brain, the blockage can cause a stroke.\n\nBut the foods we eat are complex and filled with many nutrients, making it tough to prove what is really providing benefits.\n\n\"Eating tomatoes is a good thing, but we don't know if there is really anything unique about tomatoes apart from other fruits and vegetables that reduce stroke risk,\" explains Dr. Walter Willett, chair of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nTomatoes could contribute to reducing stroke in other ways, Willett says, because they are a good source of potassium, which is known to reduce blood pressure. Elevated blood pressure is major risk factor for stroke.\n\nSo are lycopene packed tomatoes really the magic fruit? It seems the jury is still out, but researchers suggest we eat healthy as they continue to search for answers.\n\n\"This is one more reason to consume fruits and vegetables - at least 5 a day - and it's good to include tomatoes in that mix,\" Willett said.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There was no disease-mongering of stroke.\u00a0 However, the description of free radicals did sound a little alarming.\u00a0 They are natural byproducts of our biochemical processes.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Dec. 6, 2010 -- Taking aspirin over a long period of time can substantially cut the risk of dying from a variety of cancers, according to a study showing that the benefit is independent of dose, gender, or smoking. It also found that the protective effect increases with age. The study is by Peter Rothwell, MD, PhD, FRCP, of John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, England, and colleagues, and has been published online by the journal the Lancet. A previous study by the same authors showed that low doses of aspirin (75-300 milligrams) reduced the number of cases of colorectal cancer by a quarter and deaths caused by the disease by more than a third. The latest study confirms the earlier results and concludes that similar effects can be shown for other types of cancers.\n\nThe study looked at eight trials examining the effects of a daily dose of aspirin on preventing heart attacks involving 25,570 patients, 674 of whom died from cancer. They showed a 21% reduction in the number of deaths caused by cancer among those who had taken aspirin, compared with people who had not. The investigation also showed that the benefits of taking aspirin increased over time. After five years, death rates were shown to fall by 34% for all cancers and by 54% for gastrointestinal cancers. Participants were also followed up after 20 years, by which point 1,634 of the original participants had died as a direct result of cancer. This 20-year follow-up established that the risk of cancer death remained 20% lower among those who had been allocated aspirin than those in the control group for all solid cancers, including lung, prostate, brain, bladder, and kidney cancers, and by 35% for gastrointestinal cancers. The fall in the risk of death broke down according to individual types of cancer: Reductions in pancreatic, stomach, and brain cancers were difficult to quantify because of smaller numbers of deaths, the authors say.\n\nThe protective effect of taking low doses of aspirin varied according to the type of cancer and how long aspirin had been taken, the authors found. For instance, it only became apparent after about five years for esophageal, pancreatic, brain, and lung cancer; about 10 years for stomach and colorectal cancer; and about 15 years for prostate cancer.

The results were published online ahead of print on October 11, 2016 by the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry.\n\nThe National Center for PTSD estimates that seven to eight percent of Americans will have PTSD at some point in their life. The numbers are even worse for veterans: it is estimated, for example, that 30 percent of Vietnam veterans will have experienced PTSD at some point in their life. Approximately 40 to 50 percent of veterans with PTSD also have a substance use disorder (SUD).\n\n\"Addiction goes along with virtually every psychiatric disorder at a higher percentage than it does in the general population\" said Peter W. Kalivas, Ph.D. the senior author on the article and chair of the Department of Neuroscience at MUSC. \"People who are prone to psychiatric disorders are also prone to addiction.\"\n\nCurrently, there are no well-explored pharmacological treatments for patients with co-occurring PTSD/SUD. Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been approved by the FDA for treatment of PTSD, pharmacological treatments for co-occurring PTSD/SUD have yielded suboptimal results.\n\nGroundbreaking basic science research by Kalivas has shown that levels of glutamate transporters are decreased in SUDs and that administration of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine can help restore those levels and guard against relapse in animal models of SUD. Because evidence suggests that SUDs and PTSD share overlapping neurobiological pathways, Sudie E. Back, Ph.D., lead author on the article, hypothesized that NAC treatment with CBT would be a novel approach to treat co-occurring PTSD and SUD. Back is a professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at MUSC and a staff psychologist at the Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center.\n\nIn the eight-week randomized controlled trial led by Back and Kalivas, 35 veterans with PTSD and SUD, all of whom were receiving cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for their SUD, were randomized to either 2400 mg/day of NAC or placebo. The average age of the veterans was 49 years and many were veterans of the Vietnam War. To be included, veterans had to have abstained from substance use for at least seven days. Of the veterans enrolled in the trial, 83% completed it, a very high rate for this difficult-to-treat population.\n\nVeterans in the NAC-treated group showed a 46% reduction in PTSD symptoms, compared with a 25% reduction in the placebo group on the Clinical-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), which assesses trauma history and symptom severity. The threshold CAPS score for diagnosis of PTSD is 50.\n\n\"As a group, the NAC-treated veterans were below diagnostic level for PTSD at the end of treatment,\" said Back. \"For PTSD, these are some of the best outcomes we have seen in the literature for a medication.\"\n\nCraving and depression were also reduced in the NAC-treated group. The amount of craving was reduced by 81% and the frequency of craving by 71% in the NAC group, compared with 32% and 29% in the placebo group. \"Craving is a key component of substance use in relapse,\" said Back. \"If you have a medication that can really reduce craving, that will go a long way to helping people stay clean and sober.\" Depression, gauged using the Beck Depression Inventory, was reduced 48% in the NAC group vs. 15% in the placebo group.\n\nVeterans in the study had low rates of substance use during the trial, and the study found little effect of medication on use, perhaps due to the fact that all participants were receiving SUD treatment and exhibiting low levels of use. This finding could also be due to the relatively limited number of participants or to the chronic nature of the participants' PTSD. \"This is a tough patient population with SUD to work with.\" said Kalivas. \"We have Vietnam vets that have had PTSD for 15 to 20 years. This is not an easy-to-turn-around population.\"\n\nAlthough these early, promising findings show that NAC reduced PTSD symptoms, craving, and depression, NAC should not be used as a monotherapy or substitute for evidence-based behavioral treatment, but instead be seen as an adjunct therapy that enhances it.\n\n\"We would not advocate using it instead of therapy,\" said Back. \"But this could be something to help prevent relapse when used alongside a behavioral treatment.\"\n\nNAC is available over the counter and does not cause side effects at the doses used in the study, but it degrades quickly when stored, is contraindicated in patients with asthma, and can cause nausea at higher doses and so should always be obtained and administered under a physician's supervision.\n\nThe next steps in Back's research are to run a longer-term trial of NAC in veterans with PTSD and SUD and to use MRS magnetic spectroscopy to better explore the effect of NAC on glutamate levels in patients with PTSD and SUD.\n\nFounded in 1824 in Charleston, The Medical University of South Carolina is the oldest medical school in the South.

The researchers were presenting their results on Sunday and Monday in at a meeting of the American Society of Hematology.\n\nDespite the mixed results, cancer experts not involved with the research say it has tremendous promise, because even in this early phase of testing it has worked in seemingly hopeless cases. \u201cI think this is a major breakthrough,\u201d said Dr. Ivan Borrello, a cancer expert and associate professor of medicine at the School of Medicine.\n\nDr. John Wagner, the director of pediatric blood and marrow transplantation at the , called the Pennsylvania results \u201cphenomenal\u201d and said they were \u201cwhat we\u2019ve all been working and hoping for but not seeing to this extent.\u201d\n\nA major drug company, , is betting on the Pennsylvania team and has committed $20 million to building a research center on the university\u2019s campus to bring the treatment to market.\n\nHerv\u00e9 Hoppenot, the president of Novartis Oncology, called the research \u201cfantastic\u201d and said it had the potential \u2014 if the early results held up \u2014 to revolutionize the treatment of leukemia and related blood cancers. Researchers say the same approach, reprogramming the patient\u2019s immune system, may also eventually be used against like breast and .\n\nTo perform the treatment, doctors remove millions of the patient\u2019s T-cells \u2014 a type of white blood cell \u2014 and insert new genes that enable the T-cells to kill cancer cells. The technique employs a disabled form of H.I.V. because it is very good at carrying genetic material into T-cells. The new genes program the T-cells to attack B-cells, a normal part of the immune system that turn malignant in leukemia.\n\nThe altered T-cells \u2014 called chimeric antigen receptor cells \u2014 are then dripped back into the patient\u2019s veins, and if all goes well they multiply and start destroying the cancer.\n\nThe T-cells home in on a protein called CD-19 that is found on the surface of most B-cells, whether they are healthy or malignant.\n\nA sign that the treatment is working is that the patient becomes terribly ill, with raging fevers and chills \u2014 a reaction that oncologists call \u201cshake and bake,\u201d Dr. June said. Its medical name is cytokine-release syndrome, or cytokine storm, referring to the natural chemicals that pour out of cells in the immune system as they are being activated, causing fevers and other symptoms. The storm can also flood the lungs and cause perilous drops in \u2014 effects that nearly killed Emma.\n\nSteroids sometimes ease the reaction, but they did not help Emma. Her temperature hit 105. She wound up on a ventilator, unconscious and swollen almost beyond recognition, surrounded by friends and family who had come to say goodbye.\n\nBut at the 11th hour, a battery of blood tests gave the researchers a clue as to what might help save Emma: her level of one of the cytokines, interleukin-6 or IL-6, had shot up a thousandfold. Doctors had never seen such a spike before and thought it might be what was making her so sick.\n\nDr. June knew that a drug could lower IL-6 \u2014 his daughter takes it for . It had never been used for a crisis like Emma\u2019s, but there was little to lose. Her oncologist, Dr. Stephan A. Grupp, ordered the drug. The response, he said, was \u201camazing.\u201d\n\nWithin hours, Emma began to stabilize. She woke up a week later, on May 2, the day she turned 7; the intensive-care staff sang\n\nSince then, the research team has used the same drug, tocilizumab, in several other patients.\n\nIn patients with lasting remissions after the treatment, the altered T-cells persist in the bloodstream, though in smaller numbers than when they were fighting the disease. Some patients have had the cells for years.\n\nDr. Michel Sadelain, who conducts similar studies at the Sloan-Kettering Institute, said: \u201cThese T-cells are living drugs. With a pill, you take it, it\u2019s eliminated from your body and you have to take it again.\u201d But T-cells, he said, \u201ccould potentially be given only once, maybe only once or twice or three times.\u201d\n\nThe Pennsylvania researchers said they were surprised to find any big drug company interested in their work, because a new batch of T-cells must be created for each patient \u2014 a far cry from the familiar commercial strategy of developing products like or medicines, in which millions of people take the same drug.\n\nBut Mr. Hoppenot said Novartis was taking a different path with cancer drugs, looking for treatments that would have a big, unmistakable impact on a small number of patients. Such home-run drugs can be approved more quickly and efficiently, he said, with smaller studies than are needed for drugs with less obvious benefits.\n\nBut such drugs tend to be extremely expensive. A prime example is the Novartis drug Gleevec, which won rapid approval in 2001 for use against certain types of leukemia and gastrointestinal tumors. It can cost more than $5,000 a month, depending on the dosage.\n\nDr. June said that producing engineered T-cells costs about $20,000 per patient \u2014 far less than the cost of a bone-marrow transplant. Scaling up the procedure should make it even less expensive, he said, but he added, \u201cOur costs do not include any profit margin, facility depreciation costs or other clinical care costs, and other research costs.\u201d\n\nThe research is still in its early stages, and many questions remain. The researchers are not entirely sure why the treatment works, or why it sometimes fails. One patient had a remission after being treated only twice, and even then the reaction was so delayed that it took the researchers by surprise. For the patients who had no response whatsoever, the team suspects a flawed batch of T-cells. The child who had a temporary remission apparently relapsed because not all of her leukemic cells had the marker that was targeted by the altered T-cells.\n\nIt is not clear whether a patient\u2019s body needs the altered T-cells forever. The cells do have a drawback: they destroy healthy B-cells as well as cancerous ones, leaving patients vulnerable to certain types of infections, so Emma and the other patients need regular treatments with immune globulins to prevent illness.\n\nSo far, her parents say, Emma seems to have taken it all in stride. She went back to school this year with her second-grade classmates, and though her grades are high and she reads about 50 books a month, she insists impishly that her favorite subjects are lunch and recess.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for her to be a kid again and get her childhood back,\u201d Mr. Whitehead said.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "While certainly a terrible disease, acute lymphoblastic leukemia is\u00a0a treatable cancer.

(Aug. 22, 2017) - A study led by researchers at Cedars-Sinai and NeuroVision Imaging LLC provides the scientific basis for using noninvasive eye imaging to detect the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's. The experimental technology, developed by Cedars-Sinai and NeuroVision, scans the retina using techniques that can identify beta-amyloid protein deposits that mirror those in the brain.\n\nAccumulations of neurotoxic beta-amyloid protein can be detected with positron emission tomography, or PET scans, and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid, but these are invasive, inconvenient and costly, making them impractical for routine screening and follow-up evaluation.\n\n\"This is the first study demonstrating the potential to image and quantify retinal findings related to beta-amyloid plaques noninvasively in living patients using a retinal scan with high resolution. This clinical trial is reinforced by an in-depth exploration of the accumulation of beta-amyloid in the retina of Alzheimer's patients versus matched controls, and a comparison analysis between retina and brain pathologies. Findings from this study strongly suggest that retinal imaging can serve as a surrogate biomarker to investigate and monitor Alzheimer's disease,\" said Maya Koronyo-Hamaoui, Ph.D., an associate professor of Neurosurgery and Biomedical Sciences and a research scientist at the Maxine Dunitz Neurosurgical Institute at Cedars-Sinai, and a co-founder, inventor and scientist at NeuroVision. She is the senior leading author of an article in JCI Insight published online Aug. 17.\n\n\"As a developmental outgrowth of the central nervous system that shares many of the brain's characteristics, the retina may offer a unique opportunity for us to easily and conveniently detect and monitor Alzheimer's disease,\" said Keith L. Black, M.D., chairman of NeuroVision, chair of the Department of Neurosurgery and director of the Maxine Dunitz Neurosurgical Institute at Cedars-Sinai. \"We know that Alzheimer's begins as many as 10 or 20 years before cognitive decline becomes evident, and we believe that potential treatments may be more effective if they can be started early in the process. Therefore, screening and early detection may be crucial to our efforts to turn the tide against the growing threat of this devastating disease.\"\n\nSteven Verdooner, NeuroVision CEO, said the imaging system leverages the company's expertise in autofluorescence imaging of the retina using a specialized ophthalmic camera and sophisticated image processing software. \"It's exciting to see these studies demonstrating the power of the technology applied to the Alzheimer's field. Our goal is to develop a product that is easy to use, affordable and widely accessible. We look forward to the potential of retinal imaging playing a vital role in solving the problem of Alzheimer's, both in identifying and monitoring those who may be affected by the disease. Our next step is to continue with clinical trials, building upon the existing pharmaceutical company collaborations, to ensure our technology is ready for the medical community to help manage this disease.\"\n\nThe study's first author, Yosef Koronyo, a research associate at Cedars-Sinai and a scientist and inventor at NeuroVision, said the latest findings cap a decade of study that has produced several landmark discoveries. \"In 2010, our research group published an article providing the first evidence for the existence of Alzheimer's-specific plaques in the human retina, and we demonstrated the ability to detect individual plaques in live mouse models using a modified ophthalmic device.\"\n\nAfter adapting the technology for human application, the researchers initiated several ongoing clinical trials in the United States and Australia to determine the feasibility of detecting and quantifying beta-amyloid plaques in patients with the disease.\n\nIn the new article, the researchers report on a 16-patient clinical trial to demonstrate the feasibility of identifying beta-amyloid in the eye using autofluorescence imaging. They also provide detailed analyses and several new findings on Alzheimer's pathology in the retina, results of research with donated eyes and brains of 37 deceased patients, 23 with confirmed Alzheimer's disease and 14 controls.\n\nAmong key findings, the researchers report a 4.7-fold increase in retinal plaque burden in patients with Alzheimer's, compared to controls, and they provide observations regarding geometric distribution and layer location of amyloid pathology in the retina. With the imaging technology's ability to detect autofluorescence signal related to retinal beta-amyloid, these findings may lead to a practical approach for large-scale identification of the at-risk population and monitoring of Alzheimer's, the researchers say.\n\nThe article provides new insights into the disease's manifestations in the retina and information on the optical imaging system. Here are several highlights:\n\u2022 The first histologic quantitative analysis of retinal plaque clusters, or \"hot spots,\" containing the most toxic forms of beta-amyloid with specific distribution patterns in superior peripheral regions that were previously unexplored.\n\u2022 The first report of certain Alzheimer's-related pathologies in the retina, including vascular amyloid pathology.\n\u2022 The demonstration of a significant correlation between retinal and brain plaques, and coexistence of neuronal loss.\n\u2022 The first feasibility study for noninvasively detecting presumed amyloid deposits in retinas of living patients.\n\u2022 The demonstration of a fully automated calculation quantifying retinal autofluorescence that showed a 2.1-fold increase in patients with Alzheimer's, compared with controls.\n\nResearchers from NeuroVision, Cedars-Sinai, the Doheny Eye Institute, Retina Vitreous Associates Medical Group, Retinal Consultants Medical Group, Sutter Neuroscience Institute, UCLA, Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, Veterans Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, and the University of Southern California contributed to the research and article.

It is expected to be available as an inexpensive, over-the-counter product.\n\nOutdoor air pollution is a global health crisis that kills over 3 million people a year and it has long been linked to lung and heart disease and strokes. But research is also uncovering new impacts on health, including degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s, mental illness and, this week, diabetes.\n\nThe impact of air pollution costs $5tn a year, according to a World Bank report published last week. In the UK, at least 40,000 people a year die prematurely from air pollution, with a cross-party committee of MPs calling it a \u201cpublic health emergency\u201d.\n\nBut the government\u2019s plans to tackle the issue were heavily criticised this week, just as alerts were issued for extreme air pollution across much of northern England. A day later, it was announced that more ambitious plans for London from Mayor Sadiq Khan were overwhelmingly backed by the public.\n\nVehicles are a key contributor to air pollution but, a year after the VW emissions scandal broke, most new diesel cars still emit far more toxic nitrogen oxides on the road than the official lab-based limit.\n\nAction to clean up air is urgently needed across the world, but cutting emissions for vehicles and other sources will take years, meaning ways to reduce the harm in the meantime could be vital. The new inhaler has been developed by German medical devices company Bitop and is based on a molecule called ectoine, discovered in the 1980s in a desert bacterium which uses the compound to conserve water in 60C heat.\n\n\u201cIt is quite an inert molecule that does one main thing, which is bind water, which stabilises cell membrane tissues against physical or chemical damage,\u201d said Dr Andreas Bilstein, at Bitop. \u201cIt supports the natural barrier.\u201d\n\nWhen inhaled, this helps prevent the damage caused by air pollution particles that can lead to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer, Bilstein said: \u201cDamage cannot occur as strongly and there is less inflammatory response, and so disease progression is reduced. The perfect situation is that the patient inhales in the morning and evening at home.\u201d\n\nThe inhaler has been tested in three small groups of patients particularly at risk from air pollution, due to asthma, COPD and bronchitis, with the positive results due to be published soon, Bilstein said.\n\nEctoine does not interact with cell receptors, so it is classed as a medical device rather than a drug. This means large clinical trials are not required for official approval and the inhaler could be on sale soon, at an estimated cost of \u00a317 a month, after Bitop selects a marketing partner. A version of the product for use in nebulisers will be available this year in Germany and Poland, while an ectoine-based nasal spray for allergy relief is already available.\n\nBilstein said the inhaler could be useful around the world, as particulate air pollution is not just a European problem: \u201cEspecially in Asia \u2013 China in particular \u2013 the demand for such a product is even higher. I was in New York last week, and the air was also not very clean.\u201d\n\nThe protective effect of ectoine was discovered by Prof Jean Krutmann and colleagues at the Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine, while investigating whether the molecule could protect skin against sun damage. Bitop funded a series of studies, now published in prominent scientific journals.\n\n\u201cThe point that it can prevent the lung inflammation induced by ultrafine particles is established \u2013 there is no more doubt,\u201d Krutmann said. Antioxidants can also provide some protection but there has been controversy over the effectiveness of such food supplements, he said: \u201cPersonally, I think it is much better to eat lots of vegetables and fruit rather than taking any supplements.\u201d\n\nDr Richard Russell, a consultant respiratory physician in the NHS and medical advisor to the British Lung Foundation, who was not involved in the research, said the inhaler was both credible and promising: \u201cEctoine is a beautifully elegant molecule and it clearly works by helping water to stabilise, giving you a film of water in times of stress.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe work that has been published thus far, in credible, internationally recognised journals, show that this stuff has positive properties, protecting against triggered inflammation,\u201d he told the Guardian. Russell, who also lectures at Imperial College and Oxford University, said it might also be useful for the treatment of asthma, COPD and other lung diseases, not only prevention. \u201cIt could potentially do so much more. It is actually quite exciting and there is clearly a lot more to come from this story.\u201d\n\nKrutmann said slashing air pollution remained paramount. \u201cIt is very nice to be able to protect people against the detrimental effects, but this should not be used as an argument that we can now stop working on reducing particulate [air pollution]. The best thing is that we have clean air because then we don\u2019t need any prophylactic treatment. But on the other hand we have to be realistic and in many countries you cannot just switch traffic overnight to electric cars and do other drastic things.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will take many more years, especially in countries like China, and I think there is an ethical need to provide something to the general population to protect them,\u201d he said.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There is a suggestion that all of us who live in cosmopolitan areas where particulate pollution is a problem will need to start and end our day with an ectoine inhaler or risk type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, COPD and a host of other maladies.\nAlso, the article should be mindful of statements such as the ones below, which may unintentionally incite fear in the public.\n\u201cOutdoor air pollution is a global health crisis that kills over 3 million people a year\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIn the UK, at least 40,000 people a year die prematurely from air pollution, with a cross-party committee of MPs calling it a \u201cpublic health emergency.\u201d\nThese types of statistics are, first of all, hard to wrap one\u2019s mind around.

The fact that it\u2019s not licensed for this has definitely kept doctors away.\u201d\n\nFor example, on Solvay Pharmaceutical\u2019s Web site for Omacor, www.solvay-omacor.com, the first question a user sees is, \u201cAre you a U.S. citizen?\u201d\n\nIf the answer is yes, the user is sent to a page where heart attacks are not mentioned. (In the United States, Omacor is licensed only to treat the small number of people with extremely high blood triglyceride levels.)\n\nSo community doctors do not learn how to use the drug. Lack of F.D.A. approval also means that insurers will not pay for treatment with Omacor. Approval from the agency for the use of the drug in heart disease is not expected soon.\n\nA study published last month in The Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine found that only 17 percent of family doctors were likely to prescribe fish oil to their patients, including patients who had suffered a heart attack. There was a great need, the authors concluded, to \u201cimprove awareness of this important advice.\u201d\n\nThe fact that fish oil is also sold as a nutritional supplement has made it harder for some doctors to regard it as a powerful drug, experts said.\n\n\u201cUsing this medicine is very popular here in Italy, I think partly because so many cardiologists in this country participated in the studies and were aware of the results,\u201d said Dr. Maria Franzosi, a researcher at the Mario Negri Institute in Milan. \u201cIn other countries, uptake may be harder because doctors think of it as just a dietary intervention.\u201d\n\nIn the largest study of fish oil \u2014 conducted more than a decade ago \u2014 Italian researchers from the Gissi Group (Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell\u2019Infarto), gave 11,000 patients one gram of prescription fish oil a day after heart attacks. After three years, the study found that the number of deaths was reduced by 20 percent and that the number of sudden deaths by 40 percent, compared with a control group.\n\nLater studies have continued to yield positive results, although some scientists say there are still gaps in knowledge.\n\nThis summer, a critical review of existing research in BMJ, The British Medical Journal, \u201ccast doubt over the size of the effect of these medications\u201d for the general population, said Dr. Roger Harrison, an author of the paper, \u201cbut still suggested that they might benefit some people as a treatment.\u201d\n\nDr. Harrison said he believed that people should generally increase their intake of omega-3 acids, best done by eating more fish.\n\nStill, he acknowledged that it was difficult to eat foods containing a gram of omega-3 acids each day. \u201cIf you ask me do I take omega-3 supplements every day, then, embarrassingly, the answer is yes,\u201d said Dr. Harrison, a professor at Bolton Primary Care Trust of the University of Manchester in England.\n\n\u201cI, too, am caught up in this hectic world where I have little time to shop and prepare the healthy foods I know I should be eating,\u201d he said.\n\nIt seems natural for Italy to be at the forefront of the fish oil trend and home to the largest clinical trials. Scientists have long noted that Mediterranean diets are salubrious for the heart and theorized that the high content of broiled and baked fish might be partly responsible.\n\nBut the landmark Gissi-Prevenzione trial of fish oil had methodological weaknesses: the patients treated with prescription fish oil pills were compared with untreated patients, rather than with patients given a dummy pill. This meant that, despite impressive results, the trial did not meet the F.D.A.\u2019s standards for approval. Yet by 2004, regulators in almost all European countries, including Spain, France and Britain, had approved Omacor for use in heart attack patients.\n\nMarylou Rowe, a spokeswoman for Reliant Pharmaceuticals, which owns the license for the drug in the United States, said that further trials of Omacor would be needed for it to be licensed for heart attack patients in the United States. But she refused to discuss a timetable.\n\nThe American College of Cardiology now advises patients with coronary artery disease to increase their consumption of omega-3 acids to one gram a day, but it does not specify if this should be achieved by eating fish or by taking capsules. But over-the-counter preparations of fish oil have much less rigorous quality control and are often blends of the two fish oils know to be beneficial in heart disease with other less useful fatty acids.\n\nFor that reason, Dr. Jacobson of Emory gives the prescription drug, \u201coff label,\u201d to cardiac patients, even though the F.D.A. has not approved it for that use. \u201cThen I know exactly what they\u2019re getting, and there is no mercury,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he tells patients who cannot afford the prescription version that they can take the over-the-counter supplements, although there is uncertainty about the dose and they probably need three to four pills a day.\n\nIn Europe, meanwhile, research on prescription fish oil, which is now thought to act by stabilizing cell membranes, has gained momentum.

MicroRNAs influence protein activities throughout the body, and they are easily measured in biofluids, including blood, cerebrospinal fluid and saliva, according to the authors.\n\nDr. Steve Hicks, senior author of the study and an assistant professor of pediatrics at Penn State College of Medicine, said the \"five microRNAs in saliva could predict with approximately 85% accuracy which concussed children would have symptoms one month later. In comparison, standard survey measures that are typically used in clinics were approximately 65% accurate.\"\n\nThe study was funded in part by Quadrant Biosciences, a biotech company that hopes to bring a saliva test for concussion to market in the next 12 to 24 months, Hicks said.\n\n\"It's frustrating for both parents and physicians that we can't accurately and objectively predict how long a child's concussion symptoms might last, what those symptoms are likely to consist of and when it might be safe for them to return to sports or school,\" said Hicks, who, as a practicing pediatrician, has routinely cared for kids with concussions.\n\nFor the study, Hicks and his co-authors looked at 52 patients between the ages of 7 and 21, with an average age of 14.\n\nMicroRNA expression was measured in saliva spit into a cup by the patients, who had been injured mostly in sports or car accidents, when they arrived at Penn State Hershey Medical Center for an evaluation. Of the 52, 30 had prolonged symptoms and 22 had short-term symptoms of mild traumatic brain injury.\n\n\"We found three microRNAs that were highly associated with specific symptoms one month after injury, such as headache, fatigue and memory difficulties,\" Hicks said.

In the study, those who had used anti-inflammatory medications were the ones with longer-term symptoms.

One in 12 people had asthma in 2009, compared with 1 in 14 in 2001, according to the CDC. There is no cure, but most people can control their symptoms, reduce the severity of their disease, and prevent asthma attacks by avoiding asthma triggers and correctly using prescribed medicines, such as steroid inhalers, the CDC says. There's much room for improvement, Shimoide says. He says it was accidentally discovered that kampo herbs could wipe out symptoms in many people while testing the ancient remedy against an allergic skin disorder known as atopic dermatitis. So his team studied 278 people with asthma who suffered daily symptoms of the disease. Of those, 52 were given standard treatment (typically an inhaled steroid and a bronchodilator), and 226 were treated with kampo herbs. Symptoms completely disappeared in 94% of patients taking kampo herbs after an average of 16 days, Shimoide says. In contrast, about three-fourths of those taking standard asthma medications still had daily wheeze and other symptoms.\n\nThe study did not look at possible side effects of kampo herbs. But a major problem facing kampo medicine is herbal product quality. There have been cases in which poisonous plants found their way into the herbal mix, resulting in kidney damage, for example. In kampo medicine, most herbs are taken as a fixed formula. Each individual herb is thought to address a particular imbalance in an ill person. Herbs used in the current study include Scutellaria root, Coptis rhizome, gardenia fruit, hoelen, cinnamon bark, and Glycyrrhiza (aka licorice) root.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering at play.\u00a0 The story reported:\nThe number of people in the U.S. with asthma is growing.

Sometimes a heart attack or stroke is the very first symptom. About 750,000 Americans have a heart attack every year.\n\nDr. Charalambos Antoniades of Britain\u2019s University of Oxford and colleagues reported Wednesday that they have developed a new imaging method that detects inflamed fat cells as they are transforming into the inflamed, hardened plaques that clog up arteries.\n\n\u201cOur new method also allows detection of those small but inflamed artherosclerotic plaques in our heart arteries that are prone to rupture, therefore are about to cause a heart attack,\u201d Antoniades told reporters in a telephone briefing.\n\nIf the method holds up, doctors could start patients on drugs such as statins far earlier than they do now \u2014 in time to save them from ever developing serious heart disease, the researchers report in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\nRelated: New Test Detects Heart Disease Risk, Especially for Black Women\n\nIt\u2019s not just the fat cells that lead to heart disease, the No. 1 cause of death in the United State.

They measure cholesterol, blood pressure and heart rate, they test the electrical signals that keep the heart beating and they may also run imaging tests to check for clogged arteries.\n\nBut by the time a narrowed artery shows up on a standard scan, \u201cit's likely to be already too late to intervene and reverse the narrowing in the artery that has already occurred over many years,\u201d Channon said.\n\n\u201cBy detecting those individuals who don't have narrowing in their heart arteries, but they are in the process in developing them because the arteries are inflamed, we may be able to intervene early enough to prevent heart disease.\u201d\n\nThat's why surgeons do heart bypasses. They graft in a vein to bypass blood flow around the clogged part.\n\nRelated: Why Young Women are Having Heart Attacks\n\nThe team studied more than 450 people having heart bypass surgery, removing some of the fat clogging their arteries. They compared them to 270 more having angiograms to look for evidence of clogged arteries.\n\nThey found a way to identify which layers of fat were inflamed and unstable by looking at the size and shape of the cells using computed tomography (CT) scans.\n\n\u201cWe are now further validating our method in larger numbers of patients in large prospective clinical studies to document and confirm the predictive value of this method for future heart attacks,\u201d Antoniades said.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering here.

But an updated look at the study indicates that heart disease patients who follow this advice may actually increase their risk for death.\n\nThe original \"Sydney Diet Heart Study,\" was initially conducted between 1966 and 1973, at a time when the cholesterol-lowering benefits of all polyunsaturated vegetable acids (PUFAs) were touted with a broad brush.\n\nBut in the ensuing years, researchers have come to understand that not all PUFAs are alike, with key biochemical differences -- and perhaps varying cardiovascular impacts -- observed among multiple types of omega-3s (found in fish oils) and omega-6 linoleic acids.\n\n\"There is more than one type of polyunsaturated fatty acid,\" explained Dr. Christopher Ramsden, who headed the re-analysis and is a clinical investigator with the laboratory of membrane biophysics and biochemistry at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.\n\n\"And so, we were interested in trying to evaluate just one of these compounds, linoleic acid, by looking at this old trial using modern statistical methods, and also by re-including some original data that had gone missing from the first analysis,\" Ramsden explained.\n\nThe findings appeared online Feb. 5 in the BMJ.\n\nThe 458 male participants in the original study had been between the ages of 30 and 59 at enrollment, and all had a history of heart disease, with most having survived a heart attack.\n\nThe men were placed into two groups. The first group was told to consume linoleic acid, in the form of safflower oil and safflower oil polyunsaturated margarine, at levels equal to 15 percent of total calorie intake. This, said Ramsden, is equivalent to roughly twice the amount that Americans currently consume.\n\nWhile omega-3 consumption was not affected, the men were also asked to lower their saturated fat intake so that it made up less than 10 percent of their diets. They did so by substituting safflower oil for animal fats, common margarines and shortening oils, salad dressings, baked goods and other products, according to the study.\n\nThe second group continued their routine nutritional habits, and both groups kept food diaries and underwent regular assessments during the three-year-plus study period.\n\nBy newly crunching all the original data the NIH team found that, compared to the no-dietary-change group, the linoleic acid group faced a higher risk of death, from both heart disease specifically as well as from all causes overall.\n\nIn turn, Ramsden's investigators included their Sydney conclusions in a new review of all studies to date exploring the impact of omega-6 consumption.\n\nDespite the fact the American Heart Association (AHA) currently recommends that 5 percent to 10 percent of all calories come from polyunsaturated fat (principally from omega-6), the NIH team found no evidence to support the notion that linoleic acid confers health benefits. The review highlighted the possibility that boosting omega-6 consumption may actually increase the risk for developing heart disease.\n\nRamsden acknowledged that the Sydney study had been narrowly focused on a specific group of people: middle-aged men with a history of heart disease, who were asked to consume linoleic acid in quantities far exceeding both AHA guidelines and the dietary habits of most Americans.\n\n\"So, yes, one of the limitations of this kind of study is always the question of its generalizability to other populations,\" he cautioned.\n\nBut he also suggested that his team's rigorous look back offered valuable insights into how nutritional science has evolved.\n\n\"What to many people had at one time seemed pretty straightforward in the 1960s has turned out to form a much less black-and-white picture,\" he said. \"Polyunsaturates are not just involved in cholesterol-lowering. They may also be involved in inflammation, oxidation or clotting. So, it's a very complex picture. And though our goal is not to come up with diet advice, it may be that our conclusions will have important implications for nutritional guidelines.\"\n\nOn that score, American Heart Association spokesperson Penny Kris-Etherton, a registered dietician and professor of nutrition at Pennsylvania State University, suggested that the controversy concerning linoleic acid is not new and will continue.\n\n\"But I don't think this is going to change AHA recommendations,\" she said. \"Because there's very robust evidence showing the cardiovascular benefit of linoleic acid. The AHA science advisory board did not just look at one study or a couple of studies. There are lots of studies that form the basis for their guidelines.\"\n\n\"So, I don't think anybody should get alarmed and change their diet,\" Kris-Etherton said. \"Those who are concerned should wait for more research to come out on this topic before taking any drastic measures to change their eating habits in a way that could be harmful.\"\n\nFor more on AHA guidelines regarding linoleic acid, visit the American Heart Association.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There was no disease-mongering of heart disease.

Researchers predict early intervention in children will not only translate to a lifelong understanding of healthy habits but will also serve to encourage their parents to adopt healthier lifestyles.\n\nResearch has shown that unhealthy diets at a young age can contribute to cardiovascular disease later in life and that certain heart disease conditions can set in as early as 3 years old. Through the SI! Program, researchers in Madrid implemented a three-year healthy lifestyle intervention for 3 to 5 year olds that used their school, teachers and families to promote cardiovascular health through healthy diet, increased physical activity, understanding of the human body and managing emotions.\n\nOver 2,000 children in 24 Madrid public schools were followed during the program and exposed to the lifestyle intervention for three years, two years or one year depending on their age when the program began. Intervention materials included classrooms materials, take-home activities to do with their families and activities organized within the school's annual health fair. Students were assessed by pediatric psychologists at the start of the program and again annually for three years with a questionnaire to determine their knowledge, attitude and habits toward diet, physical activity and the human body.\n\n\"There is a need for a complete change in the timing of when we deliver care,\" said Valentin Fuster, M.D., Ph.D., senior author of the paper. \"Until now, the clinical community has focused on cardiovascular disease, which typically manifests in the later stages of life. Now, we need to focus our care in the opposite stage of life--we need start promoting health at the earliest years, as early as 3 to 5 years old, in order to prevent cardiovascular disease.\"\n\nChildren in the intervention group scored 5.5 percent higher on their knowledge, attitude and habits score than students not receiving intervention after the first year, 7.7 percent higher after the second year and 4.9 percent higher after the third year. Overall scores were influenced by the level of parental education and income, with the highest impact seen in families with at least a high school education and higher income. There was no difference in score based on parental age, but a higher impact in score was seen for children whose parents were of European origin.\n\nBody weight, height, waist circumference, skinfold thickness and BMI were also measured. The prevalence of obesity among children at the end of three years was 1.1 percent in the group receiving intervention compared to 1.3 percent in the control group. The total of overweight children was 7 percent in the intervention group and 7.4 percent in the control group. The largest positive changes in body fat were seen in the 3-year-old group that received three years of interventions. Interventions less than two years were not successful at reducing body fat.\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, Deepak L. Bhatt, M.D., M.P.H., executive director of interventional cardiovascular programs at Brigham and Women's Hospital Heart and Vascular Center and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said the program is groundbreaking, and follow-up studies to further pinpoint the exact mechanisms by which the program achieved positive effects on young children's health will be vital for implementing the program in other areas and informing the design of future global programs.\n\n\"It may not only be the cardiovascular health information from the program that is helpful but also the cognitive stimulation from and exposure to positive adult role models, which in turn influence personality traits critical for health behavior and habits,\" Bhatt said. \"This pioneering study represents a very important step in exploring the intersection of child development, cardiovascular health promotion and primordial prevention.

The study, funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), appears in the December 28 issue of JAMA Cardiology.\n\nFenofibrate is primarily used to help reduce elevated levels of triglycerides, or fat, in the blood. But the researchers wanted to know if the drug, when combined with statin treatment, could also reduce the risk of heart disease in people with type 2 diabetes. People with type 2 diabetes are at high risk of cardiovascular-related events, such as heart attacks, stroke, and even death, often because their levels of triglycerides are so high, and their high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels are low.\n\nTo answer their question, the researchers followed 4,640 participants from the NHLBI-funded Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Lipid Study for five years after the conclusion of the trial in 2009. The findings suggest that fenofibrate therapy may be beneficial in the way the researchers hoped: by reducing cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes who take statins but still have especially high triglycerides levels and low HDL cholesterol levels.

But when they\u2019re linked to a practice that started in Finland decades ago to help babies sleep safely, they\u2019re taking on a new purpose as so-called baby boxes make their way to the U.S.\n\nParents are beginning to take baby boxes home from hospitals along with their newborns. A Los Angeles-based company has partnered with health officials to give the boxes away for free and an online initiative offers advice aimed at reducing sudden unexpected infant deaths. New Jersey and Ohio were the first to participate statewide in the program.\n\n\u2018\u2018To new moms: (SUID) was one of my biggest fears and then it happened,\u2019\u2019 said 35-year-old Chauntia Williams, of Maple Heights, Ohio.\n\nWilliams is an advocate for safe sleeping and the boxes after she unexpectedly lost her 33-day-old daughter Aaliyah nine years ago. Williams said her daughter went to sleep in a crib with cushiony bumpers, stuffed animals and an added blanket beneath the fitted sheet and never woke up. She said the coroner determined the bedding caused the death.\n\nShe now uses a box with her son, Bryce, though he\u2019s getting a little too big for it. Her message to new parents: Educate yourselves on safe sleep habits.\n\n\u2018\u2018Open your mouth and say I\u2019m concerned about this so you can get the assistance,\u2019\u2019 Williams said.\n\nSudden unexpected infant death is a broad category that includes sudden infant death syndrome and accidental suffocation and strangulation that could come from overcrowded bassinets or cribs. The boxes aren\u2019t the only option for safe sleeping, of course, but health officials say they\u2019re a useful part of a broader safe-sleep education program.\n\nOhio on Wednesday joined New Jersey in offering the cardboard boxes, which double as bassinets, for free. Each box comes filled with a mattress, fitted sheet, onesie and diapers.\n\nThe Baby Box Co. is also handing out the boxes in Minneapolis, Phoenix and San Francisco, with the goal of expanding to all 50 states. The for-profit company also operates in Canada, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Baby Box University, Baby Box Co.\u2019s educational platform, maintains a website that coordinates the educational component of the program.\n\nThe idea for baby boxes started in Finland in the 1930s, and is tied to a sharp drop in sudden infant deaths, according to Dr. Kathryn McCans, a pediatrician who chairs New Jersey\u2019s Child Fatality and Near Fatality Review Board. The boxes provide a clutter-free sleep space that has been shown to reduce accidental and unexpected deaths, she said.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the U.S. rate of sudden unexpected infant deaths has been declining since the 1990s when public health officials began recommending parents put infants to sleep on their backs. About 3,700 sudden unexpected infant deaths were reported in the country in 2015.\n\nThe boxes are a new idea for many Americans.\n\n\u2018\u2018The thought of putting the baby in a box, I was like \u2018wow that\u2019s weird,\u2019\u2019\u2019 said Dolores Peterson, of Camden, New Jersey, who became a first-time mom recently and was among the first to bring home a box.\n\nPeterson\u2019s daughter, Ariabella, just turned 3 months old. She said the program was eye-opening for how much information she learned about how to prevent sudden unexpected infant death.\n\nMcCans says the complimentary items like diapers and onesies are nice, but the more important objective behind the boxes is bringing down infant deaths and grounding parents on safe sleep practices: Place babies on their backs to sleep; Don\u2019t use bumpers in cribs; Keep stuffed animals and blankets out of infants\u2019 sleep spaces; Avoid sleeping in the same bed as infants.\n\n\u2018\u2018No one brings their baby into bed with them because they want their baby to die,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018They do it because they want to be nurturing and they are, but it\u2019s not safe.\u2019\u2019\n\nTo get the boxes, prospective moms can register through babyboxuniversity.com, watch a handful of videos on sleep safety and pass a quiz.

The participants were randomly assigned to participate in either a health education class about heart-friendly diet and exercise, or to attend a transcendental meditation program. Transcendental meditation involves shutting out the outside world and focusing thoughts inward, or resting while remaining alert. All of the participants continued to receive their normal medical care as well, including appropriate medication.\n\nMORE: Medical Meditation: Say Om Before Surgery\n\nAfter roughly five years of follow-up, the researchers found a 48% reduction in the overall risk of heart attack, stroke, and death from any cause among members of the meditation group compared to those from the health education group. The meditating group enjoyed an average drop of 4.9 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure compared to the control group and also reported less stress and less anger. \u201cIt\u2019s like discovering a whole new class of medications,\u201d Schneider says of the power of meditation in improving the patients\u2019 health.\n\nBut while the magnitude of those results is remarkable, the study involved a relatively small number of participants, and did not reveal how meditation may be lowering heart disease risk. On the surface, it\u2019s intuitively obvious that stress management can affect heart health for the better; anxiety and stress cause blood pressure to shoot up and leave us on edge, triggering spikes in heart-harming stress hormones like cortisol.\n\nBut many experts are skeptical of the alleged benefits of techniques such as transcendental meditation that claim to reduce stress by a substantial amount. In the past, these benefits have been hard to test scientifically, largely because study participants who volunteered for meditation programs may have been biased to see them succeed. Practitioners have also made strong and essentially unsubstantiated claims about the powers of meditation, leading heart experts and scientists to be especially skeptical. In fact, in 2005, more than 500 brain researchers signed a petition (albeit an unsuccessful one) to protest a scheduled lecture on the neuroscience of meditation by the Buddhist spiritual icon, the Dalai Lama, at a major conference organized by the Society for Neuroscience.\n\nMORE: Mind Over Matter: Can Zen Meditation Help You Forget About Pain?\n\nThe great lengths to which the researchers of the Circulation study went to make their trial scientifically rigorous, however, should reinforce the results in the eyes of some skeptics. The scientists adjusted for the effects of weight, smoking behavior, and diet, all of which can influence heart attack, stroke and early heart death rates. And while the participants in both groups exercised more and cut back on alcohol during the study, they did so at similar rates, making these changes unlikely to be responsible for the differences in health outcomes either.\n\nWhile the findings aren\u2019t likely to resolve questions over whether meditation should become a standard part of heart disease care, the results should give more doctors confidence in discussing the practice with their patients and giving them some scientifically based information that\u2019s an improvement over the advice that \u201cit can\u2019t hurt to try.\u201d", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease-mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Britain\u2019s 650,000 people with bipolar disorder should take lithium to help control their condition, despite its reputation for dulling the senses, a significant new study has found.\n\nResearchers claim that although the drug does carry some health risks, its overall effectiveness, especially its ability to reduce self-harm and suicide, mean it should be much more widely used.\n\nThe findings are contained in the first study comparing the side-effects of the four main mood-stabilising drugs the NHS prescribes. They have prompted calls for a rethink about attitudes towards lithium, given that only an estimated 10% of those with bipolar disorder use it, mainly because patients fear it will cause loss of personality, weight gain and other problems.\n\nThe lead author behind the research told the Guardian that widespread \u201clithium stigma\u201d among patients is leading to them receiving the wrong treatment and ending up admitted to hospital unnecessarily because their condition is not as well controlled as it could be.\n\n\u201cLithium is a drug with a bad reputation. It is seen by patients, and some psychiatrists, as a dangerous drug. People rightly have suspicions about it. Patients say that the downsides include emotional numbing \u2013 feeling that you aren\u2019t connected with your feelings \u2013 as well as tremors,\u201d said Dr Joseph Hayes, a psychiatrist at University College London.\n\nBut lithium\u2019s reputation is largely misplaced and based on the experiences of patients from the 1960s to the 1980s who were given too large a dose of the drug, he added. The new research, published in the medical journal PLOS Medicine, found that the side-effects of the mood-stabilising alternatives used by most patients are either the same as or worse than lithium, Hayes said.\n\nThe paper, co-written by Hayes and four colleagues from UCL and Oxford University, concluded that: \u201cLithium remains an important treatment for individuals with bipolar disorder.\u201d It accepts that \u201cthere is clear evidence that its use is associated with a number of adverse events.\u201d\n\nHowever, it adds: \u201cThese risks need to be offset with the potentially superior effectiveness and anti-suicidal benefits of the drug compared to other treatment options.\u201d\n\nThe researchers studied a nationally representative sample of 6,671 patients across the UK who were treated for bipolar disorder between 1995 and 2013. Of those, 2,148 had taken lithium, 1,670 had used valproate, 1,477 had been on olanzapine and 1,376 had taken quetiapine. They experienced side-effects including chronic kidney disease, thyroid disease, weight gain and high blood pressure.\n\nThe researchers\u2019 analysis bore out one of the two main criticisms of lithium, but found the other to be baseless. They found that patients on lithium had a higher risk of suffering kidney function problems and developing hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism and also hypercalcemia. However, none of the drugs caused more severe kidney problems.\n\nMeanwhile, lithium patients were less likely to put on weight than patients on the other drugs. While 15%-20% of those on the three other drugs were more likely to gain more than 15% of their body weight, just 10% of those on lithium put on the same amount of extra pounds. Those on olanzapine added the most weight and experienced high blood pressure as a result.\n\nSeparate research has shown that patients on the other three medications are 40% more likely to harm themselves than those on lithium. Bipolar disorder carries one of the highest rates of suicide of any mental illness, alongside schizophrenia and alcohol and drug addiction.\n\nThe very limited use of lithium is despite the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) advising in 2014 that it should be the standard treatment for bipolar disorder, which is also known as manic depression and is characterised by manic highs and bouts of depression. That superseded its previous view, outlined in 2006, that any of the four drugs were useful first lines of treatment for the condition, which affects about one in 100 people.\n\n\u201cLithium stigma, which includes some people in the psychiatric community, leads to people using drugs that are less effective [than lithium]. To me as a doctor that\u2019s a big worry because my main aim is to help people to be well and if you aren\u2019t doing that with the best available evidence then you are failing patients,\u201d said Hayes.\n\n\u201cI think that many patients are missing out quite commonly on the best available treatment. That means that people end up in hospital more often than they need to and end up achieving less in their lives than they could do if they were on lithium. The high suicide rate with bipolar disorder should encourage greater use of lithium. There should be more sensible use of it.\u201d\n\nStephen Buckley, head of information at the charity Mind, said: \u201cWe welcome research which adds to our understanding of treatments and medications for people experiencing mental health problems, including bipolar disorder. But as with all areas of mental health there is still more research to be done.\n\n\u201cDifferent people will find that different treatments help with managing their mental health problems.

Not long after, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.\n\n\"Fast forward now, and my entire right side is pretty much paralyzed and my left side is weakening,\" Stecker says.\n\nStecker is now confined to a wheelchair, from where he writes a blog about his disease, called Wheelchair Kamikaze.\n\nMore than a year ago, Stecker started writing about a theory Italian physician Paolo Zamboni proposed in 2008 called chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency, or CCSVI.\n\nIt's been thought that multiple sclerosis is caused by a misguided immune system that attacks the nerves of the brain and spinal cord and can lead to muscle weakness, paralysis and death. However, Zamboni suggests that the disease instead is the result of blocked blood veins \u2014 leading to inflammation, which, in turn, causes the immune system to attack nerves in the brain and spinal cord.\n\nZamboni proposed that treating it may be as simple as opening them up. Stecker was hopeful.\n\n\"Because my disease is so aggressive, I have been very willing to be equally aggressive in trying to combat it,\" Stecker says.\n\nTo clear the veins, his doctor tried opening them with a tiny balloon. Zamboni calls it \"the liberation procedure\" but it is actually a common technique known as angioplasty when it's used to open clogged arteries \u2014 not veins.\n\n\"At first, I was very skeptical. But anecdotal reports started coming through of almost miraculous results from it.\u2026So, I decided, you know, hey it was worth a shot,\" Stecker says.\n\nBut it didn't work. Although the doctor who treated him in New York found a significant blockage, he was unable to correct it, Stecker says.\n\nStill, some would say Stecker was lucky. Many desperate patients have spent their life savings flying overseas to have the procedure, only to have it fail a few months later. Others elect to have tiny metal tubes, known as \"stents,\" placed in the veins to hold them open and have suffered serious complications, including life-threatening blood clots. Several patients have even died as a result.\n\nStecker says if he had it to do over again, he would have waited for more research. But he says he was eager to try something that offered him the first real glimmer of hope for a cure.\n\n\"CCSVI equals hope and a lot of MS patients just are completely devoid of hope,\" Stecker says. \"People don't want to have MS. They want to go back to who they used to be. You know, along comes this theory that offers an easy-to-understand solution, so it's very, very, very seductive.\"\n\nIt's so seductive, in fact, that Canadians and Americans with MS have been flocking overseas to get the \"liberation procedure.\" Something that many researchers find very troubling. Robert Zivadinov of the Buffalo Neuroimaging Analysis Center in New York says that not only is the procedure unsafe and costly to many patients, it is impeding necessary research.\n\n\"Even if the treatment is not useful for patients with MS, I don't think that we can abandon the idea of vascular involvement in MS,\" Zivadinov says. \"And I think this merits very detailed understanding of what is going on.\"\n\nWhat is going on is still a bit of a mystery. Critics argue that although Zamboni's original research suggests a vascular cause for MS, other studies don't. These discrepancies, and growing public controversy, prompted the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in the U.S. and the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada to take Zamboni's claims seriously. They funded a number of independent studies to investigate the relationship between CCSVI and MS.\n\nRobert Fox, a neurologist at the Cleveland Clinic, currently oversees one of the studies funded by an MS Society grant. He says part of the confusion comes from variations in how CCSVI is measured.\n\n\"That's absolutely one of the potential problems in the previous studies: Are the techs who got negative results, did they just not know how to do the ultrasound in the way that Dr. Zamboni described doing the ultrasound? And that's a very important issue,\" Fox says.\n\nFox says he sent his technicians to a special training to learn how to properly measure the veins because it's not something most technicians ever do.\n\nMeanwhile in Buffalo, Zivadinov says his research on CCSVI already shows a clear picture emerging.\n\n\"CCSVI is not the cause of MS but might be a consequence or a contributing factor to progression, and I think that has to be studied,\" Zivadinov says.\n\nStudying how the vascular system is involved in neurologic disease is an entirely new concept, Zivadinov says. One that may have an impact beyond any single disease.\n\n\"What professor Zamboni discovered in terms of veins is something much bigger than multiple sclerosis,\" Zivadinov says. \"We need to understand the role of the venous system in the pathology of central nervous diseases and aging.\"\n\nZamboni himself says that even if it turns out he's wrong, coming to a greater understanding of the disease would be the big reward \u2014 both for him and thousands of MS patients.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "Although there was no overt disease-mongering, the story focuses exclusively on the story of a patient who had an aggressive case of the disease.

A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended last month that children under the age of 6 not be given over-the-counter cough and cold medicines.\n\nFor the study, 105 children ages 2-18 with upper respiratory tract infections that kept them awake at night were given either a dose of buckwheat honey, honey-flavored cough syrup or no treatment half an hour before bedtime.\n\nOne dose measured one-half teaspoon for children aged 2-5, one teaspoon for children aged 6-11 and two teaspoons for children aged 12-18.\n\nParents of the 35 children who received honey, given either on its own or with a non-caffeinated drink, reported they coughed less and slept better than those who gave their children nothing. The group that used honey also reported more favorable results than those who used cough syrup, but since the study group was small, those differences weren't statistically significant.\n\nOne local pediatrician said she wouldn't discourage parents from trying honey with their children, but more studies are needed to draw solid conclusions.\n\n\"In older children, if it makes them comfortable and it helps them sleep at night, then there may be a potential benefit,\" said Dr. Sara Rizvi, assistant professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine who also works at a primary care clinic at Texas Children's Hospital. \"I would be reluctant to routinely recommend to all parents that they give honey, because in some rare cases children can have reactions to honey.\"\n\nPaul, a pediatrician who practices at Penn State Children's Hospital and teaches at the university's College of Medicine, said he began the study because he was frustrated no treatment had been proven beneficial to relieve the common children's cough. Several years ago, he led another study that showed over-the-counter cough medicine was no more effective than placebos.\n\nHoney is not only cheap and readily available, it's also generally safer than cough medicine, which can have side effects or be administered in the wrong dose.\n\nHoney should not, however, be given to children under the age of 1 because it sometimes contains a bacteria that causes botulism, a rare paralytic illness that can result in death. Unlike older children, infants can't fight the bacteria.\n\nPaul's group tested buckwheat honey instead of the lighter, more popular varieties because it's known to have more antioxidant and antimicrobial effects, which have been shown in other studies to help wounds heal. Honey may suppress cough because its sweetness causes salivation that coats the throat, authors of the study suggested.\n\n\"It's kind of amazing that something so simple could be an answer,\" Paul said.\n\nThe study was paid for by the National Honey Board, an industry-funded agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

But only about 1 percent of the population has an autoimmune response to gluten. Somewhere in that gap, a diet fad is thriving.\n\nThere are two groups of people who should definitely avoid gluten: those diagnosed with wheat allergies and those who have celiac disease. The latter is more common, affecting about 1 percent of the population. The former affects perhaps 0.1 percent of people and is more common in children, who often grow out of it.\n\nWhat is less clear is whether there is another group of individuals whose digestive systems have some \u201cgluten sensitivity\u201d and who would, therefore, benefit from avoiding gluten. The people who think they\u2019re sensitive to gluten are filling the gap between those who should avoid gluten and those who are doing it anyway. But how many people really are sensitive?\n\nGluten, for those of you who have not kept up with dietary fads, is a component of wheat. You eat it in bread, pasta, pizza and so on. Gluten-avoiders are helped by an increasing array of gluten-free breads, pastas and other products. Entire aisles of Whole Foods Market stores appear to be devoted to this trend.\n\nDespite the growing availability of alternative products, avoiding gluten can be a challenge. The satisfying, slightly chewy texture of bread requires gluten. For those of us who care about our health but, let\u2019s face it, like a nice baguette, it seems worth asking: Is there any actual health benefit to gluten avoidance?\n\nThe earliest report on whether gluten could muck with some digestive tracts comes from the late 1970s. Two authors reported on a woman in her early 40s who was experiencing significant \u201cgastrointestinal distress\u201d (bloating, gas, diarrhea, constipation, etc.) and did not have celiac disease or a wheat allergy. After being put on a gluten-free diet, she improved immediately. When gluten was reintroduced to her diet as a test, the symptoms returned, only to disappear when the gluten was again removed. The authors diagnosed the woman with what they termed \u201cnon-celiac gluten sensitivity\u201d (NCGS).\n\nGluten sensitivity fell off the radar for many years, but researchers have returned to it and adopted the same term. In contrast to celiac disease or a wheat allergy, NCGS is not diagnosed through direct testing. Rather, it refers to a condition in which someone experiences some problematic gastrointestinal symptoms that resolve when gluten is avoided. Gastrointestinal symptoms are the hallmark of NCGS \u2014 although some people also complain of fatigue or a foggy head.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s difficult to distinguish between someone who is sensitive to gluten and someone who is sensitive to the placebo effect. Since there is no test for gluten sensitivity, \u201cdiagnoses\u201d are based on whether people say they feel better when they avoid gluten. But the mind is a powerful thing. If you think avoiding gluten will make you feel better, there is a reasonable chance that it will \u2014 even if gluten is irrelevant.\n\nThis effect makes it hard to test for gluten sensitivities even in a randomized controlled trial. If a researcher enrolls people in a standard randomized controlled trial and has some participants eat bread and some not, those who avoid bread may feel better simply because they think they should. The placebo effect may lead a researcher to falsely conclude that avoiding bread is beneficial.\n\nBut that\u2019s not enough. To really get a sense of whether gluten sensitivity is a thing, researchers need to conduct a double-blind randomized controlled trial in which one group eats gluten, another does not, and no one knows which group they are in. That means putting everyone on a gluten-free diet and then directly supplementing some people with gluten protein and others with something that seems similar but has no gluten.\n\nThere have been two small studies like this. They were run by the same team. And, unfortunately for our ability to draw conclusions, they find different results. The first of these, published in 2011, followed 34 people for up to six weeks. The study population was made up of people who complained of gastrointestinal symptoms consistent with NCGS.\n\nEveryone participating in the study was on a gluten-free diet. Half had their diet supplemented with a regular muffin and regular bread; the other half received a gluten-free muffin and gluten-free bread. The authors found that 40 percent of patients on the entirely gluten-free diet reported a continuation of symptoms, compared with 68 percent of those who had consumed gluten. The groups also differed on such measures as \u201csatisfaction with stool consistency,\u201d a phrase that I honestly never thought I would write.\n\nThe second study, published in 2013, had a similar set up \u2014 37 people complaining of gastrointestinal problems, randomized into high-gluten, low-gluten and no-gluten groups. This time, rather than using bread and muffins, the authors used gluten and whey protein supplements. They found no difference in symptoms among the groups.\n\nWhy the results of these studies differ is unclear. One possibility is that some participants in the first study guessed which group they were in based on the muffin and bread and therefore the placebo effect became pronounced. Another possibility is simply that given how small the studies were, the differences occurred by chance. Regardless of the reason, we are left with little convincing evidence that gluten avoidance matters.\n\nBut let\u2019s say you take heart in the first of these studies and now believe that avoiding gluten will make some people feel better even though they don\u2019t have an allergy or celiac disease. How many people? Estimates of prevalence of NCGS are based, more or less, on information on gluten avoidance. In the 2009-10 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, about 0.6 percent of people without celiac disease or an allergy say their diet is gluten-free. And in a large Italian study of people who complain of gastrointestinal problems, the authors conclude that NCGS is slightly more common than celiac disease, putting it at a prevalence of a bit above 1 percent of the population.\n\nFor those of you keeping track at home, that means that while 30 percent of Americans are trying to cut gluten from their diet, probably at most only 1 percent of Americans may have NCGS.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have celiac disease or a wheat allergy and are experiencing distressing gastrointestinal symptoms after eating gluten \u2014 lack of satisfaction with your stool consistency, for example \u2014 there is something like a 1 in 30 chance that the gluten is potentially responsible. If you cut out gluten and it makes you feel better, great. Although it may all be in your head.\n\nIf you are cutting out gluten for any other reason, all that will happen is you\u2019ll feel the same, but without the pleasure of bread that tastes like bread.\n\nCORRECTION (Feb. 12, 11:50 a.m.): An earlier version of this article incorrectly state that it is hard to test for gluten allergies. It\u2019s hard to test for gluten sensitivities. The previous version also misstated the probability that gluten is responsible for gastrointestinal distress for those who experience gastrointestinal distress after consuming gluten and who don\u2019t have celiac disease or a wheat allergy.

The research was led by Robert Langer, a prolific inventor who heads a biological engineering lab at MIT.\n\nWriting in the journal Nature Materials, the team said they searched databases for materials that were already on the market and recognized as safe that could take a whole new approach to skin care.\n\nBetty Yu, the company\u2019s principal scientist, earned her PhD in biochemistry and toxicology. She has studied how to deliver drugs into the skin and led efforts to develop hair care products. She wanted to move on to skin products.\n\nThey wanted something stretchy and strong that wouldn\u2019t pucker up when it dried on the skin and that would be breathable.\n\n\u201cIt has to have the right optical properties, otherwise it won\u2019t look good, and it has to have the right mechanical properties, otherwise it won\u2019t have the right strength and it won\u2019t perform correctly,\u201d Langer said.\n\n\u201cCreating a material that behaves like skin is very difficult,\u201d added Dr. Barbara Gilchrest, a dermatologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital who worked on the study.\n\n\u201cMany people have tried to do this, and the materials that have been available up until this have not had the properties of being flexible, comfortable, nonirritating, and able to conform to the movement of the skin and return to its original shape.\u201d\n\nThey screened about 100 compounds before settling on polysiloxane, a silicone-based gel. They call it a cross-linked polymer layer or XPL for short.\n\n\u201cIt works in two parts,\u201d Langer told NBC News. \u201cYou put on a primer layer, just kind of rub it in. Then you put on a second layer and rub that one in. There\u2019s cross-linking and it tightens it up.\u201d\n\nCross-linking is a well-understood process. Separate strands of material become stronger when they link up. \u201cVulcanization, used to make tires, is a cross-linking process,\u201d Langer said. \u201cRubber alone would not be that strong.\u201d\n\nIn this case, the catalyst is platinum-based and it turns the gel into a thin, stretchy sheet. There are hundreds of skin products that do this now, but this one sticks better and doesn\u2019t pucker the skin, the team reports.\n\nLight-scattering particles are added to the second layer, and they reflect light off the skin, making it look clearer and smoother.\n\nLanger tried it on his arm. \u201cIt was almost like you couldn\u2019t see it. After a minute, I didn\u2019t know it was there,\u201d he said.\n\nThey ran four experiments on the product. In one, they applied it to the skin under the eyes of 25 volunteers. It lasted for 16 hours before it started peeling off, and smoothed out the eye bags that become so common as people age, they wrote.\n\n\u201cSuch a result has been previously achieved only by a lower lid blepharoplasty, an invasive surgical procedure,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThey demonstrate it in this video.\n\nThey also put tested at against petroleum jelly and regular moisturizer on 22 people with dry, flaky legs. The XPL lasted longer and helped keep the skin from losing moisture better than the petroleum jelly, which lasted better than moisturizer.\n\n\u201cThe results confirmed the XPL as a \u2018second skin\u2019 barrier that protects the skin from excessive moisture loss to the environment,\u201d they wrote.\n\n\u201cRepeated daily wear resulted in no report of irritation or other adverse events resulting from the XPL use. Furthermore, the XPL remained intact following activities such as swimming, running and exposure to rain,\u201d they added.\n\nThe stuff can just be peeled off, or taken off with makeup remover, the researchers said.\n\nDermatologist Dr. Jennifer Lucas of the Cleveland Clinic, who was not involved in the study, said she\u2019d have to see long-term results to make a judgment. \u201cConceptually, it\u2019s a great and novel idea,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cFor now, there is no magical cream that can make you look younger.\u201d\n\nOlivo will work first to develop the product to deliver drugs to the skin \u2013perhaps allergy or eczema medication, or long-lasting sunscreen, MIT said.

In this study, patients were given the drugs within 4.5 hours after the onset of a stroke, Campbell said.\n\nAlthough tenecteplase appears to be more effective for stroke patients, it's not approved for that use in the United States, according to Dr. Rohan Arora, director of stroke at Long Island Jewish Hospital in Forest Hills, N.Y.\n\nIn 2000, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved tenecteplase for use after a heart attack, Arora said.\n\n\"Tenecteplase is being widely used in developing countries, such as India,\" he said. \"One reason is it's cheaper than alteplase.\"\n\nIn the United States, tenecteplase costs about $5,800, versus alteplase, which costs $8,000, Arora said.\n\nIn addition, tenecteplase is easier to give, requiring only a single injection, while alteplase requires an injection and an IV drip, he added.\n\nArora explained that tenecteplase is not widely used in the United States for heart attack patients because these patients are typically treated with angioplasty or heart bypass surgery.\n\nFor the new study, which did not receive drug company funding, Campbell and his colleagues randomly assigned 202 stroke patients to either alteplase or tenecteplase before surgery to remove clots.\n\nThe researchers specifically looked to see which drug was better at restoring blood flow to clot-blocked blood vessels in the brain, and which drug resulted in patients having better outcomes.\n\nThe investigators found that 22 percent of the patients treated with tenecteplase had more than 50 percent of blood flow return to the brain, compared with 10 percent of those treated with alteplase.\n\nPatients treated with tenecteplase also had better functional outcomes after 90 days than those given alteplase, the findings showed.\n\nBleeding into the brain, the most serious side effect of either drug, occurred in 1 percent of patients, regardless of which drug they received, Campbell said.\n\nThe report was published April 26 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nFor more on stroke, visit the National Stroke Association.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease-mongering here.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation is gaining acceptance since it came on the market four years ago.

This week, specialty insurance administrator Magellan Behavioral Health Inc. issued medical necessity guidelines for TMS treatment and will provide coverage effective Jan. 1.\n\nDoctors who use the NeuroStar TMS Therapy system say treatments are more effective than medications with far fewer side effects. It's an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy \u2014 shock treatments \u2014 for patients who have not responded to drugs or psychotherapy. But TMS is expensive. It can cost as much as $400 for a 37-minute session and require multiple treatments. The total bill can range between $8,000 and $12,000.\n\nThe cost, however, is less than an extended hospital stay.\n\n\"We had several patients who were headed toward the hospital, who had this treatment and were able to avoid that,\" said Dr. Scott West, a psychiatrist who pioneered the treatment in Nashville 2 and one-half years ago.\n\nThe NeuroStar system resembles a dentist's chair. A patient sits in the chair while a magnetic pulse emitter transmits energy from a levered arm \u2014 a process similar to undergoing dental X-rays. The device makes a clicking noise while delivering the magnetic pulses.\n\n\"When this large magnet pulses repetitively, it causes an electromagnetic field which then passes through the skull and stimulates the brain tissue itself,\" said West, explaining a cascading effect that results in the interior nerve fibers connecting better.\n\nDr. Michelle Cochran, purchased her TMS system about 18 months ago. The devices cost around $100,000, Cochran said, who has treated 45 patients with the therapy.\n\n\"Most people are not scared of it,\" she said. \"It sounds sort of creepy and weird when you think about it, but for the most part, it is safer in general than taking a medicine. You've got less seizure risk than taking a medicine. You've got less side effects than taking a medicine.\"\n\nBoth Cochran and West cite high patient response rates. A clinical trial funded by the National Institutes of Health revealed a \"significant effect of treatment\" when patients received TMS treatment. It compared outcomes of patients who actually received the magnetic pulses against patients in a \"sham\" group, who sat down in the treatment chair for fake sessions.\n\nDepressed patients who received the real TMS treatment had remission rates four times higher than those in the sham group.\n\nHowever, insurers, including UnitedHealthcare and BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, remain reluctant to embrace the treatment. UnitedHealthcare's medical policy for TMS says it is unproven for treating depression.\n\n\"Generally speaking, just because a device, procedure or medication has been approved or is deemed to be safe by some entities does not mean that it is automatically covered,\" BlueCross BlueShield spokeswoman Kelly Allen said. \"Quality and safety are our first priority in setting our medical policy, but those have to be balanced with affordability.\"\n\nCochran does not accept Medicare and has chosen to be an out-of-network provider.

ALA is plant-based and found in such edible seeds as flaxseed and in oils, such as soy, canola and hemp oil. EPA and DHA are found in marine life, such as fish, algae and phytoplankton.\n\nPublished in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, the study involved feeding the different types of omega-3s to mice with a highly aggressive form of human breast cancer called HER-2. HER-2 affects 25per cent of women and has a poor prognosis.\n\nMa exposed the mice to either the plant-based or the marine-based omega-3s, beginning in utero.\n\n\"The mice were exposed to the different omega-3s even before tumours developed, which allowed us to compare how effective the fatty acids are at prevention,\" said Ma. \"It's known that EPA and DHA can inhibit breast tumour growth, but no one has looked directly at how effective these omega-3s are compared to ALA.\"\n\nMa found overall exposure to marine-based omega-3s reduced the size of the tumours by 60 to 70 per cent and the number of tumours by 30 per cent.\n\nHowever, higher doses of the plant-based fatty acid were required to deliver the same impact as the marine-based omega-3s.\n\nOmega-3s prevent and fight cancer by turning on genes associated with the immune system and blocking tumour growth pathways, said Ma.\n\n\"It seems EPA and DHA are more effective at this.

In Australia, it is the single leading cause of death in Australia, affecting 4.2 million Australians and killing one Australian every 12 minutes. Low-fat diets are often recommended as suitable food plans for those seeking to reduce their risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Similarly, the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) has been shown to deliver significant health benefits.\n\nIn this UniSA study, published by the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, researchers compared the health benefits of a MedDiet supplemented with two to three serves of dairy each day, and a generic low-fat diet.\n\nThe results show that the dairy-supplemented MedDiet (MedDairy) significantly improved blood pressure, heart rate, cholesterol, mood and cognitive function.\n\nPhD candidate Alexandra Wade says the new MedDairy diet challenges popular perceptions of what is considered healthy.\n\n\u201cThe MedDiet is fast earning a reputation as the world\u2019s healthiest diet and is renowned for delivering improved cardiovascular and cognitive health,\u201d Wade says.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s also higher in fat, which can be a deterrent for people seeking to adopt a healthier eating plan, especially if they don\u2019t realise the difference between healthy and unhealthy fats.\n\n\u201cIn Australia, low-fat diets are often recommended for improving heart health and they are still perceived as being healthy.\n\n\u201cThis study shows that the new MedDairy works better than a generic low-fat diet, ensuring better health outcomes for people at risk of cardiovascular disease.\u201d\n\nImportantly, the MedDairy diet also meets additional calcium requirements recommended by Australia\u2019s national health bodies.\n\nA typical MedDiet includes extra virgin olive oil, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, wholegrain breads, pastas and cereals, moderate consumption of fish and red wine, and low consumption of red meat, sweet and processed foods. It also includes 1-2 servings of dairy foods (700-820mg calcium), which is less than half the dairy recommended by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) for older Australians.\n\n\u201cLiving in Australia, we have different dietary requirements, notably a need for more calcium to protect against osteoporosis,\u201d Wade says.\n\n\u201cThese needs are unmet in the traditional MedDiet, which makes it difficult for people to adopt in the long term.\n\n\u201cThis study delivers healthier options for Australians by tailoring the nutrients in the MedDiet to meet the needs of a non-Mediterranean population.\n\n\u201cIn Australia, women up to age 50 years \u2013 and men up to age 70 years \u2013 should consume 1000mg per day of calcium per day and 1300mg thereafter, which is roughly between 3.5 and 4.5 serves a day.\n\n\u201cThe new MedDairy diet allows for three to four servings with dairy, which means Australians can more sustainably meet their recommended daily nutrient intakes while also maintaining the significant health benefits offered through the MedDiet.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes down to it, people want to be able to enjoy a colourful, tasty and nutritious diet.

Surgery, radiation, or some combination of both may lead to miserable side effects such incontinence, impotence and rectal damage. Doctors usually can\u2019t predict whether a man will suffer all or none of those side effects. While some risk factors are well-known -- including age, diabetes and poor cardiovascular health -- whether a man suffers harsh side-effects is often chalked up to random luck.\n\nSo what if it were possible to know before treatment which men might be more likely to suffer complications?\n\nNew research, published Thursday in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology, discovered a set of genetic markers that appear to indicate a significantly greater risk of collateral damage from radiation treatment for prostate cancer. Knowing a man\u2019s susceptibility to fallout from radiation may steer a doctor toward surgery instead of other potentially damaging therapy.\n\n\u201cMore often than not, it\u2019s not clear-cut which way to go,\u201d explained Barry Rosenstein, professor of radiation oncology at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. \u201cIf you see a surgeon, he\u2019s likely to say surgery is best. If you see a radiation oncologist he\u2019ll say oncology.\u201d\n\nDetermining what type of treatment a man should receive is only part of the dilemma of prostate cancer. The debate whether to even test for it is ongoing. This early-stage study represents a big step toward doctors and their patients making that decision.\n\nThe researchers started with a pool of 841 men treated with radiation for prostate cancer. Patients were assessed every three to six months for signs of sexual dysfunction for up to five years. The number of men studied was eventually winnowed down to 260 patients with erectile dysfunction and 205 controls.\n\nThe scientists then performed DNA analyses on the men, looking for genetic variations called single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs (pronounced snips), slight differences in the \u201cspelling\u201d of our DNA. After sifting through hundreds of thousands of SNPs, they settled on 12 suspect genetic variations.\n\nIt turned out that when the SNPs were combined to create a score that could be used to measure individual risk of treatment complications, having just one of the 12 SNPs more than doubled the risk. The more of the 12 a man had, the greater his chances of radiation therapy complications.\n\n\u201cIt is cumulative,\u201d Rosenstein explained. \u201cIf a man has five or six, it increases his chances quite a bit.\u201d\n\nThe research is still in the early stages, so doctors aren\u2019t likely to be using the genetic markers to determine treatment any time soon. \u201cThis is still not nearly good enough, yet\u201d he said.\n\nBut he\u2019s part of an international consortium that is trying to make that very scenario a practical reality. The next step, he said, is for group members to validate the predictive power of the markers his team found.\n\nIf they can, then doctors really will be \u201cable to assign patients to treatments and see if we maintain the same level of control of cancer and lower the incidence of complications,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if we can do that, then there\u2019ll be enough confidence to put it into use in the clinic.\u201d\n\nEven better, he suggested, it may one day be possible to use drugs to target the SNiPs, or the biological processes they influence, as a way to prevent damage from therapy.\n\nThat hope is evident to other researchers, such as Dr. Ithaar Derweesh, a urologic oncologist and associate professor of surgery at the University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center.\n\n\"This is a study that in certain ways is groundbreaking and also elegantly performed,\" Derweesh said.\n\nWhile Derweesh agreed with Rosenstein that such a technique will take time to validate, and be used to steer patients toward a particular therapy -- something he called the \"holy grail\" -- he suggested that in the nearer term, such markers might be used as a trigger to pre-emptively begin erectile rehabilitation or to take measures that might lessen the potential damage.\n\nThis kind of work is important not just for prostate cancer, but all cancers. While there has been greater success in treating cancer, survivors may live many years with side effects after treatment. If Rosenstein\u2019s hopes are fulfilled, it may one day be possible to prevent some of the damage before it\u2019s done, and still effectively treat the cancer.\n\nBrian Alexander (www.BrianRAlexander.com) is co-author, with Larry Young Ph.D., of \"The Chemistry Between Us: Love, Sex and the Science of Attraction,\" (www.TheChemistryBetweenUs.com), now on sale.\n\u2022 Pregnant women with cancer on the rise.

Artificial corneas are another option, but they're difficult to implant into the eye and can cause side effects, the researchers said.\n\nIn the new study, researchers tested corneal implants that are \"biosynthetic,\" meaning they're created with the help of living tissues. In this case, the corneas are produced with the help of human collagen -- a kind of protein -- that's grown in yeast. The mock corneas were then placed into the eyes of 10 patients after the diseased corneas were removed.\n\n\"We were pleasantly surprised that in six patients, vision improved from about 20/400 to 20/100, meaning that these patients could see objects four times farther away than before the operation,\" said Griffith, director of the Integrative Regenerative Medicine Center at Linkoping University in Sweden.\n\nThe researchers went one step further and gave contact lenses to the patients. With the lenses in place, they all had improved vision, Griffith said.\n\nWhy didn't they all get better vision immediately without the contact lenses? \"We believe that sutures used in this study resulted in roughness on the surface,\" Griffith said. \"The contact lenses compensated for the surface roughness, resulting in improved vision. We will use less disruptive sutures in our next clinical study, and this should correct this problem.\"\n\nAs for side effects, Griffith said the patients didn't report any pain or discomfort, and there were no signs that their bodies tried to reject the corneas, a risk that people face when they get transplanted organs.\n\nAs for cost, Griffith said the biosynthetic corneas \"in theory\" should be cheaper than donated corneas. Griffith said a German study recently found that donated corneas cost about $2,500.\n\nThe next step in research, Griffith said, is to create a \"new generation\" of cornea implants and test them on a wider variety of patients.\n\nThe study appears in the Aug. 25 issue of Science Translational Medicine.\n\nDr. Mark J.

(Oct. 29, 2015) - Rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is one of the most dramatic medical emergencies a person can face. It usually strikes without warning, killing approximately 50 percent of those who experience it before they reach a hospital. Of those who do get to a health facility alive, only about 50 percent survive. When diagnosed through screening, aortic aneurysms are carefully monitored for signs of enlargement, and surgical intervention often is needed to prevent rupture of the vessel. Now, University of Missouri researchers have found that patients who took cholesterol-lowering medications before endovascular surgery experienced fewer complications and better outcomes.\n\n\"Although this condition usually occurs in men older than 50 with a family history of the disease, anyone can have an abdominal aortic aneurysm,\" said Todd Vogel, associate professor and chief of the Division of Vascular Surgery at the MU School of Medicine, and lead author of the study. \"Most patients with this disease are older and tend to have other health conditions such as high cholesterol. In an effort to prevent cardiovascular disease they take statin medications. These cholesterol-lowering medications protect blood vessels from plaque formation and stress, and in some cases can even slow the progression of aortic aneurysms. We wanted to understand the impact statin use has on surgical outcomes when repairing this type of aneurysm.\"\n\nVogel's research team reviewed nearly 20,000 cases where patients either had open surgery or an endovascular repair - a minimally invasive procedure that uses a catheter to access the aneurysm. The team then identified patients who took cholesterol-lowering medication before surgery.\n\n\"Our research showed that patients who took statins before either open or minimally invasive interventions had better outcomes compared to those who did not take statin medications,\" Vogel said. \"The patients who took statins and had endovascular repairs had a 26 percent decrease in mortality up to one year after surgery. Patients who took statins and had traditional open procedures also did better, but the difference was not nearly as significant as with endovascular repair. The bottom line is that patients who used statins were more likely to survive during and after an elective endovascular procedure.\"\n\nAdditionally, the study showed that statin use also reduced post-surgical complications for patients with other health issues such as peripheral artery disease, a condition that causes arterial blockages of blood vessels in the limbs.\n\n\"This information could be beneficial to patients who are about to have elective endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair,\" Vogel said. \"However, further research is needed to assess the benefits of using statins before surgical repair of other types of aneurysms.\"\n\nThe study, \"The Impact of Preoperative Statin Therapy on Open and Endovascular Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair Outcomes,\" recently was published in Vascular, the official publication of the International Society for Vascular Surgery.\n\nThe MU School of Medicine has improved health, education and research in Missouri and beyond for more than 165 years.

The team says that popular ibuprofen gels make it difficult to control dosage and can be easily rubbed off.\n\nAlthough TEPI patch remains highly tacky and adheres well to skin, it is not uncomfortable to peel off, unlike many traditional plasters.\n\nAccording to Andrew Lee, co-founder of Medherant, \u201cwe\u2019ve only been in the lab about 12 months, but in the 12 months we\u2019ve essentially assessed about 90 percent of the drugs that are currently available as either creams or patches. We\u2019ve tested them in our polymers with very good results, we\u2019ve been able to get increased loadings of drugs in the polymer and we\u2019ve shown almost across the board that we can get a steady release rate of that drug from the polymer as well.\u201d\n\nThe team says TEPI patches could go on sale within three years, and Medherant is working with some large, unnamed, pharmaceutical companies to get them ready for market.\n\nHaddleton says the technology has exciting potential for other medications, such as opioid painkillers. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is to be able to extend the range of drugs that are available by patches because at the moment we\u2019re limited to about 20 different drugs, and there are thousands of drugs out there, and only about 20 are used in patches at the moment, which is limited by the technology of the adhesive, essentially,\u201d he said.\n\nLee told Reuters that many commercial patches do not contain pain relief agents at all, and merely sooth the body with a warming effect. He said Medherant\u2019s technology would eliminate most side effects created by oral medication.\n\n\u201cOne of the interesting areas that we plan to explore in partnership with large companies is actually using our platform technology to include other drugs that previously maybe haven\u2019t been suitable for topical or transdermal delivery - or drugs which may have not got through the regulatory filings because, for instance, they might have caused stomach irritation or other side effects when taken orally,\u201d said Lee.\n\nThe TEPI patch incorporates new adhesive technology developed by global adhesive company Bostik. Lee believes ibuprofen strips could be useful for sports participants, helping alleviate conditions such as tendonitis, and repetitive strain injuries.

Now a study published in the journal Circulation confirms and quantifies that benefit; women who ate three or more servings of blueberries and strawberries per week reduced their risk of heart attack by up to one third.\n\nIn the study, researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health and the University of East Anglia in the U.K. analyzed data from 93,600 women ages 25 to 42 enrolled in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study II. For 18 years, the women filled out surveys detailing their diets at four-year intervals.\n\nDuring the study the women experienced 405 heart attacks. But women who consumed the most blueberries and strawberries had a 32% reduced risk of heart attack compared with the women who ate berries once a month or less. The women who ate more berries also tended to eat healthier overall, consuming more vegetables and fruits than those who didn\u2019t eat as many berries; but when the scientists broke down the women\u2019s diets, they found that the highest consumers of berries even had a lower risk of heart attack compared with women who still ate plenty of fruits and vegetables but fewer berries. The effect remained even after the researchers adjusted for other things that can influence heart-disease risk, such as obesity, high blood pressure, smoking, low levels of physical activity and a family history of heart disease.\n\n\u201cThese foods can be readily incorporated into diets, and simple dietary changes could have an impact in reducing risk of heart disease in younger women,\u201d says study author Aedin Cassidy from the University of East Anglia. \u201cThis supports growing lab data showing that these compounds can help keep arteries healthy and flexible.\u201d\n\nSo what is it about berries that help the heart? The researchers focused on blueberries and strawberries because these are the most widely consumed varieties in the U.S. Both berries contain high levels of anthocyanins, as well as other flavonoids, which fight the effects of stress and free-radical damage to cells as they age. They can also keep heart vessels more elastic and flexible, which helps combat the growth of plaques that can build up and rupture, causing heart attacks.\n\nThe results are particularly encouraging because they showed that a change in diet could affect heart-disease risk for relatively young women. That means that regular consumption of berries might be a relatively easy way to lower a woman\u2019s risk of having a heart attack later in life, possibly even insulating her from heart problems. \u201cAlthough we know about the effects of antioxidants and flavonoids, and their effects in wine and chocolate, it is interesting to look at their effects in such a large group of women over a long period of time,\u201d says Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, director of women and heart disease at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThe take-home lesson is that even if you are eating these early in life, you\u2019re getting benefits that last for life.

Not only do we save lives, but we reduce the likelihood of needing more aggressive treatment,\" said study author Dr. Elisa Port. She directs the Dubin Breast Center at Mount Sinai and is chief of breast surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital, both in New York City.\n\nCurrently, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that biennial screenings start at age 50 for most women, while the American Cancer Society advises that annual screenings begin at age 45. Earlier guidelines had suggested annual screenings begin at age 40.\n\nPort noted that screening guidelines tend to be based on the ability of mammograms to save lives and how often they give a false positive result.\n\n\"But isn't there some benefit to getting tested earlier, like needing fewer lymph nodes removed and not needing chemotherapy? I think it's safe to say that most women, if they could be assured the same survival, would choose not to get more aggressive therapies,\" she said.\n\nPort's study included more than 1,100 women diagnosed with breast cancer at the Dubin Breast Center. All of the women were older than 40.\n\nThe women were separated into two groups. One group had a mammogram within the 24 months before their breast cancer diagnosis. The other group had a screening 25 months or more before their diagnosis.

They were also 32 percent more likely to need surgery to remove the whole breast (mastectomy), and 66 percent more likely to need lymph nodes removed. And the women who were screened earlier had smaller tumors.\n\nPort also looked at the 40- to 49-year-old age group, and found those who had never had a mammogram were much more likely to need chemotherapy.

But tests of muscle tissue in mice with a normal SIRT1 gene that were given resveratrol found that the substance boosted mitochondrial function.\n\nMitochondria provide the energy that cells need to function. A decrease in mitochondrial energy production has been linked to a variety of diseases, including diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, as well as to the aging process itself, said senior study author David Sinclair, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School in Boston.\n\nBut don't go reaching for that Chianti yet. Yes, resveratrol is found in the skin of red grapes. But \"the amounts we gave to our mice would be like drinking 100 glasses of red wine a day,\" Sinclair said.\n\nInstead, the goal is to develop synthetic resveratrol compounds that activate SIRT1 and could be taken as medication. \"My colleagues are in the middle of developing better molecules that we hope will be medicines that will be used to treat diseases of aging, not to extend lifespan, though that may be a side effect,\" Sinclair said.\n\nThe study is in the May 1 issue of Cell Metabolism.\n\nWhile previous studies have also suggested that resveratrol may have anti-aging properties, the precise mechanism of resveratrol has been controversial. Several studies, including work with yeast, worms and flies, have found that resveratrol acts on a class of seven genes known as sirtuins and, in human cells, SIRT1 in particular.\n\nBut other researchers have argued that resveratrol may work by activating a separate energy pathway called AMPK, which is also related to mitochondrial energy production but does not involve sirtuin genes.\n\nTesting the effect of resveratrol on SIRT1 in mice was difficult, Sinclair said. Mice that have their SIRT1 gene deleted are born with developmental defects and are unsuitable for experiments, he explained.\n\nSo Sinclair and two graduate students, Nathan Price and Ana Gomes, worked for years to come up with a method for knocking out SIRT1 in healthy adult mice.\n\n\"Our paper found you absolutely require the SIRT1 gene for resveratrol to improve the metabolism of the mice,\" Sinclair said.\n\nThe paper also showed that the AMPK pathway was activated in mice given high doses of resveratrol, yet there was no benefit to mitochondrial function. There was no effect on AMPK in mice given a lower dose of resveratrol.\n\nSinclair is co-founder and a consultant for Sirtris Pharmaceuticals Inc., which is developing resveratrol-like molecules for use as treatment for age-related diseases. In 2010, according to news reports, the company, which is owned by GlaxoSmithKline, halted clinical trials of resveratrol, but Sinclair said the company continues to develop improved synthetic molecules.\n\nGeorge Vlasuk, CEO of Sirtris, said the new findings offer the \"first definitive evidence\" for a direct link between SIRT1 and the metabolic benefits of resveratrol.\n\n\"The work by [first author] Price et al. strongly supports the basic rationale being pursued at Sirtris, which focuses on the development of small-molecule compounds that directly activate the enzymatic activity of SIRT1 as a new therapeutic approach to many diseases of aging,\" Vlasuk wrote in an email to the journal.\n\nPhilippe Marambaud, an investigator at the Litwin-Zucker Center for Research in Alzheimer's Disease and Memory Disorders at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, N.Y, said the new research adds to a body of evidence that resveratrol can potentially combat aging by boosting mitochondrial activity.\n\n\"In this study, by using an elegant adult-inducible SIRT1 knock-out mouse model, the authors now provide compelling evidence that SIRT1 is required in vivo [in the animal] for the effect of resveratrol on AMPK activation and on mitochondrial function,\" Marambaud said.\n\nWhile studies involving animals can be useful, they frequently fail to produce similar results in humans.\n\n\"A mouse model is not a human being, especially when you are genetically manipulating this animal model, you want to be very careful,\" Marambaud said. \"This field has been extremely controversial.

The findings may reduce the number of unnecessary treatments prescribed to otherwise healthy girls.\n\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder affecting up to 12% of women. Women with PCOS are more likely to suffer from irregular periods, have excessive levels of male hormones and may have difficulty in conceiving due to irregularities in the ovaries. Doctors are cautious when diagnosing PCOS in teenagers because the symptoms can be confused with normal pubertal changes. Having tools that make diagnoses more accurate can reduce unnecessary treatment for otherwise healthy teenagers at a critical stage in their lives.\n\nThe cause of PCOS is unknown and there is currently no cure for the condition. Previous studies have associated high levels of irisin, a newly discovered hormone which is released from muscles and regulates energy metabolism, with PCOS in adults.\n\nIn this study, Greek researchers from Aghia Sophia Children's Hospital in Athens compared the hormones of 23 teenagers with PCOS with 17 healthy teenagers of the same age and BMI. They found that teenagers with PCOS had significantly higher irisin levels compared to the control group, and that this was associated with higher levels of the male sex hormone testosterone, a key marker of PCOS.\n\nThe findings suggest that irisin could be a marker for PCOS allowing the condition to be diagnosed more easily. \"Teenagers who get an early diagnosis of PCOS can sooner start to deal with the physical and psychological symptoms caused by this lifelong condition,\" said lead researcher Dr Flora Bacopoulou. \"Whether it's through counselling or medication, girls can manage their symptoms and decrease the risk of further complications such as fertility problems, hirsutism (excessive hair growth) and type-2 diabetes\".\n\nThe group will next focus on confirming their results and investigate the biological role of irisin in PCOS. \"If high irisin levels in teenagers with PCOS is established, this could lead to the development of treatments for PCOS.

There are currently no proven therapies for these cases.\n\nOur sense of smell not only contributes to our enjoyment of life, but also to our daily safety and well being. We rely on our sense of smell to make us aware of smoke in detecting a fire, natural gas leaks and to avoid eating rotten food. In the elderly, of whom there are estimates that greater than 50 percent of the population over the age of 65 has experienced smell loss, it can be difficult to get proper nutrition, as the sensation of flavor is closely tied to the sense of smell, and as flavor diminishes, appetite decreases in this population.\n\nA Cochlear Implant for the Nose\n\nMotivated by work conducted by research colleagues at Virginia Commonwealth University\u2019s School of Medicine, Mass. Eye and Ear physicians wanted to address the question of whether electrical stimulation of the olfactory bulb could induce the sense of smell in human subjects.\n\nThe findings described in the International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology report demonstrate this feasibility. In the report, the researchers describe endoscopic procedures to position electrodes in the sinus cavities of five patients with an intact ability to smell. Three patients described sensations of smell (including reports of onions, antiseptic, sour and fruity aromas) as a result of the stimulation.\n\nThis breakthrough in human patients opens the door for a \u201ccochlear implant for the nose\u201d to be developed \u2014 though the study authors caution that the concept of an olfactory stimulator is more challenging than existing technologies.

Medications and psychotherapy are the primary treatments. Many older adults prefer psychotherapy to medication for the treatment of anxiety.

It is found throughout the human body, with high concentrations in the liver, adrenal glands and brain.\n\nThe latest research, conducted by investigators at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, is important not only because it suggests another treatment option for patients with depression, but because it also offers news clues into the physical pathways of depression that could ultimately lead to more effective treatments.\n\n\u201cThere are many directions in research that this opens up,\u201d said Dr. George I.

All of the study subjects continued to take the prescription antidepressant, but 39 of them were randomly assigned to receive SAMe for six weeks. The remaining 34 patients received a placebo in addition to their regular prescription treatment.\n\nAfter six weeks of treatment, 36 percent of the patients taking a combination of SAMe and an antidepressant showed improvement, compared to just 18 percent of those taking the antidepressant and placebo. And about 26 percent of patients in the SAMe group experienced a complete remission of symptoms, compared to just 12 percent in the placebo group, according to a report published in The American Journal of Psychiatry.\n\nThe research offers hope to patients who haven\u2019t been helped by traditional antidepressant treatment.

As a result, doctors are looking for additional treatments to help these patients, referred to as \u201cnonresponders.\u201d\n\nModern antidepressants essentially work by building up concentrations of neurotransmitters, which amplifies their effect on the brain. It\u2019s not clear exactly how SAMe works to curb depression, but researchers have several theories. SAMe may influence the expression of genes involved in depression or alter the function of different receptors and structures that transport neurotransmitters in the brain. The molecule also may be directly involved in the creation of neurotransmitters.\n\n\u201cMost antidepressants we use are acting on neurotransmitters in the brain,\u201d said Dr. J. Craig Nelson, professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, and author of an editorial accompanying the study. \u201cIt may be that SAMe is facilitating the synthesis of the neurotransmitters that the drugs then act on. That\u2019s probably the best hypothesis.\u201d\n\nOther studies have suggested that SAMe can relieve symptoms of depression. A 2002 analysis of depression trials conducted by the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality found that SAMe use resulted in clinically meaningful benefits to depressed patients compared to placebo, and that the supplement worked as well as tricyclic antidepressants, a category of prescription drugs.\n\nIn his editorial, Dr. Nelson notes that SAMe is typically not covered by insurance companies, and that although the cost is relatively low, it is still more than the drug co-payments required by most health plans. A monthly supply of the same brand of supplement studied would be about $143, the editorial notes.\n\nDr. Nelson, who was not involved in the Harvard study, said the results need to be replicated in a larger study, and that more information is needed on dosing, side effects and long-term treatment with SAMe, among other things. Dr. Papakostas agrees the study \u201cneeds replication\u201d but said he is hopeful about the potential for future research.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge advancement in terms of expanding the types of medications we have to treat depression,\u201d Dr. Papakostas said. \u201cIn the last 60 years of depression research, all the treatments have focused on similar mechanisms of action. This is one of the first few studies that suggests a different mechanism.

The experimental drug, however, kicks into action earlier, working to block the virus from hijacking cells in the first place, the Journal said.\n\nJapanese drug regulators could approve the drug for use in Japan by early March, the Journal reported. The drugmaker plans to apply for approval in the U.S. this summer; however, the drug likely wouldn't be available here until next year.\n\nRead more at The Wall Street Journal.

(ET), WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 2016\n\nAlso available at the For the Media website, the commentary \u201cA Call for Frailty Screening in the Preoperative Setting,\u201d by Anne M. Suskind, M.D., M.S., and Emily Finlayson, M.D., M.S., of the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nTo place an electronic embedded link to this study in your story: This link will be live at the embargo time: http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/10.1001/jamasurg.2016.4219\n\nIn a study published online by JAMA Surgery, Daniel E. Hall, M.D., M.Div., M.H.Sc., of the Veterans Affairs Pittsburgh Healthcare System and University of Pittsburgh, and colleagues examined the effect of a Frailty Screening Initiative (FSI) on death and complications by comparing the surgical outcomes of patients treated before and after implementation of the FSI.\n\nAs the U.S. population ages, the number of operations performed on elderly patients will likely increase. Frailty predicts postoperative mortality and illness more than age alone, thus presenting opportunities to identify the highest-risk surgical patients and provide tailored clinical care to improve their outcomes. This study included 9,153 patients (average age, 60 years) from a Veterans Affairs medical center who presented for major, elective, noncardiac surgery. Preoperative frailty was assessed with the Risk Analysis Index (RAI; a 14-item questionnaire), and the records of all frail patients (as determined by a certain RAI score) were flagged for administrative review by the chief of surgery (or designee) before the scheduled operation. On the basis of this review, clinicians from surgery, anesthesia, critical care, and palliative care were notified of the patient\u2019s frailty and associated surgical risks; if indicated, perioperative plans were modified based on team input.\n\nThe researchers found that overall 30-day mortality decreased from 1.6 percent (84 of 5,275 patients) to 0.7 percent (26 of 3,878 patients) after FSI implementation. Improvement was greatest among frail patients (12.2 percent to 3.8 percent), although mortality rates also decreased among the robust patients (1.2 percent to 0.3 percent). The magnitude of improvement among frail patients increased at 180 and 365 days.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate cause of the survival benefit is likely multifactorial, including changes in preoperative decision making, intraoperative management, and postoperative rescue,\u201d the authors write.\n\n\u201cThis study reveals the feasibility of facility-wide frailty screening in elective surgical populations. It also suggests the potential to improve postoperative survival among the frail through systematic administrative screening, review, and optimization of perioperative plans. The absolute reduction in 180-day mortality among frail patients was more than 19 percent, with improvement remaining robust even after controlling for age, frailty, and predicted mortality.\u201d\n\n: This investigation was supported by a grant from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration, Office of Research and Development, Health Services Research and Development.

They cost much more than generic warfarin, roughly $8 a day instead of $1 or less. And Eliquis and Pradaxa require two pills a day, one in the morning and one in the evening, instead of the once-daily warfarin. The study included 18,201 people in 1,034 clinical sites in 39 countries and was consistent worldwide, the sponsors said. Although the study was financed by the drug makers, which raises the issue of bias, it met the gold standard for medical research as a randomized, double-blinded trial in which doctors and patients did not know who took which pill until the end. The drug acts on an enzyme that leads to blood clots.\n\nDr. Christopher B. Granger, the study\u2019s lead author and a professor of medicine at Duke University, said, \u201cI think this is a profound trial result that will have a major impact on the practice and management of patients with atrial fibrillation. It combines both greater efficacy in terms of prevention of stroke with a substantial reduction to bleeding risk, and that package is one that will be particularly compelling.\u201d\n\nWall Street has high expectations, too. The companies\u2019 stock soared after they released a brief statement about the stroke and bleeding benefits in June. Barclays Capital said the final results on Sunday were \u201cperhaps the most anticipated R.&D. event of the year.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf everything checks out,\u201d Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs said in an interview, \u201cthat will confirm in our minds that Eliquis has potential to take a majority share of the $10 billion anticoagulation market.\u201d\n\nMore than 2.6 million people have atrial fibrillation in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As many as 12 million people will have it by 2020 because of an aging population with longer life expectancy. The arrhythmia in the left upper chamber of the heart can cause slow blood flow and clots, raising the risk of stroke by four to six times on average, the government says.\n\nAs many as half of people with the condition, however, are untreated, by varying estimates. Warfarin, a cheap 60-year-old drug sold generically under the brand name Coumadin, requires frequent blood tests to monitor its active level and interacts with some other drugs and foods, including leafy greens. There is great appeal and demand for new drugs that do not vary so much and deliver the same stroke-preventing benefits.\n\nThe first new drug, Pradaxa, from the German drug maker Boehringer Ingelheim, was introduced in the United States last fall. In the first seven months on market, about four in five cardiologists and two in five primary care doctors had prescribed it to more than 250,000 people, Wa\u2019el Hashad, Boehringer\u2019s vice president for cardiovascular marketing, said in an interview last week.\n\nPradaxa inhibits thrombin, an enzyme in clot formation. Other emerging drugs block a related enzyme known as Factor Xa.\n\nXarelto, from Bayer and Johnson & Johnson, approved by the F.D.A. in July to prevent clots in hip and knee replacement surgeries, goes to an F.D.A. review panel for atrial fibrillation on Sept. 8.\n\nEliquis is scheduled to be submitted for F.D.A. review later this year. Its New York-based makers are marketing powerhouses with the top two best-selling drugs in the world, Lipitor from Pfizer and Plavix from Bristol-Myers Squibb.

The MedDiet is also low in dairy, has minimal red meat, and uses olive oil as its major source of fat.\n\nLeading author Roy Hardman from the Centre for Human Psychopharmacology Swinburne University of Technology Melbourne Australia and his colleagues evaluated all the available papers between 2000-2015 that investigated if and how a MedDiet may impact cognitive processes over time. In total, 18 out of the 135 articles met their strict inclusion criteria.\n\n\"The most surprising result was that the positive effects were found in countries around the whole world. So regardless of being located outside of what is considered the Mediterranean region, the positive cognitive effects of a higher adherence to a MedDiet were similar in all evaluated papers;\" he said.\n\nAttention, memory, and language improved. Memory, in particular, was positively affected by the MedDiet including improvements in: delayed recognition, long-term, and working memory, executive function, and visual constructs.\n\n\"Why is a higher adherence to the MedDiet related to slowing down the rate of cognitive decline? The MedDiet offers the opportunity to change some of the modifiable risk factors,\" he explained.\n\n\"These include reducing inflammatory responses, increasing micronutrients, improving vitamin and mineral imbalances, changing lipid profiles by using olive oils as the main source of dietary fats, maintaining weight and potentially reducing obesity, improving polyphenols in the blood, improving cellular energy metabolism and maybe changing the gut micro-biota, although this has not been examined to a larger extent yet.\"\n\nMoreover, the benefits to cognition afforded by the MedDiet were not exclusive to older individuals. Two of the included studies focused on younger adults and they both found improvements in cognition using computerized assessments.\n\nThe researchers stress that research in this area is important due to the expected extensive population aging over the next 20-30 years. They envision that the utilization of a dietary pattern, such as the MedDiet, will be an essential tool to maintain quality of life and reduce the potential social and economic burdens of manifested cognitive declines like dementia.\n\n\"I would therefore recommend people to try to adhere or switch to a MedDiet, even at an older age,\" Hardman added.\n\nLike many researchers, Hardman takes his research home: \"I follow the diet patterns and do not eat any red meats, chicken or pork.

Those who consumed above the median amount of caffeine for this group (with an average intake of 261 mg per day) were diagnosed at a lower rate than those who fell below the median (with an average intake of 64 mg per day).

What's more, the drug carries a risk of bone damage, stunted growth and heart trouble, and can render children impotent.\n\nThese experts contend that Lupron, costing about $5,000 a month but seldom covered by insurance, is one of many treatments that cash in on the desperation of parents trying to cope with an incurable condition for which medicine has few good answers outside of painstaking behavioral therapy.\n\n\"Not only is there no scientific backing whatsoever for Lupron treatments, there are several major concerns for the children's health,\" said neurologist BethAnn McLaughlin, an adviser to the Dan Marino Foundation autism group in Weston and the mother of two developmentally disabled children.\n\n\"These people are preying on the fears of parents. We cannot be using these children who are so vulnerable as guinea pigs in a medical experiment.\"\n\nUntested autism treatments have flourished while science struggles to explain the disorder, which disrupts the abilities to speak, concentrate, connect with people and control impulses.\n\nFor unknown reasons, autism has been on the rise for the past few decades, with an estimated 675,000 children \u2013 about one in 100 \u2013 now having mild to severe symptoms. Scientists believe it stems from genetic defects that may only cause problems after an environmental trigger.\n\nA vocal subset of parents and activists blame vaccines, especially those with the mercury-based preservative thimerosal, which has been banned from virtually all as a precaution. Numerous studies have found no connection between autism and vaccines or thimerosal.\n\nLupron therapy grew from the mercury camp. Baltimore researcher Dr. Mark Geier started using the drug in 2005 on the theory \u2013 disputed by mainsteam doctors \u2013 that testosterone binds mercury in the body and that many autistic kids have high levels of the hormone.\n\nLupron halts production of the female hormone estrogen, which the body uses to make testosterone. The drug mainly is used to treat endometrial cancer in women and prostate cancer in men, and sometimes to chemically castrate sex offenders.\n\nGeier's promotional materials said he has treated hundreds of children with Lupron and has launched nine ASD Centers in eight states. In his latest, he teams with Dr. David Clayman, a Boca Raton radiologist who has an autistic teen son and is opening an ASD office beside his MRI center in Tamarac.\n\nClayman said he would not comment until he treats patients with Lupron therapy for a year. Geier could not be reached for comment despite several attempts by phone. He told one parent he did not plan to comment for this story.\n\nThe medical group began recruiting Florida patients in March when Geier spoke at a Fort Lauderdale conference for parents of children with autism.\n\nTeresa Badillo was at the meeting. Her family has searched in vain for a way to help their autistic son, Marco, 18. Badillo said he has little speech or interaction with others, but is doing OK in high school. Lately, though, Marco has grown more aggressive, physical and rebellious.\n\n\"We were basically under seige in this house,\" Badillo said. \"This kind of behavior is more scary at 18 [than] at 3. I had choices to make. If you see there is another option out there that can help your child, most parents are going to choose that option.\"\n\nAlso, Marco had discovered sex and sometimes touched himself inappropriately in public, a common problem among those with autism.\n\n\"The kids don't understand. They have impulses. It's what happens when you have high testosterone,\" Badillo said.\n\nThe family put Marco on Lupron about six weeks ago. He gets two injections a month at a dosage larger than used on adult cancer patients, plus a small daily shot.\n\n\"The therapy immediately stopped the aggression,\" Badillo said. \"This is not castrating a kid. It's just lowering the [testosterone] levels enough to normal range so the kid is not aggressive.\"\n\nShe said Geier plans to continue the Lupron for several months to see if it helps Marco's other autistic behavior. She said she knows the drug has risks but believes Lupron critics do not fully grasp the hard realities of life with an autistic child.\n\nLupron critics said autism parents may not understand the dangers.\n\nThe drug is not approved for children \u2013 except a rare few with premature puberty \u2013 because it can impair bone development crucial to growth, said Dr. Gary Berkovitz, chief of pediatric endocrinology at the University of Miami medical school.\n\nIt's not recommended for people with heart disease, kidney disease, asthma, depression or seizures because it can worsen those conditions. Autistic children are prone to seizures.\n\n\"It has not been tested so there's no way to know if it has adverse effects in the long run,\" Berkovitz said.\n\nSaid neurologist McLaughlin: \"We have very significant concerns about irreversible damage to sexual function and the brain and sex organs of these children.\"\n\nIn addition, the Food and Drug Administration is investigating complaints that Lupron causes diabetes in adults.\n\nGeier published a 2006 study contending that 11 autistic children taking Lupron did better on tests of awareness, sociability and behavior. He has since issued other studies finding that mercury leads to excess testosterone and that autistic children have excessive levels of the hormone.\n\nOther doctors said Geier's studies were small, were not scientifically sound and were published in journals that do not follow the standard practice of having experts review the methods.\n\nThe area's largest autism treatment center jointly run by the University of Miami and Nova Southeastern University, as well as another at Florida Atlantic University, frown on Lupron and other untested therapies, officials at the centers said.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering in this story.

Now, a small study published in the journal suggests that taking a probiotic supplement may provide relief from both conditions.\n\nThe randomized, placebo-controlled trial shows a connection between probiotics and mood improvement in people with IBS and depression or anxiety, as well as changes in brain regions related to emotional processing. Most previous research on this topic has been on healthy people without mood disorders.\n\nFor the new research, scientists from McMaster University in Canada recruited 44 adults with IBS as well as mild to moderate anxiety or depression. They were followed for 10 weeks; half took a daily dose of the probiotic , and half took a placebo. The probiotics were manufactured and provided by Nestle, which also funded the study. (Nestle was not involved in collection, analysis or interpretation of study data.)\n\nAfter six weeks, twice as many people who took the probiotic had decreased depression scores compared to those who took the placebo: 64% versus 32%. Results were similar after 10 weeks, as well. When people in the study were given functional MRI scans, the researchers found that improved depression scores were associated with changes in activity of several brain areas involved in mood regulation.\n\nThose changes in brain activity \u201csupport the notion that this probiotic has anti-depressive properties,\u201d the authors wrote in their paper. While their data did not show significant independent changes in anxiety, constipation, diarrhea or pain, people who took the probiotic did report improvements in overall symptoms of IBS and in quality of life.\n\nOne explanation for the improved mood in the group taking probiotics could be that because their physical symptoms feel better, their mood gets better too. That\u2019s why Dr. Roger McIntyre, professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at the University of Toronto, thinks the fMRI findings are the most interesting and important aspect of the new study: they signal that the probiotics may really be working on the brain itself.\n\nMORE: You Asked: Should I Take Probiotics?\n\n\u201cWe know that one part of the brain, the amygdala, tends to be red hot in people with depression, and it seemed to cool down with this intervention,\u201d says McIntyre, who was not involved in the new research. \u201cIt provides more scientific believability that something in the brain, at a very biological level, seems to be affected by this probiotic.\u201d\n\nNo serious side effects related to the probiotic were reported, suggesting that such a supplement could be a safe way to treat both stomach- and mood-related symptoms. Studies have looked at various types of probiotics for IBS patients, the authors wrote, and a recent review found that seemed to work better for gastrointestinal symptoms than another common probiotic, .\n\nSome experts believe that gut bacteria influence the brain (and vice versa) mainly through systemic inflammation. But in this study, the researchers found no difference in inflammatory markers between the probiotic and the placebo group. McIntyre points out that the bowel communicates with the brain through other pathways as well, including the metabolic and nervous systems.\n\nThe study\u2019s findings need to be confirmed in larger independent trials, and McIntyre says he wouldn\u2019t yet recommend taking a probiotic for symptoms associated with mental disorders like depression or anxiety. (Study co-author Premysl Bercik, associate professor of medicine at McMaster University, says the formula used in the new research isn\u2019t commercially available, anyway.) \u201cThe evidence at this point is promising,\u201d says McIntyre, \u201cbut it is not sufficient to justify recommending to patients as a viable treatment strategy.\u201d\n\nBut McIntyre says the results are encouraging. \u201cThey seem credible to me, and they might hint that there are other mechanisms, besides just inflammation, linking the GI tract to the brain,\u201d he says.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There is no disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Why smokers are more susceptible is not known for sure, but some scientists believe it has to do with smoking-caused damage that allows the bacteria to more easily attach to the lungs and windpipe, said Dr. Pekka Nuorti, a medical epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story mentions mortality from pneumonia infections in adults over 65 and notes that death from pneumonia is younger people\u2013even smokers\u2013 is relatively rare.\u00a0\n\u00a0", "answer": 1}, {"article": "(CNN) By the time Cynthia Falardeau read about Alex Pring, a little boy who got a battery-powered robotic arm last summer, she had made peace with her son Wyatt's limb difference.\n\nHer premature baby had been born with his right arm tangled in amniotic bands. At a week old, doctors amputated his dead forearm and hand. They were afraid his body would be become infected and he would die. Falardeau mourned her boy's missing arm for years but, in time, embraced her son as he was.\n\nWyatt also learned to adapt. They tried a couple of prosthetics when he was younger and each time the toddler abandoned the false limb within months.\n\n\"His main interest was to create a shocking response from onlookers by pulling it off in the grocery store,\" Falardeau wrote on CNN iReport . In truth, she had been more concerned about getting him therapy for his autism-related delays -- the limb difference was secondary.\n\nSo when a friend shared a story from the \"Today Show\" with Wyatt in mind, about a team of University of Central Florida (UCF) students and graduates that made an electronic arm for 6-year-old Pring using a three-dimensional printer on campus, Falardeau was defensive.\n\n\"He doesn't need this,\" she thought.\n\nHer fifth-grader had a different reaction: \"I want one of these robot arms!\" Falardeau remembers Wyatt telling her and her husband. \"I could ride a bike! I might even be able to paddle a kayak!\"\n\nThere were other things the 12-year-old boy said he would do if he had two hands. A proper somersault. Clap with two hands.

The organization creates and shares bionic arm designs for free download at EnablingTheFuture.org that can be assembled for as little as $20 to $50. Middle and high school student groups and Girl and Boy Scout troops are among those donating their time and materials to assemble limbs for kids and give them to recipients for free.\n\n\"It's really just a step-by-step process of solving problems. The first problem we solved was: how do we make the hand move electronically? And then: how do we attach this arm to a child?\" said sophomore Tyler Petresky. \"It's just one problem after another we keep solving. That's what engineering is all about.\"\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about 1,500 babies in the United States are born with upper limb deformities each year. Comprehensive statistics aren't available for the number of children with amputations, such as Wyatt.\n\nThe UCF project started when Albert Manero, an engineering doctoral student, heard a story on the radio about one of the inventors of the 3-D printed hand. He got involved with E-Nable and met Alex, a local boy teased because of his missing arm, and set about designing a robotic replacement. They gave it to Alex for free.\n\nEach electronic limb takes about 30 to 50 hours to make and assemble. The students use the printer in the school's manufacturing lab and cover the cost of materials -- about $350 -- through donations.\n\nPetresky got involved with the design of Pring's hand because Manero knew he was good with electronics.\n\n\"He bribed me with some pulled pork sandwiches. I went over to his house and helped him out with electronics,\" he said. \"I found out he was working on an arm, and I thought that was the coolest thing in the world.\"\n\nEventually Manero moved to Germany for a Fulbright scholarship and left Petresky in charge of running the operations in Orlando.\n\nPetresky says they ask every family about the child's favorite color, superhero and interests, so the new limb can \"not just be a piece of plastic ... but be a part of them.\"\n\nAs they've designed the bionics, they've learned that kids don't necessarily want to blend in. Children have requested colorful designs inspired by superheroes, Disney's \"Frozen,\" and in Wyatt's case, the blue-skinned men from \"Blue Man Group.\" For Christmas, the group upgraded Alex's plain vanilla white arm to a new one resembling Optimus Prime from \"Transformers.\"\n\n\"We quickly found out this is much less about fitting in and feeling normal, and much more about expressing yourself,\" Petresky said. \"There's a large aspect of being artistic and being creative.\"\n\nThe team has made electronic arms for five children and are working with three more kids including Wyatt. He traveled with his mom to UCF last week and practiced flexing his muscle to make the hand open and close.\n\nHe expects to get fitted with his new arm later this month.\n\nHis mom, Cynthia, was most excited about seeing Wyatt being celebrated for who he is.\n\n\"The adoration of college students was an affirmation that money can't buy. He was wrapped in the joy of leading and advising students on how to help children like himself,\" she wrote in her iReport. \"Wyatt felt like he was making a difference for himself and other children.\"\n\nAs they got ready to leave the campus, her son told her he can't wait to see what he will accomplish with his new arm.

Such patients need anticlotting drugs because blood clots can be a deadly complication of getting a stent.\n\nPlavix is the drug most often used to prevent this complication. But there's a problem with Plavix, and with a newer, stronger drug in the same class called Effient.\n\nBoth drugs increase the risk of dangerous bleeding.

It will slip under your skin and travel through the blood to your trachea, where you will swallow it and give it a free ride to your small intestine. Upon arrival, it will open its tiny jaw, dig its teeth into your intestinal wall and begin to drink your blood.\n\nAnd it could be the key to making millions of people healthier.\n\nWriting in the journal Science Translational Medicine on Wednesday, scientists report that a protein produced by hookworms eases the symptoms of asthma in mice \u2014 and could one day be made into a pill to treat humans.\n\nThe study is the latest from a surprising field of research into the potentially positive sides of parasites, one of the most maligned groups in the animal kingdom. It began years ago, when a gastroenterology surgeon approached parasitologist Alex Loukas, one of the senior authors on the new study. The doctor wanted to know whether there might be a connection between the dramatic success of deworming programs around the world and the rise of immune system problems like asthma and celiac disease.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the data that comes in from immunological studies . . . where you remove the parasites [that's] where you see the highest incidence of autoimmune diseases and allergies,\u201d said Severine Navarro, the paper's lead author and a senior research fellow in Loukas's lab at James Cook University in Australia.\n\n[Dear Science: Why do we get allergies? What's the point of a runny nose?]\n\nMany parasites have evolved the ability to hide from their host's immune systems. When a hookworm crawls into a human, it secretes chemicals that turn off the immune alarm bells and repair the tissue around it. It limits its consumption of blood to a few drops a day and doesn't leave its offspring scattered all over its host's gut. (Instead, it thoughtfully plants them in the host's poop to ensure an orderly exit from the body.) Like a very conscientious cat burglar, the hookworm knows it's best served by not making a mess.\n\n\u201cIt's almost symbiotic,\u201d Navarro said, \u201cbecause in order for it to survive and thrive, it needs its host to be happy and healthy.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the adaptations that help the parasites stay hidden also benefit their host by reining in overactive immune systems.\n\nThinking that they might be onto something, the researchers found 12 adults with celiac disease \u2014 a serious genetic disorder that causes an autoimmune response to gluten \u2014 who volunteered to have doctors infect them with a slimy, slithery hookworm. It was important that the participants be adults, because even relatively benign parasites can cause serious problems for children, pregnant women and others. Navarro also warned people with autoimmune disorders that they should not attempt to infect themselves with a hookworm, no matter how debilitating their illness might be. Parasites are no joke.\n\nFor the dozen trial participants, the hookworm did improve their tolerance of gluten.\n\nIt was an intriguing result, but it's difficult to scale that kind of study. Only so many people are willing to have a parasite put inside them for science. And because of the risks associated with parasites, going around infecting people isn't a viable treatment option.\n\n[Dear Science: How many germs are actually on a toilet seat \u2014 and should I care?]\n\nSo Navarro and her colleagues isolated the active ingredient in hookworm spit \u2014 a compound called AIP-2 \u2014 and injected it into asthmatic mice on a daily basis for five days. The animals' asthma systems substantially declined, and their airways became measurably less inflamed. These benefits persisted for 10 weeks after the mice stopped getting the treatment \u2014 \u201cI don't even know how much that is in mouse years,\u201d Navarro said.\n\nThe researchers also noticed that AIP-2 seemed to have a calming effect on the body's dendritic cells \u2014 a part of the immune system responsible for processing threats.\n\n\u201cIt is basically rewiring the cells in that tissue into promoting very efficient regulatory T cells,\u201d Navarro said, describing the cells that help modulate the immune system.\n\nThis suggests that AIP-2 might also help humans, since dendritic cells have the same function in us that they do in mice. Navarro said their next step is a phase one clinical trial, which would test the effectiveness of an AIP-2 pill.\n\nShould that work, it has the potential to help the 235 million people around the world who suffer from asthma. The compound might also be used to treat other autoimmune disorders, like celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis.\n\nThis study would also suggest that humans lost something when we rid ourselves of the microbes and parasites that had evolved alongside us for tens of thousands of years. \u201cThere\u2019s a major school of thought that says that these parasites should be encountered early in life to contribute to the education of the immune system,\u201d Navarro said.\n\nShe wouldn't go so far as to call parasites good. Deworming campaigns and other public health efforts unquestionably have protected countless people from anemia, malnutrition, developmental disorders and potentially deadly infections.\n\n\u201cBut what we need is to find what's good in them,\u201d she said, \u201cand try to restore that missing component.\u201d\n\nThe vocal tricks political candidates use to sound like leaders\n\nThis lab can re-create the sounds of any space\n\nThese monkeys are creating tools thought to be unique to humans \u2014 by accident\n\nThe tiny genetic tweak that helped snakes lose their legs\n\nThe mysterious \u2018Planet Nine\u2019 might be causing the whole solar system to wobble", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The article does not engage in disease mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "MONDAY, March 28, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Acupuncture can help alleviate the often-debilitating hot flashes that afflict many breast cancer patients, new Italian research says.\n\nNoting that hot flashes are a fact of life for many women with breast cancer, the investigators found that pairing lifestyle advice with weekly acupuncture sessions dramatically improved the women's quality of life.\n\n\"Acupuncture together with enhanced self-care for three months is effective in reducing hot flashes in women with breast cancer,\" said study author Giorgia Razzini, a clinical trial project manager in the oncology unit of Ospedale di Carpi (Carpi Hospital), in Bologna, Italy.\n\nAnd because hormone treatment for breast cancer typically makes the hot flash experience even worse, Razzini added, acupuncture could be a useful tool for helping such patients \"stay on their therapy and improve their quality of life.\"\n\nRazzini and colleagues published their findings online March 28 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\nIn the study, the Italian team focused on 190 breast cancer patients who had reported moderate (or worse) hot flashes while undergoing treatment at five cancer hospitals and one primary health care center in northern Italy between 2010 and 2013.\n\nThe patients, whose average age was 49, were randomly split into two groups. One group of 105 patients was offered a three-month regimen of self-care advice on diet, exercise and psychological support.\n\nThe second group, of 85, was offered the same advice in the same time frame along with 10 half-hour weekly sessions of \"traditional\" acupuncture.\n\nAll of the participants kept hot flash diaries. At the end of the three-month period (and for up to six months thereafter) daily hot flash experiences were assessed for changing severity and frequency.\n\nThe result: by the end of the treatment period, those in the acupuncture group were found to have hot flash scores that were 50 percent lower than those in the non-acupuncture group. The finding continued to hold up for a half-year after the acupuncture sessions ended.\n\nThose in the acupuncture group also seemed to have a generally higher overall quality of life in terms of both physical and mental health, with no serious side effects, the study authors said.\n\nSo why does acupuncture seem to work?\n\nRazzini cited several reasons, including acupuncture's ability to prompt blood vessel dilation in the patient's nervous system, while stimulating the release of endorphins -- a neurotransmitter that interacts with brain cells involved in the regulation of pain and emotion. It also triggers the release of the stress hormone norepinephrine, as well as the mood regulator serotonin.\n\nRazzini didn't know how much American patients might have to pay for such treatment, but added, \"Compared to other effective treatments such as antidepressants, (acupuncture) should be less expensive, and, for sure, more safe and feasible.\"\n\nDr. Courtney Vito, a breast oncologic surgeon at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., was pleased that a serious issue in breast cancer treatment is getting a closer look.\n\n\"Anyone who treats breast cancer struggles with this problem in their practice, because the hot flashes that some women experience with anti-hormonal treatment can be profound,\" she said.\n\n\"Almost all women experience them. For some it's a moderate situation, but for others it's a really significant problem. Some women -- I would say probably about 15 percent -- have such severe hot flashes that they even refuse to take medications that can cut their risk for cancer or cancer recurrence by 50 percent, simply because they can't handle the hot flashes,\" Vito explained.\n\n\"And I've actually had patients who have had acupuncture with good success, so I'm not surprised by the finding,\" she added. \"But it is heartening that we now have scientific proof that this can work.

Diane Zheng of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.\n\n\u201cTaking care of your vision is important in order to maintain good cognitive function,\u201d she said in a telephone interview.\n\nPoor eyesight and weakening mental function are common in older people and related to one another, but the question of whether vision influences cognition, or vice versa, has not been clear, the study team writes in JAMA Ophthalmology.\n\nTo investigate, Zheng\u2019s team followed 2,520 adults for eight years, testing their vision and cognitive status every other year.\n\nOver the course of the study, average visual decline was roughly equivalent to losing the ability to read one line of an eye chart. People who had worse vision at the beginning of the study had worse scores on the cognitive exam as well. A person\u2019s vision at their previous check-up was related to their mental function at the following check-up. While mental function at one check-up was also related to vision at the following exam, the effect of vision on subsequent mental function was significantly stronger.\n\nWhile the mechanism behind the vision-cognition relationship isn\u2019t well understood, Zheng said, worsening vision can discourage people from brain-stimulating activities like doing crosswords and engaging with other people.\n\nShe recommended that older adults get regular eye checkups, and have any vision symptoms checked out and treated promptly.\n\n\u201cThis study provides additional evidence that would suggest that people who can keep their vision healthy as they age might also be protecting their cognitive health,\u201d said Dr. Heather E. Whitson of Duke University School of Medicine and Durham VA Medical Center, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re aging without good vision, not only are you giving your brain less stimulation, you might be altering your brain at a structural level,\u201d she said in a phone interview.\n\nThe good news, Whitson added, is that poor vision is one of the few risk factors for cognitive decline that is potentially modifiable.

Previous research involved administering the combination by injection or via a patch, said study senior author Dr. Christina Wang, a professor of medicine at Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute.\n\nThe combination contraceptive needs to undergo further testing before it is commercially available.\n\nAlthough men have sometimes received a bad rap for not being willing to assume responsibility for birth control, Dr. Joseph Alukal, an assistant professor of urology at NYU Langone Medical Center, in New York City, thinks this reputation may be somewhat undeserved.\n\n\"I think [men] would use it more than is realized,\" said Alukal, who was not involved in the new research. \"Plenty of guys are concerned about unwanted pregnancy, almost as much as women.\"\n\nUnfortunately, condoms and vasectomy have remained the only commercially available contraception options for men.\n\nThe results of the study, funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development, were presented at the recent Endocrine Society annual meeting, held in Houston.\n\nAccording to Wang, the gel was applied in two spots -- the testosterone component on the arm and the progestin component on the abdomen. The gels were applied every day for six months.\n\nThe study, conducted in conjunction with the University of Washington, involved 56 men who were assigned to receive one of three types of gels: one gel containing both testosterone plus a gel containing one of two doses of the synthetic progestin; or a gel containing testosterone on its own plus a \"placebo\" gel with no progestin.\n\nUp to 89 percent of the men who received the combination formulas saw their sperm concentrations plunge to less than 1 million sperm per milliliter, versus just 23 percent of those receiving only testosterone.\n\nNormal sperm concentration is more than 15 million sperm per milliliter, according to the Mayo Clinic's website.\n\nUp to 78 percent of men receiving the drug combination in the study saw their concentrations drop to no sperm at all, versus only 23 percent of men taking testosterone alone.\n\nThe testosterone/progestin combination works by shutting off the hormones that control production of sperm in the testes, Wang explained.\n\nOne important and unanswered question is what the long-term side effects of this regimen might be.\n\nThe answer, said Wang, is \"We just don't know.\"\n\nThat's apart from mild-to-moderate acne or an increase in acne, which was seen in about 21 percent of participants.\n\nA new formulation currently being developed that contains half the amount of testosterone might decrease or eliminate that problem, Wang speculated.\n\nAnother question is how reversible this would be in terms of restoring sperm counts, Alukal said.\n\nIn addition to planning more studies on this combination protocol, Wang is also in early phases of testing the male hormone dimethandrolone, which is more potent than testosterone.\n\nBecause the new study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nThere's more on contraception at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "Providing alternative contraception options for men is an important issue, as the story suggests.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Increased blood pressure and reduced robustness of circadian rhythms are frequently reported in elderly subjects.

The hypotensive effect was dependent on time. The maximum systolic BP lowering effect of melatonin falls between 3:00 and 8:00 in the morning, the time of the highest risk of heart attacks and strokes. Nighttime and morning BP decreased more profoundly on average -8/3.5 mm Hg for SBP/DBP, respectively.\n\nMoreover, the higher the mean systolic BP was during the first week, the more it dropped on the second week of melatonin administration. Melatonin also decreased the overall variability in BP.\n\nMelatonin ws effective in synchronizing disrupted circadian rhythms of BP, heart rate and body temperature, making these circadian rhythms smoother and less irregular. None of these effects was found in 34 placebo treated seniors, thus ruling out the possibility that rhythms could be improved just because of regular schedule and presence of medical personal who took measurements.\n\nIn conclusion, melatonin can be of great value for aged people suffering from hypertension as an adjuvant substance complementing basic medication as it is able to stabilize circadian BP, heart rate profiles and their phase relationships.

There, it heats the lungs to 149 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 cooler than a cup of coffee, but warm enough to shrink the smooth muscle in the airways, which swells during an asthma attack and restricts breathing. After the procedure, the airways no longer are so prone to constricting, studies show. Asthma patients suffer fewer attacks and need fewer hospital visits.\n\nMs. DiGiusto had the procedure in March 2011.

Frequent hospital trips are almost inevitable, and powerful steroids like prednisone \u2014 which can cause thinning bones, cataracts, depression and other debilitating side effects \u2014 become a necessity.\n\nNationwide, asthma treatment costs exceed $10 billion a year, and over half of that is spent on severe asthmatics, who make up only 10 percent of the asthma population.\n\nDoctors say bronchial thermoplasty has given them a new weapon in the battle against severe asthma, and many patients call it life-changing.

Each time, a different section of the lungs is treated. Some patients report temporary coughing, mucus and other respiratory symptoms brought on by irritation of airways.\n\nBut several five-year studies showed no long-term safety issues. And researchers at Washington University School of Medicine found that compared with a control group, bronchial thermoplasty patients saw their asthma attacks drop by a third, their emergency room visits fall by 84 percent, and the number of days they lost from work and school drop by 66 percent.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a cure, but it is definitely a breakthrough,\u201d said Dr. Pratik S. Patel, director of Interventional Pulmonary Medicine at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center in New Jersey. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to get rid of asthma, but it is going to reduce symptoms and hospitalizations and make patients more functional in their daily life.\u201d For now, the procedure is only for severe asthmatics, who \u2014 unlike a vast majority of asthma patients \u2014 cannot keep flare-ups at bay with standard medications, said Dr. Kyle Hogarth, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago who was involved in clinical studies of the treatment.\n\n\u201cThere are millions and millions of asthmatics,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will not be millions of thermoplasty patients.\u201d\n\nStill, even patients with severe asthma often are denied insurance coverage for the procedure. Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the industry trade group, said insurers are awaiting the results of an additional five-year clinical trial, required by the F.D.A. when it approved bronchial thermoplasty.

The one-time cost of $20,000, they say, is dwarfed by the tens of thousands of dollars in hospital bills and medication costs that a severe asthmatic can easily accumulate in a single year.\n\nOne such patient, Alberto Gaulion, 68, a retired importer in Miami, estimated that for much of the last decade, his insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield, spent about $50,000 a year on his medical care.\n\n\u201cEvery two or three weeks I had to go to the hospital,\u201d he said, \u201cand I was taking everything that was on the market. I was on a cocktail of drugs.\u201d\n\nBlue Cross would not cover the procedure for him, so Mr. Gaulion paid out of pocket when he had it in 2010.

Dr. McEvoy argued that it made economic sense, and earlier this year Health Partners agreed.\n\n\u201cWhen plans look at the cost savings, I think they\u2019re going to cover it,\u201d said Dr. McEvoy, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota. \u201cYou have to show that there\u2019s a return on investment.\u201d", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story notes that the procedure\u00a0\u201cis only for severe asthmatics, who \u2014 unlike a vast majority of asthma patients \u2014 cannot keep flare-ups at bay with standard medications.\u201d", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Scientists working to develop a 'game-changing' new antibiotic have made a significant advance towards creating commercially viable drug treatments by producing two simplified synthetic versions of the substance which are just as potent at killing superbugs like MRSA as its natural form.\n\nThe breakthrough by researchers at the University of Lincoln, UK, marks another important step to realising the potential of teixobactin in aiding the global fight against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Teixobactin is a recently discovered natural antibiotic which many in the international scientific community believe could lead to creation of the first commercially viable new antibiotic drug in 30 years.\n\nThe Lincoln team has successfully synthesized new simplified versions of teixobactin which harness the same powerful antibiotic effects in a way that could be produced on a commercial scale. Their findings are published in the Royal Society of Chemistry's journal, Chemical Science.\n\nUntil now, scientists attempting to synthesise teixobactin believed they needed to use cationic (or positively charged) amino acids which bind to the bacterial target using a 'side chain'. This meant they had to use either the very rare amino acid found naturally in teixobactin, called enduracididine, or alternative ones which had lower potency against superbugs.\n\nEach amino acid sits at a specific place in teixobactin's structure, and the Lincoln team has now successfully replaced enduracididine - which holds position ten - with two alternative amino acids which are not positively charged. These amino acids lack the 'binding' part, over-turning the prior understanding that enduracididine is essential for to so-called 'target binding' to be highly potent against superbugs.\n\nWith this new knowledge, synthesised versions of teixobactin can be more easily developed, taking the process from up to 30 hours to just ten minutes for a single coupling step - a significant step towards turning teixobactin into a viable new drug. Importantly, the two new simplified forms of teixobactin have also proven to have identical potency against superbugs as the natural form of teixobactin.\n\nDr Ishwar Singh, a specialist in novel drug design and development from the University of Lincoln's School of Pharmacy, is leading the research team. He explained: \"When teixobactin was discovered it was ground breaking in itself as a new antibiotic which kills bacteria without detectable resistance including superbugs such as MRSA. We have been investigating a way to simplify the design while retaining the high potency against resistant bacteria such as MRSA.\n\n\"This simplified design and more efficient synthesise will enable work to be carried out at a commercial level. Enduracididine was severely limiting our ability to do this because of its scarcity, a complex multistep synthesis, and long and repetitive steps of between 16 and 30 hours with high failure rate and very low yields.\n\n\"We needed to make a change to the structure so that we could make the molecule more viable for drug development. We had tried replacing it with other amino acids with a similar make up, but they all were less potent in comparison to the natural form of teixobactin. Now, we have discovered that we can in fact use amino acids which are structurally different, and are commercially-available. They are also 16 times more potent than a clinically-used antibiotic in killing the superbug MRSA, and they were also highly potent against other antibiotic-resistant infections, such as vancomycin resistant enterococci, and tuberculosis.\"\n\nThe work builds on the success of the team's pioneering research to tackle antimicrobial resistance over the past 18 months. Dr Singh is working with colleagues from the School of Life Sciences and the School of Chemistry at the University of Lincoln to develop teixobactins into a viable drug.\n\nIt has been predicted that by 2050 an additional 10 million people will succumb to drug resistant infections each year.

Plaque in these arteries is a red flag for a potential heart attack. (Agatston does not make any money from the coronary calcium scan.)\n\nThe other imaging test Agatston recommends is an ultrasound of the carotid artery, looking at plaque in the main blood vessel leading to the brain. Plaque in the carotid artery is a sign of increased risk for a heart attack and stroke.\n\nBoth tests are non-invasive and outpatient, although the calcium scan does expose the patient to the equivalent of several months of normal background radiation.\n\nOne large federally funded study found the coronary calcium score a better predictor of coronary events like a heart attack than the traditional Framingham Risk Score, which considers age, cigarette smoking, blood pressure, total cholesterol and HDL, the \"good\" cholesterol.\n\nAgatston thinks the coronary calcium scan should be routinely scheduled at age 50, like a colonoscopy, or earlier for people with family histories of heart disease.\n\nMost hospitals now offer the imaging tests, some at less than $100 for both, and they are often covered by insurance.\n\nCardiologists now generally use the calcium scan only for patients considered at intermediate risk for heart disease, determined by traditional measures such as cholesterol, blood pressure, lifestyle and family history.\n\nHigh-risk patients already receive such aggressive treatment as cholesterol-lowering statin medication, but many doctors don't think low-risk patients need to incur the expense or small dose of radiation that comes with a coronary calcium scan.\n\n\"There is a large group in the middle called intermediate risk, which may be as much as 50% of the population,\" said Dr. Erin Michos, a cardiologist at the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at Johns Hopkins University\n\nA good candidate for a coronary calcium scan, she says, would be a 50-year-old man with slightly elevated cholesterol and a father who had a heart attack.\n\n\"Do you put this 50-year-old who has this family history on a statin medication with potential expense (and) side effects for the next four decades of his life, or do you further refine how far at risk he is?\" she asked.\n\nA calcium score would answer that question, she says.\n\nThere's a third test Agatston likes: a $65 blood test that looks at a patient's LDL, or bad cholesterol. LDL particles come in different sizes, and patients with a lot of small-particle LDL are more likely to build up plaque in their blood vessels, Agatston says. Alternately, patients with large LDL particles do not tend to accumulate plaque.\n\n\"There are a lot of little old ladies in their 80s with very high cholesterol who have squeaky clean vessels. They have very large particles, and they don't get into the vessel wall,\" Agatston says.\n\nThese new tests give patients a chance to make major changes in their diet and lifestyle, and give doctors an opportunity to treat them with medication.\n\n\"One of the best-kept secrets in the country in medicine is the doctors who are practicing aggressive prevention are really seeing heart attacks and strokes disappear from their practices.

The reduction is real and ranges from 30 to 70 percent.\"\n\nThe researchers thought metformin's possible cancer-lowering properties suggested the need for clinical trials to investigate whether the drug might help prevent tumors in smokers at high risk of developing cancer. Others believed that the finding might influence the choice of drugs in people with diabetes.\n\n\"All other things being equal, many diabetics face a choice of oral agents, and early evidence that metformin may have an effect on the oncology side may increasingly play a role in decision-making,\" said Dr. Michael Pollack, professor of medicine and oncology at McGill University in Montreal. \"We can't ignore this, but we can't say we have FDA [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] approval for metformin for cancer indications.\"\n\nMetformin was developed from the French lilac plant, known in the Middle Ages to control excess urination, a symptom of uncontrolled diabetes. The drug was approved by the FDA in the mid-1990s.\n\nThe study by Dennis and colleagues looked at mice that had been genetically engineered to be susceptible to lung tumors.\n\nMice taking metformin in their drinking water had 34 percent fewer tumors than those not taking metformin. And when the drug was administered by injection, the improvement seen was 73 percent.\n\nDennis stated that a likely mechanism of action resides in the liver \"and specifically the hormones [including insulin] that are released.\" Insulin may have a relationship with cancer.\n\n\"It's most likely that metformin is working by reducing insulin and IGF1 [insulin-like growth factor] levels in the body,\" said Lewis Cantley, director of the Cancer Center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, and co-author of an accompanying perspective piece.\n\nIt's also possible, however, that metformin is working more directly on the tumor process, the researchers said.\n\nA second study, this one a randomized controlled trial involving a very small number of humans (23), found that patients with an early form of colorectal cancer who were treated with metformin did see a decrease in possible cancer-related growth, compared with participants not taking the drug.\n\n\"These patients were not diabetic, so they didn't necessarily have high insulin levels to begin with but lower insulin levels,\" Cantley explained.\n\nThis adds credence to the idea that metformin's value is in its ability to lower overall insulin levels in the body, Cantley said.\n\nAt this point, no one knows if metformin is safe in non-diabetic populations but some clinical trials are starting to look at the issue, Lippman said.\n\nAnd, pointed out Dr. Lucas Wong, associate professor of internal medicine at Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine and co-director of the Gastrointestinal Cancer Program at Scott & White in Temple, Texas, while the new research is \"interesting and thought-provoking, what's proven in humans is totally another level.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Library of Medicine has more on metformin.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering in this story.

Some notice it more than others, but it happens to everyone when the lenses in the eyes lose their flexibility.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a part of getting older,\u201d says Dr. Ralph Chu, an ophthalmologist in private practice in Bloomington, Minnesota.\n\nBut that may be changing. In a little over a year, the FDA approved two new devices to help with age-related vision loss. The most recent to receive approval, the \u201cRaindrop\u201d, is made mostly from water and works by reshaping the cornea helping the eye to focus better on close-up objects.\n\nBoth of the new implants, Raindrop and KAMRA, go into only one eye. The other eye will be for seeing distance, explains Dr. D. Rex Hamilton, director of the Laser Refractive Center at the Stein Eye Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a clinical professor of ophthalmology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.\n\n\u201cSo the other eye needs to have good distance vision without glasses,\u201d Hamilton says, adding that sometimes people have laser surgery to improve the distance vision in the eye that won\u2019t be getting an implant to improve vision close-up.\n\nAlso, Hamilton notes, the implants aren\u2019t a \u201cbe all end all. They may work quite well for a period of time but a person's lenses will continue to change with age and, ultimately, the patient may need cataract surgery.\n\nA cataract procedure replaces the lens, improving both near and far vision, and lasts for the rest of the patient\u2019s life. About half of Americans have cataracts or cataract surgery by age 80, according to the National Eye Institute.\n\nStill, for those who don\u2019t want to wait till their lenses cloud over, \u201cthis is a life-changing procedure,\u201d Chu says. \u201cThis is more than just about convenience. It\u2019s functioning in your day-to-day life.\u201d\n\nEkstadt has the privilege of being the first person in the nation to get the Raindrop outside of a clinical trial.\n\nThe procedure to implant the device into Ekstadt\u2019s cornea takes less than 5 minutes: The doctor uses a laser to create a tiny pocket in her cornea and two minutes later the Raindrop is inserted and the procedure is finished.\n\nJust 15 minutes after the surgery Ekstadt can already see better and can make out a line in the eye chart that she couldn\u2019t decipher before.\n\nAnd now she\u2019s able to read without the aid of glasses.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean she won\u2019t need more attention from her doctor, says Hamilton. \u201cThere\u2019s a healing process after the inlay is put in that requires eye drops be put in on a daily basis for around three months,\" says Hamilton. \"You need to be monitored by your surgeon during that period of time.\u201d\n\nOne downside: the implants aren\u2019t covered by insurance or Medicare, says Hamilton, adding \u201cthe cost is around $4,000 to $5,000.\u201d\n\nThere are other risks with the procedure, but they are rare, according to clinical trials.\n\n\u201cAny time you do surgery there is a risk of infection\u2014about one in 2,000,\u201d Hamilton says. \u201cAnd an infection in the cornea can cause scarring that can affect your vision.\u201d\n\nHamilton suggests that people wanting to have an implant find an experienced eye surgeon, one who does both cataract surgery and refractive surgery, which includes LASIK.\n\nLauren Dunn is a medical producer for NBC News; Linda Carroll is a contributor for NBCNews.com", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There was no disease mongering, though including everyone older than\u00a035 years old in the \u201caging\u201d category may have been overkill.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "In what the authors describe as the largest and longest study of resveratrol in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease, there\u2019s encouraging news that the component, which is found in red wine, grapes and dark chocolate, may keep the disease from progressing.\n\nDr. R.

It's potentially huge.\"\n\n\"This is something we've been waiting to see,\" he continued.\n\n\"This directly interferes with the genetic mechanisms that promote cancer to stop the production of a particular protein,\" added Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. \"This is one step away from getting into the actual DNA.\"\n\nAs reported online March 21 in Nature, this is the first time the process, known as RNA interference (RNAi), has been shown to work in humans.\n\nThe process of RNA interference involves putting two strands of RNA together to form so-called \"small interfering RNAs\" (siRNAs) and inserting them into cells. Once there, these interlopers cut the messenger RNA (mRNA) that is ordinarily used to make specific proteins. This discovery won the Nobel Prize in 2006.\n\nBut the work that nabbed the prize was done in worms -- a far cry from humans.\n\nAnd there were other challenges, not the least of which was how to get the siRNAs into the appropriate cell and then make sure they did what they were supposed to do.\n\nThis team, from the California Institute of Technology (CalTech), devised a super-small nanoparticle system that, when injected into the body, would make its way to the tumor, deposit the siRNAs into the tumor cell and leave them to their assigned task.\n\nThis early-phase clinical trial involved actual patients with melanoma, a particularly virulent form of skin cancer.\n\nThe experiment proceeded just as planned, as biopsies later showed.\n\nThe researchers injected the cargo-laden nanoparticles into the patients, much as you would administer a flu or any other type of shot. They did not inject directly into the tumor as many other researchers have done.\n\nThe nanoparticles made their way smoothly to the target -- the tumor cell -- and cleaved the mRNA in just the right place, stopping production of the culprit protein.\n\nThe precision of the process is crucial to limiting side effects, the researchers said.\n\n\"Now you can go selectively at proteins involved in the disease and not have off-target effects,\" explained Mark E. Davis, lead author of the paper, and professor of chemical engineering at CalTech in Pasadena. \"Normally when you make drugs, it's hard to say 'attack only that protein.' In this particular case, I'm going to go in at the genetic level and eliminate that one protein I want to eliminate.\"\n\nAnd unlike conventional gene therapy -- where the offending gene is replaced by a new one or overridden -- this therapy is reversible, said Adams.\n\n\"This will run its course. Ultimately, it will restore itself,\" he said.\n\nThe authors believe the same system could provide a highly targeted, selective way to reach many different genes and affect tumors that have untll now eluded drug therapy.\n\nObviously, the process will have to be refined and optimized before it's actually used for treatment.\n\n\"This is the first qualitative 'yes, we can do it' publication and it really has to be kept in that perspective,\" Adams said.\n\nThere's more on RNA interference at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "Not applicable because no diseases were discussed in any detail.

GTPS is the current term for what used to be called greater trochanteric or subgluteal bursitis. This study is the first to directly compare these two treatments for the syndrome.\n\nThe medical community once thought that a swollen hip bursa--a fluid-filled sac that acts as a gliding surface to reduce friction between moving tissues in this joint--was the source of this hip pain. This conclusion led to the use of steroid injections to the bursa to help decrease swelling and pain. However, evidence now indicates that injuries to the muscles and tendons around the hip are the actual cause of this pain, and that inflammation is often not involved, calling injecting the bursa with a steroid into question.\n\nGTPS is estimated to affect 10% to 25% of the general population. This kind of hip pain has been reported to be more common in women and in patients with coexisting low back pain, osteoarthritis, Iliotibial band tenderness, and obesity. The study demonstrates that patients with GTPS can get similar results from dry needling as from a steroid injection.\n\n\"Evidence for dry needling of the hip in lieu of steroid injection is in its infancy,\" acknowledges lead author Kindyle L. Brennan, PT, PhD, with Baylor Scott & White Health. However, \"this study suggests dry needling as an effective alternative to cortisone injection.\"\n\nDr. Brennan adds that, \"The potential detrimental side effects of steroid injection, particularly repeated injections, are of concern for patients and providers alike.\" As a result, \"the identification of a comparable treatment alternative with minimal side effects, such as dry needling, offers valuable clinical advantages,\" she says.\n\nDr. Brennan and her fellow researchers treated 43 patients with GPTS and a total of 50 painful hips. The patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: one group receiving cortisone injection and the other group, dry needling. Treatments were administered over six weeks, and clinical outcomes were collected at the start of the trial and at one, three, and six weeks. The researchers measured pain and function. They also collected information about medication intake for pain in the involved hip, as well as the sex, age, and body mass index of study participants.\n\nThe baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. The results showed that cortisone injection did not provide better outcomes than dry needling for either pain or function in patients with GTPS. Both groups experienced a decrease in pain and an improved ability to move and complete daily activities.\n\nDr. Brennan cautions that while this study uses a larger sample than most, further studies are warranted. In particular, participants were only followed for six weeks; additional studies over longer time periods will be important.\n\nThe study is titled \"Dry Needling Versus Cortisone Injection in the Treatment of Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome: A Noninferiority Randomized Clinical Trial.\" Co-authors on the paper are Bryce C.

A total of 837 COPD patients were stratified by blood eosinophil counts and randomized to receive either 100 milligrams of mepolizumab or placebo, delivered under the skin every four weeks for one year.\n\nThe patients with high eosinophil counts who received mepolizumab had a statistically significant 18 percent lower rate of moderate/severe exacerbations (1.4 per year compared to 1.7 per year) than those in the placebo group. The exacerbation rate in the low eosinophil group treated with the biologic did not differ from placebo. The time to the first exacerbation also was higher with mepolizumab than placebo, but only in the high eosinophil group.\n\nIn a second, simultaneous trial, termed METREO, the team assessed the effect of a higher dose of mepolizumab in 675 patients with elevated eosinophil levels. Patients were randomized to receive 100 or 300 milligrams of mepolizumab or placebo, with the same delivery method and schedule as METREX.\n\nSimilar to METREX, the exacerbation rate was reduced by 20 percent in the high eosinophil group after 100 milligrams of mepolizumab. The METREO results narrowly missed statistical significance. The 300-milligram dose did not provide an advantage over the lower dose.\n\nAn analysis of data from both trials found that as baseline blood eosinophil counts increased, so did mepolizumab's reduction in the annual exacerbation rate. This finding indicates that patients with higher initial eosinophil counts benefited more from mepolizumab than those with lower eosinophil counts, Sciurba said. The safety profile of mepolizumab did not differ from placebo in either trial.\n\n\"In addition to providing a new treatment option for patients with treatment-resistant, moderate to severe COPD, the new results also are important because they identify a potential biomarker for the disease and demonstrate that eosinophilic inflammation plays a role in flare-ups in COPD,\" Sciurba said.\n\nPitt's Division of Pulmonology, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine has a legacy of pioneering treatments for lung disease. UPMC also is home to a leading lung transplant program.\n\n\"The findings in these trials exemplify what we hope to achieve not only in COPD but across all lung diseases with regards to a precision approach to treatment,\" said division chief, Rama Mallampalli, M.D.\n\nFunding for both trials was provided by GlaxoSmithKline, which plans to seek approval from the FDA for the use of mepolizumab in eosinophilic COPD.\n\nAdditional authors on the study are Ian Pavord, F.Med.Sci.

New clinical research published today in PLoS One shows that over-the-counter magnesium appears safe and effective to treat mild to moderate depression.\n\nCritical to such body functions as heart rhythm, blood pressure and bone strength, the mineral magnesium plays a role in combating inflammation in the body and has been proven to have an association with depression.

Less obvious symptoms include depression, insomnia, anxiety, fatigue and constipation.\n\nNeurological disorders that mimic the symptoms of Parkinson's disease are called atypical parkinsonism disorders.\n\nMany doctors cannot tell whether a patient has Parkinson's disease or atypical parkinsonism.\n\n\"This can be very challenging, especially during the early stages of the diseases and if the responsible doctor is not a neurologist specialized in movement disorders,\" said Dr. Oskar Hansson, lead author of the new study, a neurologist and an associate professor at Lund University in Sweden.\n\nNon-specialists \"do not really know exactly what questions to ask the patient and the special signs to look for,\" Hansson wrote in an email. Yet patients with atypical disorders \"usually have a much worse prognosis, with faster disease progression, (with) more disabling symptoms\" than Parkinson's patients, so early identification is crucial.\n\nThe correct diagnosis is also key to treatment since \"most patients with atypical parkinsonism disorders do not respond well to dopamine-targeting medications\" that are usually prescribed for Parkinson's patients, Hansson said.\n\nHansson and his colleagues developed a blood test that is, essentially, a variation on an existing test capable of detecting neurofilament light chain protein in spinal fluid. This protein is a component of nerve cells, and when these cells die, it can be detected in both spinal fluid and blood.\n\nBecause spinal fluid is not easily obtained by a primary care doctor, this diagnostic test is not very useful, so Hansson developed a blood test and investigated its accuracy in the new study.\n\nWhen validating a new biomarker for disease, \"one should always analyze at least two different (groups of patients and controls) to make sure that the results are reproducible,\" said Hansson, who added that participants should also include both early- and late-stage patients established at different clinics.\n\nAll told, a total of 244 people with Parkinson's and 79 healthy volunteers serving as a comparison group participated in Hansson's study, along with 181 patients with atypical parkinsonism disorders.\n\nOf these, 88 patients had multiple system atrophy, which impairs the body's involuntary functions such as heart rate, blood pressure and digestion.\n\nSeventy patients had progressive supranuclear palsy, which affects movement, walking, balance, speech, swallowing, vision, mood and thinking.\n\nAnd 23 patients had corticobasal degeneration, which causes decreased movement on one side of the body, muscle rigidity, tremor and a disconnection between thought and action.\n\nTesting these participants, the researchers found that nerve protein levels ranged higher in people with atypical parkinsonism and lower in patients with Parkinson's disease as well as the healthy volunteers. However, the test cannot distinguish between the different atypical disorders, which doctors must rely on symptoms to diagnose.\n\nBlood test accuracy is defined based on sensitivity, the percentage of positives that are correctly identified, and specificity, the percentage of negatives that are correctly identified. In Sweden, the blood test had a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 91%, while in the United Kingdom, sensitivity was 80% and specificity 90%. For early-stage study participants, generally, sensitivity was 70% and specificity was 80%.\n\nOverall, the blood test showed equal accuracy as the spinal fluid test when diagnosing Parkinson's or an atypical parkinsonism disorder, in both early and later stages of disease.\n\nHansson imagines that blood-based tests will be used in the future \"in the diagnostic work-up of patients with parkinsonism by most doctors who are not very specialized with these movement disorders.\" He also believes the test will be used by specialists for Parkinson's patients who \"do not exhibit a very typical symptomatology\" or do not respond as expected to treatment.\n\nThough atypical parkinsonism conditions look very similar to Parkinson's at first, they \"have a different underlying molecular cause,\" according to Bronstein, and so it is important to recognize them early in order to treat them properly. \"Disease-specific therapies are now in trials, so accurate diagnosis is essential in determining if these new treatments work,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Dr. Paul Wright, chairman of neurology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, New York, and Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York, the importance of this study is that it brings to light that there are new biomarker tests that can delineate between these neurological diseases.\n\n\"A lot of time, people come in and say they or a family member has a tremor, and they believe it's Parkinson's disease,\" said Wright, who also was not involved in the study. This early assumption may impede diagnosis of a less recognized atypical parkinsonism condition.\n\nOr a patient has \"horrible blood pressure fluctuations,\" Wright said, and no obvious tremor or rigidity symptoms, so a doctor suspects a heart condition. Instead, the cause is multiple system atrophy, a neurodegenerative disease. Though other symptoms will show up eventually and help in diagnosing the patient, in the meantime, the patient will be receiving the wrong medicines.\n\nAn accurate blood test, then, would be good news in these situations.\n\n\"It's a lot more reassuring to a patient to say 'we're just going to take a blood test to check for a few things,' \" Wright said. \"It's much easier and less anxiety-provoking for patients than taking a spinal tap.\"\n\nUp until now, many diseases have been diagnosed based on symptoms, with patients asking, \"How do you know I have this?\" Meanwhile, doctors are not always correct, Wright said. This is true even of Parkinson's, which is diagnosed based on symptoms, a patient's history, neurological exams, a patient's response to medicine and, in some cases, brain imaging tests.\n\nStill, Wright is hopeful and believes a biomarker test for Parkinson's \"will be down the line. ... In general, researchers are looking for biomarkers of disease.\"\n\nSpecialists and sub-specialists are available only in big cities, Wright said, and access to a simple blood test would enable a correct diagnosis in a primary care office.\n\n\"We always assume there's luxury,\" Wright said. \"But that's not really what's real in most of the country.\"", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story does not disease monger, and it did a nice job describing how common these atypical diseases are, compared to Parkinson\u2019s disease.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "According to a paper published in the online edition of the British journal Nature Medicine, preliminary studies by a team of scientists led by a Stanford neurology professor show the test is yielding promising results in predicting which patients with mild memory loss are at high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn a study of 259 blood samples, the test identified early markers for Alzheimer's with 90 percent accuracy, reports CBS News correspondent John Blackstone.\n\nToday only an autopsy can establish for sure that a patient had Alzheimer's.

For example, a study tested the approach in 23 young adults, around age 24. Compared with a control group of 20 young adults, the treatment group increased letter recognition speed. Similar training is an effective component in treating amblyopia, also called \u201clazy eye,\u201d which is the most frequent cause of vision loss in infants and children, affecting 3 percent of the population.

Now health officials are warning doctors that preventing the disease will take more than just writing a prescription.\n\nThe pill, called Truvada, is already on the market for treating HIV infections. But the landmark study, involving 2,500 men who have sex with men, showed that taking Truvada faithfully can reduce the risk of infection by as much as 92 percent.\n\nThat touched off a lot of celebrating. It's the first time anybody's shown that taking a pill can prevent HIV \u2013 and it was the first new weapon against HIV unveiled in many years.\n\nTo make sure it works, though, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says doctors need to do a number of things:\n\u2022 Prescribe Truvada only for men at high risk of getting infected \u2013 that is, only for men who have sex with men, those who have multiple sex partners, and those who live in areas where there's a lot of HIV circulating.\n\u2022 Test patients before prescribing it to make sure they're not already infected.

When researchers tested the blood of patients for traces of Truvada, they found many who claimed to have taken the pill regularly weren't telling the truth. Among those whose tests showed they really did take it every day, the risk of HIV infection was 92 percent lower than those not on the drug.\n\nThere's one other thing, the CDC says.

Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nThe study - the first trial to publish five-year results from SBRT treatment for prostate cancer - found a 98.6 percent cure rate with SBRT, a noninvasive form of radiation treatment that involves high-dose radiation beams entering the body through various angles and intersecting at the desired target. It is a state-of-the-art technology that allows for a concentrated dose to reach the tumor while limiting the radiation dose to surrounding healthy tissue.\n\n\"The high cure rate is striking when compared to the reported five-year cure rates from other approaches like surgery or conventional radiation, which range between 80 to 90 percent, while the side effects of this treatment are comparable to other types of treatment,\" said Dr. Raquibul Hannan, Assistant Professor of Radiation Oncology and lead author for the study. \"What we now have is a more potent and effective form of completely noninvasive treatment for prostate cancer, conveniently completed in five treatments.\"\n\u2022 Prostatectomy, the surgical removal of the prostate gland, which can be done with minimally invasive techniques and robotic assistance;\n\u2022 Brachytherapy, in which doctors implant numerous small radioactive seeds about the size of a grain of rice into the prostate gland using multiple large needles inserted through the skin in the operating room. Once implanted, the seeds release their radioactivity directly into the prostate gland; and\n\u2022 External beam radiation, which involves 42 to 45 treatments administered over two or more months, five days a week.\n\n\"The current form of radiation is 44 treatments given over nine weeks. In contrast, the SBRT therapy we used allows the delivery of highly focused radiation in only five treatments, allowing patients to return to their normal lives more quickly,\" said senior author Dr. Robert Timmerman, Director of the Annette Simmons Stereotactic Treatment Center at UT Southwestern, and Professor and Vice Chairman of the Department of Radiation Oncology. \"SBRT is both more convenient and has increased potency.\"\n\nUT Southwestern served as the lead site for the multi-institutional clinical trial, which involved first-time prostate cancer patients diagnosed with stage I or stage II (low and intermediate risk) prostate cancer. A total of 91 patients were treated prospectively and followed for five years, with only one patient experiencing a recurrence of his cancer. The findings are published in the European Journal of Cancer.\n\nTerry Martin of McKinney, Texas, - about an hour outside Dallas - said the fewer number of treatments was a compelling advantage when he was evaluating treatment options.\n\n\"I live 45 minutes away from UT Southwestern. The difference between being treated five times versus 44 times is enormous,\" said Mr. Martin, a retired airline pilot. \"I felt that I was back to normal just 10 days after finishing treatment.\"\n\nIn addition to shorter treatment times, researchers found that side effects were not necessarily different compared to other forms of prostate cancer treatment. In the short term, the side effects of SBRT can include urinary issues (urgency, frequency and burning) and rectal irritation, which are often temporary and reverse within four weeks of treatment. Researchers found a small risk of longer-term urinary and rectal complications, which is also comparable to conventional treatments. Decrease in erectile function was seen in 25 percent of patients, fewer than with conventional radiation or surgery, said Dr. Hannan.\n\nTo reduce the side effects associated with SBRT, current clinical trials at UTSW are using a unique and biodegradable rectal spacer gel to protect the rectum. UTSW is currently the only accredited site in Texas at which this spacer gel can be used.\n\nOther clinical trials at the UTSW Department of Radiation Oncology are seeking to expand the application of SBRT to high-risk (Stage III) prostate cancer patients. \"Our hope is that the high potency of this form of treatment will significantly improve treatment of these patients,\" says Dr. Hannan, the principal investigator of the high-risk prostate SBRT trial.\n\nUT Southwestern has been a leader in pioneering use of SBRT. Dr. Timmerman, Director of Image-Guided Stereotactic Radiation Therapy, Medical Director of Radiation Oncology, and holder of the Effie Marie Cain Distinguished Chair in Cancer Therapy Research, has served as the lead investigator in several national trials designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SBRT to treat other types of cancer, including cancer in the lung, liver, and spine. A range of clinical trials of SBRT therapy are under way at Simmons Cancer Center, including new investigations evaluating use of SBRT for cancers in the breast and larynx.\n\nSince 2009, UT Southwestern has trained more than 300 physicians and peers interested in implementing SBRT in their clinical practice. Simmons Cancer Center's arsenal of stereotactic radiotherapy technology includes the cutting-edge Gamma Knife, CyberKnife, Agility, Vero SBRT and TrueBeam technologies.\n\nThe SBRT study for prostate cancer was supported by a grant from the U.S. Department of Defense.

One expert, Dr. Dale Bredesen, a professor at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and a professor at the Easton Laboratories for Neurodegenerative Disease Research at UCLA, thinks he might have found a way to reverse memory loss, a hallmark of the disease.\n\nIn a study published in the journal Aging, Bredesen and colleagues showed how 10 patients who were experiencing age-related memory decline showed brain scan improvements after following an approach called metabolic enhancement for neurodegeneration (MEND), a 36-point individualized regimen of diet, exercise, brain stimulation, sleep improvements, medication and vitamins and other specific protocols for five to 24 months.\n\nFor example, an MRI of one patient showed hippocampal volume at the 17th percentile for his age range prior to MEND. (The hippocampus is a brain area critical for learning and memory that shrinks in Alzheimer's patients.) After 10 months of following the prescribed protocol, his hippocampal volume increased to the 75th percentile.\n\nThe study noted that some of the patients who had to quit working as a result of their memory decline, were able to return to work after adopting MEND and participants who were struggling at their jobs reported an improvement in job performance.\n\n\"Lives have been dramatically impacted,\" Bredesen told CBS News. \"I'm enthusiastic about that and continue to evolve the protocol.\"\n\nJames E. Galvin, M.D., M.P.H., a professor of clinical biomedical science at FAU's Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine and a professor in the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing, who was not involved in the study, agreed that personalized approaches such as the MEND protocol are the types of approaches needed for this disease going forward. \"It's important to be excited about this approach,\" he told CBS News. However, Galvin cautioned, \"I'm not sure about the method.\"\n\nThe MEND protocol, outlined in a 2014 study in the journal Aging, calls for interventions to treat conditions that could be associated with Alzheimer's such as inflammation, stress and diabetes. However, MEND also requires the use of supplements which are not well studied and do not require FDA approval.\n\n\"Not all things from the approach have a lot of scientific support behind them,\" Galvin told CBS News.\n\nBut Bredesen believes that the only way to treat Alzheimer's is to treat all of the underlying problems, which may require intervention with supplements. \"Nutrition, exercise, sleep, stress reduction -- these are all critical pieces of this,\" he told CBS News. \"It's about optimizing biochemistry for your genetics, whatever it takes.\"\n\nBut even if MEND is effective, the program is complex and difficult to follow. A Buck Institute press release on the study stated: \"None of the patients were able to stick to the entire protocol. The significant diet and lifestyle changes, and multiple pills required each day, were the two most common complaints.\"\n\nBredesen said that to simplify the program, they are connecting patients with health coaches. \"We're trying to make it simpler, but we don't want to lose the efficacy,\" he said.\n\nBredesen noted, too, that the MEND protocol was suitable for patients in the early stages of Alzheimer's. One participant from the 2014 study, who had been diagnosed with late-stage Alzheimer's, did not show improvements with the protocol.\n\n\"If you told me that your mother is 86 and living in a home, I would say that I'd want to treat you,\" he said. \"It's about prevention.\"\n\nBredesen said that his team has a couple of larger trials planned to confirm or refute the results in the current study and to address key questions about how long results can be maintained and how late in the course of cognitive decline reversal is possible.\n\nGalvin agrees that more research is necessary before any conclusive results can be reported. \"This is moving in the right direction,\" he told CBS News. \"These anecdotal case reports provide a nice point to start a discussion.\"", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There\u2019s no exaggeration of the seriousness of Alzheimer\u2019s.

Every year 4.9 million babies are born with a birth defect worldwide and one in four pregnant women suffer a miscarriage in Australia. In the vast majority of cases the cause of these problems has remained a mystery. Until now.\n\nThis breakthrough, led by Professor Sally Dunwoodie from the Victor Chang Institute, has identified a cause of recurrent miscarriages as well as heart, spinal, kidney and cleft palate problems in newborn babies.\n\n \n\n\u201cThe ramifications are likely to be huge. This has the potential to significantly reduce the number of miscarriages and birth defects around the world, and I do not use those words lightly,\u201d says Professor Dunwoodie.\n\nThe landmark study found that a deficiency in a vital molecule, known as NAD, can prevent a baby\u2019s organs from developing correctly in the womb.\n\nNicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is one of the most important molecules in all living cells. NAD synthesis is essential for energy production, DNA repair and cell communication. Environmental and genetic factors can disrupt its production, which can cause a NAD deficiency.\n\nWorld first research at the Victor Chang Institute has found that this deficiency can be particularly harmful during a pregnancy as it can cripple an embryo when it is forming.\n\n\u201cNow, after 12 years of research, our team has also discovered that this deficiency can potentially be cured and miscarriages and birth defects prevented by taking a common vitamin,\u201d Professor Dunwoodie revealed.\n\nAt the heart of the paramount discovery is the dietary supplement vitamin B3, also known as niacin. Scientists at the Victor Chang Institute have discovered simply boosting levels of this nutrient during pregnancy can potentially prevent recurrent miscarriages and birth defects.\n\nVitamin B3 is required to make NAD and is typically found in meats and green vegetables as well as vegemite. However, a recent study[i] found that despite taking vitamin supplements at least a third of pregnant women have low levels of vitamin B3 in their first trimester, which is the critical time in organ development. By the third trimester, vitamin B3 levels were low in 60% of pregnant women. This indicates pregnant women may require more vitamin B3 than is currently available in most vitamin supplements.\n\nUsing a preclinical mouse model, scientists at the Victor Chang Institute investigated the effect of vitamin B3 on developing embryos. The results were astounding.\n\nBefore vitamin B3 was introduced into the mother\u2019s diet, embryos were either lost through miscarriage or the offspring were born with a range of severe birth defects. After the dietary change, both the miscarriages and birth defects were completely prevented, with all the offspring born perfectly healthy.\n\nThis discovery is akin to the revolutionary breakthrough made last century that confirmed folic acid supplementation can prevent spina bifida and other neural tube defects in babies. As a result, consumption of folic acid has been adopted by expectant mothers worldwide, and the addition of folate to our food supply has led to a 70% decrease in the number of babies born with neural tube defects.\n\nAccording to the Executive Director of the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, Professor Robert Graham, the implications are profound.\n\n\u201cJust like we now use folate to prevent spina bifida, Professor Dunwoodie\u2019s research suggests that it is probably best for women to start taking vitamin B3 very early on, even before they become pregnant. This could change the way pregnant women are cared for around the world,\u201d said Professor Graham.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this breakthrough will be one of our country\u2019s greatest medical discoveries. It\u2019s extremely rare to discover the problem and provide a preventive solution at the same time. It\u2019s actually a double breakthrough,\u201d said Professor Graham.\n\nThe next step will be to develop a diagnostic test to measure NAD levels. This will enable doctors to identify those women who are at greatest risk of having a baby with a birth defect, and ensure they are getting sufficient vitamin B3.\n\nThe findings have been released today by the New England Journal of Medicine \u2013 the most prestigious clinical research publication in the world. http://www.nejm.org/\n\nThis study would not have been possible without the generous support of the Chain Reaction Foundation, the Key Foundation and the National Health and Medical Research Council.\n\u2022 4.9 million babies are born with a serious birth defect worldwide every year\n\u2022 3.3 million children under five die from serious birth defects annually\n\u2022 Congenital heart disease is the most common form of birth defect, affecting 1 in 100 babies\n\u2022 42 babies are born with a heart defect in Australia every week\n\u2022 30 babies will undergo heart surgery in Australia every week\n\u2022 Heart defects account for 30% of deaths in children under five\n\n[1] Baker H, DeAngelis B, Holland B, Gittens-Williams L, Barrett T Jr. Vitamin Profile of 563 Gravidas during Trimesters of Pregnancy.

Despite its longtime use, warfarin remains tricky to dose because a person's genetic makeup influences how the drug is processed in the body. Too much warfarin can cause internal bleeding; too little warfarin fails to prevent blood clots.\n\nNow, a new study led by Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis shows that dosing warfarin (Coumadin and others) is safer -- producing fewer adverse events such as hemorrhage -- when key elements of a patient's genetic makeup are considered.\n\nThe research, published Sept. 26 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, reports results from the clinical trial known as GIFT (Genetics Informatics Trial of Warfarin to Prevent Deep Venous Thrombosis).\n\n\"Physicians have been prescribing warfarin since the Eisenhower administration,\" said first author Brian F. Gage, MD, a professor of medicine at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. \"It's a widely used anticoagulant, but it causes more major adverse events than any other oral drug. Thousands of patients end up in the emergency department or hospital because of warfarin-induced bleeding. But we continue to prescribe it because it is highly effective, reversible and inexpensive. So our goal is to make warfarin safer. GIFT showed that precision-medicine based on clinical factors and three genes improves the safety of initiating warfarin therapy.\"\n\nPatients in the trial were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group received warfarin dosing based on standard factors such as age, height and weight; the second group was dosed based on these clinical factors plus genetic variants. Participating sites in the trial included Washington University School of Medicine, Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, Intermountain Healthcare, University of Utah, and Rush University Medical Center.\n\nOf the 789 patients who were dosed in the traditional manner, 116 experienced at least one adverse event (14.7 percent). Of the 808 patients whose warfarin dosing was guided by genetic testing, 87 experienced an adverse event (10.8 percent). Compared with patients receiving traditional warfarin dosing, patients dosed with the genetic approach had a 27 percent reduction in adverse events, which was statistically different. The adverse events were bleeding, formation of blood clots in the veins and warfarin overdoses. No patient died during the trial.\n\nEarlier studies looking at whether genetic testing could improve warfarin dosing had produced conflicting results. However, these studies were smaller and considered fewer genes than GIFT. GIFT enrolled 1,600 patients age 65 and older at high risk of blood clots because they underwent hip- or knee-replacement surgeries.\n\nUnlike prior studies, GIFT took into account genetic variants in three genes for 11 days of warfarin therapy. Genetic variants were assessed on a commercial platform called GenMarkDx. Variants in one gene affect vitamin K recycling. Variants in another gene affect warfarin sensitivity. Variants in the third gene alter warfarin metabolism in the liver and can cause an overdose if the dose is not adjusted soon enough.\n\n\"There are additional genetic variants that may help to guide warfarin dosing, especially among patients with African ancestry,\" Gage said. In the future, we hope to quantify how these variants affect warfarin.\"\n\nGage also noted how health-care costs relate to dosing warfarin in a genetically guided manner. \"Although genetic testing is more expensive than clinical dosing, the cost is falling,\" he said. \"In our study, we estimated that genetic testing costs less than $200 per person, which is less than one month of a newer anticoagulant.\"\n\nThis work was supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), grant numbers R01HL097036 and UL1TR000448; the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, grant number CAG-00400N; and GenMarkDx, which supplied instrumentation.\n\nGage BF, Bass AR, Lin H, Woller SC, Stevens SM, Al-Hammadi N, Li J, Rodriguez Jr. T, Miller JP, McMillin GA, Pendleton RC, Jaffer AK, King CR, DeVore B, Porche-Sorbet R, Napoli L, Merritt K, Thompson AM, Hyun G, Anderson JL, Hollomon W, Barrack RL, Nunley RM, Moskowitz G, Davila-Roman V and Eby CS for the GIFT investigators.

Our test takes us closer to that dream.\"\n\nAhlquist was scheduled to present the findings of the study Thursday in Philadelphia at a meeting on colorectal cancer sponsored by the American Association for Cancer Research.\n\nThe new technology, called the Cologuard sDNA test, works by identifying specific altered DNA in cells shed by pre-cancerous or cancerous polyps into the patient's stool.\n\nIf a DNA abnormality is found, a colonoscopy would still be needed to confirm the results, just as happens now after a positive fecal occult blood test (FOBT) result.\n\nTo see whether the test was effective, Ahlquist's team tried it out on more than 1,100 frozen stool samples from patients with and without colorectal cancer.\n\nThe test was able to detect 85.3 percent of colorectal cancers and 63.8 percent of polyps bigger than 1 centimeter. Polyps this size are considered pre-cancers and most likely to progress to cancer, Ahlquist said.\n\nThe sensitivity of the test is much better than what has been seen in other stool screening tests, the ACS' Brooks added. \"But, showing that in a small group of samples is very different from demonstrating that in a population where only a small number of individuals are going to have polyps of that size. Then we will know if this is a big step forward,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Ahlquist, Cologuard is the first noninvasive test to detect pre-cancerous polyps, he added.\n\nIn addition, the test is the only one that is able to identify cancer in all locations throughout the colon, something which other tests either can't or don't do well, Ahlquist said.\n\nOne more advantage: patients do not need to do any special preparation before taking the test, something that other tests require, he added.\n\nAhlquist noted that the test still needs to be refined. \"We learned there are still some bugs and we can make the test even better,\" he said.\n\nCologuard is not yet available for sale. Clinical trials comparing the test with colonoscopy are slated to start next year. Ahlquist hopes that the test will be approved and available within two years.\n\nAhlquist noted that the cost of the test has not yet been established. It is expected to cost more than a fecal occult blood test, but far less than a colonoscopy. A fecal occult blood test can cost as little as $23 while a colonoscopy can total $700.\n\nAnother benefit is that it would probably need to be done once every three years, while the fecal occult blood test is usually done yearly. Savings over time on a more accurate test done fewer times could justify the higher cost of the Cologuard test, Ahlquist said.\n\nIn two other presentations at the meeting, researchers have linked key gene variants to the risk for colon cancer and also to the prognosis of the disease.\n\nIn one study, researchers found that people who have long telomeres, the small strips of DNA that cover the ends of chromosomes, have a 30 percent increased risk of developing colon cancer.\n\n\"Even for people their age, their telomeres were longer than you'd expect for healthy people,\" lead researcher Dr. Lisa A. Boardman, an associate professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic, said in a statement. \"This suggests that there may be two different mechanisms that affect telomere length and that set up susceptibility to cancer,\" she said.\n\nIn the other study, a research team led by Kim M. Smits, a molecular biologist and epidemiologist in the GROW-School for Oncology and Developmental Biology at Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands, uncovered a surprise when it came to a gene variant on the KRAS gene called the G variant. This variant, long linked to poorer outcomes in advanced colorectal cancer, actually predicted a better prognosis in early-stage colon cancer.\n\n\"You would intuitively think that the G variant would be associated with a poorer prognosis, as it is in late-stage colorectal cancer, but that is not the case,\" Smits said in a statement.\n\nExperts point out that studies presented at scientific meetings do not have to pass the rigorous peer review of studies published in reputable journals.\n\nFor more information on colon cancer, visit the American Cancer Society.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering here.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "MONDAY, Oct. 9, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Drinking plenty of water each day may have an unexpected benefit -- staving off urinary tract infections, a new study reports.\n\nYoung women plagued by UTIs who drank an additional 6 cups of water each day were nearly half -- 48 percent -- as likely as a control group to have another infection, the study showed.\n\nThe water group also reduced their use of antibiotics by roughly half -- or 47 percent.\n\nWhat's more, the amount of time that passed before a woman's next UTI and between recurrent infections was longer in the water group than in the control group.\n\nWomen are more prone to UTIs than men, partly due to their anatomy. A shorter urethra makes it easier for bacteria from rectum to enter the vagina and travel to the bladder.\n\nStudy author Dr. Thomas Hooton said it's thought that increasing fluid intake decreases UTI risk in two ways: by preventing bacteria from adhering to the bladder and by reducing the overall concentration of bacteria that could cause an infection.\n\n\"Flushing bacteria out of the bladder, it's been known, at least it's been thought, that it is protective. This study suggests that it is,\" said Hooton, clinical director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Miami School of Medicine.\n\nDr. Hunter Wessells, who wasn't involved in the study, called the additional fluid intake \"substantial,\" leading to a corresponding increase in urine output.\n\n\"It is the urine output which is of course the key factor leading to the effect seen in the study,\" said Wessells, chair of the department of urology at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.\n\nDr. Susan Bleasdale, medical director of infection control at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said the study \"may be a game changer\" for antibiotic \"stewardship\" programs aimed at reducing inappropriate antibiotic use.\n\nShe cited a 2010 review estimating that 11 million to 12 million women a year will suffer from a UTI, accounting for 1.6 billion antibiotic prescriptions a year.\n\n\"We might not even need to use antibiotics,\" she said.\n\nThe study, conducted in Bulgaria, involved 140 healthy premenopausal women who had at least three UTIs in the past year. All reported low daily fluid intake. They drank roughly four cups of fluid per day, including just 2 cups of water a day.\n\nHalf of the women in the study were asked to consume 1.5 liters of water, or about 6 cups, each day in addition to their usual daily fluid intake. Specifically, they were asked to begin drinking a 1/2-liter water bottle at each meal and finish each bottle before the next meal.\n\nThe remaining women served as a control group. They continued their usual fluid intake.\n\nThe women were followed for a year, with clinic visits at the beginning of the study as well as 6 and 12 months later. Researchers measured their water and fluid intake; urine volume, frequency and concentration; and symptoms. They also called the women each month to assess compliance and counsel them to return to the clinic for evaluation and possible treatment if they were experiencing UTI symptoms.\n\nOverall, the water group increased daily water intake by close to 5 cups a day. Their total daily fluid intake, including water and other beverages, averaged nearly 12 cups.\n\nBy contrast, the control group's total daily fluid intake was less than half of that.\n\nHooton noted that it's not clear exactly how much fluid intake must increase to deliver a benefit.\n\n\"There's no magic in a liter-and-a-half,\" he said.\n\nLikewise, he believes any increase in fluid -- not just water -- may be beneficial since fluids are mostly water. And while the study involved younger women, he said older women who experience recurrent UTIs may benefit from increasing their daily fluid intake as well.\n\nWhether the advice would benefit women with normal urine output, however, is unclear, Wessells noted.\n\n\"In addition, the bother associated with the higher urine output, and feasibility of implementing this water intake strategy across a range of occupations and ages, requires further study as well,\" he said.\n\nResearchers presented the findings Saturday at IDWeek 2017, the annual meeting of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, the HIV Medicine Association and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society.\n\nResearch presented at meetings is generally considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed publication.\n\nVisit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more on UTIs.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story did not disease-monger and it discussed the prevalence of UTIs and why they affect women more often.

It is less useful for some of the most common diseases, such as heart disease or diabetes, because they are influenced by vast numbers of genes-gone-wrong working together in complicated ways.\n\nOn Monday, researchers revealed a new way to measure millions of small genetic variations that add up to cause harm, letting them calculate someone's inherited risk for the most common form of heart disease and four other serious disorders. They estimated that up to 25 million Americans may have triple the average person's risk for coronary artery disease even if they haven't yet developed warning signs like high cholesterol.\n\n\"What I foresee is in five years, each person will know this risk number, this 'polygenic risk score,' similar to the way each person knows his or her cholesterol,\" said Dr. Sekar Kathiresan, who led the research team from the Broad Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School.\n\nIf the approach pans out and doctors adopt it, a bad score wouldn't mean that you'd get a disease, just that your genetic makeup increases the chance \u2014 one more piece of information in deciding on care. For example, when the researchers tested the system using a DNA database from Britain, less than 1 percent of people with the lowest risk scores were diagnosed with coronary artery disease, compared with 11 percent of people with the highest risk score.\n\n\"There are things you can do to lower the risk,\" Kathiresan said \u2014 the usual advice about diet, exercise, cholesterol medication and not smoking helps.\n\nOn the flip side, a low-risk score \"doesn't give you a free pass,\" he added. An unhealthy lifestyle could overwhelm the protection of good genes.\n\nThe scoring system can also predict an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, breast cancer and an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation, the team reported in the journal Nature Genetics \u2014 noting that next steps include learning what might likewise lower those risks.\n\nIt doesn't require the most sophisticated type of genetic testing. Instead, Kathiresan can calculate risk scores for those five diseases \u2014 eventually maybe more \u2014 simply by reanalyzing the kind of raw data people receive after sending a cheek swab to companies like 23andMe.\n\nA geneticist who specializes in cardiovascular disease, he hopes to open a website where people can send in such data to learn their heart risk, as part of continuing research.

Hong, director of cardiovascular research at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. \"The only disappointment is that this score applies only to those with European ancestry, so I wonder if similar scores are in the works for the large majority of the world population that is not white.\"\n\nHong pointed to a friend who recently died of a massive heart attack despite being a superfit marathon runner who'd never smoked, the kind of puzzling death that doctors have long hoped that a better understanding of genetics could help to prevent.\n\n\"Most of the variation in disease risk comes from an enormous number of very tiny effects\" in genes, agreed Stanford University genetics Professor Jonathan Pritchard. \"This is the first time polygenic scores have really been shown to reach the level of precision where they can have an impact\" on patient health.\n\nFirst, the Boston-based team combed previous studies that mapped the DNA of large numbers of people, looking for links to the five diseases \u2014 not outright mutations but minor misspellings in the genetic code.\n\nEach variation alone would have only a tiny effect on health.

Although there is ongoing debate regarding the safety and effectiveness of vaginal laser surgery, a new study suggests that it may be effective, especially after multiple treatments. Study results are published online in Menopause, the journal of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS).\n\nCollectively known as the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), the various genital and urinary problems associated with menopause have created a market for new therapies and treatments to help women regain sexual function and bladder control. Vaginal laser surgery represents one of the newer and more hotly contested approaches.\n\nIn the case of microablative fractional CO2 laser surgery, a series of microscopic laser beams using fractionated energy penetrate the skin to remove old and damaged skin cells, intended to rebuild the vaginal pathway. In this new study, GSM symptoms were evaluated up to12 months after the last laser surgery and compared based on the number of total therapies applied (up to a total of five).\n\nThe results of this small, retrospective, non-sham-controlled study demonstrated that this type of laser surgery was particularly effective in reducing the intensity of dyspareunia (painful sex) and dryness. It further demonstrated that four or five laser therapies may be superior in lowering the intensity of GSM symptoms compared with three laser therapies in both short- and long-term follow-up. Study results are published in the article \"Microablative fractional CO2 laser for the genitourinary syndrome of menopause: up to 12-month results.\"\n\n\"This study adds to the literature on vaginal laser therapy for GSM.

George of the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, the lead author of the new study.\n\nThe biggest issue with studies so far, he explained, has been that it\u2019s tough to fake the sound and sensation of the real device in order to run a gold standard clinical trial in which some people get the treatment, and others get a sham treatment, no one knowing which.\n\nBut George and his team say they\u2019ve solved that problem by developing a dummy device that clicks in a similar way to the real thing and causes a person\u2019s eye muscles to twitch, just like real a TMS device.\n\nIn the May issue of the Archives of General Psychiatry, George and his colleagues report the results of their 190-patient study, the most rigorous investigation of TMS for depression so far. The researchers randomly assigned participants to receive 37.5 minutes of TMS delivered to a part of the brain region that plays a role in emotion, or 37.5 minutes of sham TMS, once a day for three weeks.\n\nAfter three weeks, 14 percent of patients in the real TMS group had recovered from their depression, compared to 5 percent of the sham TMS group; people who had the real treatment were four times as likely to get better as those who got the fake treatment.\n\nBased on the results, George and his team say, it would be necessary to treat 12 depressed patients with TMS in order to have one patient recover.\n\nEighty-eight percent of the study participants completed the first phase of the trial. Patients in both groups were equally likely to report side effects, which included headache, discomfort at the TMS site, and eye twitching.\n\nIn a second phase of the study, all patients were given the real TMS treatment. Thirty percent of the patients in the second phase recovered from depression.\n\nHow long the treatment should last is not yet clear. \u201cIt\u2019s very muddy now exactly how long we need to treat patients,\u201d George said. \u201cIt looks as if from this trial you at least need to try three weeks and maybe even six weeks before you would give up.\u201d\n\nPatients who got better were prescribed venlafaxine - marketed as Effexor \u2014 and a small dose of lithium, noted George, a combination that\u2019s been shown to help people stay well after their depression has remitted. George said he and his colleagues would like to study whether giving people TMS intermittently instead of putting them on antidepressants would produce equally durable effects.\n\nTMS works by producing an electrical current that can pass through the skull and into the target area of the brain. George said he believes the approach works by \u201cresetting\u201d electrical activity and restoring normal mood regulation.\n\nSomething similar is likely happening, he added, with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), or what is sometimes referred to as \u201celectroshock treatment.\u201d Sixty to 70 percent of depressed people who undergo ECT, in which electrodes placed on the front of the brain induce a convulsion while the patient is anesthetized, will recover.\n\nGeorge said he hopes that by better understanding where TMS should be delivered and by figuring out the best dose and duration of treatment, success rates closer to those of ECT might be achieved. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that it\u2019s pointing us in a path of understanding how to interact with the brain in a non-invasive way to get people well.\u201d", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "This story doesn\u2019t resort to disease-mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The researchers report that nearly half of the cases of prostate cancer among the roughly 5,000 men in the study could be attributed to the five gene regions and a family history, with some men having one or two of the gene variants and others having all five and a family history.\n\nProstate cancer becomes more common as men age \u2014 autopsies of elderly men find that most had prostate cancer, whether they knew it or not. But the men in this study had an average age of about 65, when the disease is less common and more likely to kill.\n\nWilliam B. Isaacs, a professor of urology and oncology at Johns Hopkins University and an author of the new report, said that if research validates what has been found, men may want to get the new genetic test when they are young, 35, say. Those at high risk because of their genetics might then choose to start prostate-cancer screening earlier than the usual age of about 50, using a blood test that looks for proteins secreted by prostate tumors.\n\n\u201cI think that makes sense,\u201d said Dr. Howard Sandler, a professor of radiation oncology at the University of Michigan and a spokesman for the American Society of Clinical Oncology.\n\nBut others worry that more frequent testing could exacerbate what is already a major problem: most prostate cancers grow so slowly that they would have been harmless if left alone. But since doctors cannot tell which are dangerous, they treat nearly all that they find. And treatment has serious side effects, including, often, impotence and incontinence.

It was released online on Wednesday, a journal spokeswoman said, because \u201cit is a very active area of research with a lot of competition.\u201d\n\nResearchers long knew that the disease often runs in families. Though scientists spent years looking for genes, they found none that were reproducibly associated with a marked effect.\n\nWith new technology to scan the entire length of a person\u2019s DNA, researchers tried a new approach. They began looking for small variations in tiny DNA regions that were associated with prostate cancer. That resulted in the discovery, by several groups of investigators in Iceland and the United States, of the gene variants, small alterations in gene sequences. Unlike traditional genetic links to disease, the variants are not mutations that destroy a gene\u2019s function. In fact, no one knows what their effect is.\n\nThe next step was to ask whether those variants really could predict who had prostate cancer. So Dr. Jianfeng Xu, a professor of epidemiology and cancer biology at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, and his colleagues studied a Swedish population of 2,893 men with prostate cancer and 1,781 men who did not have it. That led to their finding that each of the five variants independently predicted prostate cancer risk.\n\n\u201cEach confers a moderate risk,\u201d Dr. Xu said, adding that the effect of having just one of the variants \u2014 a 10 or 20 percent increase in a man\u2019s chance of having prostate cancer \u2014 was not enough to justify using a single variant for screening. But, he added, because each conferred an independent risk, the risks added up so that the more men had, the greater their risk. Then they found that family history of the cancer added an independent risk. \u201cThat was very, very surprising to us,\u201d Dr. Xu said.\n\nThe next step, Dr. Isaacs said, is to look in other populations. \u201cWe think that can happen almost instantaneously,\u201d he said, explaining how scientists have blood samples and family histories of thousands of men who were tested for prostate cancer.\n\nBut some said that if the test leads to more screening, it is not necessarily a good thing. There is already too much prostate-cancer screening, they say, resulting in too much treatment. \u201cTo me, it is a nightmare,\u201d Dr. Albertsen said. \u201cWe are just feeding off of this cancer phobia.\u201d\n\nWhat is needed, and what the new test does not provide, is a way to decide which cancers are dangerous and which are not, Dr. Isaacs said. Still, he said the new test could help patients if it was used with caution. \u201cWe may be premature with this idea \u2014 everyone has a different way of thinking about this \u2014 but it should not take five years to know if we are on the right track. All this can happen very rapidly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have worked with enough families that have a positive family history to know that people are anxious to know their risk of prostate cancer,\u201d he said.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "A couple of the quotes border on disease-mongering when discussing the prospect of earlier prostate cancer screening \u2013 even in men in their 30s..

They have been able to show in a controlled trial that targeting this area with magnetic pulses can improve the condition in some patients. This early clinical work is presented at the ECNP conference in Paris on Tuesday 5th September, with later publication in Schizophrenia Bulletin*.\n\n\"This is the first controlled trial to precisely determine an anatomically defined brain area where high frequency magnetic pulses can improve the hearing of voices\", said lead researcher, Professor Sonia Dollfus (University of Caen, CHU, France).\n\nSchizophrenia is a serious long-term mental health problem. People with schizophrenia experience a range of symptoms, which may include delusions, muddled thoughts and hallucinations. One of the best-known is hearing voices, also known as Auditory Verbal Hallucination (AVH), which around 70% of people with schizophrenia experience at some point. These voices, may be 'heard' as having a variety of different characteristics, for example as internal or external, friendly or threatening, they may be continuously present or present only occasionally, and so on.\n\nTranscranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been suggested as a possible way of treating the hearing of voices in schizophrenia. TMS uses magnetic pulses to the brain, and has been shown to be effective in several psychiatric conditions. However, there is a lack of controlled trials to show that TMS works effectively with AVH sufferers.\n\nThe French research team worked with 26 patients who received active TMS treatment, and 33 as a control group, who received sham (placebo) treatment. The researchers interviewed the patients using a standard protocol - the Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale - which revealed most of the characteristic features of the voices which they were hearing. The treated patients received a series of 20 Hz high-frequency magnetic pulses over 2 sessions a day for 2 days. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the pulses were targeted at a specific brain area in the temporal lobe, which is associated with language (the exact area is the crossing of the projection of the ascending branch of the left lateral sulcus and the left superior temporal sulcus)\n\nAfter 2 weeks, the patients were re-evaluated. The researchers found that 34.6% of the patients being treated by TMS showed a significant response, whereas only 9.1% of patients in the sham group responded ('significant response' was defined as a more than 30% decrease in the Total Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale score).\n\nProfessor Sonia Dollfus said: \"Auditory Verbal Hallucinations, or \"hearing voices\" can be a disturbing symptom of schizophrenia, both for patients and for those close to sufferers. This is the first controlled trial to show an improvement in these patients by targeting a specific area of the brain and using high frequency TMS. This means two things; firstly it seems that we now can say with some certainty that we have found a specific anatomical area of the brain associated with auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia. Secondly, we have shown that treatment with high frequency TMS makes a difference to at least some sufferers, although there is a long way to go before we will know if TMS is the best route to treat these patients in the long-term\".\n\nCommenting, Professor Andreas Meyer-Lindenberg, Central Institute of Mental Health, Mannheim and member of the ECNP executive board, said: \"This work builds on previous studies that have shown a critical role of excessive activity of subregions of the temporal lobe in the generation of voice hallucinations in schizophrenia. To move this into treatment, controlled trial such as the one by Dollfus and coworkers are important. While response rates were moderate, TMS is a welcome addition to the therapeutic repertoire especially for patients who do not respond to medication.\"\n\nNOTE: The full title of this release is \"Scientists discover brain area which can be targeted for treatment in patients with schizophrenia who 'hear voices'\" It has been shortened in some versions to comply with Eurekalert title limits.\n\n*This work has been accepted in the peer-reviewed journal Schizophrenia Bulletin: The Journal of Psychoses and Related Disorders.

But the results came back the same: His lethal leukemia had been wiped out by an experimental treatment never before used in humans.\n\n\u201cWe were hoping for a little improvement,\u201d remembered the 72-year-old retired New Jersey corrections officer, who had battled the disease for a decade. He and his oncologist both broke down when she delivered the good news in 2010. \u201cNobody was hoping for zero cancer.\u201d\n\nThe pioneering therapy administered to Ludwig and a few other adults at the University of Pennsylvania hospital paved the way for clinical trials with children. Six-year-old Emily Whitehead, who was near death, became the first pediatric recipient in 2012. Like Ludwig, she remains cancer-free.\n\nSuch results are why the treatment is on track to become the first gene therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration. An FDA advisory committee will decide Wednesday whether to recommend approval of the approach, which uses patients\u2019 own genetically altered immune cells to fight blood cancers.\n\nIf the panel gives the nod, the agency probably will follow suit by the end of September. That would open the latest chapter in immunotherapy \u2014 \u201ca true living drug,\u201d said Penn scientist Carl June, who led its development.\n\nThe CAR T-cell treatment, manufactured by the drug company Novartis, initially would be available only for the small number of children and young adults whose leukemia does not respond to standard care. Those patients typically have a grim prognosis, but in the pivotal trial testing the therapy in almost a dozen countries, 83 percent of patients went into remission. A year later, two-thirds remained so.\n\nAnd childhood leukemia is just the start for a field that has attracted intense interest in academia and industry. Kite Pharma of Santa Monica, Calif., has applied for FDA approval to treat aggressive non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, and a similar Novartis application is close behind. Researchers also are exploring CAR T-cell therapy\u2019s use for multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the disease that afflicted Ludwig. They are also tackling a far more difficult challenge \u2014 using the therapy for solid tumors in the lungs or brain, for example.\n\nThe excitement among doctors and researchers is palpable. \u201cWe\u2019re saving patients who three or four years ago we were at our wit\u2019s end trying to keep alive,\u201d said Stephen Schuster, the Penn oncologist who is leading a Novartis lymphoma study. That study and a Kite trial have shown that the treatment can put about one-third of adults with advanced disease \u2014 those who have exhausted all options \u2014 into remission.\n\nYet along with the enthusiasm come pressing questions about safety, cost and the complexity of the procedure.\n\nIt involves extracting white blood cells called T cells \u2014 the foot soldiers of the immune system \u2014 from a patient\u2019s blood, freezing them and sending them to Novartis\u2019s sprawling manufacturing plant in Morris Plains, N.J. There, a crippled HIV fragment is used to genetically modify the T cells so they can find and attack the cancer. The cells then are refrozen and sent back to be infused into the patient.\n\nOnce inside the person\u2019s body, the T-cell army multiplies astronomically.\n\nNovartis has not disclosed the price for its therapy, but analysts are predicting $300,000 to $600,000 for a one-time infusion. Brad Loncar, whose investment fund focuses on companies that develop immunotherapy treatments, hopes the cost does not prompt a backlash. \u201cCAR-T is not the EpiPen,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is truly pushing the envelope and at the cutting edge of science.\u201d\n\nThe biggest concerns, however, center on safety. The revved-up immune system becomes a potent cancer-fighting agent but also a dangerous threat to the patient. Serious side effects abound, raising concerns about broad use.\n\n\u201cTreating patients safely is the heart of the rollout,\u201d said Stephan Grupp of Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, who as director of the hospital\u2019s cancer immunotherapy program led early pediatric studies as well as Novartis\u2019s global trial. \u201cThe efficacy takes care of itself, but safety takes a lot of attention.\u201d\n\nOne of the most common side effects is called cytokine release syndrome, which causes high fever and flulike symptoms that in some cases can be so dangerous that the patient ends up in intensive care. The other major worry is neurotoxicity, which can result in temporary confusion or potentially fatal brain swelling. Juno Therapeutics, a biotech firm in Seattle, shut down one of its CAR T-cell programs after five patients died of brain swelling. Novartis has not seen brain swelling in its trials, company officials said.\n\nTo try to ensure patient safety, Novartis is not planning a typical product rollout, with a drug pushed as widely and aggressively as possible. The company instead will designate 30 to 35 medical centers to administer the treatment. Many of them took part in the clinical trial, and all have gotten extensive training by Grupp and others.\n\nGrupp said he and his staff learned about the side effects of CAR T-cell therapy \u2014 and what to do about them \u2014 through terrifying experiences that began five years ago with Emily Whitehead.\n\nThe young girl, who had relapsed twice on conventional treatments for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, was in grave condition. Grupp suggested to her parents that she be the first child to get the experimental therapy.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Surely, this has been tried on kids somewhere else in the world,\u2019 \u201d recalled her father, Thomas Whitehead of Philipsburg, Pa. \u201cBut Steve said, \u2018Nope, some adults got it, but that was a different kind of leukemia.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAfter she received the therapy, Emily\u2019s fever soared, her blood pressure plummeted, and she ended up in a coma and on a ventilator for two weeks in the hospital\u2019s intensive care unit. Convinced his patient would not survive another day, a frantic Grupp got rushed lab results that suggested a surge of the protein Interleukin 6 was causing her immune system to relentlessly hammer her body. Doctors decided to give Emily an immunosuppressant drug called tocilizumab.\n\nShe was dramatically better within hours. She woke up the next day, her seventh birthday. Tests showed her cancer was gone.\n\nThe approval of CAR T-cell therapy would represent the second big immunotherapy advance in less than a decade. In 2011, the FDA cleared the first agent in a new class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors. It has approved five more since then.\n\nThere are big differences between the two approaches. The checkpoint inhibitors are targeted at solid tumors, such as advanced melanoma and lung and bladder cancer, while CAR T-cell therapy has been aimed at blood disorders. And although checkpoint inhibitors are off the shelf, with every patient getting the same drug, CAR T-cell therapy is customized to an individual. Many immunotherapy experts think the greatest progress against cancer will be achieved when researchers figure out how to combine the approaches.\n\nFor the Penn team, the CAR T-cell story goes back decades, starting at the then-National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., where June and a postdoctorate fellow named Bruce Levine worked on new HIV treatments. In the process, they figured out a way to turbocharge T cells to make them more powerful and plentiful.\n\nThe pair moved to Philadelphia in 1999 and dove into cancer research. Two years later, June\u2019s wife died of ovarian cancer, something he has credited as spurring him to work even harder in the field. In the years that followed, researchers across the country, including at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, racked up an array of tantalizing discoveries involving T cells.\n\nFast-forward to 2010, when Ludwig, who lives in Bridgeton, N.J., became Penn\u2019s first patient to receive CAR T-cell therapy. Two other men got the treatment not long after. One is still in remission; the other relapsed and died.\n\nBut after those three patients, the Penn researchers ran out of money for more treatments. To try to raise interest and funding, they decided to publish the results of their work. The article that appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine in August 2011 created a \u201cfirestorm,\u201d June said \u2014 one that brought them new resources. David Porter, a Penn oncologist working with June, was on vacation in western Maryland and had to stop at a Kohl\u2019s to buy a dress shirt for the immediate TV interviews.\n\nThe pediatric trial opened the following spring with Emily. Six months later, Penn licensed its technology to Novartis in exchange for financial support, which included a new on-campus cell-manufacturing facility.\n\nWith FDA approval seeming imminent, the researchers who were so instrumental in the therapy\u2019s development and testing are almost giddy. Grupp is especially pleased that the advance will be available first to children. \u201cUsually everything is developed first for adults,\u201d he noted recently, \u201cand children are an afterthought.\u201d\n\n\u2018This is not the end\u2019: Using immunotherapy and a genetic glitch to give cancer patients hope\n\nThis 8-year-old is free of cancer \u2014 for now \u2014 after a \u2018breakthrough\u2019 treatment\n\nFor a 6-year-old with cancer, a future staked on medicine\u2019s hottest field", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There\u2019s really no disease mongering here, though there is one point that we\u2019d like to single out.

This amount of zinc is equivalent to what biofortified crops like zinc rice and zinc wheat can add to the diet of vulnerable, nutrient deficient populations.\n\nThe study, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, was led by CHORI Senior Scientist Janet King, PhD. King and her team are the first to show that a modest increase in dietary zinc reduces oxidative stress and damage to DNA.\n\n\"We were pleasantly surprised to see that just a small increase in dietary zinc can have such a significant impact on how metabolism is carried out throughout the body,\" says King. \"These results present a new strategy for measuring the impact of zinc on health and reinforce the evidence that food-based interventions can improve micronutrient deficiencies worldwide.\"\n\nZinc is ubiquitous in our body and facilitates many functions that are essential for preserving life. It plays a vital role in maintaining optimal childhood growth, and in ensuring a healthy immune system. Zinc also helps limit inflammation and oxidative stress in our body, which are associated with the onset of chronic cardiovascular diseases and cancers.\n\nAround much of the world, many households eat polished white rice or highly refined wheat or maize flours, which provide energy but do not provide enough essential micronutrients such as zinc. Zinc is an essential part of nearly 3,000 different proteins, and it impacts how these proteins regulate every cell in our body. In the absence of sufficient zinc, our ability to repair everyday wear and tear on our DNA is compromised.\n\nIn the randomized, controlled, six-week study the scientists measured the impact of zinc on human metabolism by counting DNA strand breaks. They used the parameter of DNA damage to examine the influence of a moderate amount of zinc on healthy living. This was a novel approach, different from the commonly used method of looking at zinc in the blood or using stunting and morbidity for assessing zinc status.\n\nAccording to King, these results are relevant to the planning and evaluation of food-based solutions for mitigating the impact of hidden hunger and malnutrition.

Chan School of Public Health, whose study appears in the journal Pediatrics, analyzed data from a large, ongoing, national study of nurses focused on factors that influence women's health.\n\n\"The results of this study emphasize the role of an early life high-fiber diet on prevention of breast cancer in later life. High consumption of foods rich in fiber such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains in early life may help to reduce breast cancer incidence,\" lead author Maryam Farvid, a visiting scientist at Harvard, told CBS News.\n\nThe findings showed that breast cancer risk was 12 to 19 percent lower among women who ate more dietary fiber in their youth, depending on how much more they ate. Eating more fiber during adolescence was linked to a 16 percent lower risk of breast cancer overall, and a 24 percent lower risk of breast cancer before menopause.\n\nFarvid said the findings show that each additional 10 grams per day increase in fiber intake during adolescence reduced the risk of breast cancer by 14 percent.\n\n\"Having the recommended 25 to 30 grams of fiber daily would decrease the risk by 30 percent and potentially even greater with higher fiber intake,\" Farvid said. \"Women are doing themselves a huge favor in terms of breast cancer prevention if they increase the amount of dietary fiber intake earlier in life rather than later.\"\n\nEating more fruits and vegetables was especially beneficial, the researchers said.\n\nHealthy high-fiber food choices include apples, pears, raspberries, artichokes, green peas, broccoli, split peas, lentils, beans, whole wheat pasta, whole grain bread, brown rice, bran flakes, and oatmeal.\n\nWhy would these foods have such an impact?\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, Duke University Medical Center's Dr. Kimberly Blackwell said there's longstanding evidence that dietary fiber may cut down on circulating estrogen levels through changes in the gut microbiome.\n\nShe said that recently more evidence has come to light suggesting a relationship between dietary fiber and breast cancer risk, and that eating more fiber would be a simple way to reduce risk.\n\nOne weakness she pointed out in the study is that the women were asked to recall details about their adolescent diet when they were in their 30s and 40s.

In the raw analysis, mothers who skipped the supplement were more than 2.1 times more likely to have a child with autistic disorder compared with mothers who took the supplement.\n\nAmong the 85,176 children in the study, 270 (or 0.32%) received an ASD diagnosis \u2013 114 (0.13%) had autistic disorder, 56 (0.07%) had Asperger syndrome and 100 (0.12%) were diagnosed with \u201cpervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified,\u201d or PPD-NOS.\n\nResearchers in Norway examined health records of more than 85,000 children born there between 1999 and 2009 to see whether they had some kind of autism diagnosis. They also looked at questionnaires completed by their mothers to see how much folic acid they were consuming in the month before they became pregnant and during the first eight weeks of pregnancy, a critical period of embryonic brain development. Health officials in Norway recommend that pregnant women (and women who are trying to get pregnant) take 400 micrograms of folic acid per day.\n\nMothers who took folic acid supplements around the time they became pregnant were less likely to have children with an autism spectrum disorder, a new study has found.\n\nBut not all mothers were equally likely to take folic acid supplements. Those who did were more likely to have attended college, to be nonsmokers, to be first-time mothers and to have planned their pregnancies. The researchers also found that the popularity of folic acid supplements rose as time went on. After the researchers controlled for factors like these, they calculated that taking the supplements was associated with a 39% lower risk of having a child with autistic disorder.\n\nThe raw numbers also showed that women who took extra folic acid were less likely to have kids with Asperger syndrome or PPD-NOS, but when other factors were taken into account, the association was no longer statistically significant and could have been due to chance, the researchers found.\n\nThe results were published in Wednesday\u2019s edition of the Journal of the American Medical Assn.\n\nThe study also looked at folic acid use later in pregnancy but found no correlation between that and the chances of a child developing an autism spectrum disorder. Nor did they find any link between fish oil supplements and risk of ASDs.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how these findings apply to mothers and children in the United States. Autism spectrum disorders are diagnosed much more frequently in the U.S. than in Norway.\n\nOn the other hand, pregnant women here are also far more likely to consume a healthy amount of the B vitamin because the Food and Drug Administration has required manufacturers of enriched breads, cereals and other grains to fortify them with folic acid since 1998. As a result, a cup of enriched white long-grain rice now contains 797 micrograms of folic acid, for example, and a cup of Cheerios has 493 mcg, according to this report from the Harvard Women\u2019s Health Watch.\n\nThe fact that autism cases have been on the rise in the U.S. even after folic acid supplementation became mandatory is a puzzle, according to three researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Division of Birth Defects and Developmental Disorders. In an editorial that accompanies the JAMA study, they write that the discrepancy \u201cmay be attributable to changes in diagnosis and surveillance but also may reflect a concurrent real increase in the risk of ASDs attributable to as-yet undescribed risk factors and exposures.\u201d They also note that data from the National Health Examination and Nutrition Survey published in 2009 show that the typical American consumes only 150 mcg of folic acid per day even with mandatory fortification.\n\nYou can read a summary of the study and the editorial on the JAMA website.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story mentions the puzzlement about why rates of autism appear to be rising in the US, thus giving readers a sense of how much remains unknown about potential causes or responses.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Oct. 26, 2011 -- An experimental drug called briakinumab appears to be more effective than a standard medication for treating psoriasis, a new study shows.\n\nThe study is published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

It is led by Enrique Schisterman of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Results are in the current online issue of Human Reproduction.\n\nRusso says, \"One of our main findings is that there was no overall relationship between most types of physical activity and the likelihood of becoming pregnant for women who had already had one or two pregnancy losses, except for walking, which was associated with higher likelihood of becoming pregnant among women who were overweight or obese.\"\n\nWhitcomb, whose research on the determinants of fertility and pregnancy outcomes usually involves studying biomarkers at the molecular level, adds, \"Lifestyle is definitely relevant to these outcomes because it can have an effect at the molecular level. What we eat and what we do are potential factors we can change to shape our health. So this sort of research is important because it helps provide information on the things people can actually do something about.\"\n\nFurther, he says, \"We were happy to be able to add scientific evidence to general recommendations about physical activity. This is especially true for the results about walking for even limited blocks of time. Walking has great potential as a lifestyle change because of its low cost and availability.\"\n\nFor the 1,214 women in the study, the association of walking with the ability to become pregnant, known as fecundability, varied significantly by body mass index, the authors report. Among overweight/obese women, walking at least 10 minutes at a time was associated with improvement in fecundability. Further, in statistically adjusted models, women reporting more than four hours a week of vigorous activity had significantly higher pregnancy chances compared to no vigorous activity.\n\nModerate activity, sitting and other activity categories were not associated with fecundability overall or in BMI-stratified analyses, they add. Russo and Whitcomb say one finding that is still not clear is the different associations related to vigorous compared to moderate and low-intensity activities. Whitcomb says, \"We don't know what to make of the finding that high intensity physical activity may have different biological effects than walking, but our study doesn't offer enough detail to get at why vigorous activity would work differently than other levels.\"\n\nAmong a number of cautions the researchers point to in this work is that physical activity is related to other behaviors and lifestyle factors, and women who are more physically active may be different from women who are less active in many ways. Russo says, \"We did our best to try to account for the differences and to address them statistically.\"\n\nThe researchers also note that the overall generalizability of this work is limited because the study population may not be representative of the general population with regard to fecundability, and exercise habits may differ in women with prior miscarriage compared to those without.\n\nWhitcomb says another way in which this study is distinct from other work in this area has to do with who was included in the study. The EAGeR trial focused on women with a history of one or two prior pregnancy losses. However, he adds, \"We were happy to be able to conduct research considering women having the most difficulty getting and staying pregnant, and to provide messages about common lifestyle factors they may be able to address.\"\n\nThe researchers conclude that \"these findings provide positive evidence for the benefits of physical activity in women attempting pregnancy, especially for walking among those with higher BMI.

Their average age was 69.\n\nAmong the nearly 2,000 women who completed the trial, increases in bone mineral density were greater with abaloparatide than placebo, the researchers found.\n\nIn addition, fewer cases of hypercalcemia (abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood) occurred among women taking abaloparatide (3 percent) than Forteo (6 percent).

However, relative risk can be misleading to patients and clinicians,(42) because the interpretation of a relative risk or its change is highly dependent on the baseline risk. For instance, doubling a minor risk is still minor, but doubling a common risk is alarming. It is therefore desirable that individuals who have BMD measurements be informed about their fracture probability risk category instead of their relative scores.(4) The lifetime risk estimates from this study provide such a means for communication of risk to an individual patient.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "While prenatal testing is widely used for pregnant women at risk of having babies with chromosome disorders such as Down syndrome, new research shows certain types of tests may also reveal markers of cancer in mothers.\n\nWhen Marin Mejia was pregnant with her son Owen, one such blood test that picks up DNA from mother and baby came back showing abnormal results.

Many are pushing for cannabis as a treatment for the abuse of opioids and illegal narcotics such as heroin, and as an alternative to painkillers.\n\nIt's a tempting sell in New England, hard hit by the painkiller and heroin crisis. But there's a problem: There is very little research showing marijuana works as a treatment for such addictions.\n\nAdvocates argue a growing body of scientific literature supports the idea, pointing to a study in the Journal of Pain this year that found that chronic pain sufferers significantly reduced their opioid use when taking medical cannabis. Another study, published last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found cannabis can be effective in treating chronic pain and other ailments.\n\nThe research falls short of concluding marijuana helps wean people off opioids - Vicodin, Oxycontin and related painkillers - and heroin, though. Many medical professionals say there's not enough evidence for them to confidently prescribe it.\n\nIn Maine, which is considering adding opioid and heroin addiction to the list of conditions that qualify for medical marijuana, Michelle Ham said marijuana helped her end a years-long addiction to painkillers prescribed for a bad back and neck. Tired of feeling \"like a zombie,\" the 37-year-old mother of two decided to quit cold turkey, which she said brought on convulsions and other withdrawal symptoms. Then, a friend mentioned marijuana, which Maine had legalized in 1999 for chronic pain and scores of other medical conditions. Ham gave it a try in 2013 and said the pain is under control and she hasn't gone back on the opioids.\n\n\"Before, I couldn't even function. I couldn't get anything done,\" Ham said. \"Now, I actually organize volunteers, and we have a donations center to help the needy.\"\n\nBolstered by stories like Ham's, doctors are experimenting with marijuana as an addiction treatment in Massachusetts and California. Supporters in Maine are pushing for its inclusion in qualifying conditions for medical marijuana. Vermonters are making the case for addiction treatment in their push to legalize pot.\n\nAuthorities are also desperate to curb a sharp rise in overdoses; Maine saw a 31 percent increase last year, and drug-related deaths in Vermont have jumped 44 percent since 2010. Vermont officials also blame opioid abuse for a 40 percent increase over the past two years of children in state custody.\n\n\"I don't think it's a cure for everybody,\" said Maine Rep. Diane Russell, a Portland Democrat and a leader in the state effort to legalize marijuana. \"But why take a solution off the table when people are telling us and physicians are telling us that it's working?\"\n\nMost states with medical marijuana allow it for a list of qualifying conditions. Getting on that list is crucial and has resulted in a tug of war in many states, including several in which veterans have been unsuccessful in getting post-traumatic stress disorder approved for marijuana treatment.\n\nThis month, Pennsylvania became the 24th state to legalize medical marijuana. Sen. Mike Vereb, a Republican, called on lawmakers to take on what he called \"the number-one killer in Pennsylvania\" - opioid abuse.\n\n\"Opioid abuse has no party, has no color, has no religion,\" Vereb said. \"Let's face it, that's the killer.

People are dying and, as a result, we ought to use things that are proven to be effective,\" said Dr. Richard Saitz, chair of the Department of Community Health Sciences at the Boston University School of Public Health.\n\nCannabis could have limited benefits as a treatment alternative, said Harvard Medical School's Dr. Kevin Hill, who last year authored the JAMA study that found benefits in using medical marijuana to treat chronic pain, neuropathic pain and spasticity related to multiple sclerosis. But he urged caution.\n\n\"If you are thinking about using cannabis as opposed to using opioids for chronic pain, then I do think the evidence does support it,\" he said. \"However, I think one place where sometimes cannabis advocates go too far is when they talk about using cannabis to treat opioid addiction.\"\n\nThe findings in the Journal of Pain study that found chronic pain sufferers reduced their opioid use when using medical pot were limited because participants self-reported the data.\n\nSubstance abuse experts argue there are already approved medications. It would also be wrong to portray marijuana as completely safe, they say, because it can also be addictive. But supporters point to doctors like Dr. Gary Witman, of Canna Care Docs, who has treated addicts with cannabis at his offices in Fall River, Stoughton and Worcester, Massachusetts.

And, for unknown reasons, the U.S. rate of preterm delivery has been going up in recent years.\n\nThat's why it's a pretty big deal that the Food and Drug Administration has OK'd a drug, called 17-HP, that experts say could make a dent in the preemie problem.\n\nNot a huge dent, but a significant one. The March of Dimes calculates that if all the women eligible to get the newly approved drug actually did, there would be 10,000 fewer preemies a year \u2013 out of more than half-a-million born that way.\n\n\"Although that may seem like a small percent, it's really a very extraordinary ability to impact on what is really a major public health problem,\" Dr. Alan Fleischman, the March of Dimes medical director, told Shots.\n\nAccording to the best research, the drug reduces the risk of premature birth by one-third among women who are at high risk because they had a previous preterm birth.\n\nThe drug is not for women whose prior premature births were of twins or other multiple births, or who are carrying more than one fetus in their current pregnancy. Nor is it for women who have other conditions that raise their risk of preterm birth, such as high blood pressure or infection.\n\nAnd even for the 30,000 or so women who are eligible, 17-HP, which will be marketed as Makena, isn't a magic bullet. The study showed that 37 percent of women who got weekly injections of it delivered prematurely, compared to 55 percent of women who got injections of a placebo.\n\nInterestingly, the drug is not new \u2014 it's just taken a long and circuitous route to approval.\n\nIn 1956, the FDA approved 17-HP for the treatment of certain cancers and other hormonal disorders, under the brand name Delalutin. But its manufacturer withdrew it from the market in 2000 \"for reasons unrelated to safety,\" as the FDA puts it.\n\nIn fact, as a Federal Register posting last year chronicled, there have been questions raised about whether 17-HP caused birth defects of various kinds. In the 1970s, the FDA required warnings on drugs containing progesterone, as 17-HP does, because of an increased risk of birth defects. They later revoked them.\n\nThe FDA is apparently satisfied that 17-HP is safe, but it's requiring its sponsors KV Pharmaceuticals and TherRx to conduct further studies of women who have taken it and children exposed during pregnancy.\n\nEveryone in this field is mindful of the long-running tragedy of vaginal and other cancers and male urinary disorders that resulted from the last drug thought to prevent premature birth \u2013 a synthetic estrogen called diethylstilbesterol, or DES. In 1971 researchers realized children exposed to DES in utero had a higher incidence of vaginal and breast cancers, and males were subsequently found to have urinary-tract problems.\n\nFleischman, the March of Dimes official, says there's no such risk from 17-HP, partly because it's not used before the 16th week of pregnancy, when fetal organs have already formed.\n\n\"We have been very aggressively tracking all the data,\" Fleischman says, \"and we have no reason to believe that this drug will increase birth defects.\"", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease-mongering of prematurity or its consequences.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "TUESDAY, Feb. 22, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- In women who have had breast cancer, annual mammograms help detect second breast cancers, but they're not as effective in women who have never had the disease, new research suggests.\n\n\"Screening mammography does work well in women with a history of breast cancer, so they should continue to get their annual screening mammogram,\" said Diana Miglioretti, senior investigator at Group Health Research Institute in Seattle and a co-author of the new research. \"But they also need to remain vigilant because they are at increased risk of cancers not detected on mammography that show up between mammograms.\"\n\nIn their study, published in the Feb. 23 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, Miglioretti and her colleagues found that false positives and interval cancers were both higher in women with a history of breast cancer than in those without such history. False positives are an initial finding of cancer that turns out to be benign based on additional testing. Interval cancers are those found between mammograms, either through additional tests or symptoms.\n\nThe researchers evaluated 12 years of data from 58,870 screening mammograms in 19,078 women with early-stage breast cancer and an equal number of mammograms in another 55,315 women who had never had breast cancer. The women were matched on such factors as age and breast density, a risk factor for cancer, with higher density increasing risk.\n\nWithin a year of the screening, 655 cancers were found in women with a breast cancer history and 342 in those without.\n\nMammograms had detected 76.5 percent of the cancers in women who had never had breast cancer and 65.4 percent in those who had previously had the disease. As for false positives, 1 percent of the women without a history of breast cancer were referred for biopsy but ended up being cancer-free, compared with 1.7 percent of those with a breast cancer history.\n\nThe interval cancer rate was 3.6 per 1,000 screenings in those with a history and 1.4 per 1,000 in those without, the investigators found.\n\nWomen with a history of breast cancer were also more likely to be called back for additional imaging or biopsies: 18 percent called back, compared with 8.3 percent of the others.\n\n\"I think it's mostly positive news,\" Miglioretti said. \"Of the ones that are missed, most of them are early stage.\" It points to the need, she said, for women to remain vigilant about screening after their breast cancer treatment -- and to report any symptoms to their doctor immediately.\n\nDr. William Audeh, medical director of the Samuel Oschin Cancer Center and the Wasserman Breast Cancer Risk Reduction Program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, described the findings as \"not at all surprising.\" He reviewed the study but was not involved in it.\n\nAfter surgery and radiation, he said, a woman's breasts have changed, and there is a greater chance that a radiologist will think that something is abnormal simply because of the changes. \"That helps explain the false positives,\" Audeh said.\n\nAnd though mammography did not catch all cancers in the women with a breast cancer history, the study still points out the value of the test, he said.\n\nRobert Smith, director of cancer screening for the American Cancer Society, agreed.\n\n\"Despite poorer performance compared with women without a prior history of breast cancer, overall screening mammography was effective at detecting the majority of breast cancer in women with a [history] at an early favorable stage, with the majority of tumors being diagnosed as ductal carcinoma in situ or stage 1,\" Smith said.\n\nA trend among cancer specialists, Audeh said, is to tailor follow-up for a woman who has had breast cancer.

All had been diagnosed with either migraines or another type of intensely painful (and cyclically occurring) headache known as cluster headaches.\n\nBefore participating in the study, patients were asked to indicate their pain levels according to a standardized scale from 1 to 10. Pre-treatment pain scores averaged more than 8, Mandato said.\n\nThe participants all underwent a session of \"image-guided therapy,\" in which a spaghetti-sized catheter was inserted through a nostril and into the nasal passage to deliver a dose of lidocaine to a nerve center known as the sphenopalatine ganglion. This was then repeated in the opposite nostril, according to the researchers.\n\nMandato stressed that no one in the study required sedation to undergo the procedure.\n\nThe target nerve bundle, explained Mandato, \"resembles a complex highway crossing with many [nerve] signals and exits going in all directions.\" And, he said, the hope was that lidocaine would essentially short-circuit that bundle's headache-causing pathway.\n\nThe day after the procedure, average migraine pain levels had dropped from about 8 to just over 4. Pain scores rose only marginally a week after the procedure, and reached an average of just over 5 by the one month post-procedure mark, according to the study.\n\nThe procedure didn't help everyone, though. Seven of the patients (about 6 percent) failed to get any benefit from the treatment, the investigators found. However, 88 percent of those in the study reported needing less standard pain relief medication after the procedure.\n\nThe researchers acknowledged that this procedure is a temporary solution that would need to be repeated.

Hands-only CPR is simpler and easier to remember and removes a big barrier for people skittish about the mouth-to-mouth breathing.\n\n\"You only have to do two things. Call 911 and push hard and fast on the middle of the person's chest,\" said Dr. Michael Sayre, an emergency medicine professor at Ohio State University who headed the committee that made the recommendation.\n\nHands-only CPR calls for uninterrupted chest presses - 100 a minute - until paramedics take over or an automated external defibrillator is available to restore a normal heart rhythm.\n\nThis action should be taken only for adults who unexpectedly collapse, stop breathing and are unresponsive. The odds are that the person is having cardiac arrest - the heart suddenly stops - which can occur after a heart attack or be caused by other heart problems. In such a case, the victim still has ample air in the lungs and blood and compressions keep blood flowing to the brain, heart and other organs.\n\nA child who collapses is more likely to primarily have breathing problems - and in that case, mouth-to-mouth breathing should be used. That also applies to adults who suffer lack of oxygen from a near-drowning, drug overdose, or carbon monoxide poisoning. In these cases, people need mouth-to-mouth to get air into their lungs and bloodstream.\n\nBut in either case, \"Something is better than nothing,\" Sayre said.\n\nThe CPR guidelines had been inching toward compression-only. The last update, in 2005, put more emphasis on chest pushes by alternating 30 presses with two quick breaths; those \"unable or unwilling\" to do the breaths could do presses alone.\n\nNow the heart association has given equal standing to hands-only CPR. Those who have been trained in traditional cardiopulmonary resuscitation can still opt to use it.\n\nSayre said the association took the unusual step of making the changes now - the next update wasn't due until 2010 - because three studies last year showed hands-only was as good as traditional CPR. Hands-only will be added to CPR training.\n\nAn estimated 310,000 Americans die each year of cardiac arrest outside hospitals or in emergency rooms.

Ewy (pronounced AY-vee) is director of the University of Arizona Sarver Heart Center in Tucson, where the compression-only technique was pioneered.\n\nEwy said there's no point to giving early breaths in the case of sudden cardiac arrest, and it takes too long to stop compressions to give two breaths - 16 seconds for the average person. He noted that victims often gasp periodically anyway, drawing in a little air on their own.\n\nAnonymous surveys show that people are reluctant to do mouth-to-mouth, Ewy said, partly because of fear of infections.\n\n\"When people are honest, they're not going to do it,\" he said. \"It's not only the yuck factor.\"\n\nIn recent years, emergency service dispatchers have been coaching callers in hands-only CPR rather than telling them how to alternate breaths and compressions.\n\n\"They love it.

Taking tamoxifen for five years after diagnosis reduces breast cancer mortality by about one-third.\n\nIn the new study, women with early tumors who took tamoxifen for 10 years cut their risk of dying from breast cancer by another 29%, compared to women who stopped after five years.\n\nIn absolute terms, 12% of women on tamoxifen for 10 years died of breast cancer within five to 14 years after diagnosis, compared to 15% of those who stopped at five years.\n\nOverall, women who take tamoxifen for a decade cut their risk of dying from breast cancer nearly in half, compared with those who don't take it at all, says study co-author Richard Gray of the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.\n\nThat's significant, given that tamoxifen is used by hundreds of thousands of women worldwide, says Gray, whose study was presented Wednesday at the annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Oxford funded the study, which included more than 6,800 women from 36 countries, While tamoxifen delays tumor growth in some women, it appears to cure others, Gray says.\n\n\"This is a dream come true for women,\" says V. Craig Jordan, a researcher who led tamoxifen's development, but who wasn't involved in the new study. \"It's very exciting.\"\n\nTamoxifen, which has been used for decades, is far cheaper than most new chemotherapies and biological drugs, which cost thousands of dollars a month. A generic version costs about $100 a month in the USA, according to Susan G. Komen for the Cure.\n\nIn the U.K., tamoxifen costs only $5 a month. In India, it's 2 cents a pill, says Jordan, scientific director at Georgetown's Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nJordan says the new findings will quickly change care for some patients.\n\nYounger women with more aggressive tumors may want to extend their tamoxifen use, says Jennifer Litton, an assistant professor at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who wasn't involved in the study.\n\nTamoxifen is the only hormonal option for women before menopause, Litton says.\n\nDoctors may not want to change the care of older patients, however, she says. That's because postmenopausal women have the option of tamoxifen or another class of hormonal therapies, called aromatase inhibitors, or AIs. These drugs are slightly more effective than tamoxifen, although they don't work before menopause, Litton says.\n\nBecause the study didn't include AIs, doctors can't say how whether tamoxifen would benefit women who've taken them, Litton says. Other researchers are conducting trials comparing five versus 10 years of AIs, although these results won't be out for several years.\n\nGray noted that tamoxifen has risks. In his study, doubling the length of treament also doubled the risk of endometrial cancer, which affects the uterine lining, to about 3%. However, because this cancer is very treatable, death rates were low: 0.4% of those on tamoxifen for 10 years died of endometrial cancer, compared to 0.2% of those taking it for five years.\n\nDoctors saw no increase in strokes, which has long been a concern with tamoxifen, Gray says.\n\nBreast cancer survivors have mixed reactions to the results.\n\nSome women will be glad to have another treament option, says breast cancer survivor Lillie Shockney, 59, administrative director of the Johns Hopkins Cancer Survivorhip Program in Baltimore.\n\n\"Patients get very nervous when they stop any hormonal therapy, because they feel like now they aren't doing anything,\" says Shockney, 59. \"The opportunity to 'do something' might be appealing, despite the side effects.\"\n\nShockney says she'd like to see research on other ways to prevent recurrences, such as weight loss. \"If someone lost 40 pounds, would that do as much as another five years on tamoxifen?\" Shockney asks.\n\nSome patients may be reluctant to prolong their use of a drug that causes so many side effects, says Boston breast cancer survivor Alicia Staley.\n\nStudies show that only 80% of women take tamoxifen for five years, Litton says. Some switch to an AI, although these drugs can also cause problems, such as joint pain and osteoporosis.\n\nStaley say she tamoxifen gave her \"many, many side effects,\" including severe hot flashes. \"Dry eyes, joint pain, weight gain \u2014 you name it, I had it,\" she says.\n\nAfter 2\u00bd years, Staley and her doctor stopped the drug \"to regain a measure of quality of life.\"\n\nFor Shockney, tamoxifen took a heavy toll on her marriage, causing dryness that made sex unbearably painful.\n\nPatients and their partners need to have honest talks with doctors about how extended treatment will affect their relationship, she says.\n\n\"If we are going to look at giving women tamoxifen for 10 years, by golly, we better get the partners involved,\" Shockney says.\n\nYet Shockney says her husband of nearly 35 years would have wanted her to do everything possible to survive.\n\n\"If someone said to my husband, 'I know this has been a rough road for you, and a big impact on your sex life, but if she stays on it another five years. it could affect her survival,' he would have said, 'Please, please, take the pill.' \"", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There is no evidence of disease-mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "WEDNESDAY, Feb. 8, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Deep brain stimulation, a technique used to treat Parkinson's disease and certain psychiatric disorders, appears to provide some memory-enhancing benefits, researchers report.\n\nUsing electrical impulses to stimulate a part of the brain critical for memory function significantly improved patients' navigational ability, reflecting improved spatial memory, the small study from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) suggests.\n\nAlthough the results are still preliminary, the method may potentially hold promise for boosting memory in patients with early Alzheimer's disease, the researchers said.\n\n\"The thing to bear in mind is that it's a first, important step,\" said Suzanne Haber, a brain researcher and professor of pharmacology and physiology at University of Rochester Medical Center in New York, who wasn't involved in the study. \"I think it was exciting that they were really able to show that stimulating that area was important for a certain kind of learning. It raises more questions, and many more experiments that can be done.\"\n\nSeven patients awaiting possible surgery for the seizure disorder epilepsy had electrodes implanted in their brains to pinpoint the origin of their convulsions. The researchers followed them and found they were better able to recognize landmarks and to navigate routes more quickly in a video game featuring a taxi cab, virtual passengers and a cyber city. Patients played the role of cab drivers who picked up passengers and delivered them to one of six requested shops in the city.\n\nStimulation of the entorhinal cortex -- a region considered crucial to transforming daily experience into lasting memories -- produced the improvement, the researchers said.\n\nThe study is published Feb. 9 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nDuring the video game task, participants learned their way around a virtual town with and without five-second periods of deep brain stimulation, and were tested for their ability to reach predetermined landmarks. Six patients showed a 64 percent reduction in \"excess path length\" -- the ideal path between destinations, which indicated better performance -- for locations that had been learned during periods of deep brain stimulation.\n\nFor five patients, navigation to each of the three stores learned during stimulation was faster and shorter than navigation to the three stores learned without stimulation, indicating a consistent effect, the study said. Stimulating the hippocampus -- a brain region next to the entorhinal cortex which helps form and store memories -- produced no effect during this experiment, however.\n\n\"Critically, it was the stimulation at the gateway into the hippocampus, and not the hippocampus itself, that proved effective,\" senior study author Dr. Itzhak Fried, a professor of neurosurgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, said in a university news release.\n\n\"Our preliminary results provide evidence supporting a possible mechanism for enhancing memory, particularly as people age or suffer from early dementia. At the same time, we studied a small sample of patients, so our results should be interpreted with caution,\" Fried added.\n\nCurrently, deep brain stimulation is used to control the tremors associated with Parkinson's, symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder and some other psychiatric conditions, including depression.\n\nHaber noted that the brain damage that occurs with epilepsy, which can produce memory problems, is different than that resulting from Alzheimer's disease, in which the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are believed to contribute to nerve cell deterioration. So it's difficult to generalize this study's results to other diseases that affect memory, she said, and the research didn't show if effects of temporary deep brain stimulation last beyond the study period.\n\n\"In these types of studies you think of things like this,\" Haber said, \"but how real it is, is something we're going to have to see.

It diagnoses prostate cancer that's going to actually cause harm,\" said Dr. H. Ballentine Carter, urology chief at Johns Hopkins University, who led the research published Tuesday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nThe study is far from proof that making health decisions based on so-called PSA velocity can really save lives.\n\nBut Carter contends the findings suggest that men should consider getting a baseline PSA test around age 40, instead of the more usual 50, to use as a comparison for future changes.\n\nPSA tests are used to screen men for prostate cancer, but they're imprecise. Too much PSA, or prostate-specific antigen, in a man's blood can indicate that he has either a benign enlarged prostate or cancer. Only a biopsy can tell the difference.\n\nIt's not even clear when is the best time to do a biopsy. Some men have cancer despite a \"normal\" PSA count of 4 or below. Yet routinely biopsying men with low PSA would worsen another problem, overdiagnosis. Many specialists say too many men today are undergoing side effect-prone treatment for tumors too small and slow-growing to ever threaten their lives.\n\nTwo years ago, Boston researchers reported that men whose PSA levels jumped more than 2 points the year before diagnosis were more likely to relapse and die despite prostate surgery. But those were men whose PSA levels were already fairly high.\n\nHopkins' Carter wondered if doctors could catch such men far sooner, when the cancer might be more treatable.\n\nHe turned to a study of aging that has been collecting and freezing blood samples from participants since 1958. The Hopkins team tracked PSA changes in that blood from 980 men, 20 of whom eventually died of prostate cancer and 104 of whom survived it.\n\nHow fast a man's PSA was rising a decade before his cancer was diagnosed \u2014 even before it reached that biopsy-triggering level of 4 \u2014 predicted his survival 25 years later, regardless of his ultimate cancer treatment, Carter concluded.\n\nThose with a higher PSA velocity \u2014 the level rose more than a count of 0.35 a year \u2014 had a 54 percent survival rate, while those whose PSA rose more slowly had a 92 percent survival rate.\n\nWhat does that mean for men today? That it's a good idea to order a biopsy for a man with a low but fast-rising PSA, Carter said. And men diagnosed with prostate cancer whose PSA is rising slowly may be ideal candidates for monitoring instead of surgery or other treatment, he added.\n\nA study with just 20 deaths is far too small to prove the value of PSA velocity, cautioned Dr. Durado Brooks, a prostate specialist with the American Cancer Society.\n\nStill, growing numbers of doctors are using the method already to help decide when to order a biopsy, and \"I think the study does raise the question as to whether PSA velocity may at some point be a helpful factor in determining prognosis,\" he said.\n\nThe work is \"another step on the road to more sophisticated\" prostate cancer screening and treatment, Dr. Timothy Church of the University of Minnesota wrote in an editorial accompanying the work.\n\nSome 234,000 U.S. men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year, and just over 27,000 of them will die, the cancer society estimates.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The article nicely describes the dilemma around whether or not to find and/or treat prostate cancer.

It consists mainly of cells that line the walls of capillaries in the brain and are so tightly packed that many molecules in the bloodstream cannot slip out between cells to reach the brain tissue itself. But certain drugs, like mannitol, will temporarily open the barrier and were first used more than 20 years ago to help other medicines reach the brain.\n\nThe new technique refines the art of opening the barrier: it uses microcatheters \u2014 fine, highly flexible tubes that are inserted into an artery in the groin and then threaded up into tiny blood vessels nearly anywhere in the brain \u2014 to spray chemotherapy directly onto tumors or areas from which they have been removed. The catheters are normally used to deliver clot-dissolving drugs to the brain to treat strokes.\n\n\u201cThis will substantially alter the way that chemotherapy is given in the future,\u201d said Dr. John Boockvar, the brain surgeon who devised the trial. \u201cBut we have to prove that at certain doses, nobody gets hurt.\u201d\n\nReferring to glioblastoma patients, Dr. Riina said, \u201cEveryone is looking for something to do for these people.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if you buy someone just a year, that could be a wedding or a graduation,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou never know what might happen in the year they hold onto.\u201d\n\nThe study, which began in August, is still in its earliest phase, meaning its main goal is to measure safety, not efficacy \u2014 to find out if it is safe to spray Avastin directly into brain arteries and at what dose. Nonetheless, the doctors were pleased when M.R.I. scans of the first few patients showed that the treatment seemed to erase any sign of recurring glioblastomas. But how long the effect will last remains to be seen.\n\nDespite a beautiful scan, the first patient who was treated died in October, from pneumonia and the spread of glioblastoma to his brainstem.\n\nInnovations are desperately needed to make headway against glioblastoma, which is \u201cone of the most deadly tumors that exist in humans,\u201d said Dr. Russell Lonser, chairman of surgical neurology at the National Institutes of Health.\n\n\u201cThis is a very good start,\u201d Dr. Lonser said. \u201cThe early data is very interesting and exciting.\u201d\n\nThe complexity of a study like this goes beyond the science. Clinical trials are also a complicated pact, emotionally and ethically, between desperate patients and doctors who must balance their ambition as researchers against their duty as clinicians, and must walk a fine line between offering too much hope and not enough.\n\n\u201cI tell patients, \u2018I\u2019m going to try to cure your disease, but so far glioblastoma is an incurable disease,\u2019 \u201d Dr. Boockvar said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic,\u201d Mr. Sugrue said one morning in September, after scheduling a second brain operation. But he had tears in his eyes.\n\nThere are about 10,000 new cases of glioblastoma a year in the United States, mostly in people over 45. The tumors are notorious for growing back like weeds even after being cut out and blasted with chemotherapy and radiation, and they are nearly always fatal. With the best treatment, the median survival time is about 15 months.\n\nBut in the last five years, the number of patients who survive 2 years has increased to 25 percent, from 8 percent, largely because doctors began using a chemotherapy pill called temozolomide, or Temodar, along with radiation (Temodar is believed to seep through the blood-brain barrier).\n\nDr. Boockvar said he thought that if he could just keep patients alive for two years, more advances might come along and give them time.\n\n\u201cThe glioblastoma population is very studyable, unfortunately, because the prognosis is so grim,\u201d he said.\n\nPatients often wind up on the front lines of research, figuring they have little to lose and hoping they will be lucky enough to test the big breakthrough. More than 500 studies for people with glioblastoma are listed on the government Web site www.clinicaltrials.gov.\n\nMr. Sugrue, who lives in Stamford, Conn., with his wife, Donna, and their children Molly and Tim, began having headaches in April. He thought he had a sinus problem. But a scan found a brain tumor nearly the size of a golf ball. A local doctor referred him to Dr. Boockvar. He had the standard treatment: surgery, temozolomide pills and six weeks of radiation, which ended on June 25.\n\nBy July, an ominous bright spot on his M.R.I. scan suggested that the tumor might already be growing back. He continued chemotherapy, but the spot kept enlarging.\n\nBy mid-September, the Sugrues were back in Dr. Boockvar\u2019s office to plan their next step. Stubbly hair was growing in on Mr. Sugrue\u2019s scalp, except for a bare patch, around an arcing scar above his right ear. His eyes, bright blue with thick, dark lashes that gave him a boyish look, searched the doctor\u2019s face.\n\nThe headaches had returned. New scans, displayed on a computer screen, showed signs of brain swelling and bright spots that should not have been there. Dr. Boockvar recommended more surgery and then chemotherapy with Avastin, which had recently been approved for recurring glioblastoma.\n\nIt was approved for intravenous use \u2014 to be dripped into a vein, usually in the arm \u2014 but he said Mr. Sugrue would be an ideal candidate for his study, in which the drug would be infused directly into an artery in the brain, producing levels at least 50 times what the intravenous route could achieve. One other patient had been treated that way, and M.R.I. scans showed that recurring tumors seemed to have melted away.\n\nMr. Sugrue said he was all for it, even though Dr. Boockvar warned him that the drug was no magic bullet. Then Dr. Boockvar ticked off the risks from a second brain operation.\n\n\u201cI have to quote you a 5 percent risk you\u2019ll be visibly weak,\u201d he said. \u201cA 1 percent chance of paralysis on the left side.\u201d\n\nMr. Sugrue wiped his eyes and began to apologize for losing his composure, but the surgeon cut him off and said, \u201cIn neurosurgery they say that if you don\u2019t make your patient cry, you haven\u2019t gotten informed consent.\u201d\n\nThe trial grew out of a conversation about a year ago between Dr. Boockvar and Dr. Riina, an expert in using microcatheters to treat strokes.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Why can\u2019t you infuse chemotherapy for my brain tumor patients?\u2019 \u201d Dr. Boockvar recalled. \u201cAnd he said: \u2018I can. Just show me what you want to do.\u2019 \u201d\n\nDr. Riina said, \u201cTechnically, I can go anywhere in your brain.\u201d\n\nHe said microcatheter technology had advanced \u201clight-years\u201d in the last decade and was just waiting for a new drug to come along for glioblastoma.\n\nThey wrote up a plan to test what they called \u201csuperselective intra-arterial cerebral infusion\u201d of Avastin in 30 patients with glioblastomas that had recurred after standard treatment. Each patient would receive just one treatment directed into the brain, followed weeks later by a series of intravenous treatments with Avastin.\n\nTheir study involves a technique first developed about 30 years ago, which uses mannitol to open the blood-brain barrier temporarily to get chemotherapy into the brain. Mannitol pulls water out of the tightly packed cells lining the capillaries so that they shrink and pull away from one another, opening up gaps through which drug molecules can pass into the brain.\n\nThe technique was developed by Dr. Edward A. Neuwelt, a neurosurgeon at Oregon Health Sciences University and the Veterans Affairs Hospital in Portland. Its best results have been in people with a rare type of brain tumor called a primary central nervous system lymphoma. But it has not been helpful with glioblastoma, because until recently there was no chemotherapy to infuse that would have much effect on those tumors.\n\nDr. Neuwelt said that Avastin had helped to renew interest in opening the blood-brain barrier but that researchers disagreed about whether the drug would lend itself to that use.\n\nAvastin starves tumors by blocking the growth of new blood vessels, which they need to survive. Dr. Boockvar said microcatheters should increase the odds of success by delivering a high dose of the drug directly to where it was needed most. Earlier research with other drugs used larger catheters inserted into the carotid arteries, which feed the entire brain \u2014 meaning that the tumor did not receive the most concentrated dose and that healthy brain tissue was exposed to the toxic drugs.\n\nBy mid-November, the researchers had treated five patients, including Mr. Sugrue; they first infused mannitol, waited five minutes and then sprayed in the Avastin. In all the patients\u2019 M.R.I. scans, the telltale bright spots that marked tumor growth faded away after the treatment.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you what it means,\u201d Dr. Boockvar said. \u201cNobody knows.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the death of the first patient was a reminder that glioblastoma can invade other parts of the brain and the spinal fluid and that the highly localized spray of Avastin might miss deadly seeds of cancer.\n\nBut Dr. Boockvar remained hopeful for the remaining patients, describing the scans as \u201castronomically far better than I had anticipated.\u201d\n\nMr. Sugrue was still in the hospital in late September when Dr. Boockvar burst into his room and got him out of bed to look at his own before-and-after scans.\n\n\u201cHe took me to this room with all these computers and said, \u2018I\u2019ve got to show you this,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Sugrue recalled. \u201cThis M.R.I. was a thing of beauty. I\u2019m excited that he\u2019s excited. That means a lot to me.\u201d\n\nDr. Boockvar said: \u201cAvastin may not be the best drug for this delivery technique.

The language is in some places dramatic but not inappropriately so. ", "answer": 1}, {"article": "PSA stands for prostate-specific antigen, a substance produced only by the prostate gland and found in the ejaculate. Its purpose is to liquefy the semen to release sperm, freeing them to fertilize an egg. The PSA level, measured in nanograms per milliliter of blood, reflects how much of this antigen is being produced and released into the bloodstream. The larger a man\u2019s prostate, the more PSA is produced, which makes the test very confusing in older men with benign enlargement of this gland.\n\nAside from cancer and prostatic growth with age, factors that can change PSA measurements include inflammation or infection of the prostate; a decline in testosterone levels or the drug finasteride, taken for hair loss, both of which lower the PSA; and variations in laboratory assays and in the inherent biology of a person. Biological variability can result in as much as a 15 percent difference between readings, and in nearly half of men with an abnormal PSA, the test will normalize in one to four years without any treatment.\n\nBut Dr. H. Ballentine Carter, a urologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, notes that no significant changes in PSA result from recent sexual intercourse or ejaculation, a digital rectal examination or riding a bicycle. \u201cEven long-distance bikers do not have prostate trauma\u201d that causes their PSA to increase, Dr. Carter said.\n\nCurrent guidelines recommend that all men have an annual PSA test starting at age 50 and that biopsies be conducted if the level exceeds 4 or if a \u201csignificant rise\u201d occurs between two tests. The guidelines also suggest limiting screening to men with more than a 10-year life expectancy.\n\nThis approach has resulted in many biopsies in men who did not have cancer \u2014 about 70 percent of those with elevated PSAs are cancer free \u2014 and debilitating prostate surgery in men with cancers that would never have become a threat in their remaining years of life.\n\nOn the Way: New Guidelines\n\nBased on recent studies, the American Urological Association will soon release revised guidelines that, experts hope, will reduce unnecessary biopsies and prostate surgeries, which even in the best hands can leave a man impotent and incontinent. The revised guidelines are expected to reduce the cost of screening, the cost per life saved and overall deaths from prostate cancer.\n\nThe new guidelines will no longer rely on a single reading. Rather, they will suggest that doctors focus on changes in levels over time. They will also suggest that testing start at 40 to obtain a baseline measurement, with the test repeated at 45 and 50, after which it should be given annually until 70.\n\n\u201cIf a 70-year-old man has a PSA history that hasn\u2019t changed over the years, maybe he doesn\u2019t need further testing,\u201d Dr. Carter suggested. \u201cPSA testing of men over 70 is not rational.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to a Scandinavian study showing that among men older than 65, to prevent one death from prostate cancer over 10 years, 330 men would have to have prostate surgery.\n\n\u201cThis has created a huge dilemma in urology,\u201d Dr. Carter said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to miss the possibility of a life-threatening disease, but we end up diagnosing and treating disease that would never have caused harm.\u201d\n\nThe new guidelines will lower the PSA level at which a biopsy should be considered, because, as Dr. Carter put it, \u201cthere\u2019s no level below which we can tell a man he doesn\u2019t have prostate cancer or life-threatening prostate cancer.\u201d\n\nAs one important trial showed, among men with a very low PSA \u2014 that is, a reading below the current cutoff of 4 \u2014 biopsies found that 15 percent had prostate cancer. Among that 15 percent, Dr. Carter said, 15 percent had high-grade, potentially life-threatening cancers. That means that 2.25 percent of the total number of men with a PSA less than 4 had life-threatening cancers.\n\nBut, he added, \u201cIf we biopsied every man with a PSA below 4, we\u2019d be looking at a sea of cancers that would never grow to be life threatening.\u201d\n\nThese facts and the results of a recent study by Dr. Carter, among others, indicated that rather than acting on the basis of a single PSA test, the rate of change in levels over time is a better indicator of who might have a serious cancer. This rate, known as PSA velocity, will be part of the new guidelines, which will suggest that in men with low readings, doctors consider the changes in levels over the course of three measurements.\n\n\u201cWe need at least 1 \u00bd to 2 years\u2019 worth of data\u201d to make a meaningful judgment about how to proceed, Dr. Carter said.\n\nHe explained that in men with an initially high level \u2014 say 10 or higher\u2014 velocity is not an issue. For them, if other factors like prostate infection are not the cause of the high level, a biopsy is in order. But in men with a PSA from 0 to 4, knowing the velocity of changes can add useful information, he said.\n\nAnother approach to assessing the meaning of a PSA reading is to analyze how much antigen is traveling free in the blood and how much is bound to a companion protein, Dr. Scardino suggested. If more than 25 percent of the PSA is free, chances are that it is being produced by a benignly enlarged prostate. The lower the amount of free PSA, the more likely cancer is the cause and the more likely the disease is aggressive, requiring treatment, according to Dr. Patrick C. Walsh, a Johns Hopkins urologist and the author of \u201cDr. Patrick Walsh\u2019s Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer.\u201d", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There are several inaccuracies in the description of prostate cancer and prostate cancer screening.\u00a0 One, the story quotes a source who\u00a0attributes the drop in prostate cancer deaths to PSA screening, which is not known for sure (and there were advances in medical treatment at the same time even though this source states there weren't).\u00a0 There could be other reasons for the drop in prostate cancer deaths.\u00a0 Another inaccuracy is that the story states \"guidelines\" (without explaining which guidelines) recommend all men have an annual PSA test beginning at age 50.\u00a0 This is not true; in fact, major guideline-issuing organizations like the American Urological Association, the American Cancer Society, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommend a shared decision making approach which individualizes this choice based on personal preferences and values.\u00a0 Third, the idea of using PSA velocity in prostate cancer screening has not been well-studied and there is not a lot of evidence to prove the value of this approach.\u00a0 The article states using PSA velocity is a better approach than using a single test for prostate cancer screening, which has not yet been proven (although this approach is often used in monitoring advanced disease after diagnosis).\u00a0 Although a minor inaccuracy, the article also quotes a source who states that PSA does not fluctuate based on sexual activity.\u00a0 However, the evidence for this is mixed and not conclusive.\u00a0 ", "answer": 0}, {"article": "January 30, 2018 - For older women undergoing mastectomy for breast cancer, direct-to-implant (DTI) breast reconstruction provides good outcomes in a single-step procedure, while avoiding some of the inconvenience and risks of staged approaches to breast reconstruction, reports a study in the February issue of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery\u00ae, the official medical journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS).\n\n\"The DTI approach is a powerful tool for breast reconstruction in elderly patients,\" comments ASPS Member Surgeon Andrea Moreira, MD, of the Cleveland Clinic. The researchers believe the DTI technique may expand the options for older women, who are less likely to undergo breast reconstruction.\n\nGood Results with DTI Breast Reconstruction in Women over 65\n\nDirect-to-implant breast reconstruction has emerged as a single-stage approach to immediate breast reconstruction after mastectomy. So far, however, most studies of DTI have focused on younger women.\n\n\"Half of all breast cancers occur in women over 65, yet only four to 14 percent of these women undergo reconstruction,\" Dr. Moreira and coauthors write. Most studies of breast reconstruction in older women have focused on multiple-step techniques such as tissue expander implant (TEI) reconstruction.\n\nThe researchers identified women over age 65 who underwent DTI reconstruction at the Cleveland Clinic between 2012 and 2015. They identified a total of 24 breasts reconstructed by DTI in 19 patients, all with at least 30 days' follow-up and most with one year of follow-up\n\nPatient characteristics and outcomes were compared to those of 109 breasts with TEI reconstruction in 98 patients. The women undergoing DTI reconstruction were older (73.5 versus 69.2 years) and had a higher body mass index, compared to the TEI group.\n\nBoth DTI and TEI were safe and effective options for breast reconstruction. Complication rates were similar between groups, including blood and fluid collections (hematoma and seroma), infection, unplanned surgery, and failed reconstruction.\n\nHowever, DTI had some important advantages. Women in the DTI group were less likely to be readmitted to the hospital and spent fewer total days in the hospital. In the year after surgery was completed, women in the DTI group made an average of 6.5 office visits, compared to about 12 visits in the TEI group.\n\nThe DTI group also spent fewer days with a surgical drain in place: average about 13 days, compared to 23 days in the and had fewer total days in the hospital. That's an important consideration, as drains require antibiotic treatment to prevent infection, in addition to causing discomfort for the patient.\n\nThe authors note some important limitations of their study--particularly the fact that it was a review study of one hospital's experience with a relatively new procedure. Dr. Moreira and colleagues write, \"These reported cases include our learning curve patients as we familiarized ourselves with appropriate patient selection and surgical technique.\"\n\nThe researchers emphasize that DTI isn't an option for every patient, depending on breast shape and other factors. Despite these limitations, their experience suggests that complications of the DTI approach in older women are similar to those of the more commonly used TEI technique.

Of this group, 58 were diagnosed with prostate cancer, 24 with bladder cancer and 73 with haematuria or poor stream without cancer. The results of the pilot study using the GC sensor system indicate that it is able to successfully identify different patterns of volatile compounds that allow classification of urine samples from patients with urological cancers.\n\nProfessor Chris Probert from the University of Liverpool's Institute of Translational Medicine began work on this project with UWE Bristol when he was working in Bristol as a gastroenterologist with clinical and research interest in inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nThe research team used a gas chromatography sensor system called Odoreader that was developed by a team led by Professor Probert and Professor Norman Ratcliffe at UWE Bristol. The test involves inserting urine samples into the Odoreader that are then measured using algorithms developed by the research team at the University of Liverpool and UWE Bristol.\n\nProfessor Probert said: \"There is an urgent need to identify these cancers at an earlier stage when they are more treatable as the earlier a person is diagnosed the better. After further sample testing the next step is to take this technology and put it into a user friendly format. With help from industry partners we will be able to further develop the Odoreader, which will enable it to be used where it is needed most; at a patient's bedside, in a doctor's surgery, in a clinic or Walk In Centre, providing fast, inexpensive, accurate results.\"\n\nProfessor Norman Ratcliffe said, \"There is currently no accurate test for prostate cancer, the vagaries of the PSA test indicators can sometimes result in unnecessary biopsies, resulting in psychological toll, risk of infection from the procedure and even sometimes missing cancer cases. Our aim is to create a test that avoids this procedure at initial diagnosis by detecting cancer in a non-invasive way by smelling the disease in men's urine. A few years ago we did similar work to detect bladder cancer following a discovery that dogs could sniff out cancer. We have been using the Odoreader, which is like an electronic nose to sense the cancer.\"\n\n\"The Odoreader has a 30 metre column that enables the compounds in the urine to travel through at different rates thus breaking the sample into a readable format. This is then translated into an algorithm enabling detection of cancer by reading the patterns presented. The positioning of the prostate gland which is very close to the bladder gives the urine profile a different algorithm if the man has cancer.\"\n\nMr Raj Prasad, Consultant Urologist at Southmead Hospital, North Bristol NHS Trust, said: \"If this test succeeds at full medical trial it will revolutionise diagnostics. Even with detailed template biopsies there is a risk that we may fail to detect prostate cancer in some cases. Currently indicators such as diagnosed prostatomegaly (enlarged prostate) and unusually high PSA levels can lead to recommendations for biopsy if there is a concern that cancer may be prevalent. An accurate urine test would mean that many men who currently undergo prostate biopsy may not need to do so.\"\n\nThe pilot trial was funded by the Rotary Club in Bristol who held annual Run for the Future events in Bristol.\n\nThe research team is now looking to fund a full clinical trial.\n\nA video in which Professor Probert explains how the machine works can be found here", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The release doesn\u2019t engage in disease mongering, but we were concerned that the release unjustly pushes the \u201curgency\u201d of the need for testing.

But after the robotic job earlier this month, she was out of the hospital in a few days and feeling chipper.\n\n\"The robot is the way to go,\" Jackson said. \"Yes, indeed.\" Using a robot enables a surgeon to work on a patient without splitting open the chest and using a heart-lung machine, as happens with traditional surgery. The robotic tools are inserted through small openings made in the patient's body, minimizing trauma and significantly reducing recovery time.\n\nWhile surgical robots have been available for most of this decade, few are used to do cardiac bypass surgery, even though that was their focus when the machines were introduced.\n\nThe robot - not a kind of mechanical being but a system that enables a surgeon at a control panel to manipulate microtools - has proved more challenging to integrate into coronary bypass surgery than expected, illustrating how technological advancements can be difficult to readily adapt.\n\nNow, the University of Chicago Medical Center, where Jackson had her surgery, has launched a major new effort to make robotic bypass surgery more widely available.\n\nIt has hired the nation's foremost master of robotic bypass surgery to help lead a revolution in coronary bypass. Dr. Valluvan Jeevanandam, the chief of cardiothoracic surgery at the U. of C. Medical Center and in charge of the hospital's initiative, acknowledges he has set a difficult task.\n\nInstead of opening up a patient and working directly on his heart, the robotic-assisted surgeon sits at a console near the patient, looking at three-dimensional high-definition images on a screen and using his hands and feet to control the microtools inserted within the patient's chest. Tiny laser lights and video cameras provide the surgeon's view of what's happening.\n\n\"Using the robot isn't easy,\" Jeevanandam said. \"A drop of blood can block your view and you have to take out the camera and clean it.\" Heart surgeons tend to be confident, competent people used to taking hold of a problem and moving ahead directly. Many who trained to use robots to do coronary bypass run out of patience after three or four procedures, Jeevanandam said, which is why he decided to hire Dr. Sudhir Srivastava, who performed hundreds of robotic bypasses while working at a center in Odessa, Texas.\n\n\"We're a top center,\" said Jeevanandam. \"If they can do this in Odessa, why not Chicago?\"\n\nSrivastava brings a focus and determination to mastering robotic surgery that Jeevanandam wants to spread to other heart surgeons at Chicago.\n\n\"He practices yoga,\" Jeevanandam said. \"It comes in handy.\" But Dr. Pat Pappas, chief of cardiac surgery at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, Ill., wonders if Jeevanandam may be overestimating robotic capabilities.\n\n\"At some point it may happen,\" he said. \"But given the current state of the technology, I don't think that's the case now.\" Pappas started using a surgical robot in 2001, and he intended to use the machine to do minimally invasive coronary bypass procedures, but he found it too difficult. Instead, he has used the machine to do hundreds of heart valve repairs.\n\nThe robots have proven popular for urologic, gynecologic and some general surgery, Pappas said, but few coronary surgeons use them for valve repairs and fewer still do bypass procedures. The problem, he said, is a surgeon cannot feel what he's doing.\n\n\"There's no tactile feedback,\" Pappas said. \"The exactness of bypass surgery is so high that many people are reluctant to do it without tactile as well as visual feedback.\"\n\nSrivastava said it is true that the normal sense of touch is missing from robotic work, and that is a shortcoming, but it can be overcome with practice. Before working on humans in Odessa, he practiced on dozens of pig hearts.\n\n\"After doing it hundreds of times,\" Srivastava said, \"I almost feel the machine is no longer between me and the patient. My hands and feet move in a way that's totally intuitive. That is achievable. You almost develop this sixth sense where looking at what you're doing gives you pseudo-tactile feedback.\"\n\nWhile some have suggested that younger physicians who grew up playing video games may find robotic surgery more natural, Srivastava disagrees. He said that experienced cardiac surgeons who have mastered conventional bypass surgery are the best candidates for learning to use robots because they have the skills and confidence to get themselves out of difficult situations that may arise.\n\n\"Skill set is important, but mental attitude is very important,\" he said. \"I've been in practice more than 20 years, and five years ago we launched robotics. This old dog learned.\"\n\nThe maker of the robotic systems, Intuitive Surgical Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., is an enthusiastic backer of the University of Chicago's initiative.\n\nRecent concerns raised over the safety of medicated stents used in coronary angioplasty procedures have caused more patients and physicians to consider bypass surgery as a better therapy for blocked coronary arteries, said Chris Rabbitt, cardiac marketing director for the company.\n\nAngioplasty, which uses a balloon to open blocked arteries, has been a popular alternative to bypass surgery in part because it brings less trauma to the patient. Stents are small devices used to keep arteries open after the balloon breaks up the blockage. Many stents are infused with chemicals intended to keep the arteries open, but some studies suggest the medication introduces new risks to cardiac health.\n\n\"Patients are more educated,\" Rabbitt said. \"It used to be that when you fell ill, you'd get angioplasty and be stented. But patients understand they have more options.\"\n\nUsing robotics to bypass major blocked arteries and putting stents in other blocked arteries is gaining some currency, Rabbitt said, although few surgeons have come close to Srivastava's familiarity with the robot.\n\nEven though they cost, on average, $1.5 million, the robot systems are gaining popularity. There are 504 systems in North America, 108 in Europe and 44 in the rest of the world.\n\nIf he can train several cardiac surgeons and their teams at the University of Chicago to do robotic coronary bypass procedures, Srivastava said it will change the face of bypass surgery because consumers who hear the benefits of avoiding a cracked sternum will demand the minimally invasive approach.\n\nFinding satisfied patients is probably the easiest aspect of robotic surgery.\n\nJohn Farrell, 70, of Valparaiso, Ind., had severe back pain and needed surgery this summer, but his cardiologist said that blockage of his coronary arteries need to be fixed before he could undergo the back operation. By opting for robotic surgery, Farrell was able to get his back repaired just 10 days after his heart.\n\n\"The heart operation was no problem at all,\" he said.\n\nFor Mary Lou Coulter, 77, of Westville, Ind., the main aftereffect of her robotic procedure was some soreness and numbness.\n\n\"When I left the hospital, I asked them when I could drive,\" she said, \"and they said `Whenever you feel like it,' which really surprised me.\"\n\nFirst published on September 5, 2007 at 12:00 am", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "Quoting the marketing director of the company that makes the robotic systems, the story suggests that bypass surgery may be safer than using a stent to keep an artery open, generating fears about the safety of stents.

The research was only meant to show that, so far, it seems feasible and safe.\n\nThe concept was based on the astonishing case of an AIDS patient who seems to be cured after getting blood cells from a donor with natural immunity to HIV nearly four years ago in Berlin. Researchers are seeking a more practical way to achieve similar immunity using patients' own blood cells.\n\nThe results announced Monday at a conference in Boston left experts cautiously excited.\n\n\"For the first time, people are beginning to think about a cure\" as a real possibility, said Dr. John Zaia, head of the government panel that oversees gene therapy experiments. Even if the new approach doesn't get rid of HIV completely, it may repair patients' immune systems enough that they can control the virus and not need AIDS medicines - \"what is called a functional cure,\" he said.\n\nCarl Dieffenbach, AIDS chief at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, agreed.\n\n\"We're hopeful that this is sufficient to give the level of immune reconstitution similar to what was seen with the patient from Germany,\" he said.\n\nThis is the first time researchers have permanently deleted a human gene and infused the altered cells back into patients. Other gene therapy attempts tried to add a gene or muffle the activity of one, and have not worked against HIV.\n\nThe virus can damage the immune system for years before people develop symptoms and are said to have AIDS - acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The virus targets special immune system soldiers called T-cells. It usually enters these cells through a protein receptor, or \"docking station,\" called CCR5.\n\nSome people (about 1 percent of whites; fewer of minorities) lack both copies of the CCR5 gene and are naturally resistant to HIV. One such person donated blood stem cells in 2007 to an American man living in Berlin who had leukemia and HIV.\n\nThe cell transplant appears to have cured both problems, but finding such donors for everyone with HIV is impossible, and transplants are medically risky.\n\nSo scientists wondered: Could a patient's own cells be used to knock out the CCR5 gene and create resistance to HIV?\n\nA California biotechnology company, Sangamo (SANG-uh-moh) BioSciences Inc., makes a treatment that can cut DNA at precise locations and permanently \"edit out\" a gene.\n\nDr. Jacob Lalezari, director of Quest Clinical Research of San Francisco, led the first test of this with the company and colleagues at the University of California in San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nHe warned that it would be \"way overstated\" to suggest that the results so far are a possible cure.\n\n\"It's an overreach of the data. There are a lot of people out there with hopes and dreams around the C-word,\" so caution is needed.\n\nIn the study, six men with HIV had their blood filtered to remove a small percentage of their T-cells. The gene-snipping compound was added in the lab, and about one-fourth of the cells were successfully modified. The cells were mixed with growth factors to make them multiply and then infused back into the patients.\n\nThree men received about 2.5 billion modified cells. Three others received about 5 billion.\n\nThree months later, five men had three times the number of modified cells expected. As much as 6 percent of their total T-cells appear to be the new type - resistant to HIV, Lalezari said.\n\nThe sixth man also had modified cells, but fewer than expected. In all six patients, the anti-HIV cells were thriving nearly a year after infusion, even in tissues that can hide HIV when it can't be detected in blood.\n\n\"The cells are engrafting - they're staying in the bloodstream, they're expanding over time,\" said Lalezari, who has no personal financial ties to Sangamo, the study's sponsor.\n\nThe only side effect was two days of flulike symptoms. It will take longer to determine safety, but several AIDS experts said they were encouraged so far.\n\n\"It is a huge step\" and a first for the field of genetics, said John Rossi, a researcher at City of Hope in Duarte, Calif., where he and Zaia plan another study to test Sangamo's approach. \"The idea is if you take away cells the virus can infect, you can cure the disease.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Dr. Carl June, a gene therapy expert at the University of Pennsylvania, will report partial results from a second, federally funded study of 10 people testing Sangamo's product. He treated his first patient with it in July 2009.\n\n- People born without the CCR5 gene are generally healthy, but will deleting it have unforeseen consequences?\n\n- Will HIV find another way into cells? Certain types of the virus can use a second protein receptor, though this is less common and usually when AIDS is advanced. Sangamo is testing a similar approach aimed at that protein, too.\n\n- How long will the modified cells last? Will more be needed every few years?\n\n- Could doctors just infuse Sangamo's product rather than removing cells and modifying them in the lab?\n\n- What might this cost?\n\nSangamo spokeswoman Liz Wolffe said it's too early in testing to guess, but it would be \"a premier-priced\" therapy - in the neighborhood of Dendreon Corp.'s new prostate cancer immune therapy, Provenge - $93,000.\n\nYet AIDS drugs can cost $25,000 a year, so this could still be cost-effective, especially if it's a cure.\n\nJay Johnson, 50, who works for Action AIDS, an advocacy and service organization in Philadelphia, had the treatment there in September.\n\n\"My results are excellent,\" he said. \"The overall goal is to not have to take medication, and then hopefully lead maybe to a cure.\"\n\nMatt Sharp, 54, of suburban San Francisco, also had the treatment in September.\n\n\"I would trade anything to not have to take a handful of medications every day for the rest of my life and suffer all the consequences and side effects,\" he said.\n\n\"I may not live long enough to see the cure, but I always hoped for a chance.\"", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "No disease mongering here.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "SUNDAY, Dec. 5, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Using gene therapy, German researchers report that they managed to \"correct\" a malfunctioning gene responsible for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, a rare but devastating childhood disorder that leads to prolonged bleeding from even minor hits or scrapes, and also leaves these children vulnerable to certain cancers and dangerous infections.\n\nHowever, one of the 10 kids in the study developed acute T-cell leukemia, apparently as a result of the viral vector that was used to insert the healthy gene. The boy is currently on chemotherapy, the study authors noted.\n\n\"This is a very good first step, but it's a little scary and we need to move to safer vectors,\" said Dr. Mary Ellen Conley, director of the Program in Genetic Immunodeficiencies at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn.\n\n\"The study shows proof-of-principle that gene therapy with stem cells in a genetic disorder like this has strong potential,\" added Paul Sanberg, a stem cell specialist who is director of the University of South Florida Center of Excellence for Aging and Brain Repair in Tampa.\n\nNeither Conley nor Sanberg were involved in the study, which is scheduled to be presented Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology in Orlando, Fla.\n\nAccording to Conley, children (mostly boys) with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) are born with an inherited genetic defect on the X chromosome that affects the number and size of platelets and makes the children remarkably susceptible to easy bleeding and infections, including different types of cancer.\n\nBone marrow transplants are the main treatment for the disorder which, if they succeed, basically cure the patient.\n\n\"They grow up, go to college and they cause problems,\" said Conley. \"But they're not an easy group of patients to transplant.\"\n\nEven if a good match is found, transplant recipients can go on to have more problems with infections, such as graft-versus-host disease, in which the body basically rejects the foreign elements.\n\n\"One of the long-lasting complications is the kids couldn't do this, they couldn't do that, they see themselves as different,\" Conley said. \"Transplants are getting better but we need better therapy, there's no question.\"\n\nIn this study, the researchers inserted a healthy gene capable of producing WAS protein into hematopoietic stem cells (the \"granddaddy\" cells that give rise to different blood cells), then transferred these stem cells back into the patient using a viral vector. A viral vector is a virus that has been modified to deliver foreign genetic material into a cell.\n\nIn fact, the experiment was largely successful, with cells now able to produce WAS protein, resulting in increased platelet counts and improvement of some immune-system cells.\n\n\"This is a first step that says you can correct the disease but I think most people would look at it and say the risk of leukemia is something, and that, let's see if we can avoid that,\" said Conley, whose team at St. Jude is working on a therapy involving a different type of vector. \"It's a good start, but I think we have better things coming down the road.\"\n\nIn other news from the conference, another group of German researchers have determined that people who donate peripheral blood stem cells or bone marrow to help save a life don't face any heightened risk of cancer.\n\nPreviously there had been some concern that drugs needed to get the stem cells out of the bone marrow and into the bloodstream where they could be accessed might pose a risk of leukemia.\n\nThe study was based on questionnaires returned from more than 12,500 donors, which also showed the donors tended to be in good health and were willing to donate again.\n\nAnother study found that the drug rituximab (Rituxan), used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and forms of leukemia and lymphoma, could greatly reduce graft-versus-host disease in stem cell transplant recipients.\n\nThe National Marrow Donor Program has more on Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The story didn\u2019t exaggerate the consequences of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "For 63-year-old Lynn Kaufman, the battle against migraines consumed her life.

In other words, even if the dog had been given away for adoption just before the woman gave birth, the healthy microbiome exchange could still take place.\n\nThe study also showed that the immunity-boosting exchange occurred even in three birth scenarios known for reducing immunity, as shown in Kozyrskyj's previous work: C-section versus vaginal delivery, antibiotics during birth and lack of breastfeeding.\n\nWhat's more, Kozyrskyj's study suggested that the presence of pets in the house reduced the likelihood of the transmission of vaginal GBS (group B Strep) during birth, which causes pneumonia in newborns and is prevented by giving mothers antibiotics during delivery.\n\nIt's far too early to predict how this finding will play out in the future, but Kozyrskyj doesn't rule out the concept of a \"dog in a pill\" as a preventive tool for allergies and obesity.\n\n\"It's not far-fetched that the pharmaceutical industry will try to create a supplement of these microbiomes, much like was done with probiotics,\" she said.\n\nThe study, funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Allergy, Genes and Environment Network (AllerGen NCE), was published in the journal Microbiome, along with an editorial in Nature.", "question": "Does the news release commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "There is no obvious disease mongering here, but the release might plant the suggestion that if readers don\u2019t own a dog and don\u2019t expose their infant to dog-related bacteria, then they may be exposing their children to a greater risk of some form of allergy or even obesity later on.

The study was published online Aug. 6, 2015, in the European Heart Journal.\n\nThe findings may sway the ongoing debate over testosterone therapy's benefits and risks, especially for the heart. Studies over the past few years have yielded mixed results, although part of that might stem from differing patient populations and research methods.\n\nFor example, the new VA study excluded men with a history of heart attacks or strokes, although it did include those with existing heart disease. A much-cited VA database study that was published in JAMA in 2013 looked specifically at men with coronary artery disease; about 20 percent of the total study group of around 8,700 men had suffered a prior heart attack.\n\nSo far, the medical community lacks results from any definitive clinical trial that might provide clear guidance. Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration issued guidance earlier in 2015 advising clinicians about the over-use of testosterone therapy, and pointing to a possible increased risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\nThe new VA study is likely to draw attention because of its large size and relatively long follow-up period.\n\nDr. Rajat Barua, the paper's corresponding author, says the study is also noteworthy because of its finding that administering the right dose is critical: Treating \"low T\" but not restoring levels to normal doesn't appear to impart much benefit, at least in terms of cardiovascular risk. Testosterone isn't prescribed with the goal of improving heart health, but that is a consideration in many cases.\n\n\"It is the first study to demonstrate that significant benefit is observed only if the dose is adequate to normalize the total testosterone levels,\" Barua and his coauthors wrote. \"Patients who failed to achieve the therapeutic range after testosterone replacement therapy did not see a reduction in [heart attack] or stroke and had significantly less benefit on mortality.\"\n\nBarua is with the Kansas City (Mo.) VA Medical Center. He's also an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Kansas.\n\nThe study team looked at national data on more than 83,000 men with documented low testosterone, all age 50 or above, who received care in VA between 1999 and 2014.\n\nThe researchers divided the men into three clinical groups: those who were treated to the point where their total testosterone levels returned to normal (Group 1); those who were treated but without reaching normal (Group 2); and those who were untreated and remained at low levels (Group 3).\n\nImportantly, all three groups were \"propensity matched\" so the comparisons would be between men with similar health profiles. The researchers took into account a wide array of factors that might affect cardiovascular and overall risk. They included, for example, age, body mass index, various chronic diseases, LDL cholesterol levels, and the use of aspirin, beta blockers, and statins.\n\nThe average follow-up across the groups ranged from 4.6 to 6.2 years.\n\nThe sharpest contrast emerged between Group 1 (those who were treated and attained normal levels) and Group 3 (those whose low testosterone went untreated). The treated men were 56 percent less likely to die during the follow-up period, 24 percent less likely to suffer a heart attack, and 36 percent less likely to have a stroke.\n\nThe differences between Group 1 and Group 2 (those who were treated but did not attain normal levels) were similar but less pronounced.\n\nLittle difference emerged between Groups 2 and 3, except for a slight benefit in survival for those who were treated.\n\nBarua and colleagues say they don't know the exact reasons for testosterone's apparent benefits for the heart and overall survival. \"The mechanisms for these effects remain speculative,\" they write. Possible explanations, they say, could involve body fat, insulin sensitivity, lipids, blood platelets, inflammation, or other biological pathways. More research is needed, they say, to clarify how testosterone affects the cardiovascular system.\n\nWhile the new study results do seem to advocate for testosterone replacement therapy, Barua stresses the need for \"appropriate screening, selection, dosing, and follow-up of patients to maximize the benefit of testosterone therapy.\"\n\nThe authors also caution that \"off-label\" use remains a concern. In other words, doctors should not write a prescription simply because an older man is complaining of symptoms such as low energy and low sex drive. According to the FDA, \"Testosterone products are FDA-approved only for use in men who lack or have low testosterone levels in conjunction with an associated medical condition.

And, therefore, alleviating this pain might help reduce the risk for postpartum depression. In the study, researchers reviewed the medical records of 201 women who used epidural analgesia and had their pain assessed using a 0-10 scale during labor. They calculated the percent improvement in pain (PIP) throughout labor after the implementation of epidural analgesia.

But Tirpak's physician, Dr. Mary Laughlin, turned to something deemed medical waste until recently: umbilical cord blood.\n\nCord blood is rich in stem cells and easier to match than adult bone marrow because the immune cells are not developed. Also, patients can get the treatment in about three weeks -- as opposed to six to eight for bone marrow from an adult donor, said Laughlin, founder and medical director of the Cleveland Cord Blood Center.\n\n\"That can be a critical time interval for a patient who is in remission,\" she said, noting that doctors often fear a patient's relapse while awaiting the transplant.\n\nTraditionally, patients with leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma have first tried to find an adult bone marrow donor either from a close relative or from a national bone marrow registry. But the registry's more than 12 million donors meet the needs of only about 60 percent of Caucasians in the United States and only 5 to 15 percent of minorities, who are underrepresented. Even siblings are not a sure thing, with the chance of matching a brother or sister only 25 percent.\n\nNathan Mumford, who is African-American, tried to find a bone marrow donor after his leukemia was diagnosed not long after he graduated from college.\n\n\"We went through that process, and nobody had a match. Siblings are the best matches. My brother or my sister wasn't a match. My friends, aunts, uncles, cousins, nobody was a match. So, couldn't go that route,\" Mumford said.\n\nAt that point, Mumford said, his choices were to continue chemotherapy and live for, maybe, another year and a half. Or he could try a cord blood stem cell transplant.\n\n\"That was an opportunity,\" said Mumford, who survived Hodgkin's disease as a child. \"That was a chance for me to live. I'm not a quitter. I've never been a quitter, so I wasn't going to quit.\"\n\nMumford received a cord blood stem cell transplant in November 2004. In such transplants, patients have chemotherapy, radiation or both to kill the cancer cells and to suppress the immune system so that the new stem cells are not rejected. Then, the stem cells are injected into the patient's body and travel to the bone marrow cavities, where they create new, healthy marrow. Mumford, who's now 30, says he's never felt better.\n\n\"I just feel amazing,\" he said. \"I have a lot of energy, and I'm just excited about it.\"\n\nMumford lives in Cleveland and runs the Karen E. Mumford Foundation. The nonprofit, named for his mother, who died of breast cancer while he was being treated, provides emotional and financial assistance to cancer patients.\n\nTirpak and Mumford represent a growing number of patients taking advantage of stem cells from cord blood, which can be used in patients with leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma. Cord blood transplants among unrelated donors have risen from 1 percent in 2001 to 24 percent last year, Laughlin says.\n\nNationally, more than 200 hospitals accept cord blood donations. Parents must decide before birth whether to bank a child's cord blood. If they do, it's collected immediately after birth, processed, registered in a national database and kept frozen. If collected and stored for private use, the procedure can cost as much as $2,000 or more, plus annual storage fees.\n\nPublic blood banks collect and store the cord blood free of charge. Those parents get their own child's blood unless it has already been given out as a match for someone else. In that case, other matching blood is made available free of charge.\n\nCord blood stem cell transplants have the same risks as adult bone marrow transplants: the new blood rejecting the host, called graft-versus-host disease. And patients still must endure months of recovery. Well worth it, say Mumford and Tirpak, who received her stem cell injection two years ago.\n\n\"Such a tiny few drops of blood cells really give new birth to people,\" Tirpak said.\n\nOn Saturday, her husband, Jake, finally wore the suit he had been saving for his wife's funeral -- at a family wedding.", "question": "Does the story commit disease-mongering?", "explanation": "The article does not appear to engage in disease-mongering.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Newswise \u2014 Montreal, March 22, 2016 \u2014 The proportion of older adults with age-related vision loss is estimated to be as high as one in three over the age of 50. In Canada, that\u2019s roughly 3.6 million people. Many of these individuals turn to adaptive devices designed to magnify objects and text, but these devices can be prohibitively expensive, uni-functional and bulky.\n\nEnter the iPad: a technological device that\u2019s relatively cheap, serves many purposes, is smaller than most books, and \u2014 according to new research from Concordia University in Montreal \u2014 is just as effective a visual aid as traditional devices.\n\nA study recently described in Good Times Magazine provides the first experimental evidence that the Apple iPad is as good as technology traditionally used in reading rehabilitation for individuals with visual impairment.\n\nAnd that could help with stigmatization of the elderly and disabled.\n\nFor the study, the Concordia-based research team recruited 100 participants who ranged in age from 24 to 97. A little over half the participants had age-related macular degeneration, a disease characterized by the deterioration of the small central portion of the retina that is normally responsible for fine detailed vision tasks such as reading.\n\nThe researchers used questionnaires and tests to gauge participants\u2019 visual ability, and then compared the Apple iPad versus two traditionally used magnification devices, to see if reading rates varied across devices.\n\n\u201cUnsurprisingly, we found that most participants found it hard to read small and medium text, while nearly a quarter of them reported that reading large text was much easier,\u201d says Elliott Morrice, an MA student in Concordia\u2019s Department of Psychology and the study\u2019s first author.\n\n\u201cWhat was interesting to note was that it didn\u2019t matter what technology was used to do the magnification: an iPad worked just as well as a traditional device like a closed circuit television system (CCTV),\u201d he says. \u201cWhen we took previous experience into account, we found that participants who had used iPads before read on average 30 words per minute faster than those who were using the iPad for the first time. But there were no significant differences in the reading rates of participants who had previous experience using the CCTV, compared to the reading rates of first-time CCTV users.\u201d\n\nAnother benefit is that many older adults feel stigmatized by using the traditional devices, because they identify them as having an impairment or disability.\n\n\u201cTablet computers offer many of the same benefits while being socially acceptable,\u201d says Aaron Johnson, the study\u2019s senior author, and an associate professor in the psychology department, and a member of the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Rehabilitation of Greater Montreal (CRIR).\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more, compared to the devices currently used by those with low vision, iPads are multi-functional, allowing the user to go online, check email, make video calls \u2014 and they cost less than the traditional devices,\u201d he says. \u201cThis cost saving can be both to the individual, and if appropriate, to the insurance companies that may provide individuals with assistive devices.\u201d\n\nPartners in research: This work was supported in part by the Vision Health Research Network, the Fonds de recherche du Qu\u00e9b\u00e9c - Sant\u00e9, the Antoine Turmel Foundation, CRIR, and the MAB-Mackay Foundation.

McEvoy, MD, MCR, and her co-authors report that at three months of age, the infants whose mothers took 500 mg of vitamin C in addition to their prenatal vitamin had significantly better forced expiratory flows (FEFs). FEFs measure how fast air can be exhaled from the lung and are an important measure of lung function because they can detect airway obstruction.\n\nThe researchers also discovered an association between the infant FEFs and a genetic variant some of the mothers possessed that appeared to amplify the negative impact of nicotine on the babies before they were born. Other studies have linked this genetic factor, specifically for the \u03b15 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, to increased risk of lung cancer and obstructive lung disease.\n\n\u201cSmoking during pregnancy reflects the highly addictive nature of nicotine that disproportionately affects the most vulnerable populations,\u201d said Dr. McEvoy, lead study author and professor of pediatrics at Oregon Health & Science University. \u201cFinding a way to help infants exposed to smoking and nicotine in utero recognizes the unique dangers posed by a highly advertised, addictive product and the lifetime effects on offspring who did not choose to be exposed.\u201d\n\nIn a previous study, the authors had shown that 72 hours after birth, babies of mothers who smoked had better lung function if their mothers were randomized to vitamin C (500 mg/day) during their pregnancies compared to those born to mothers who smoked and were randomized to placebo. That study used passive methods to measure lung function, and the authors note that FEFs provide a more direct assessment of airway function and are similar to methods used to diagnose lung disease in adults and older children.\n\nIn the current study, 251 pregnant women who smoked were randomly assigned at 13 to 23 weeks of gestation to either receive vitamin C (125 women) or a placebo (126 women). Smoking was defined as having had one or more cigarettes in the last week. All participants received smoking cessation counseling throughout the study, and about 10 percent of the women quit smoking during the study.\n\nThe researchers wrote that study results support the hypothesis that oxidative stress caused by cigarette smoking reduces the amount of ascorbic acid, a component of vitamin C, available to the body. At the time they enrolled in the study, the women had lower levels of ascorbic acid than have been reported among women who do not smoke. Those levels rose in study participants who received vitamin C to become comparable to women who do not smoke.\n\nInfants in this study will continue to be followed to track their lung function and respiratory outcomes. The authors believe that future trials of vitamin C supplementation in pregnant smokers should determine whether the benefits are greater if the supplementation starts earlier and continues postnatally in the babies themselves.\n\nSumming up the findings of the current study, Dr. McEvoy said that a relatively low dosage of vitamin C may present \u201ca safe and inexpensive intervention that has the potential to help lung health of millions of infants worldwide.\u201d\n\nHowever, she added, helping mothers quit smoking should remain the primary goal for health professionals and public health officials. \u201cAlthough vitamin C supplementation may protect to some extent the lungs of babies born to mothers who smoke during pregnancy, those children will still be at greater risk for obesity, behavioral disorders and other serious health issues,\u201d she said.\n\nThis study was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the Office of Dietary Supplements.\n\n\u201cFor mothers who smoke during pregnancy, vitamin C may reduce harm #smoking causes to their babies\u2019 #lungs, finds new study of #vitaminC supplementation. #Nosmokingduringpregnancy.\u201d\n\nAbout the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine\n\nThe AJRCCM is a peer-reviewed journal published by the American Thoracic Society.

This means that many currently available drugs simply won't affect it.\n\n\"We were surprised [at the results] because triple-negative breast cancer is very difficult to treat,\" said study lead author Dr. Joyce O'Shaughnessy.\n\n\"The big, big surprise was survival,\" added O'Shaughnessy, who nevertheless stressed that the trial was small and preliminary.\n\nThe findings were enough to generate the interest of Dr. Lisa A. Carey, the co-author of an accompanying editorial.\n\n\"It is early, but it's really exciting because it's a new class of drugs. It isn't that often that we have a completely new approach to treating cancer,\" said Carey, medical director of the University of North Carolina Breast Center in Chapel Hill. \"This is a new book. We've just opened it up.\"\n\nIniparib inhibits a pathway that helps repair DNA; researchers call it the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) pathway. If this chain is interrupted, cancer cells don't have the necessary tools to repair themselves.\n\n\"[PARP inhibitors] work by preventing the cells from repairing damage to their DNA,\" Carey explained.\n\nA similar drug, in fact, has shown benefit in patients with BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 mutations predisposing them to breast and ovarian cancer.\n\nIn this study, 123 patients with triple-negative breast cancer were randomized to receive a commonly used, well-tolerated chemotherapy regimen (gemcitabine and carboplatin) or to receive chemo plus iniparib.\n\nMore than one-half of the women responded to the combination treatment (meaning the tumor volume decreased) versus only about one-third of those receiving chemo alone.\n\nWomen receiving iniparib plus chemo lived an average of 12.3 months compared to just 7.7 months in the chemo-alone group. This may not seen like very long in either group, but for this serious a cancer, it is impressive, the researchers noted.\n\nThis was a phase 2 trial. O'Shaughnessy, who is co-director of breast cancer research at Baylor-Sammons Cancer Center, US Oncology, and Texas Oncology in Dallas, said the results of a larger (about 500 patients) phase 3 trial should be available within one to three months.\n\n\"The whole field is still preliminary and we have to be careful not to overhype the results [as] we're waiting on the results of the phase 3 trial,\" she said. \"Phase 2 was quite positive, but we really don't know if this is going to end up benefiting patients until we get to phase 3.\"\n\nIn her editorial accompanying the study, Carey agreed. \"Both excitement and caution are appropriate in interpreting the trial,\" she wrote. \"Some clear drawbacks should be noted.\" Among them, she said, were the small size of the study group, \"imbalances at baseline\" favoring the iniparib group, and the \"unconventional\" chemotherapy regimen. But caveats notwithstanding, she concluded, the results may herald improved therapy \"for an underserved subgroup of patients with breast cancer.\"\n\nO'Shaughnessy added that the drug was \"extremely well tolerated [by patients]. It didn't seem to add any appreciable toxicity to chemotherapy.\"\n\nIn the meantime, she pointed out, a woman walking through a clinic door who is diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer shouldn't panic. \"If it's only in the breast or lymph nodes, we cure most triple-negative cancers.

Even with this trio of medicines, Mr. Brown\u2019s LDL cholesterol level hovered around 200.\n\nThe two PCSK9 inhibitors approved by the FDA last year were developed as a result of research done by UT Southwestern geneticists Dr. Helen Hobbs and Dr. Jonathan Cohen. Using data from the Dallas Heart Study, a population-based study that gathered extensive medical data on 6,000 Dallas residents, the two researchers showed that certain mutations to the gene that codes for the protein PCSK9 lead to low levels of cholesterol in the blood.\n\nFurther,Dr. Hobbs and Dr. Cohen found a woman who had inherited not one, but two of these mutations in the PCSK9 gene \u2013 one mutation from each parent. This woman had stunningly low levels of LDL cholesterol. While anything below 100 is considered good, her LDL cholesterol level was just 14. Crucially, this woman was in good health, suggesting that therapies aimed at blocking PCSK9 would not only be effective, but also safe.\n\nTheir research led to the development by drug companies of evolocumab and alirocumab, the two approved PCSK9 inhibitors, which are delivered by monthly or semimonthly injections.\n\nDr. Hobbs, Director of the Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development, holds the Eugene McDermott Distinguished Chair for the Study of Human Growth and Development, the Philip O\u2019Bryan Montgomery, Jr., M.D. Distinguished Chair in Developmental Biology, and the 1995 Dallas Heart Ball Chair in Cardiology Research. Dr. Cohen, Professor of Internal Medicine and with the McDermott Center, holds the C. Vincent Prothro Distinguished Chair in Human Nutrition Research. Mr. Brown had been part of a clinical trial testing the safety and effectiveness of one of the new PCSK9 inhibitors and, when the drugs were approved, Dr. Khera began working to get Mr. Brown approved by his insurance to be on the new regimen.\n\n\u201cIn the world of cholesterol patients, most are well-controlled with statins, and they should stay on those,\u201d said Dr. Khera. \u201cBut Mr. Brown is the perfect patient for PCSK9 inhibitors. We knew he could tolerate it because he\u2019d been in a clinical trial, he knew how to administer the injections, and he was very high-risk. We\u2019d exhausted the other options in trying to control his cholesterol.\u201d\n\nTwo months after he started his biweekly injections of the new drug, Mr. Brown\u2019s LDL cholesterol level was down to 111 \u2013 not quite normal, which is 100 or less \u2013 but an almost 50 percent reduction from the level it had been for years.\n\nIt\u2019s a good sign for Mr. Brown, who looks forward to many more years of running his business, watching Dallas Cowboys games, and spending time with his grandchildren.\n\n\u201cThere are many more Frank Browns out there \u2013 patients who can\u2019t control their cholesterol with the standard drugs,\u201d said Dr. Khera. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to have this option to offer this special set of patients.\u201d About UT Southwestern Medical CenterUT Southwestern, one of the premier academic medical centers in the nation, integrates pioneering biomedical research with exceptional clinical care and education.
