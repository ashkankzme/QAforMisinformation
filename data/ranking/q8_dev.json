[{"article": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Scientists for the first time have used gene therapy to successfully destroy cancer tumors in patients with advanced disease \u2014 a goal that has taken 20 years to achieve.\n\nResearchers at the University of Pennsylvania engineered patients\u2019 own pathogen-fighting T-cells to target a molecule found on the surface of leukemia cells.\n\nThe altered T-cells were grown outside of the body and infused back into patients suffering from late-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which affects the blood and bone marrow and is the most common form of leukemia.\n\nTwo participants in the Phase I trial have been in remission for up to a year. A third had a strong anti-tumor response, and his cancer remains in check. The research group plans to treat four more patients with CLL before moving into a larger Phase II trial.\n\n\u201cWe put a key onto the surface of the T-cells that fits into a lock that only the cancer cells have,\u201d said Dr. Michael Kalos, director of translational and correlative studies at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Perelman School of Medicine and an investigator on the study.\n\nThe results provide \u201ca tumor-attack roadmap for the treatment of other cancers,\u201d including those of the lung and ovaries as well as myeloma and melanoma, researchers said.\n\nThe findings were published simultaneously Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine and Science Translational Medicine.\n\nKalos said past efforts to use the technique, known as \u201cadoptive T-cell transfer,\u201d failed either because the T-cell response was too weak or proved too toxic for normal tissue.\n\nThe technique differs from other cancer therapies designed to harness the body\u2019s own immune system to fight tumors \u2014 such as therapeutic cancer vaccines.\n\n\u201cWe are saying forget about stimulating an immune response. We are going to give you an immune response,\u201d Kalos said.\n\nThe treatment appears safe, but researchers said more study was needed. The leukemia patients in the Phase I trial had to be treated with an immunity-boosting drug since the targeted molecule, CD-19, is also present on certain normal immune-system cells.\n\nTo deliver the gene therapy, the researchers used a virus that can only infect cells once. It was used to carry a chimeric antigen receptor targeting CD-19 coupled with receptors for two other components of T-cell activity.\n\nAbout two weeks after the gene therapy, patients began to experience \u201ctumor lysis syndrome\u201d \u2014 chills, nausea and fever \u2014 caused by the break-down products of dying cancer cells.\n\nThe engineered T-cells were detected in patients\u2019 blood for several months afterward, and a portion of them turned into \u201cmemory T-cells,\u201d which could provide ongoing protection against cancer recurrence, researchers surmised.\n\nDr. Walter Urba of the Providence Cancer Center in Portland Oregon cautioned that continued presence of activated T-cells and memory cells might be more of a problem in other types of cancer where toxic effects on normal tissue could be more severe.\n\nIn addition, the long-term viability of the treatment is still unknown.\n\n\u201cOne of the big questions is ... will those persistent T-cells continue to work and prevent that tumor from coming back,\u201d said Urba, who was not involved in the study.\n\nAll of the funding for the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s gene therapy work has come from the academic community, but the work is expensive.\n\n\u201cWe are looking for corporate partners as we head into Phase II trials,\u201d Kalos said.\n\nFurther study will show whether the latest results \u201creflect an authentic advance toward a clinically applicable and effective therapy or yet another promising lead that runs into a barrier that cannot be easily overcome,\u201d Urba said in an NEJM editorial.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story does note the study is a Phase 1 trial iin the 4th sentence and also notes that\u00a0researchers intend to enroll\u00a0four more\u00a0subjects.

Results were published November 2 in the Obesity Journal.\n\nWhile the Weight Management Center has a high success rate at helping patients lose weight to fight diabetes, many people with the condition don't live near a specialized program and need help that's readily available. O'Neil said because Weight Watchers has centers all over the country, including sites in small towns with limited or no medical facilities, its program could help meet this need if combined with diabetes-specific counseling.\n\nThat's why he said it was important for MUSC to be involved in the study, which was funded by a grant from the commercial weight loss program, Weight Watchers. Promoting healthy communities is part of MUSC's mission.\n\nThe multi-site study's results were statistically and clinically significant, O'Neil said.\n\n\"The Weight Watchers people were significantly better off than people who received standard care.\" They achieved better control of their blood sugar and lost more weight, he said. They still had diabetes, but many were able to reduce the amount of medication they were taking.\n\nThe study's 563 participants were all overweight or obese and under a doctor's care for uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes. Half got standard care: a session of nutrition counseling with a registered dietitian and written materials. The other half went to Weight Watchers meetings, had access to Weight Watchers' online materials and had two phone consultations and follow-up email contact with certified diabetes educators who told them how to modify the Weight Watchers plan to help with their diabetes.\n\nParticipants had four follow-up visits related to the study and continued to see their regular doctors for medical management of their diabetes.\n\nAfter a year, people in the Weight Watchers group had an average weight loss of about 4 percent of their starting weight, compared to 2 percent for the standard care group. The Weight Watchers group also had a bigger improvement in a measure of long-term control of their blood sugar, which can reduce the risk for serious problems related to Type 2 diabetes. Left uncontrolled, the condition can damage blood vessels and nerves, putting people at risk of having a heart attack or stroke. It can also cause eye problems, kidney damage and even lead to amputations.\n\u2022 Not getting enough exercise\n\nCertain racial and ethnic groups are more at risk, including African-Americans and Hispanics. Unlike Type 1 diabetes, which is caused by an immune reaction, Type 2 diabetes develops over the course of years. So incremental improvements such as the ones seen in the MUSC-led study are important.\n\n\"It wasn't a huge, overwhelming difference,\" O'Neil said. \"But it was scalable, meaning it could be applied to the whole population.\"\n\nThe whole population of people with Type 2 diabetes includes more than 20 million Americans. It's by far the more common form of diabetes and can lead to about $85,000 in medical costs.\n\nDiabetes is a growing problem. O'Neil said the rate jumped from about 9 percent to 12 percent between 2002 and 2012. Weight loss is seen as a good way to slow its progression.\n\nThe MUSC Health Weight Management Center takes a scientific approach to weight loss, focusing on changes in activity levels, behavior, thinking, diet and support systems. O'Neil said it's important to help people, not blame them.\n\nThe Weight Watchers study is new evidence of what that help might include when it comes to a side effect of weight gain: Type 2 diabetes. \"You do have some power and control,\" he said. \"You can lose some weight and lower your blood sugar - and may even be able to change your medications.

But he says by using an electroencephalogram and new, sophisticated computer programs to analyze the EEGs, he and his co-authors were able to correctly identify with 80% accuracy, which babies were at higher risk for autism and which were not.\n\nScientists have known for quite some time now that the earlier a child with autism gets therapy, the easier it is to improve language and behavioral skills. In 2007, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that all children be screened for autism at the ages of 18 months and 24 months. Here researchers are trying to find markers for autism before a child begins showing signs of autism.\n\nIn a new study published Tuesday in the journal BMC Medicine, scientists studied 79 infants. 46 babies had a brother or sister with known autism, which means they themselves are at an increased risk for the neurodevelopmental disorder that affects about one in 110 children according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The sibling of a child with a confirmed diagnosis of autism has a 1 in 5 chance of also developing the disorder. These infant siblings were compared with 33 infants with no known family history of autism.\n\nThe babies were given EEG's at 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months of age. Researchers strapped a net of 64 electrodes all over a baby's head while it was sitting in its mom's lap and a research assistant was blowing bubbles to hold the child's attention. The electrodes measured actual firings of neurons. The EEG technique is much easier to use because the baby can be awake and moving and wiggling around, says Dr. Geraldine Dawson, chief science officer for the advocacy group Autism Speaks, which partially funded this research. Other brain imaging technologies like magnetic resonance imaging would require a baby to be asleep or sedated because they have to be completely still while the test is being done. \"Nobody wants to sedate a healthy infant,\" says Dawson.\n\nBosl explains that the new computer algorithms that he developed were able to analyze results of the EEG much better than in the past. He said that, judging by the differences in brain activity, he and his colleagues could detect which babies were in the high-risk group. They say they were nearly 100% accurate when the boys were 9 months old. They were most accurate with baby girls at age 6 months. Overall, the biggest differences in brain activity were seen at 9 months \u2013 which is much earlier than when a child typically shows behavioral problems associated with autism. The differences in brain activity were smaller as the babies got older.\n\nDoctors and scientists not connected to the study are intrigued by the results but caution that this is very early research and not something concerned parents can be looking for as a screening tool for their babies any time soon.\n\nSarah Paterson, Ph.D., is the director of the neuroimaging lab at the Center for Autism Research at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. She is also looking for early signs of autism as part of the Infant Brain Imaging Study, but her work focuses on differences in brain structure. Paterson says that if the results out of Boston can be confirmed, \"It's very exciting because finding an early sign for autism is really the holy grail.\" But she cautions that a lot more work needs to be done. \"This study needs to be replicated by their lab and independent scientists,\" she says.\n\nDr. Max Wiznitzer says the researchers have found a \"really fascinating technique, that offers a different way to look at the brain.\" Wiznitzer \u2013 a pediatric neurologist at Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio \u2013 notes that what the study can't tell us is what the differences in brain activity between the two groups of babies actually mean. He, too, is hopeful that further research will provide more concrete information.\n\nBosl says the first children enrolled in his study are now at 2 and 3 years old, which is the age when autism usually is diagnosed. This will now allow the researchers to evaluate them for autism and then look back at the brain activity patterns of the children who do fit the clinical criteria for autism.\n\nBosl acknowledges that if this is very early research, but he believes if the results are confirmed, it may lead to a safe and inexpensive way to detect autism, which would allow intervention before any autistic behaviors appear.\n\n \"It'll change the field, if this works,\" says Bosl. He hopes to expand the number of babies in his study to 200. \"The only thing slowing us down right now is funding.\"", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story made it clear that this was an experimental diagnostic tool and not ready for the pediatrician\u2019s office.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "What is the effect of Topical Curcumin Gel for treating burns and scalds? In a recent research paper, published in the open access journal BioDiscovery, Dr. Madalene Heng, Clinical Professor of Dermatology at the David Geffen School of Medicine, stresses that use of topical curcumin gel for treating skin problems, like burns and scalds, is very different, and appears to work more effectively, when compared to taking curcumin tablets by mouth for other conditions.\n\n\"Curcumin gel appears to work much better when used on the skin because the gel preparation allows curcumin to penetrate the skin, inhibit phosphorylase kinase and reduce inflammation,\" explains Dr Heng.\n\nIn this report, use of curcumin after burns and scalds were found to reduce the severity of the injury, lessen pain and inflammation, and improve healing with less than expected scarring, or even no scarring, of the affected skin. Dr. Heng reports her experience using curcumin gel on such injuries using three examples of patients treated after burns and scalds, and provides a detailed explanation why topical curcumin may work on such injuries.\n\nCurcumin is an ingredient found in the common spice turmeric. Turmeric has been used as a spice for centuries in many Eastern countries and gives well known dishes, such as curry, their typical yellow-gold color. The spice has also been used for cosmetic and medical purposes for just as long in these countries.\n\nIn recent years, the medicinal value of curcumin has been the subject of intense scientific studies, with publication numbering in the thousands, looking into the possible beneficial effects of this natural product on many kinds of affliction in humans.\n\nThis study published reports that topical curcumin gel applied soon after mild to moderate burns and scalds appears to be remarkably effective in relieving symptoms and improved healing of the affected skin.\n\n\"When taken by mouth, curcumin is very poorly absorbed into the body, and may not work as well,\" notes Dr. Heng. \"Nonetheless, our tests have shown that when the substance is used in a topical gel, the effect is notable.\"\n\nThe author of the study believes that the effectiveness of curcumin gel on the skin - or topical curcumin - is related to its potent anti-inflammatory activity. Based on studies that she has done both in the laboratory and in patients over 25 years, the key to curcumin's effectiveness on burns and scalds is that it is a natural inhibitor of an enzyme called phosphorylase kinase.\n\nThis enzyme in humans has many important functions, including its involvement in wound healing. Wound healing is the vital process that enables healing of tissues after injury. The process goes through a sequence of acute and chronic inflammatory events, during which there is redness, swelling, pain and then healing, often with scarring in the case of burns and scalds of the skin. The sequence is started by the release of phosphorylase kinase about 5 mins after injury, which activates over 200 genes that are involved in wound healing.\n\nDr. Heng uses curcumin gel for burns, scalds and other skin conditions as complementary treatment, in addition to standard treatment usually recommended for such conditions.", "question": "Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The news release discusses the uses of curcumin for gastronomical and cosmetic purposes \u2014 many of which go back centuries.

But such removal is painful, makes recovery more difficult and leaves women susceptible to complications, including infections and a chronic, sometimes disabling swelling in their arms known as lymphodema.\n\nIn the new study, Armando Giuliano of the John Wayne Cancer Institute at Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., and colleagues analyzed data collected from 445 women who had their nodes removed and 446 who did not, along with radiation and chemotherapy. They found no significant difference in the patients' chances of surviving five years after their diagnosis. The five-year \"disease-free\" survival rate was 83.9 percent in those who did not have the more aggressive surgery compared with 82.2 in those who did, the researchers reported.\n\nBased on the findings, the researchers said, women who fit the criteria of those in the study probably do not need to undergo the additional surgery. The researchers noted that the study was limited to women with tumors known as T1 or T2, meaning they were relatively small, had no enlarged nodes that could be felt, and the cancer had not spread elsewhere.\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, Grant Walter Carlson and William Wood of Emory University in Atlanta called the study an \"important contribution\" that represents the latest development in breast cancer treatment, which has steadily been moving toward less-aggressive options, sparing women from unnecessary surgery and follow-up therapy.

It\u2019s estimated that about 1 in every 100 people in the UK has ASD. More boys are diagnosed with the condition than girls.\n\nResearch indicates that ASD most likely develops in the womb and that a mother\u2019s diet during pregnancy could have an influence. But results from previous studies have been inconsistent, suggesting that other unmeasured factors (confounding), such as a mother\u2019s overall health and lifestyle, could also play a role.\n\nSo an international research team set out to assess whether nutrient supplementation during pregnancy is associated with reduced risk of ASD, with and without intellectual disability.\n\nThey applied three analytical methods to a sample of 273,107 mother-child pairs living in Stockholm, Sweden. The sample was restricted to children who were 4 to 15 years of age by December 31 2011 and were born between 1996 and 2007.\n\nWomen reported their use of folic acid, iron, and multivitamin supplements at their first antenatal visit and cases of child ASD were identified from national registers.\n\nAfter adjusting for several potentially influencing factors in both mothers and children, the researchers found that multivitamin use, with or without additional iron and/or folic acid, was associated with a lower likelihood of child ASD with intellectual disability relative to mothers who did not use folic acid, iron, and multivitamins.\n\nThere was no consistent evidence that either iron or folic acid use were associated with a reduced risk of ASD.\n\nThe results of the various analyses seemed to be consistent with each other, say the authors, suggesting that the association between multivitamins and ASD might not be fully explained by confounding.\n\nThey point to several study limitations, such as the potential for confounding and difficulty assessing type, timing and dose of supplements. However strengths included the relatively large population-based sample size and the advanced analytical methods used to gauge the robustness of findings.\n\n\u201cTogether, the three analyses appear to point toward a potential inverse association between multivitamin use with ASD with intellectual disability,\u201d say the authors.\n\nGiven the current understanding and strength of evidence supporting the importance of nutritional supplementation during pregnancy, \u201cit is impossible to imagine that these results, on their own, should change current practice,\u201d they write.

But the authors of a new study believe giving it early may slow and even reverse some disease-related disability.\n\n\"The expectation in MS has always been to try to slow down the progression of the disease. Now we can tell our patients that a significant number can actually improve by reversing their disability,\" said lead researcher Dr. Gavin Giovannoni. He is a neurology professor at Queen Mary University of London in England.\n\nThe treatment is not without its downsides, however. Because of the potential for side effects, people who received this treatment have to undergo monthly blood and urine tests for four years after the last dose, Giovannoni said.\n\nGiovannoni described Lemtrada as an immune system \"rebooter.\" First, it depletes the immune system, then it allows it to recover, he explained.\n\nDuring the time when the immune system is depleted, there is a risk of infection over eight to 12 weeks, including herpes infections, he said.\n\nAlso, when the immune system rebuilds itself, \"a significant number of people, about 40 percent, will develop another autoimmune disease,\" Giovannoni said. These include Graves' disease (a thyroid disorder) and a bleeding/bruising disorder called idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), which occurs in about 2 percent of patients, he noted.\n\n\"But these diseases can be treated, so it's not like MS. It's kind of trading in your MS for another autoimmune disease,\" Giovannoni said.\n\nStill, one MS specialist who reviewed the new study said patients need to be cautious about taking the drug.\n\nLemtrada is not for every patient with MS and the decision to use it should be carefully considered, said Dr. Dhanashri Miskin, an attending neurologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\n\"Although the safety profile is generally manageable for the right patient, risks probably outweigh benefits in patients with mild or early stage disease,\" Miskin said.\n\nThe decision to start Lemtrada should be made in the context of the risks, including infusion-associated reactions, infections, and autoimmune adverse events, she said. \"Although alemtuzumab [Lemtrada] treatment is associated with safety risks, those risks are manageable in most patients,\" Miskin said.\n\nThe new trial of more than 600 patients with relapsing-remitting MS was funded by Sanofi Genzyme and Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, the drug's makers.\n\nMS occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the protective sheath around nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. People can suffer muscle weakness, numbness, vision problems and difficulty with balance and coordination. Relapsing-remitting MS is the most common type, with symptoms suddenly worsening and then going into remission.\n\nFor this study, Giovannoni and colleagues treated 628 patients with relapsing-remitting MS who had not responded to at least one other MS drug. Lemtrada was given to 426 patients, while 202 received another drug, interferon beta-1a.\n\nThe researchers assessed disability levels at the start of the study and every three months for two years. By the study's end, nearly 28 percent of those given Lemtrada had improved by at least one point on a 10-point disability test, versus about 15 percent of those receiving interferon, the researchers found.\n\nMoreover, patients receiving Lemtrada were 2.5 times more likely to have their thinking skills improve compared to those given interferon. And they were more than twice as likely to see improvement in their ability to move without tremor or clumsiness, the findings showed.\n\nThe findings held after researchers adjusted the results to make sure the gains weren't led by those recovering from relapses.\n\nGiovannoni believes the drug could offer real relief from MS symptoms.

Each year, almost 800,000 Americans suffer a stroke, and more than 140,000 die.\n\nAlthough many patients take drugs like statins and medicine to reduce their risk of stroke, surgical treatment of severe blockages in the carotid artery has been shown to be more effective than medical therapy alone in preventing ischemic strokes caused by a buildup of plaque in the arteries.\n\nThe Crest trial, sponsored by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke with additional financing from the stent maker Abbott Vascular, is one of the largest randomized clinical trials to study the two major procedures used to open blocked neck arteries and restore blood flow to the brain.\n\nIt included 2,502 patients at more than 100 in the United States and Canada, who were randomly assigned to receive either surgery or stenting over a period of nine years. Most of the patients had an artery blockage greater than 70 percent. The trial included patients who had suffered a stroke or a ministroke and those who were asymptomatic.\n\nThe death rate in the trial was very low, but risks varied depending on the procedure. Within the first month after the procedure, 4.1 percent of stent patients had suffered a stroke, compared with 2.3 percent of the surgery patients.

She quickly noticed a big difference.\n\n\"I didn't feel ravenous, and I didn't want to snack all day long,\" she says.\n\nOver the next year, Qnexa helped Wade slowly drop about 40 pounds, and keep it off for another year. \"It makes you feel so much better,\" Wade says. \"Your back don't hurt, your feet don't hurt.\"\n\nBut the FDA rejected Qnexa in 2010 because of concerns about side effects, especially possible heart problems and birth defects.\n\nQnexa's rejection came amid a flurry of failed attempts by drug companies to win approvals of new weight-loss drugs. The setbacks put a spotlight on how the FDA handles these drugs.\n\nEven though obesity is at epidemic levels, the FDA hasn't approved any new weight-loss medicines since 1999.\n\n\"We have two-thirds of all Americans who are overweight or obese, and the costs are nearing $150 billion a year,\" says Christine Ferguson, a health policy professor at George Washington University. \"The sheer magnitude of the problem really requires us to address it more aggressively and thoughtfully than we have.\"\n\nFerguson has been helping to organize a series of meetings involving public health experts, anti-obesity advocates, government officials and others to try to figure out what the FDA should do.\n\n\"We actually have this huge gap,\" says Joe Nadglowski of the Obesity Action Coalition, who has been participating in the meetings. \"We go from Weight Watchers to bariatric surgery.

They say the FDA wrongly still tends to view weight-loss drugs as diet pills \u2014 something frivolous and used primarily for cosmetic purposes.\n\n\"We are not talking about medications to help someone lose five pounds to fit into their prom dress or wedding dress. We're talking about medications to help those who are struggling with the health impact of obesity,\" Nadglowski says.\n\nSo Nadglowski and others are pushing the FDA to take into consideration whether the risks of new drugs may be outweighed by their benefits beyond weight loss, such as reducing the risk for heart disease, diabetes and other complications of obesity.\n\nWoodcock says officials realize they may have to think about things differently.\n\nAs the FDA works through this, many are watching how the agency handles Qnexa. An FDA advisory panel is scheduled to review Qnexa again on Feb. 22.\n\nBarbara Troupin of Vivus, the company that is developing Qnexa, says the drug appears to do a lot more than just help people lose weight.\n\n\"We see decreases in blood pressure. We see decreased rates of progression to diabetes. We see improvements in sleep apnea. We see improvements in quality of life. Pretty much all of our data shows significant benefits,\" she says.\n\nVivus hopes the FDA will agree that those benefits will outweigh some of the risks, including the concerns about birth defects. The company is submitting new data it says show that the risk is lower than had been feared. Vivus also has a plan to minimize the chances that pregnant women will take it.\n\nSome see Qnexa as a test of the FDA trying to recalibrate how it weighs risks and benefits for weight-loss drugs.\n\nFor her part, Wade just wants to be able to start taking it again.

They also reported paying less attention to pain.\n\nIn general, they also had less disability, a reduced fear of moving, and improvement in mental and physical outlook, according to the study authors.\n\n\"These positive effects were found until the last follow-up measurement at one year after treatment,\" Malfliet said.\n\nThe program involves \"pain neuroscience education with cognition-targeted motor control training,\" she said.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nPain neuroscience education aims to change patients' beliefs about pain, to increase their knowledge of pain and to decrease its threat, Malfliet said.\n\nBesides focusing on the makeup of the spine, the program stressed lifting techniques and stretching.

Results from the first of three key clinical trials could arrive by year's end.\n\nScientists are cautious: In a hunt spanning two decades, no one has found a medication to help treat cocaine addiction, and there's no guarantee that modafinil will pan out.\n\nBut for Dr. Nora Volkow, director of NIH's National Institute on Drug Abuse, the narcolepsy medicine tops the list of promising potential therapies.

Optimistic people are likely to have better diets, they\u2019re exercising more, and they\u2019re getting better sleep.\u201d\n\nHowever, even after the researchers accounted for these factors, the results still suggest that optimism itself is linked to a longer life.\n\n\u201cSo it could be that optimism directly impacts our biological functioning,\u201d Hagan said. \u201cOptimism is linked with lower inflammation and healthier biomarker levels and lipid levels, so there could be an independent effect on optimism.\u201d\n\nShe said her team plans to focus more on the potential impact of optimism on biological functioning in future research.\n\nThe authors point out that since the study was only done in women, who were mainly white, the results might not be generalizable to other populations.

About 25% of all women who become pregnant have a first-trimester loss. But for some women, every pregnancy results in a loss. The researchers studied the effects of micronized plant-derived progesterone in 116 of these women who had experienced two or more pregnancy losses.\n\nTo determine whether a woman's endometrium (uterine lining) is healthy and can sustain the embryo, the research team used the endometrial function test (EFT\u00ae), which was created by study co-author Harvey J. Kliman, M.D., director of the Reproductive and Placental Research Unit in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at Yale School of Medicine. An abnormal EFT is associated with pregnancy failure, while a normal EFT is associated with pregnancy success. Kliman and the team focused on the nCyclinE molecular marker as a way to assess patients with recurrent pregnancy loss.\n\nWomen in the study with an abnormal nCyclinE level were prescribed progesterone two days after ovulation, when the uterine lining matures in preparation for a possible pregnancy.\n\nThe researchers believe that the progesterone caused the patients' endometrium to produce more endometrial secretions. \"The endometrium feeds the baby up until the eighth week of pregnancy. Then at 9 to 10 weeks the mother's blood takes over to feed the embryo,\" said Kliman.\n\n\"In this subset of women experiencing multiple early miscarriages, we assume that their embryos were literally starving to death,\" Kliman added. \"They attached, but they were not getting enough food. When we give progesterone back to these women, the endometrium makes more nutrients and prevents their pregnancy loss.\n\nKliman said he initially created the Endometrial Function Test (EFT\u00ae), which uses the nCyclinE marker, to identify women with infertility. \"This study has shown that the EFT can also be an important tool for patients with recurrent pregnancy loss,\" he said.\n\nKliman worked with lead author Mary Stephenson, M.D., the Dr. Theresa S. Falcon-Cullinan Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Illinois at Chicago and director of the University of Illinois Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Program.\n\n\"We are very pleased to find that these results reinforce the evidence that progesterone could be a very beneficial, inexpensive, and safe treatment for many women with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss,\" said Stephenson. \"The positive results show us that next we need to study progesterone as a treatment for recurrent pregnancy loss with a prospective randomized trial to validate the findings.\"\n\nOther authors on the study included Dana McQueen, M.D., and Michelle Wintes, M.D.", "question": "Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Progesterone is widely available, but what about the EFT? \u00a0We don\u2019t have any idea after reading this news release.

The study, known as Active, examined the effects of cognitive training programs on 2,785 healthy older adults.\n\nParticipants were divided into three groups. One got training for memory improvement, one for reasoning and one with computerized training in speed-of-processing.\n\nIn the speed training, which emphasized visual perception, individuals were asked to identify objects on a screen quickly.

Researchers compared measures of quality, safety, clinical outcomes, quality of life and costs of home infusion services to those provided in medical settings. The research showed that patients receiving intravenous therapy at home had as good or better clinical outcomes as those patients who received the same therapy in a traditional health care setting. In addition, patients overwhelmingly preferred receiving their infusion therapies at home, reporting fewer disruptions in personal schedules and responsibilities. The costs associated with home infusion were also consistently lower than services provided in a health care facility, with savings ranging between $1,928 and $2,974 per course of treatment.\n\n\"At CVS Health, we provide important home infusion services to patients through Coram, which is just one of the ways we are expanding our clinical delivery model and helping to move important health services to lower cost sites of care,\" added Alan Lotvin, MD, Executive Vice President, CVS Specialty. \"In fact, our patients report high satisfaction with our Coram home infusion services, citing convenience and comfort as key elements that improved their overall experience.\"\n\n\n\nHome infusion services are a rapidly growing delivery model in the health care system with rising rates of chronic and acute conditions that require intravenous therapy. Despite this, clinical outcomes and quality of care have not previously been systematically evaluated. While many commercial health plans provide comprehensive coverage for home infusion services, Medicare has limited reimbursement for this type of care, and Congress is discussing how to implement a comprehensive home infusion benefit for Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nCoram, a service provided by CVS Health, provides vital infusion care and support to tens of thousands of Americans each month with a range of conditions including immune deficiencies, rheumatoid arthritis and serious infections requiring intravenous antibiotic therapy.

In the studies detailed on Sunday, both drugs reduced the bad cholesterol by about 60 percent, to about 50 milligrams per deciliter from about 120 at the start of the studies. In many cases such big reductions were achieved even though the patients were already taking statins.\n\nBoth drugs could win approval from the Food and Drug Administration by this summer. Analysts say the drugs will have billions of dollars in annual sales and will be taken by millions of people who cannot lower their cholesterol enough using statins alone or cannot tolerate statins. (However, the PCSK9 drugs are taken by injection every two weeks or four weeks, which could deter some users.)\n\nStatins reduce cardiovascular risk and scientists believe it is because they decrease low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol. But merely looking at cholesterol levels can be misleading. The drug niacin did not protect against heart attacks and strokes even though it raised so-called good cholesterol and modestly lowered bad cholesterol.\n\nInsurers in particular might demand proof that the PCSK9 drugs stave off heart attacks, strokes, deaths from coronary disease and procedures to open arteries before agreeing to pay for them for many patients. Executives at CVS Health, a leading pharmacy benefits manager, recently said that PCSK9 inhibitors might cost $7,000 to $12,000 a year and would strain health care budgets because so many people might use them.\n\n\u201cManaged care pharmacy, indeed the health care system, has never seen a challenge like this to our resilience in absorbing costs,\u201d they wrote in the Health Affairs blog.\n\nWhether the results from these two small studies will be persuasive enough remains to be seen.\n\nThe study of Amgen\u2019s evolocumab involved 4,465 patients with various degrees of risk, two-thirds of whom were randomly chosen to get the drug in addition to the medication they were already taking.

For the study, researchers from Lund University in Sweden recruited 121 young adults who had injured their A.C.L.\u2019s. The volunteers, between 18 and 35, were physically active, and many were competitive athletes. They agreed, rather bravely, to be randomly assigned to one of two groups and accept radically different treatments for their torn A.C.L.\u2019s. The first group began physical therapy and then underwent surgical reconstruction of the ligament, considered by many people to be the best option for injured athletes. The second group received only physical therapy, with the option to have the operation later. Twenty-three subjects of that group did eventually have the operation. (For those fortunate enough not to be personally familiar with A.C.L. surgery, reconstruction involves replacing the injured ligament with tissue from elsewhere in your own leg or from a cadaver.)\n\nOver two years, the injured knees were assessed using a comprehensive numerical score that rated pain, function during activity and other measures. At the time of the original injury, the knee also had been scored. At the end of the two years, both groups showed considerable improvement. The scores for the surgically repaired knees had risen by 39.2 points. The scores for the more conservatively treated knees also had risen, by 39.4 points. In other words, the outcomes were virtually identical. Despite a widespread belief that surgery leads to a stronger knee, the results showed that surgically reconstructing the A.C.L. as soon as possible after the tear \u201cwas not superior\u201d to more conservative treatment, the study\u2019s authors wrote. The findings suggest, the authors concluded, that \u201cmore than half the A.C.L. reconstructions\u201d currently being conducted on injured knees \u201ccould be avoided without adversely affecting outcomes.\u201d\n\nThis possibility should reverberate across playing fields nationwide, where, at the moment, preseason high school, collegiate and adult-league sports practices are under way, with a concomitant surge in A.C.L. tears. By one estimate, as many as 1 in every 556 fit, active people will tear an A.C.L. \u2014 particularly if they participate in sports that involve frequent pivoting and landing, like soccer, football, tennis, skiing and basketball. At the same time, the urge to treat the injury with surgery appears to be growing. The \u201cbelief among most surgeons and patients is that surgery is a \u2018must,\u2019 at least if you aim to go back into an active lifestyle,\u201d the Swedish authors of the study e-mailed in response to questions.\n\nPart of the reason for A.C.L. surgery\u2019s popularity is that by most measures, it works. In the current study, most of the group members who had reconstructive surgery reported that their injured knees felt healthy after two years and that they had returned to activity \u2014 not, in most cases, at the same level as before their injuries, but they were active. Significantly, their knees also were notably more \u201cstable\u201d than the joints that hadn\u2019t been surgically fixed. Stability is, in theory, desirable. A stable knee rarely gives way.\n\nBut in practice, the importance of stability after A.C.L. treatment is \u201ccontroversial,\u201d The New England Journal study\u2019s authors, Richard Frobell, Ph.D., and Stefan Lohmander, M.D., Ph.D., of Lund University, wrote in their e-mail. In an important 2009 study published in The British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers retrospectively compared outcomes after 10 years in competitive athletes who had surgery or had opted for conservative treatment of their torn A.C.L.\u2019s. The surgically repaired knees were notably more stable. But they weren\u2019t fundamentally healthier. The surgically reconstructed knees and the conservatively treated joints experienced similar (and high) levels of early onset knee arthritis, a common occurrence after an A.C.L. tear. The treatments were almost identical, too, in terms of whether the athletes could return to sports and whether they reported subsequent knee problems.\n\nWhy, then, undergo A.C.L. reconstruction, an operation that can be expensive and, like all surgical procedures, carries risks? Several top-flight orthopedic surgeons I contacted say that they remain convinced that surgery leads to a better long-term outcome for certain patients, particularly if they want to return to pivoting sports. \u201cThe reason to have the surgery is to preserve\u201d other parts of the knee from injury during activity, says Dr. Warren Dunn, an assistant professor of orthopedics and rehabilitation at Vanderbilt University who has extensively studied A.C.L. tears. He points out that in The New England Journal of Medicine study, only 8 percent of the patients in the first surgical group subsequently tore a meniscus, a fragile pillow of cartilage that can rip if a knee gives way. Twenty-five percent of those in the physical therapy group eventually tore their meniscuses.\n\nWhat these numbers mean for anyone who tears an A.C.L. or is the parent of a young athlete in that situation is that they should have a long, frank conversation with an orthopedic surgeon and possibly also a nonsurgical sports-medicine specialist about options. \u201cWe recommend surgery based on activity level and sports,\u201d Dr. Dunn says. \u201cMost subjects can do in-line activities\u201d like running or biking \u201cwithout an A.C.L.\u201d He adds, \u201cOn the other hand, we believe that A.C.L.-deficient subjects that do return\u201d to sports involving cutting, pivoting or planting the leg \u201ccan consequently injure the meniscus\u201d or other cartilage in the knee and would benefit from a replacement A.C.L.\n\nThe authors of the study are less sure. \u201cOn the basis of our study results, we\u2019d tell patients\u201d that \u201cthere is no apparent downside of starting a good rehab program and waiting with the surgery decision to see if it is needed or not,\u201d the authors wrote to me.\n\nThe ultimate lesson of The New England Journal study is almost certainly that more science on the subject is needed. \u201cWe definitely know only parts of the long-term outcome\u201d after different A.C.L. treatments, says Dr. Duncan Meuffels, an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam and lead author of The British Journal of Sports Medicine study.\n\nBut large-scale, randomized controlled studies, the gold standard of medical research, may be difficult to orchestrate, in part because people with shredded A.C.L.\u2019s can balk at being denied surgery. In The New England Journal study, some of those assigned to physical therapy wound up requesting surgery, although they weren\u2019t experiencing any knee problems. For them, it seems, \u201cthe desire to undergo surgery was based on expectations rather than symptoms,\u201d the authors told me. It may be years, unfortunately, before we know if such expectations are justified or if unreconstructed injured knees can be fine.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "It\u2019s clear that ACL\u00a0surgery and physical therapy are available.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A Maryland medical group has started treating autistic children in South Florida with shots of a drug used for chemical castration, a therapy widely panned by mainstream experts.\n\nThe group gives children the cancer drug Lupron to stop their bodies from making testosterone, saying the drug helps expel toxic mercury and quells aggressive or sexually explicit behavior by kids with excessive levels of the male hormone.\n\nA Boca Raton mother who just put her 18-year-old son on the drug said it seems to help.\n\nBut numerous physicians, researchers and therapists insist there's no proof mercury causes autism, that Lupron removes mercury or that autistic kids have excessive testosterone. What's more, the drug carries a risk of bone damage, stunted growth and heart trouble, and can render children impotent.\n\nThese experts contend that Lupron, costing about $5,000 a month but seldom covered by insurance, is one of many treatments that cash in on the desperation of parents trying to cope with an incurable condition for which medicine has few good answers outside of painstaking behavioral therapy.\n\n\"Not only is there no scientific backing whatsoever for Lupron treatments, there are several major concerns for the children's health,\" said neurologist BethAnn McLaughlin, an adviser to the Dan Marino Foundation autism group in Weston and the mother of two developmentally disabled children.\n\n\"These people are preying on the fears of parents. We cannot be using these children who are so vulnerable as guinea pigs in a medical experiment.\"\n\nUntested autism treatments have flourished while science struggles to explain the disorder, which disrupts the abilities to speak, concentrate, connect with people and control impulses.\n\nFor unknown reasons, autism has been on the rise for the past few decades, with an estimated 675,000 children \u2013 about one in 100 \u2013 now having mild to severe symptoms. Scientists believe it stems from genetic defects that may only cause problems after an environmental trigger.\n\nA vocal subset of parents and activists blame vaccines, especially those with the mercury-based preservative thimerosal, which has been banned from virtually all as a precaution. Numerous studies have found no connection between autism and vaccines or thimerosal.\n\nLupron therapy grew from the mercury camp. Baltimore researcher Dr. Mark Geier started using the drug in 2005 on the theory \u2013 disputed by mainsteam doctors \u2013 that testosterone binds mercury in the body and that many autistic kids have high levels of the hormone.\n\nLupron halts production of the female hormone estrogen, which the body uses to make testosterone. The drug mainly is used to treat endometrial cancer in women and prostate cancer in men, and sometimes to chemically castrate sex offenders.\n\nGeier's promotional materials said he has treated hundreds of children with Lupron and has launched nine ASD Centers in eight states. In his latest, he teams with Dr. David Clayman, a Boca Raton radiologist who has an autistic teen son and is opening an ASD office beside his MRI center in Tamarac.\n\nClayman said he would not comment until he treats patients with Lupron therapy for a year. Geier could not be reached for comment despite several attempts by phone. He told one parent he did not plan to comment for this story.\n\nThe medical group began recruiting Florida patients in March when Geier spoke at a Fort Lauderdale conference for parents of children with autism.\n\nTeresa Badillo was at the meeting. Her family has searched in vain for a way to help their autistic son, Marco, 18. Badillo said he has little speech or interaction with others, but is doing OK in high school. Lately, though, Marco has grown more aggressive, physical and rebellious.\n\n\"We were basically under seige in this house,\" Badillo said. \"This kind of behavior is more scary at 18 [than] at 3. I had choices to make. If you see there is another option out there that can help your child, most parents are going to choose that option.\"\n\nAlso, Marco had discovered sex and sometimes touched himself inappropriately in public, a common problem among those with autism.\n\n\"The kids don't understand. They have impulses. It's what happens when you have high testosterone,\" Badillo said.\n\nThe family put Marco on Lupron about six weeks ago. He gets two injections a month at a dosage larger than used on adult cancer patients, plus a small daily shot.\n\n\"The therapy immediately stopped the aggression,\" Badillo said. \"This is not castrating a kid. It's just lowering the [testosterone] levels enough to normal range so the kid is not aggressive.\"\n\nShe said Geier plans to continue the Lupron for several months to see if it helps Marco's other autistic behavior. She said she knows the drug has risks but believes Lupron critics do not fully grasp the hard realities of life with an autistic child.\n\nLupron critics said autism parents may not understand the dangers.\n\nThe drug is not approved for children \u2013 except a rare few with premature puberty \u2013 because it can impair bone development crucial to growth, said Dr. Gary Berkovitz, chief of pediatric endocrinology at the University of Miami medical school.\n\nIt's not recommended for people with heart disease, kidney disease, asthma, depression or seizures because it can worsen those conditions. Autistic children are prone to seizures.\n\n\"It has not been tested so there's no way to know if it has adverse effects in the long run,\" Berkovitz said.\n\nSaid neurologist McLaughlin: \"We have very significant concerns about irreversible damage to sexual function and the brain and sex organs of these children.\"\n\nIn addition, the Food and Drug Administration is investigating complaints that Lupron causes diabetes in adults.\n\nGeier published a 2006 study contending that 11 autistic children taking Lupron did better on tests of awareness, sociability and behavior. He has since issued other studies finding that mercury leads to excess testosterone and that autistic children have excessive levels of the hormone.\n\nOther doctors said Geier's studies were small, were not scientifically sound and were published in journals that do not follow the standard practice of having experts review the methods.\n\nThe area's largest autism treatment center jointly run by the University of Miami and Nova Southeastern University, as well as another at Florida Atlantic University, frown on Lupron and other untested therapies, officials at the centers said.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "It\u2019s clear from the story that Lupron is already used to treat endometrial cancer and prostate cancer.\u00a0 The story might have addressed more directly its current off-label use.\u00a0\u00a0 \nIt\u2019s also clear that this is about a Maryland medical group taking its idea on the road to South Florida.\u00a0 Ideally, the story might have addressed whether it\u2019s being tried elsewhere.

A new study identifies patterns of communication that can help couples affected by Alzheimer\u2019s maintain a sense of connection, which could improve quality of life for both partners.\n\nPrevious research on communication in couples affected by Alzheimer\u2019s has tended to focus on deficits, said study author Christine Williams, professor and director of the PhD in Nursing program at Florida Atlantic University\u2019s Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing. Identifying patterns that help couples maintain their bond could make it easier for caregiving spouses to find meaning and improve satisfaction with their marriage.\n\n\u201cNo one is looking at it from the perspective of what these couples are doing right, what is helping,\u201d said Williams, whose findings were published in the International Journal for Human Caring. \u201cSome past research has involved a caregiver giving directions and seeing if his or her spouse [with Alzheimer\u2019s] can follow. A relationship is obviously so much more than that.\u201d\n\nMembers of Williams\u2019s research team visited 15 couples in their home once a week for 10 weeks. The couples, who were recruited from a day program for people with memory disorders and their spouses, were receiving coaching in communication, with caregivers learning to listen, to avoid arguing, to not treat their spouse like a child. Twice during the 10 weeks, the couples were asked to discuss a topic of their choosing while the researcher left the room. A total of thirty 10-minute conversations were recorded.\n\nIn analyzing the recordings, Williams identified 10 communication patterns that caregiving spouses used to connect with their partners and show affection. These patterns showed the caregivers applying what they\u2019d learned through coaching in creative ways, she said. They included sharing news about friends or relatives or plans for the day as a way to involve their spouse in day-to-day events; waiting patiently and keeping eye contact while spouses searched for words; and finding alternate ways to communicate \u2014 for example, singing songs together when attempts to engage the spouse in certain topics failed.\n\nThe caregiving spouses seemed to value their partners\u2019 efforts to communicate as much as or more than the actual content of their conversations. They were willing to listen to stories they had heard before, and resisted correcting their partners\u2019 versions of past events. This showed that they \u201cvalue the relationship more than being right,\u201d Williams said.\n\nSome of the caregivers did voice frustration or tried to teach their partners information they had forgotten. Future research might focus on interventions that could help diffuse these frustrations, the paper noted. Yet Williams hopes that the more supportive and positive communication patterns that many of the caregivers showed will help nurses coach spouses and family members affected by Alzheimer\u2019s. Previous research has found that communication decline among people with dementia is a significant source of stress to caregivers, and most say they need education about communication.\n\n\u201cThe reality is, a person with dementia isn\u2019t going to have a dramatic breakthrough and remember things forgotten,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAt the same time, people with Alzheimer\u2019s do have moments of clarity or show affection when it\u2019s unexpected.

The subjects in both groups took weekly 75-minute classes and practiced yoga or deep stretching at home for about 20 minutes at a time at least three days a week.\n\nThe study is the largest and most thorough to date to look at whether yoga has an effect on chronic low back pain, a problem that affects millions and has no surefire long-term remedy. A number of earlier studies suggested that regular yoga classes might benefit back pain sufferers, though most were limited by small sample sizes, short study periods and other flaws.\n\nThe latest study, published in The Archives of Internal Medicine, involved more than 200 people who were followed for up to 26 weeks.\n\n\u201cThis is good news for yoga,\u201d said Karen J. Sherman, lead author of the study and senior scientific investigator at Group Health Research Institute in Seattle. \u201cThe smaller studies which hinted that yoga might be helpful all had problems one way or another. This is a much larger study, and the findings are robust.\u201d\n\nAbout four out of five people experience low back pain at some point in their lives, prompting Americans to spend $50 billion a year on medications, physical therapy and related costs. Exercise, and in particular strength-training routines that develop muscles of the trunk and core, can help reduce pain and improve function, though many people avoid them for fear of doing further harm.\n\nTo find out whether the movements and static poses associated with yoga could make a difference, as earlier research had suggested, Dr. Sherman and her colleagues recruited 228 people with chronic low back pain in the Seattle area. Their mean age was in the late 40s to 50, and they were randomly assigned to one of three groups. One group took weekly yoga classes over 12 weeks, which typically included breathing exercises, 5 to 11 postures and guided deep relaxation. Another group went to weekly stretching classes built around aerobic exercises, deep stretches and strengthening exercises focused on the trunk and leg muscles. Both groups were given handouts and instructional CDs and DVDs and asked to practice 20 minutes at home on days when there was no class. Those in the third group served as \u201cself-care\u201d controls and received a book containing advice on back exercises and ways to reduce pain.\n\nAfter 12 weeks, those in the yoga group were, over all, significantly less bothered by symptoms than the control group, and they reported better function and less difficulty in mundane daily activities like walking up stairs and bending down to put on socks. The improvements remained when the researchers checked with them 26 weeks after the start of the study. Those in the stretching group saw just as much benefit as the people taking yoga. More than half of the subjects in each group improved on measurements of function by at least 50 percent, compared with less than a quarter of the controls.\n\n\u201cCompared with self-care, yoga and stretching class participants were significantly more likely to rate their back pain as better, much better or completely gone at all follow-up times,\u201d the study noted. \u201cMore participants in the yoga and stretching groups were very satisfied with their overall care for back pain.\u201d\n\nDr. Sherman said that like many other therapies for low back pain, yoga probably would not work for everyone. For those who want to try, a weekly class and a few 20-minute sessions at home might be a good starting point, she said.\n\n\u201cDoes everybody need to practice at least 20 minutes a day three times a week? It probably depends on your back pain,\u201d she said. \u201cAt a certain point in time you learn what your back needs.\u201d\n\nAs an alternative to yoga, stretching may be a viable option. Dr. Sherman recommended taking an intensive stretching class, then establishing a routine at home. But she cautioned that her study looked specifically at deep stretching that is far more involved than the brief, light stretches most people do before or after a workout.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like stretching each leg for 30 seconds,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s much more intensive.

The protection was seen for oral and pharyngeal cancer, but not for cancer of the larynx.\n\nDrinking less than five cups of coffee a day had a smaller but statistically significant protective effect: about 4% lower odds of mouth and throat cancer for each cup drunk daily.\n\nWas it the caffeine? Probably not. Though there weren't enough data on decaf drinkers to draw conclusions, drinking tea -- even massive quantities -- was not protective.\n\nGaleone and colleagues note that coffee contains more than a thousand chemicals.

But whether these substances actually protect against cancer in humans is a question for future studies.\n\nMost head and neck cancers are linked to alcohol consumption and to smoking.

Todd McAllister of Cytograft Tissue Engineering in California and colleagues implanted lab-grown blood vessels into 10 patients with advanced kidney disease in Argentina and Poland from 2004 to 2007.\n\nEarly results for two of these patients were announced in 2005. In 2007, the scientists published preliminary findings for another 4 patients in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nIn this most recent study, published Friday in the medical journal Lancet, scientists reported on the new blood vessels in those same patients and 4 others.\n\nDialysis patients need a vessel, or shunt, to connect them to dialysis machines. This can be made from their own vessels. But because dialysis is done so regularly, kidney patients often run out of healthy vessels and need an artificial one, often made out of gortex. Those are prone to infection and inflammation.\n\nIn the study, doctors took a small snippet of skin from patients. Cells from those samples were grown in a lab, to help them produce proteins like elastin and collagen. From those, scientists made sheets of tissue that were rolled into blood vessels 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 centimeters) long.\n\nThe vessels were finished after 6 to 9 months. All of the vessels were implanted into patients' upper arms, to connect them to dialysis machines.\n\nThe vessels failed in three of the patients, which experts said was not surprising in patients so seriously ill.

Honey is also known to have antioxidant and antimicrobial properties.\n\nIn one double-blind study published in The Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, researchers recruited 105 children and teenagers who had coughs from upper-respiratory infections. The subjects were randomly divided into three groups: one that received no treatment, another that received one or two teaspoons of buckwheat honey, and a third that received a dose of honey-flavored dextromethorphan. Ultimately, the honey produced the greatest improvements when it came to better sleep and reduced cough frequency and severity.\n\nThe study was carried out by pediatricians at the Pennsylvania State University medical school and supported by a grant from the National Honey Board, an industry-backed agency of the Department of Agriculture.\n\nIn a similar study published in the journal Pediatrics in 2004, researchers recruited 100 children with upper respiratory tract infections who had been coughing for an average of over three days. The children were given a cough syrup with dextromethorphan, a cough syrup containing an antihistamine, or a placebo, which was essentially flavored water. Although children in all three groups experienced a reduction in coughing, those who received the flavored water fared the best.\n\nThe Risks: According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, honey may be useful in relieving coughing, but it should never be given to children under a year of age because in rare cases it can cause infantile botulism.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story makes it clear that the standard treatment for colds in kids was the subject of a 2007 ban by the FDA, and that the other standard remedy \u2013 honey \u2013 is a grocery store staple.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "(Reuters) - Bayer Healthcare said on Wednesday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved using transvaginal ultrasound as an alternate test to confirm if the company\u2019s Essure permanent birth control device has been placed properly.\n\nEssure is a small metal coil inserted into woman\u2019s fallopian tubes.

I was taken aback by their response. They basically laughed at the idea that the flu shot was particularly effective.\n\nThis posed a conundrum. It seemed like there were two groups saying very different things. But after reviewing the research, I think I understand what's going on here. It's true that flu vaccines don't work spectacularly well, at least according to the best evidence we have (and most of the evidence on flu vaccines is of poor methodological quality). But the downsides to getting a vaccine are extremely minimal, and flu shots may still be helpful in reducing some illness and saving lives, which is why public health experts say you should get vaccinated anyway.\n\nWhy the flu vaccine isn't always effective\n\nThe flu vaccine has been our main strategy for warding off seasonal flu for more than 60 years. Seasonal influenza, which surfaces as a respiratory illness, is caused by influenza A and B viruses. The flu shot is designed to protect people against three or four strains of the A and B viruses that researchers believe will be most common that year, leading to the nasty fevers, headaches, coughs, and runny noses that make many people miserable in the fall and winter.\n\nThe challenge, however, is that the flu virus is highly unstable, mutating all the time. So this means drug companies can't just make one kind of vaccine that'll last a lifetime. Every year, public health agencies essentially make educated guesses on what strains and mutations will make the rounds. And that's not easy. In February, the World Health Organization offers a prediction \u2014 based on surveillance and laboratory and clinical studies \u2014 and then each country uses that prediction to approve vaccines in its jurisdiction. (In the US, the Food and Drug Administration makes that final call.) The potential for error here can dramatically alter the effectiveness of the flu shot in a given season. If vaccine makers prepare for one combination of viruses and different ones end up circulating widely, the vaccine won't work that well.\n\nThis may help explain why the evidence on the effectiveness of flu shots is relatively mixed. The Cochrane Collaboration, an independent nonprofit that reviews the evidence on medical questions, has conducted two major meta-analyses (looking at the results of lots of individual studies) on whether the shot prevents flu in healthy children and adults.\n\nIn kids, the highest-quality evidence \u2014 a randomized controlled trial \u2014 suggests the vaccine works well enough: On average, if you give six kids under the age of 6 a flu shot, you can expect to prevent one case of the flu. For children under age 2, the benefits are less clear; the evidence, the researchers found, was scant, and of the research that was available, it seemed the efficacy of the shot was similar to placebo.\n\nIn adults, however, the vaccine's effects are more modest. \"Depending on the season,\" explained Tom Jefferson, an author on these Cochrane reviews, \"you need to vaccinate anywhere between 33 and 100 people to avoid one set of symptoms.\" In a good year, when the WHO guesses correctly and the flu shot matches the strains in circulation, you need to give 33 adults flu shots, on average, to prevent one case of illness. In a year when the WHO guesses badly, you need to vaccinate 100 people to prevent one flu case.\n\nJefferson pointed out that his Cochrane review on adults also found that flu vaccination rates have barely any effect on the number of sick days taken and no major impact on rates of hospitalization. So, yes, the flu vaccine can prevent illness, but it's hard to detect major effects on public health in the data.\n\nOn the other hand, the evidence suggests that there's no harm in getting a flu shot, either. The meta-analyses found no evidence of serious side effects beyond the odd case of soreness at the injection site.\n\nThat seems to be the same conclusion that other studies have drawn \u2014 the flu vaccine is modestly helpful, and doesn't hurt. In 2012 researchers analyzed 15 meta-analyses on the flu shot and concluded, \"Most influenza vaccines have been shown to confer some protection against naturally acquired infection and no evidence for major harms has emerged.\"\n\nOne key caveat here is that the evidence, overall, is pretty poor quality. Most of these analyses rely overwhelmingly on observational studies, where researchers observe and gather data on people who take the flu shot compared with those who don't. Because these aren't experiments \u2014 ideally we'd have randomized controlled trials \u2014 they're more prone to bias and therefore less reliable.\n\nIn the case of the elderly, the situation is particularly troublesome. As this Lancet study points out, because annual flu shots were recommended for the elderly since the 1960s, it has been unethical to conduct high-quality randomized controlled trials where you give only one group the shot in order to compare it with another group that didn't get the vaccine. So, as this Cochrane review notes, it's impossible to draw firm conclusions on the effectiveness of the flu vaccine for those over 65 because the data is so biased and poor.\n\nAgain, though, this doesn't mean we should throw away the vaccine. Stanford researcher John Ioannidis told me how he makes sense of this issue after reviewing the evidence: \"Overall the flu vaccine is effective, and it does save lives. I cannot put an exact figure to how many, but it may well be millions of lives. Generally it is safe and rather cheap, so even if the effectiveness is less than optimal sometimes, overall it is a good deal.\"\n\nWhy people still bother to get the shot\n\nDespite the limited evidence of effectiveness, there are still good reasons why public health experts recommend the shot.\n\nFor one, in those years when the WHO guesses correctly which strains will circulate, the shot tends to be a lot more helpful than some of these averages suggest. And the vaccine is overwhelmingly safe. There's also little by way of alternatives. Beyond public health measures (making sure you have good hand hygiene and avoiding the office when you're sick), the flu shot is the best medical intervention we have for preventing infection. So there's little downside with at least some potential benefit. I personally continue to get the flu shot for this reason.\n\nAs Roger Baxter, the co-director of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center, told me, \"Flu vaccines are not a panacea, and do not prevent all cases of flu, even in the best years, when there are no manufacturing problems and the match is perfect.\" He continued: \"However, the vaccines provide moderate protection, and can prevent huge numbers of cases of this serious illness. Many studies have shown that the vaccines are very safe, so the benefit-to-risk ratio is high and the cost is relatively low.\"\n\nWelcome to Dear Julia, a column where readers can submit everyday health questions.

She says the best way to prevent getting these cancers is to not smoke or drink alcohol, rather than drinking lots of coffee. \"We wouldn't want to be encouraging people to drink that much [coffee], without people considering the other risks factors,\" Hashibe says. \"Each person needs to think about how they metabolize caffeine or coffee.\"\n\nIn the past, there\u2019s been a perception that coffee may be bad for you, according to Dr. Donald Hensrud, chair of preventive medicine at the Mayo Clinic. But he says that newer studies suggest that drinking coffee may actually be good for you. \"Like many things, the evidence changes over time,\" says Hensrud. He adds that when it comes to the link between coffee and head and neck cancer, \"the benefits outweigh the risks and this is just one more piece of that puzzle that supports that.\"\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly known why coffee may help prevent these cancers. But coffee contains over 1,000 different chemical compounds, including cancer-fighting antioxidants, and it\u2019s those antioxidants that may provide a \u201cplausible explanation\u201d for reducing the cancer risk, says Hensrud.\n\nOther recent studies suggest coffee may have beneficial effects in other diseases like dementia, diabetes, liver and Parkinson's disease. However, coffee alone may not be the answer according to some experts. Dr. Dong Shin, a head and neck specialist at Emory Winship Cancer Institute says this new study suggests \u201cthere is a hint of beneficial outcomes\" with coffee and oral cancer.

But robotic surgeries took longer than non-robotic surgeries by about 40 minutes - 3 hours and 11 minutes compared to 2 hours and 29 minutes, on average. Longer surgeries often mean a more tired surgeon and more chances for things to go wrong.\n\nThe robot-surgeon team might not have outperformed the surgeon alone because the procedure was a relatively simple one.\n\nSurgical robots do not operate on their own. Rather, surgeons move electronic instruments that are linked to the movement of other instruments inside the body, while they watch a three-dimensional image of what\u2019s going on inside.

As rates of sugar-related disorders such as diabetes, obesity and heart disease climb, many experts believe that when Americans rid themselves of fat, they simply replaced it with sugar in all its forms.\n\nBut that the rise of the chronic diseases was actually linked to higher sugar consumption is a challenge. Dr. Robert Lustig, from the department of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco, who has made a name for himself publishing books and research addressing the question of sugar\u2019s effects on the body, wanted clearer answers. Now, in a paper published Tuesday, he and his colleagues believe they have come up with the definitive evidence that sugar, as Lustig says, \u201cis toxic.\u201d\n\nIn most lab studies, the doses of sugar that scientists test are quite high; they want to see what the effect is quickly and, depending on the research, they may not have time to wait to study the more gradual effects that might emerge. And in studies where people reduce the amount of sugar they eat, for instance, those people end up eating fewer calories overall, so it\u2019s difficult to know whether any changes are due to the removal of sugar or to the drop in calories.\n\nLustig and his colleagues think they\u2019ve produced the \u201chard and fast data that sugar is toxic irrespective of its calories and irrespective of weight.\u201d\n\nMORE: FDA Wants Nutrition Labels to Include More Detail on Added Sugars\n\nLustig\u2019s confidence comes from the unique study, described in , of 43 Hispanic or African-American children aged eight to 18 years old. He collected detailed food questionnaires from each of the adolescents to get an idea of the average amount of calories they ate per day, then designed a special menu for each of them for nine days that matched the total numbers of calories they would normally eat. The only difference in the nine-day diet was that most of the sugar the children ate was replaced by starch \u2014 the overall number of calories remained the same. The children weighed themselves daily, and if they were losing weight, they were told to eat more of the provided food in order to keep their weight the same throughout the study.\n\n\u201cEverything got better,\u201d says Lustig. Some of the children went from being insulin resistant, a precursor state to developing diabetes, in which the body\u2019s insulin levels can no longer keep up with the pace of breaking down sugar that\u2019s coming in from the diet, to insulin sensitive.\n\nMORE: Artificial Sweeteners Aren\u2019t the Answer to Obesity: Here\u2019s Why\n\n\u201cWe took chicken teriyaki out, and put turkey hot dogs in. We took sweetened yogurt out, and put baked potato chips in. We took pastries out and put bagels in,\u201d says Lustig. \u201cSo there was no change in [the children\u2019s] weight and no change in calories.\u201d\n\nAfter nine days of having their total dietary sugar reduced to 10% of their daily calories, however, they showed improvements in all of these measures. Overall, their fasting blood sugar levels dropped by 53%, along with the amount of insulin their bodies produced since insulin is normally needed to break down carbohydrates and sugars. Their triglyceride and LDL levels also declined and, most importantly, they showed less fat in their liver.\n\nMORE: 7 Amazing Things That Happen to Your Body When You Give Up Soda\n\nBecause some of the children lost weight, to convince themselves that the effects weren\u2019t due to the small amount of weight that some of the children lost, Lustig and his team compared those who lost weight to those who didn\u2019t during the study, and found similar improvements in both groups.\n\n\u201cUp until now, there have been a lot of correlation studies linking sugar and metabolic syndrome,\u201d says Lustig. \u201cThis is causation.\u201d\n\nThe diet he provided the children isn\u2019t considered ideal from a health perspective \u2014 starches are still a considerable source of calories and can contribute to weight gain. But Lustig relied on the starches to prove a point in a scientific study \u2014 that the effect sugar has on the body goes beyond anything connected to its calories and to weight. \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting in any way, shape or form that we gave them healthy food,\u201d he says. \u201cWe gave them crappy food, shitty food, processed food \u2014 and they still got better. Imagine how much even better they would have gotten if we didn\u2019t substitute and took the sugar out. Then they would have gotten even better yet. That\u2019s the point.\u201d\n\nMORE: The Trouble With Sugar Free Kids\n\nNot everyone is convinced that the results definitely prove sugar, and not weight loss, is the culprit, however. Susan Roberts, professor of Nutrition, USDA Nutrition Center at Tufts University notes that because some of the children lost weight, it\u2019s still possible that shedding the pounds helped their metabolic measures to improve. She also points out that the children self-reported their initial diet, which can often be inaccurate. \u201cWe know that a healthy diet and weight loss cause good metabolic changes, and although this study tries to attribute its effects to low fructose, in fact it is impossible to do that because of the study design.\u201d\n\nSome experts are concerned for other reasons. They\u2019re worried that the findings may shift attention away from what they consider to be the more fundamental issue \u2014 that overall, we\u2019re eating too much. \u201cToo much calorie intake is still the biggest problem,\u201d says Dr. Mark Corkins, professor of pediatrics at University of Tennessee Health Science Center and member of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on nutrition. He notes that the study involved children who were obese already and consuming too many calories. \u201cIt\u2019s an important study, and the facts coming out of it are very important. It means we need to look at sugars, and at the type of sugars and sugar intake. But I worry that people are going to hang everything on this when we still need to reduce consumption.\u201d\n\nLustig hopes that won\u2019t happen as more data emerges that details how sugar is altering the body in unhealthy ways outside of its caloric contribution. That wasn\u2019t the subject of the current paper, but he promises follow up studies based on this work that will address that. This study does hint however, at what might be happening. While there has been a lot of attention on the presence of belly fat and its connection to metabolic syndrome, the fact that the children saw improvements in the amount of fat in their liver suggests that might be an important way that sugar is contributing to chronic disease. Obese children and those with diabetes often suffer from fatty liver, a condition normally associated with alcohol abuse but increasingly common among non-drinkers who gain excessive amounts of weight.\n\nThis new view of sugar could change the advice that doctors and government health officials give about eating the sweet stuff.

The medication is not available yet, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is reviewing it for possible approval, the researchers said.\n\nIn the United States, about 10 percent of people say they have chronic insomnia, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are sleep aids on the market, but they do not work for everyone and they can have side effects that include sleepwalking, daytime drowsiness and confusion.\n\nSuvorexant works differently from those drugs, zeroing in on specific brain chemicals involved in the ability to sleep, explained study author Dr. William Herring, executive director of clinical research at Merck.\n\nThe study, published online Nov. 28 and in the Dec. 4 print issue of the journal Neurology, included 254 healthy adults with primary insomnia, which means it wasn't caused by an underlying physical or mental health problem.\n\nAll of the patients spent four weeks on one of four doses of suvorexant and another four weeks on placebo pills. They had their sleep monitored in a sleep lab on their first night with each treatment, and then came back again after four weeks.\n\nOverall, Herring's team found, people slept better with the drug, although the improvement was not dramatic.\n\nAt the outset, when patients spent eight hours in bed, they were typically asleep for 66 percent of that time. One day on suvorexant boosted that by anywhere from 5 percent to 13 percent, relative to the placebo. Between 21 and 37 fewer minutes were spent awake during those sleep periods.\n\nThere was still a benefit four weeks later. One expert pointed out, however, that the benefit was small.\n\n\"The amount of additional sleep was not tremendous,\" said Dr. Carl Bazil, director of the division of epilepsy and sleep at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center.\n\nThe effect was essentially comparable to what has been seen with other sleep medications, said Bazil, who was not involved in the research.\n\nBut, he said, suvorexant is seen as a potentially important development in the world of sleep medicine, because the drug blocks specific brain chemicals called orexins, which help keep people awake. Standard sleep medications work more widely throughout the brain, Bazil explained, which is why they can have a host of side effects.\n\n\"The way [suvorexant] works makes a lot of sense,\" Bazil said. \"The hope is that it will help some people who haven't responded to [other drugs], and have fewer side effects.\"\n\nIt's promising news, Bazil added, that there were no serious side effects in this study.\n\nThe most common side effects were sleepiness (reported by about 10 percent of patients on the two higher doses of suvorexant), headache (reported by about 5 percent), dizziness and abnormal dreams (5 percent).\n\nThere are still many questions, including whether the drug would benefit people with insomnia due to a health condition, which doctors call secondary insomnia.\n\nThe study also excluded adults aged 65 or older -- an age group commonly affected by insomnia. But, Herring said, seniors were part of a larger, 12-month trial, and Merck has submitted those results to the FDA.\n\nAnother sleep specialist said the findings show \"some potential benefit\" from suvorexant, but he cautioned insomnia sufferers against relying completely on any drug.\n\n\"Medication can be important,\" said Dr. William Kohler, who directs the Florida Sleep Institute in Spring Hill. \"But in the long run, the best methods for treating insomnia are behavioral techniques.\"\n\nKohler said cognitive behavioral therapy -- where people learn to change the thoughts and habits that affect their sleep quality -- is a proven way to manage insomnia. For most people, he said, medication should be a temporary treatment; behavior change is the long-term fix.\n\nBazil agreed: \"I look at most people with insomnia as someone who developed bad sleep habits.\"\n\nA drug, ideally used for a short time, may help encourage sleep and get people on the right track, Bazil said. \"But those bad sleep habits -- you've got to address them too,\" he added.\n\n\"The problem,\" Kohler noted, \"is that we don't want to make behavior changes. We want to pop a pill.\"\n\nLearn more about insomnia and good sleep habits from the National Sleep Foundation.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story explained that the drug is \u201cbeing developed\u201d and has been submitted to the FDA for approval.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Chemotherapy is administered to a cancer patient via intravenous drip in Durham, N.C.

Digital tomosynthesis (DBT), or 3D mammography, does slightly better, detecting approximately 25 percent more cancers, or roughly 5 cancers in 1,000 women screened. Based on the preliminary results at Penn Medicine, the cancer detection rate of AB-MR screening is 25 cancers per 1,000 patients. One in eight women in the United States will develop breast cancer at some point during their life.\n\n\"Having dense breast tissue makes it more difficult to detect a cancer on a mammogram,\" said the study's lead author, Susan Weinstein, MD, an associate professor of Radiology and the director of breast MRI at Penn Medicine. \"Based on the literature and our results, women with dense breast tissue who desire supplemental screening, these results suggest that AB-MR may be a better option than other supplemental screening tests such as whole breast ultrasound.\n\nThe most common exam offered for asymptomatic patients seeking supplemental screening is a whole breast screening ultrasound examination. However, screening ultrasound examinations have higher rates of false positives, meaning more cases of positive screenings where no cancer is present.\n\nBased on the results from Penn's study, the AB-MR may be a better option.

According to traditional medicine, specific acupuncture points on the skin are connected to internal pathways that conduct energy, or qi (\u201cchee\u201d), and stimulating these points with a fine needle promotes the healthy flow of qi.\n\nModern research has most often focused on the effects of acupuncture on painful conditions, like chronic back pain and migraines. Researchers speculate that it may help ease pain by altering signals among nerve cells or affecting the release of various chemicals of the central nervous system.\n\nIt is unclear, Manber said, why acupuncture might help lessen the severity of depression.\n\nFor their study, she and her colleagues randomly assigned 52 women to receive depression-specific acupuncture twice a week for four weeks, then weekly for another four weeks. Another 49 women received control acupuncture and 49 received massage. All completed a standard measure of depression severity at the outset and again after four and eight weeks of treatment.\n\nAfter eight weeks, patients in the depression-specific acupuncture group had a higher rate of response to treatment. They were not, however, more likely to see a complete remission in their depression; about 35 percent had a remission, versus 29.5 percent in the other two groups combined - a statistically insignificant difference.\n\nFourteen women who received depression-specific acupuncture reported pain during the needling, as did seven in the control-acupuncture group.\n\nOverall, Manber\u2019s team notes, the response to acupuncture in this study was comparable to what has been seen in studies of psychotherapy for depression during pregnancy.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story didn\u2019t address whether any acupuncture therapists are trained in the \"depression-specific\" acunpuncture methods that were used in one arm of this study.\u00a0 ", "answer": 0}, {"article": "GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN (Reuters) - A wearable device that stimulates the sense of balance with electric \u201cnoise\u201d could help Parkinson\u2019s disease patients, according to Swedish scientists.\n\nScientists from the University of Gothenburg\u2019s Sahlgrenska Academy have developed a portable pocket-sized vestibular, or balance, stimulation device in a bid to improve the lives of Parkinson\u2019s sufferers.\n\nThe research was led by Associate Professor Filip Bergquist, who said the simple device was similar to the TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) therapy which is used for pain relief, for example in child birth.\n\n\u201cSo this is really not a very complicated device. It is a current device which is very similar to the ones that people use for pain relief with electrical stimulation of muscles and nerves, what\u2019s called TENS. The difference is that we use a particular current profile which you can stimulate the balance organs with without creating a balance disturbance. So you do not get the impression that the world is moving or that you are moving, you actually do not feel anything,\u201d Bergquist explained.\n\nThe device operates by providing stimulation via patches attached to the patient\u2019s head behind the ears, where the vestibular system is located.\n\nParkinson\u2019s disease is characterized by reduced levels in the brain of the hormone dopamine, a neurotransmitter that allows different regions of the brain to communicate with one another. Symptoms of advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease include an impaired sense of balance, as well as tremors, poor mobility, slowness and stiffness.\n\nNearly all patients diagnosed with the disease are treated with levodopa, a drug that stimulates the production of dopamine in the brain. The effectiveness of oral levodopa reduces as Parkinson\u2019s disease progresses in the patient and can lead to involuntary movements, or dyskinesia.\n\nIn earlier experiments on rats, researchers at Sahlgrenska showed that noisy electric stimulation of the balance organs could be used to change the activity of the brain, thereby balancing the effects of dopamine shortage and improving the animals\u2019 motor skills and balance.\n\nThe researchers have also tested the method on ten Swedish Parkinson\u2019s patients, in both medicated and unmedicated states. According to Sahlgrenska, on one day the patients received an active noise stimulation and on another day inactive treatment, not knowing which day the current was active. According to the research institute, the experiments showed that the active noise stimulation improved both the patients\u2019 balance and the combined symptoms.\n\nParkinson\u2019s sufferer Staffan Lindblom said he did not expect any great advances, but would be thankful for anything that would make living with the disease easier.\n\n\u201cI have become hardened in the sense that I do not have too great expectations. But I still believe that something will be found at some point which could be useful. There is extensive research in this field and I hope that it eventually will come up with a result. Not a significant result but a few steps forward would really be appreciated,\u201d he said.\n\nUnfortunately this particular treatment did not work on Lindblom, with Bergquist suspecting there could also be other causes to Lindblom\u2019s balance problems.\n\nBergquist said he hoped the device could treat patients for whom the Levodopa drug, which turns into dopamine in the body and increases levels of the chemical, was not enough.\n\nHe also said they were working on the hypothesis that other diseases which affect the dopamine system, such as ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), could also benefit from this kind of treatment.\n\n\u201cWhat we are hoping for with this device is to find a treatment for movement disorders where Levodopa, Parkinson\u2019s disease where Levodopa is not enough. And in particular in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease where there is problem with gait and balance. But this may not be restricted to Parkinson\u2019s disease, so there may be other conditions with poor balance where you could use electrical stimulation of the vestibular organs, the balance organs to improve balance and gait,\u201d he said.\n\nThe plan is now for the device to be tested in a longer-term study, where patients will be using it at home.

The new stent is designed to gradually dissolve over three years.\n\nCurrently-available stents are permanent, mesh-wire tubes that hold open arteries after a procedure used to clear fatty plaque.\n\nExperts describe Abbott's device as an important step in finding a better approach to treating the leading cause of death in the U.S.\n\n\"This is presumably a better technology going forward, at least that's the theory, but it will take years to prove,\" said Dr. George Vetrovec, professor emeritus at Virginia Commonwealth University. Vetrovec was part of an FDA advisory panel of cardiologists who overwhelmingly endorsed the device in March.\n\nThe Absorb stent, already sold in Europe and Asia, is made of a degradable material that's designed to stay intact for one year then break down over the next two years.\n\nUse of metallic stents surged in the early 2000s as a treatment for people who suffered a heart attack or experienced chest pain caused by clogged arteries that restrict blood flow. They are still implanted in about 850,000 U.S. patients annually.\n\nBut doctors have scaled back their use due to safety concerns, insurance cost-cutting and evidence that they are overused. Studies in 2007 and 2008 suggested that stented arteries faced a higher risk of blood clots, potentially triggering heart attack a year or more down the road. Results of another five-year study showed that patients who received stents to treat chest pain fared about as well as those treated with drugs.\n\nAmid these concerns, Abbott and others began developing dissolving stents that would slowly melt away like stitches, presumably reducing complications.\n\nIn the company study submitted to the FDA, patients who got Absorb fared about as well as those receiving Abbott's older metal stent after one year. But heart-related complications were actually slightly higher with Absorb - 7.8 percent of patients, versus 6.1 percent of patients with the metal stent. That 1.7 percent difference is not considered statistically significant.\n\nOther complications with the new device include allergic reactions, infections and internal bleeding.\n\nDoctors who studied Absorb said it may take several years before its advantages become clear. Long-term safety results aren't expected until 2020.\n\n\"We have good theoretical reasons to believe that by getting rid of the stent, and allowing the coronary artery to restore its normal shape, that will prevent many of those late events,\" said Dr. Gregg Stone, of Columbia University Medical Center, who helped conduct the pivotal trial of Absorb. Stone was not paid by Abbott for his work on the trial.\n\nSome Wall Street analysts are betting that products like Absorb will allow companies to raise prices and boost revenue.\n\n\"The key for the stent market will be whether pricing returns to rational levels and the success of the new bio-absorbable stent platforms,\" states Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar, in an investment note. He says a \"perfect storm of events,\" including safety concerns and the economic downturn led Abbott and competitors Medtronic Inc. and Boston Scientific Corp. to slash prices in recent years.\n\nStent sales fell roughly 30 percent to $4.1 billion in 2014 from 2006 levels, according to Evercore.\n\nAbbott said it does not disclose the price of its stents. Hospitals often bill $30,000 for stenting procedures, which includes the costs of the stent, medical staff and other equipment and services.\n\nChicago-based Abbott controls a little more than a third of the U.S. stent market.

The research was only meant to show that, so far, it seems feasible and safe.\n\nThe concept was based on the astonishing case of an AIDS patient who seems to be cured after getting blood cells from a donor with natural immunity to HIV nearly four years ago in Berlin. Researchers are seeking a more practical way to achieve similar immunity using patients' own blood cells.\n\nThe results announced Monday at a conference in Boston left experts cautiously excited.\n\n\"For the first time, people are beginning to think about a cure\" as a real possibility, said Dr. John Zaia, head of the government panel that oversees gene therapy experiments. Even if the new approach doesn't get rid of HIV completely, it may repair patients' immune systems enough that they can control the virus and not need AIDS medicines - \"what is called a functional cure,\" he said.\n\nCarl Dieffenbach, AIDS chief at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, agreed.\n\n\"We're hopeful that this is sufficient to give the level of immune reconstitution similar to what was seen with the patient from Germany,\" he said.\n\nThis is the first time researchers have permanently deleted a human gene and infused the altered cells back into patients. Other gene therapy attempts tried to add a gene or muffle the activity of one, and have not worked against HIV.\n\nThe virus can damage the immune system for years before people develop symptoms and are said to have AIDS - acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The virus targets special immune system soldiers called T-cells. It usually enters these cells through a protein receptor, or \"docking station,\" called CCR5.\n\nSome people (about 1 percent of whites; fewer of minorities) lack both copies of the CCR5 gene and are naturally resistant to HIV. One such person donated blood stem cells in 2007 to an American man living in Berlin who had leukemia and HIV.\n\nThe cell transplant appears to have cured both problems, but finding such donors for everyone with HIV is impossible, and transplants are medically risky.\n\nSo scientists wondered: Could a patient's own cells be used to knock out the CCR5 gene and create resistance to HIV?\n\nA California biotechnology company, Sangamo (SANG-uh-moh) BioSciences Inc., makes a treatment that can cut DNA at precise locations and permanently \"edit out\" a gene.\n\nDr. Jacob Lalezari, director of Quest Clinical Research of San Francisco, led the first test of this with the company and colleagues at the University of California in San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nHe warned that it would be \"way overstated\" to suggest that the results so far are a possible cure.\n\n\"It's an overreach of the data. There are a lot of people out there with hopes and dreams around the C-word,\" so caution is needed.\n\nIn the study, six men with HIV had their blood filtered to remove a small percentage of their T-cells. The gene-snipping compound was added in the lab, and about one-fourth of the cells were successfully modified. The cells were mixed with growth factors to make them multiply and then infused back into the patients.\n\nThree men received about 2.5 billion modified cells. Three others received about 5 billion.\n\nThree months later, five men had three times the number of modified cells expected. As much as 6 percent of their total T-cells appear to be the new type - resistant to HIV, Lalezari said.\n\nThe sixth man also had modified cells, but fewer than expected. In all six patients, the anti-HIV cells were thriving nearly a year after infusion, even in tissues that can hide HIV when it can't be detected in blood.\n\n\"The cells are engrafting - they're staying in the bloodstream, they're expanding over time,\" said Lalezari, who has no personal financial ties to Sangamo, the study's sponsor.\n\nThe only side effect was two days of flulike symptoms. It will take longer to determine safety, but several AIDS experts said they were encouraged so far.\n\n\"It is a huge step\" and a first for the field of genetics, said John Rossi, a researcher at City of Hope in Duarte, Calif., where he and Zaia plan another study to test Sangamo's approach. \"The idea is if you take away cells the virus can infect, you can cure the disease.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Dr. Carl June, a gene therapy expert at the University of Pennsylvania, will report partial results from a second, federally funded study of 10 people testing Sangamo's product. He treated his first patient with it in July 2009.\n\n- People born without the CCR5 gene are generally healthy, but will deleting it have unforeseen consequences?\n\n- Will HIV find another way into cells? Certain types of the virus can use a second protein receptor, though this is less common and usually when AIDS is advanced. Sangamo is testing a similar approach aimed at that protein, too.\n\n- How long will the modified cells last? Will more be needed every few years?\n\n- Could doctors just infuse Sangamo's product rather than removing cells and modifying them in the lab?\n\n- What might this cost?\n\nSangamo spokeswoman Liz Wolffe said it's too early in testing to guess, but it would be \"a premier-priced\" therapy - in the neighborhood of Dendreon Corp.'s new prostate cancer immune therapy, Provenge - $93,000.\n\nYet AIDS drugs can cost $25,000 a year, so this could still be cost-effective, especially if it's a cure.\n\nJay Johnson, 50, who works for Action AIDS, an advocacy and service organization in Philadelphia, had the treatment there in September.\n\n\"My results are excellent,\" he said. \"The overall goal is to not have to take medication, and then hopefully lead maybe to a cure.\"\n\nMatt Sharp, 54, of suburban San Francisco, also had the treatment in September.\n\n\"I would trade anything to not have to take a handful of medications every day for the rest of my life and suffer all the consequences and side effects,\" he said.\n\n\"I may not live long enough to see the cure, but I always hoped for a chance.\"", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story\u00a0 made it clear that this was a very preliminary report.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "SCOTTSDALE, Arizona - A migraine is much more than just a bad headache.

The data was presented at the American Surgical Association annual meeting in San Diego. Locally advanced pancreatic cancer is Stage III cancer that has not yet spread.\n\nPancreatic cancer has one of the highest mortality rates of all cancers and is expected to climb from the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the U.S. to the second by 2020. Ninety four percent of pancreatic cancer patients will die within five years of diagnosis, and 74% of patients die within the first year of diagnosis.\n\n\"The STAR data adds to the growing body of evidence that IRE ablation may represent a new treatment paradigm for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer,\" said Robert Martin, M.D., Ph.D., F.A.C.S., director of the Division of Surgical Oncology, and Professor, Department of Surgery, University of Louisville, James Graham Brown Cancer Center. \"This new analysis of IRE could help change the standard of care for Stage III pancreatic cancer patients whose only treatment options until now were chemotherapy or a combination of chemo-radiation therapy, which will only stabilize the disease and not destroy the tumor. With IRE, these patients now have a surgical treatment option to augment their treatment plan.\"\n\nThe NanoKnife\u00ae IRE system is a tool that destroys cancerous cells by subjecting them to a series of short electrical pulses using high-voltage direct current that does not injure surrounding cells, blood vessels and other vital structures. IRE overcomes rapid growth of the tumor by killing all malignant cells at once so they cannot continue to grow and spread. The NanoKnife\u00ae IRE system is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the surgical ablation of soft tissue. It is not approved for use in specific cancers.\n\nSTAR was a retrospective analysis of IRE performed on 200 consecutive patients diagnosed with locally advanced (Stage III) pancreatic cancer (LAPC) at six centers in the U.S. The centers that collaborated on the study included University of Louisville, Louisville, KY; Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI; Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH; Piedmont Hospital, Atlanta, GA; Swedish Medical Center, Denver, CO; and Cancer Treatment Centers of America, Atlanta, GA.\n\nFrom July 2010 to October 2014, patients with radiographic Stage III LAPC were treated with IRE and monitored under a multicenter, prospective IRB-approved registry.

All patients underwent induction chemotherapy with 52 percent receiving chemo-radiation, for a median of 7 months (range, 5-13) prior to IRE. IRE was successfully administered to all patients. Nineteen percent sustained complications with a median grade of 2 (range 1-3). Median length of stay was 6 days (range, 4-58) with a median follow-up of 25 months.

Dr. Vigneswaran is division director of thoracic surgery and a professor in the department of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery of Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine.\n\nMalignant pleural mesothelioma is caused by environmental factors such as exposure to asbestos as well as a genetic predisposition to the cancer. It develops in the pleura, the thin layer of tissue surrounding the lungs. As the tumor grows, it restricts the lungs, typically causing shortness of breath, fatigue, weight loss and/or chest discomfort and pain. In PD surgery, the pleura is removed. While the procedure cannot cure mesothelioma, it can help control the buildup of fluid, improve breathing and lessen cancer pain. Dr. Vigneswaran and colleagues administered a cancer quality-of-life survey known as the EORTC QLQ-C30 to 114 mesothelioma patients who underwent PD surgery. The median age was 70, with a range of 50 to 88. Prior to surgery, 31 percent of the patients had a performance status score of 0 (fully functional); 65 percent had a performance status score of 1 (able to do light house work or office work); and 4 percent had a performance status of 2 (ambulatory and capable of self-care, but unable to work).

Two phase III clinical trials show that a drug that restores the body's natural production of testosterone has no negative effect on a man's sperm count while a topical testosterone gel causes a significant drop. The findings, which are published in BJU International, could change the way men are treated for low testosterone.\n\nWhile testosterone replacement therapy can boost men's energy levels, sex drive, and mood, the treatment can fool the body into thinking that it is producing enough testosterone, so that it in turn starts making less of its own. This can result in a significant decrease in sperm count--leading to infertility--because the body needs its own testosterone to produce sperm.\n\nAn alternative approach to testosterone replacement is based on restoring the body's natural production of testosterone with drugs similar to those used to help women ovulate. Edward Kim, MD, urologist at the University of Tennessee Medical Center and Professor at the University of Tennessee Graduate School of Medicine in Knoxville, and his colleagues compared such a drug, called Enclomiphene citrate, with testosterone replacement therapy (Androgel) in overweight men with low testosterone, or hypogonadism. In the randomized studies, 44 men started on 12.5 mg of oral enclomiphene citrate daily, with 25 men being up-titrated to 25 mg; 42 men received a topical 1.62 percent AndroGel; and 41 men received a placebo. Over five months, patients had 10 clinic visits with one overnight stay.\n\nThe investigators found that Enclomiphene citrate restored blood testosterone levels to normal after 16 weeks while maintaining sperm concentrations, whereas Androgel restored blood testosterone levels but caused marked reductions in sperm concentrations by suppressing the function of the testes.\n\n\"One of the basic tenets in medicine is to do no harm. As this study has shown in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled manner, exogenous testosterone therapy with Androgel can clearly decrease sperm production and potentially impact fertility,\" said Dr. Kim. \"This study confirmed that Enclomiphene can maintain spermatogenesis while restoring testosterone levels to normal.\"\n\nFull citation: \"Oral Enclomiphene Citrate Raises Testosterone and Preserves Sperm Counts in Obese Hypogonadal Men, Unlike Topical Testosterone: Restoration Instead of Replacement.\" Edward D.

Sadler from Warwick's Department of Chemistry, researchers have developed a new line of attack against cancer: an organic-osmium compound, which is triggered using a non-toxic dose of sodium formate, a natural product found in many organisms, including nettles and ants.\n\nNamed JPC11, it targets a metabolic process which cancer cells rely on to survive and multiply. It does this by converting a key substance used by cancer cells to provide the energy they need for rapid division (pyruvate) into an unnatural lactate - leading to the cells' destruction.\n\nUniquely, this chemo-catalyst treatment can be recycled and reused within a cancer cell to attack it repeatedly.\n\nThis unprecedented functional ability to recycle and reuse the compound within cancer cells could lead to future anticancer drugs being administered in smaller, more effective, and potentially less toxic doses - decreasing the side-effects of chemotherapy.\n\nThe researchers have been focusing on the potential to use this compound on ovarian and prostate cancers.\n\nOvarian cancers are becoming increasingly resistant to existing chemotherapy drugs (such as the platinum drug, cisplatin). Since this new research functions in a totally new and unique way, it may overcome this acquired resistance and widen the spectrum of anticancer activity.\n\nImportantly, the development opens up a possibility for a more selective cancer treatment as JPC11 was observed to specifically target the biochemistry of cancer cells, leaving healthy cells largely untouched - another improvement compared to existing platinum-based drugs, which can also attack non-cancerous cells.\n\n\"This is a significant step in the fight against cancer. Manipulating and applying well-established chemistry in a biological context provides a highly selective strategy for killing cancer cells.\n\n\"We have discovered that chemo-catalyst JPC11 has a unique mechanism of action - and we hope that this will lead to more effective, selective and safer treatments in the future.\"\n\nProfessor Peter Sadler, a medicinal chemist at the University of Warwick commented:\n\n\"Platinum compounds are the most widely used drugs for cancer chemotherapy, but we urgently need to respond to the challenges of circumventing resistance and side-effects. Our lab is focussed on the discovery of truly novel anticancer drugs which can kill cells in totally new ways. Chemo-catalysts, especially those with immunogenic properties, might provide a breakthrough.\n\n\"It will take time to progress from the lab to the clinic, but we are fortunate to have a talented enthusiastic, international team working with colleagues in Warwick Cancer Research Centre across the borderlines of chemistry, cell and systems biology and cancer medicine who are determined to succeed.\"\n\nProfessor Martin Wills, catalyst specialist at the University of Warwick, commented:\n\n\"Although asymmetric catalytic hydrogenation processes are well developed in the materials industry, this research provides the first ever example of it being achieved inside cells using a synthetic catalyst.\"\n\nHandedness (molecular asymmetry) is critical to the function of bio-molecules in the body. Proteins, enzymes and our DNA, for example - are handed. Only the correct hand works, in the same way that a right hand does not fit a left-hand glove.\n\nIn this case, the osmium compound JPC11, with sodium formate, can selectively produce a molecule of a specific 'handedness' - thus manipulating how cancer cells grow.\n\n\"The 'handedness' of molecules is critical in the body. Our hands are near-identical, but are mirror images of each other. The same can be true of molecules, and in some cases, having the wrong handed molecule can have profound biological consequences.\n\n\"We believe that manipulation of the 'handedness' of molecules in cells could provide a new strategy for fighting diseases.\"\n\nThe research, 'Asymmetric transfer hydrogenation by synthetic catalysts in cancer cells', is published in Nature Chemistry.

The most commonly recommended sideline test is the Standardized Assessment of Concussion, a multipart examination during which athletes are asked to name the date, describe how they feel, memorize and recall lists of words, and do jumping jacks and other tests of coordination. Ideally, this assessment should be administered and evaluated by a medical professional.\n\nBut while the sidelines of college and professional games are crowded with doctors and certified athletic trainers, few high schools and youth leagues have those resources. Most of the time, concussion testing in youth sports falls to volunteer coaches or parents with little if any medical experience.\n\nThat situation prompted researchers at New York University\u2019s Langone Concussion Center to begin wondering recently whether there might be other, easier diagnostic tools to check young players for concussions.\n\nTheir thoughts soon turned to vision.\n\n\u201cAbout 50 percent of the brain\u2019s pathways are tied in some to way to vision and visual processing,\u201d said Dr. Steven Galetta, chairman of neurology at N.Y.U. Langone Medical Center and senior author of the study, which was published in The Journal of Neuro-Ophthalmology.\n\nEye tests can tell evaluators a great deal about how well someone\u2019s brain is working.\n\nBut for the most part, visual tests have not been part of the standard protocol for sideline concussion testing of young athletes.\n\nHowever, the N.Y.U. researchers knew that in recent years, trainers working with athletes in sports such as boxing and mixed martial arts, where concussions are common, had begun supplementing the Standardized Assessment with a simple vision exam, known as the King-Devick test, during which someone reads slightly jumbled lines of numbers printed on three cards as quickly as possible. (See below for more information.) The King-Devick test measures rapid eye movement, visual tracking and related cognitive responses and is a reliable indicator of cognitive problems. If an injured adult reads the numbers more slowly after a head impact than in baseline testing, he or she is considered to have sustained a concussion.\n\nBut it had not been evaluated for use in young athletes. So the N.Y.U. researchers decided to test it.\n\nThey recruited 243 young hockey and lacrosse players between the ages of 5 and 18, and 89 collegians from the same sports.\n\nThese athletes all completed a baseline Standardized Assessment of Concussion exam during preseason and walked as fast as possible along a narrow 10-foot long strip of athletic tape to measure their balance. They also completed the King-Devick test.\n\nThen they went out to play.\n\nDuring their subsequent competitive seasons, 12 athletes hit their heads and were put through the full battery of sideline concussion tests by parents or coaches, under the supervision of N.Y.U. medical personnel. Fourteen age-matched uninjured athletes in the same sports completed the same tests, to serve as controls.\n\nNeurologists later confirmed that the 12 injured athletes had sustained concussions.\n\nThen the N.Y.U. researchers compared how well the various sidelines tests had done at pinpointing the brain injury.\n\nThe Standardized Assessment of Concussion had performed rather miserably, correctly identifying only two of the concussed athletes, missing 10, and finding that three of the uninjured control athletes had supposedly sustained a concussion, since their scores had declined compared with their baseline (almost certainly, the study\u2019s authors believe, because these young athletes were physically tired).\n\nThe King-Devick test did much better, correctly assessing concussion in 75 percent of the young injured players and inaccurately identifying it in only one.\n\nThe pace-along-the-tape test was also relatively accurate. Ten of the 12 injured athletes were slower now, but so were five of the unhurt players.\n\nOverall, the King-Devick test had by far the greatest accuracy and lowest risk of false positives.\n\nThe upshot, Dr. Galetta believes, is that parents and coaches \u201cshould absolutely consider\u201d familiarizing themselves with the King-Devick test and administering it to young athletes before the season starts, then having those baseline numbers and the test itself handy on the sidelines.\n\nIf an athlete hits his or her head and is then slower than baseline by even a fraction of a second at reading off the numbers, Dr. Galetta said, it is very probable he or she has a concussion and needs to be taken from play and seen by a doctor.\n\nIt is still too early to say, however, whether the King-Devick test can replace other, more conventional concussion evaluations for young athletes, including the standardized assessment, despite its shortcomings in this study, Dr. Galetta cautioned. For now, he says, it probably should be used in conjunction with other tests.\n\nHow to Administer the King-Devick Concussion Test\n\nDuring preseason, use a stopwatch to time the athlete as he or she reads off the numbers on each line from left to right as quickly as possible. The cards should be read in order. This establishes a baseline time. For the greatest precision, you might want to have athletes perform the test twice and use their best reading.\n\nDuring the season, if an athlete is suspected of sustaining a concussion, have him or her repeat the test on the sidelines. If the time is slower, even by a small amount, he or she probably has a concussion, according to neurologists.\n\nInterestingly, uninjured athletes are almost always faster at reading the numbers during games or practices, because physical exertion sharpens the kind of visual performance being tested.\n\n\n\n For more fitness, food and wellness news, \u201clike\u201d our Facebook page.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story does not explicitly state that one can purchase this test, but the implication is that it is available.

Fenfluramine was taken off the market in 1997 after being linked to potentially life-threatening heart valve problems. But lorcaserin is far more selective than the drug fenfluramine and much safer, its manufacturer says, because it specifically targets the serotonin receptor associated with hunger while having no impact on the heart.\n\nAbout half the dieters who took lorcaserin for a year in the study lost at least 5% of their body weight, compared to 20% of dieters who took a placebo pill. About one in five lorcaserin users lost 10% or more of their body weight, compared to one out of 14 placebo users.

It significantly raises the risk of stroke.\n\nPatients in the Medtronic-sponsored trial who underwent the cryoablation procedure \u2014 which involves using a catheter to freeze away the heart tissue where the problem originates \u2014 was just as safe as drugs used to treat the condition and far more effective, meeting the study\u2019s primary goal of eliminating atrial fibrillation one year after the procedure.\n\nDubbed Stop-af, the Medtronic trial showed that almost 70 percent of patients who had cryoablation remained free of the condition after one year, compared with just 7 percent of patients who received drug therapy, according to data presented at the American College of Cardiology meeting in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cThis is the best data we have at this point in support of cryoablation (to treat atrial fibrillation),\u201d said Dr. Douglas Packer of Mayo Clinic, the lead investigator of the study.\n\nOver 3 percent of patients treated by cryoablation experienced a serious condition \u2014 a narrowing of the pulmonary vein in 7 out of 228 patients, one of whom required another procedure to widen the vein.\n\nDamage or irritation to the nerve that controls the diaphragm was reported in 11 percent of the cryoablation procedures, but none of the cases was considered serious, with 98 percent resolved by the 12-month follow-up.\n\nComplications related to the atrial fibrillation itself were also monitored. During the follow-up period, 97 percent of patients who got the procedure and 92 percent of the drug therapy patients did not suffer heart attack, stroke or death.\n\nLess than 1 percent of patients treated with cryoablation were hospitalized for a recurrence of the disease, compared with 6 percent in the drug group.\n\nPatients in the pilot study had advanced atrial fibrillation and tended to have other medical problems, such as high blood pressure, diabetes or coronary artery disease,\n\nPacker, who also led the pilot study, dubbed Cabana, acknowledged that the main limitation of this study was its small size, but said it lays the foundation for a larger one.\n\nHe said the larger study, which will include 180 centers, is currently enrolling patients.\n\nAnti-arrhythmic drugs eliminate atrial fibrillation in about half of all patients but can have adverse side effects.\n\nCryoablation is an alternative that is growing in popularity. Over the past decade, more patients have been referred for ablation procedures when drugs proved ineffective.\n\nCatheter ablation involves inserting a thin tube into a blood vessel, usually through a site in the upper leg or neck, and then threading it though the body until it reaches the heart. When it reaches the area of the heart that causes abnormal rhythms, the tissue is ablated, or destroyed.\n\nThe procedure has been used to treat arrhythmias for years.

The paid for the study.\n\nDoctors and patients alike find it easy to accept more cancer treatment on the basis of a study, Dr. Morrow said, but get scared when the data favor less treatment.\n\nThe new findings are part of a trend to move away from radical surgery for breast cancer. Rates of , removal of the whole breast, began declining in the 1980s after studies found that for many patients, survival rates after and radiation were just as good as those after mastectomy.\n\nThe trend reflects an evolving understanding of breast cancer. In decades past, there was a belief that surgery could \u201cget it all\u201d \u2014 eradicate the cancer before it could spread to organs and bones. But research has found that breast cancer can begin to spread early, even when are small, leaving microscopic traces of the disease after surgery.\n\nThe modern approach is to cut out obvious tumors \u2014 because lumps big enough to detect may be too dense for drugs and radiation to destroy \u2014 and to use radiation and chemotherapy to wipe out microscopic disease in other places.\n\nBut doctors have continued to think that even microscopic disease in the lymph nodes should be cut out to improve the odds of survival. And until recently, they counted cancerous lymph nodes to gauge the severity of the disease and choose chemotherapy. But now the number is not so often used to determine drug treatment, doctors say. What matters more is whether the disease has reached any nodes at all. If any are positive, the disease could become deadly. Chemotherapy is recommended, and the drugs are the same, no matter how many nodes are involved.\n\nThe new results do not apply to all patients, only to women whose disease and treatment meet the criteria in the study.\n\nThe tumors were early, at clinical stage T1 or T2, meaning less than two inches across. Biopsies of one or two armpit nodes had found cancer, but the nodes were not enlarged enough to be felt during an exam, and the cancer had not spread anywhere else. The women had lumpectomies, and most also had radiation to the entire breast, and chemotherapy or hormone-blocking drugs, or both.\n\nThe study, at 115 medical centers, included 891 patients. Their median age was in the mid-50s, and they were followed for a median of 6.3 years.\n\nAfter the initial node , the women were assigned at random to have 10 or more additional nodes removed, or to leave the nodes alone. In 27 percent of the women who had additional nodes removed, those nodes were cancerous. But over time, the two groups had no difference in survival: more than 90 percent survived at least five years. Recurrence rates in the armpit were also similar, less than 1 percent. If breast cancer is going to recur under the arm, it tends to do so early, so the follow-up period was long enough, the researchers said.\n\nOne potential weakness in the study is that there was not complete follow-up information on 166 women, about equal numbers from each group. The researchers said that did not affect the results. A statistician who was not part of the study said the missing information should have been discussed further, but probably did not have an important impact.\n\nIt is not known whether the findings also apply to women who do not have radiation and chemotherapy, or to those who have only part of the breast irradiated. Nor is it known whether the findings could be applied to other types of cancer.\n\nThe results mean that women like those in the study will still have to have at least one removed, to look for cancer and decide whether they will need more treatment. But taking out just one or a few nodes should be enough.\n\nDr. Armando E. Giuliano, the lead author of the study and the chief of surgical oncology at the Cancer Institute at St. John\u2019s Health Center in , Calif., said: \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t come as a big surprise, but it will. It\u2019s hard for us as surgeons and medical oncologists and radiation oncologists to accept that you don\u2019t have to remove the nodes in the armpit.\u201d\n\nDr. Grant W. Carlson, a professor of surgery at the Winship Cancer Institute at , and the author of an editorial accompanying the study, said that by routinely taking out many nodes, \u201cI have a feeling we\u2019ve been doing a lot of harm.\u201d\n\nIndeed, women in the study who had the nodes taken out were far more likely (70 percent versus 25 percent) to have complications like infections, abnormal sensations and fluid collecting in the armpit. They were also more likely to have lymphedema.\n\nBut Dr. Carlson said that some of his colleagues, even after hearing the new study results, still thought the nodes should be removed.\n\n\u201cThe dogma is strong,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little frustrating.\u201d\n\nEventually, he said, genetic testing of breast tumors might be enough to determine the need for treatment, and eliminate the need for many node biopsies.\n\nTwo other breast surgeons not involved with the study said they would take it seriously.\n\nDr. Elisa R. Port, the chief of breast surgery at in Manhattan, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal in the world of breast cancer. It\u2019s definitely practice-changing.\u201d\n\nDr. Alison Estabrook, the chief of the comprehensive breast center at St. Luke\u2019s-Roosevelt hospital in New York said surgeons had long been awaiting the results.\n\n\u201cIn the past, surgeons thought our role was to get out all the cancer,\u201d Dr. Estabrook said. \u201cNow he\u2019s saying we don\u2019t really have to do that.\u201d\n\nBut both Dr. Estabrook and Dr. Port said they would still have to make judgment calls during surgery and remove lymph nodes that looked or felt suspicious.\n\nThe new research grew out of efforts in the 1990s to minimize lymph node surgery in the armpit, called axillary dissection. Surgeons developed a technique called sentinel node biopsy, in which they injected a dye into the breast and then removed just one or a few nodes that the dye reached first, on the theory that if the was spreading, cancer cells would show up in those nodes. If there was no cancer, no more nodes were taken. But if there were cancer cells, the surgeon would cut out more nodes.\n\nAlthough the technique spared many women, many others with positive nodes still had extensive cutting in the armpit, and suffered from side effects.\n\n\u201cWomen really dread the axillary dissection,\u201d Dr. Giuliano said. \u201cThey fear lymphedema. There\u2019s numbness, , and some have limitation of motion. There are a fair number of serious complications. Women know it.\u201d\n\nAfter armpit surgery, 20 percent to 30 percent of women develop lymphedema, Dr. Port said, and radiation may increase the rate to 40 percent to 50 percent. Physical therapy can help, but there is no cure.\n\nThe complications \u2014 and the fact that there was no proof that removing the nodes prolonged survival \u2014 inspired Dr. Giuliano to compare women with and without axillary dissection. Some doctors objected. They were so sure cancerous nodes had to come out that they said the study was unethical and would endanger women.\n\n\u201cSome prominent institutions wouldn\u2019t even take part in it,\u201d Dr. Giuliano said, though he declined to name them. \u201cThey\u2019re very supportive now.

Keeping skin healthy in the bright light of day is hard work. The devotion to hats and rash guards, the careful selection of sunscreen and thorough application and reapplication every 90 minutes is at best tedious, and when children are involved, the process can be truly demoralizing. But once the towels are hung on the line, in the soft light of dusk, your work is done. Right?\n\nA new school of thought in the beauty world is pushing the idea that what you put on your skin after a day at the beach could play a part in reducing sun damage. One proponent of the concept is Hillary Peterson, founder of Bay Area-based company True Nature Botanicals. Ms. Peterson, a former marketing executive, began to explore the use of all-natural products several years ago after surviving melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer.\n\nHer take on sun exposure is refreshingly pragmatic. \u201cThe message with\u2026protection has been to stay out of [the sun],\u201d said Ms. Peterson. \u201cBut I\u2019m on the phone with you from Hawaii and can see at least 40 people on the beach, soaking in the rays. My kids are outside playing. I know that it\u2019s not realistic to say \u2018no sun.\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe is, however, quite knowledgeable about how to be safe when you\u2019re in the sun. (She\u2019s also called on Terrence Collins, the Teresa Heinz Professor of Green Chemistry at Carnegie Mellon University as a consultant to formulate her line.) Ms. Peterson has long been aware of the role that antioxidants play in protecting skin from UV damage. (A groundbreaking study in 1996 proved antioxidants like vitamins C and E can boost the efficacy of sunscreen and make skin more resistant to damage.) She even brews antioxidant-rich green tea, lets it cool and puts it in a spray bottle. \u201cI spritz my kids with it before I apply sunscreen and again after they come out of the sun,\u201d she said.\n\nNow, a new study by Yale University cancer researchers, published this year, shows that the cell-damaging effects of ultra-violet rays may continue for some time after you seek cover. Ergo, it may be necessary to draw out the day\u2019s protective ministrations into nighttime.\n\nThis information is in the early stages of transforming the category of after-sun care\u2014a category traditionally limited to aloe vera-laden moisturizers and gels that lowered the temperature of sun-parched skin but not much else. Product formulators are now seeing after-sun care as another line of defense to stop cell mutations and aging in its tracks.\n\nMs. Peterson recommends her Pacific Mist spray which contains antioxidant-rich green tea and white tea extracts as well as sea fennel extract, which aids in hydration, and the line\u2019s Pacific Face Oil which contains a mix of oils from chia seed, kiwi, passion fruit and papaya seed\u2014all rich in essential fatty acids and antioxidants.\n\nWhen shopping for other after-sun treatments, be aware that some labels only add a trace, ineffective amount of a beneficial ingredient to a product in order to tout its effects on the label, while others have a bona fide antioxidant slant.\n\nOne Love Organics, a 6-year-old company founded by ex-lawyer Suzanne LeRoux, is a fine example of the latter. Based in St. Simons Island, Ga., the brand has an Eco-Cert-certified lab that creates mostly organic, botanical-based face and body treatments developed with sun exposure in mind. Ms. LeRoux typically recommends layering the brand\u2019s Vitamin C Body Oil or the Gardenia + Tea Antioxidant Body Serum under sunscreen during the day. Rich with botanical oils and green tea extract, both are also ideal after-sun products. \u201cOur lab is on an island in the South. We think about sun exposure a lot,\u201d she added.\n\nAfter-sun care converts should also look for products dispensed in a pump or spray which keeps contents from oxidizing when exposed to air, like Blissoma\u2019s pomegranate extract-filled Amend Antioxidant Sprayable Lotion. Avoid products formulated with alcohol, which can dry skin out.\n\nNot everyone is convinced of the effectiveness of after-sun care. Beverly Hills-based dermatologist Rhonda Rand believes most products can only lower skin temperature and add moisture. \u201cThat can make sun-exposed skin feel better,\u201d she said, \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing you can do to reverse sun exposure.\u201d And while Henry Lim, president of the American Academy of Dermatology, believes that the Yale study was important, he cautions that you only have a three-hour window after sun exposure to take advantage of any potential product benefits\u2014and that antioxidants \u201care notoriously not very stable and must be formulated carefully in order to be effective.\u201d\n\nBut believers like True Nature Botanicals\u2019 Ms. Peterson are undeterred. \u201cIn medicine, you need a definitive study,\u201d she countered. \u201cWe can\u2019t get doctors to say if you eat a healthier diet, your body will function better. But [by] bringing Omega-3 and -6 and antioxidants to the skin, we\u2019re giving it more of the tools it needs to handle sun exposure.\u201d", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "It is clear that the products mentioned in the story are currently available.

Higher soy intake was also associated with less reported fatigue. The breast cancer survivors studied included 173 non-Hispanic white and 192 Chinese Americans including US-born Chinese and Chinese immigrants.\n\nResearchers say breast cancer survivors often experience side effects from cancer treatments that can persist months or years after completion of treatment. For example, because many treatments designed to prevent breast cancer recurrence inhibit the body's production or use of estrogen, the hormone that can fuel breast cancer growth, breast cancer patients often experience hot flashes and night sweats, among other side effects.\n\nThe lead author on the study, Sarah Oppeneer Nomura, PhD, of Georgetown Lombardi, said that while further research is needed in larger study populations and with more detailed dietary data, this project addresses an important gap in research on the possible role of lifestyle factors, such as dietary habits, in relation to side effects of treatments.\n\n\"These symptoms can adversely impact survivors' quality of life and can lead them to stopping ongoing treatments, she says. \"Understanding the role of life style factors is important because diet can serve as a modifiable target for possibly reducing symptoms among breast cancer survivors.\"\n\nWhen study participants were evaluated separately by race/ethnicity, associations were significant among white breast cancer survivors; however; while a trend was seen in the benefit for Chinese women, results were not statically significant. Researchers explain Chinese women typically report fewer menopausal symptoms. Most of them also consume cruciferous vegetables and soy foods, making it difficult to see a significant effect in this subgroup. Indeed, in this study, Chinese breast cancer survivors ate more than twice as much soy and cruciferous vegetables.\n\nWhether the reduction in symptoms accounts for longtime use of soy and cruciferous vegetables needs further investigation, says the study's senior author, Judy Huei-yu Wang, PhD, of Georgetown Lombardi's Cancer Prevention and Control Program.\n\nResults obtained in preclinical studies in animals show that biologically active compounds present in both soy and cruciferous vegetables cause breast cancer cells to grow, but have opposite effects in animals that consume these compounds well before cancer is diagnosed and continue consuming them during and after cancer treatments.\n\nUntil more research is conducted, breast cancer patients should not suddenly start eating soy, if they have not consumed it before, says Leena Hilakivi-Clarke, PhD, a professor of oncology at Georgetown Lombardi and a co-author of the study.\n\nResearchers also found suggestive associations with lower reporting of other symptoms, including joint problems, hair thinning/loss and memory less in women who consumed more soy foods, but these associations did not reach statistical significance.\n\nPhytochemicals, or bioactive food components, such as isoflavones in soy foods and glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables may be the source of the benefit, researchers say. Isoflavones bind to estrogen receptors and exert weak estrogenic effects, among other effects. Glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables influence levels of metabolizing enzymes that can modulate inflammation and levels of estrogen, possibly attenuating treatment-related symptoms.\n\nCo-authors of the study include Chiranjeev Dash, MBBS, MPH, PhD, Leena Hilakivi-Clarke, PhD, and Yun-Ling Zhen, MPH, PhD, from Georgetown Lombardi; Yi-Tin Hwang, PhD, from National Taipei University, Taiwan; Scarlett Lin Gomez, MPH, PhD, from the Cancer Prevention Institute of California; Teresa T.

The advanced form of radiation therapy (RT) was well tolerated among this relatively understudied elderly population, indicating that SBRT is a viable option for patients who may otherwise be offered no curative treatment.\n\nWhile the primary treatment for early stage lung cancer is surgical removal of the tumor, some patients may not be able to tolerate surgery due to health status, advanced age or other factors. For these patients, the best curative option is SBRT, a specialized type of external beam RT that uses advanced imaging techniques to deliver extremely targeted radiation to a tumor. This high degree of precision makes SBRT particularly effective at sparing surrounding healthy tissue, which is important for tumor sites near essential organs, such as the heart and lungs. Patients complete SBRT treatment in three to five days, compared with several weeks for conventional RT.\n\n\u201cWhile multiple studies and trials have established the effectiveness of SBRT for inoperable early-stage lung cancer, one of the common reasons for not giving radiation in older patients is concern about tolerating the treatment and potential side effects,\u201d said Richard J. Cassidy III, MD, lead author of the study and a resident in radiation oncology at Emory University\u2019s Winship Cancer Institute in Atlanta. \u201cThe low rates of side effects from SBRT for this elderly population in our study indicate that these concerns should not prevent physicians from considering definitive treatment for their inoperable octogenarian and nonagenarian patients with early stage lung cancer.\u201d\n\nFindings are based on a retrospective analysis of 58 consecutive patients who received definitive lung SBRT across four academic sites within Emory between 2010 and 2015. All patients were age 80 or older at the time of their diagnosis, with a median age of 84.9 years. Forty percent of the tumors were adenocarcinomas, while 29 percent were squamous cell carcinomas and 31 percent did not have a biopsy. Fifty percent of patients who did not have a biopsy had a previous history of lung cancer. Researchers used logistic regression and proportional hazard testing to determine the association of patient, tumor and treatment characteristics to compare rates of survival, recurrence and progression and assess the influence of patient and disease characteristics. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was conducted to determine which patients were most likely to benefit from therapy.\n\nAt two years following definitive SBRT for lung cancer among elderly patients, survival rates were 73 percent for cancer specific survival (CSS) and 57 percent for overall survival (OS). CSS rates were higher for patients who were not active smokers but lower for patients who were older or had a previous lung cancer diagnosis (smoking Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.14, p = 0.03; age HR = 1.19, p = 0.04; cancer HR = 7.75, p = 0.01). OS rates were higher for patients with higher Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), which measures a patient\u2019s functional ability to perform ordinary tasks, such as work and self-care (HR = 0.91; p < 0.01). Researchers determined that this metric should be considered when offering SBRT in this elderly population, with certain performance status criterion (i.e., KPS \u2265 75) associated with significantly improved outcomes. Two-year estimates of local control and regional control were 84.5 percent and 71.7 percent, respectively. Local failure was more common among patients with adenocarcinomas (HR = 6.36, p = 0.01) and less common for patients with T1 tumors (HR = 0.20, p < 0.01). Higher KPS scores were associated with lower rates of both local failure (HR = 0.92, p < 0.01) and regional failure (HR = 0.94, p < 0.01). In terms of toxicity, just over one-third of patients (34.5%) experienced radiation pneumonitis of any grade, with only two patients experiencing grade 3+ pneumonitis. Pneumonitis was more frequent among patients who were not actively using ace-inhibitors (Odds Ratio (OR) = 3.49, p = 0.02) and less frequent in smaller tumors (OR = 0.03, p < 0.01).\n\n\u201cOur study, along with other studies, helps to show that SBRT can effectively and safely add years to the lives of elderly patients who have early stage lung cancer but cannot undergo an operation for it,\u201d said Dr. Cassidy. \u201cElderly patients, who are otherwise doing well, should not have treatment withheld based solely on concerns about side effects and age.\u201d\n\nThe abstract, \u201cStereotactic body radiotherapy for early stage non-small cell lung cancer in patients 80 years and older: A multi-center analysis,\u201d will be presented in detail during the poster session at the 2017 Multidisciplinary Thoracic Cancers Symposium in San Francisco (full details below).

But now the Food and Drug Administration has evaluated the safety of the second generation of silicone implants and the results are mixed.\n\nAn FDA report, released in late June, says silicone implants are generally safe. But complications from implants are frequent \u2014 things like hardening of the skin around the implant; ruptured, wrinkled, or lopsided implants; scarring, pain and infection.\n\nAs many as half of patients will need to have additional surgeries or have the implants removed in the first decade.\n\nIt also turns out that the longer a woman has the implants, the more likely she is to experience these complications.\n\nTake Kate Marion. She had silicone implants for breast augmentation in her late 20s. Just shy of two decades later she noticed something unusual.\n\n\"When I was crossing my left arm across my body \u2014 for instance, to put lotion on my right arm \u2014 I would make a little noise from my armpit, the way little boys do when they stick their hand in their armpit and pump their arm up and down,\" Marion says. \"A little tooty noise.\"\n\nAn MRI showed both her implants had burst. Her doctor immediately recommended removing them, which she did. Marion hasn't suffered any apparent harm from her ruptured implants, and she even confesses to having an occasional twinge of regret that she didn't have them replaced when she had the old ones removed. But ultimately she decided she didn't want to go through more surgery.\n\n\"Well, how long would these next ones last? I would be in my 60s when I had to do this again, and who wants to have surgery unnecessarily when you are 60 something?\" says Marion.\n\nAlthough the long-term effects of silicone in the body are still uncertain, many plastic surgeons don't see the leaking of modern implants as a health concern.\n\n\"The actual silicone that's within the implants is inert. So if the silicone gel leaks, it doesn't travel through the body, it doesn't cause systemic problems. So the MRI is really detecting a cosmetic concern,\" says New York City plastic surgeon Matthew Schulman.\n\nBut there have been more serious outcomes. Annette Knecht got silicone implants in 1991 following a double mastectomy. For years afterward she felt ill, suffered multiple bouts of pneumonia, had trouble breathing and pain in her chest. Doctors reassured her it wasn't her implants.\n\n\"We had a CT scan done, and it showed OK \u2014 everything looked fine, so we didn't worry about it,\" says Knecht.\n\nBut no one ever told her to get an MRI \u2014 something the FDA now recommends that women with silicone implants get every few years. As it turned out, Knecht's implants had leaked; a biopsy found silicone in her lymph nodes and in her lungs. She is currently disabled and awaiting a lung transplant \u2014 all, she says, for vanity.\n\n\"We're about four generations removed from those implants,\" says Schulman, the plastic surgeon. He explains that implants have undergone big changes since the early 1990s, when Knecht received hers. Back then they contained a runny liquid silicone.\n\n\"The silicone implants of today are what we call a cohesive gel \u2014 it's essentially like a jelly. So the jelly may ooze a little bit, but it will not run out like an oil,\" says Schulman.\n\nSid Wolf of the nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen is among critics who point out that the data in the FDA report sample just a fraction of the nearly 400,000 women who receive breast implants each year. Moreover, that data are limited to just the last two or three years \u2014 not enough, Wolf says, to make any real claims about the long-term safety of the implants.\n\n\"There is a huge deficiency of long-term data at a time when we know that the longer these devices are in, the more problems ... occur,\" says Wolf.\n\nStill, there are plenty of satisfied customers among the nearly 400,000 women who receive breast implants each year. Not only have the number of women choosing breast implants for augmentation risen by nearly 40 percent in the last decade, Schulman says that in his practice, 80 percent of them are choosing silicone over saline. What's more, he says few of them follow the recommendations to get routine MRIs to screen for leaks.\n\nSchulman says that the rates of complications for silicone implants are roughly the same as for saline \u2014 though he feels these complications can be minimized by choosing an experienced surgeon. Still, he warns his patients that no procedure is without risks \u2014 and additional surgeries are a very real possibility.\n\n\"Your young breast implants don't last forever,\" says Schulman. \"They may leak, they may rupture, you may decide you want a different size. So you have to at least expect that sometime in your life, you are going to need a reoperation. And if you are 100 percent against having another surgery related to these implants, then it's something you should reconsider.\"", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Beginning with a clear description of silicone breast implants\u2026banned in 1992, back five years ago with a concurrent FDA evaluation process\u2026the article does an excellent job of establishing availability.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The treatment, dubbed Early Start Denver Model or ESDM, offers a child 20 hours a week of one-on-one treatment with a trained therapist.

Many are pushing for cannabis as a treatment for the abuse of opioids and illegal narcotics such as heroin, and as an alternative to painkillers.\n\nIt's a tempting sell in New England, hard hit by the painkiller and heroin crisis. But there's a problem: There is very little research showing marijuana works as a treatment for such addictions.\n\nAdvocates argue a growing body of scientific literature supports the idea, pointing to a study in the Journal of Pain this year that found that chronic pain sufferers significantly reduced their opioid use when taking medical cannabis. Another study, published last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found cannabis can be effective in treating chronic pain and other ailments.\n\nThe research falls short of concluding marijuana helps wean people off opioids - Vicodin, Oxycontin and related painkillers - and heroin, though. Many medical professionals say there's not enough evidence for them to confidently prescribe it.\n\nIn Maine, which is considering adding opioid and heroin addiction to the list of conditions that qualify for medical marijuana, Michelle Ham said marijuana helped her end a years-long addiction to painkillers prescribed for a bad back and neck. Tired of feeling \"like a zombie,\" the 37-year-old mother of two decided to quit cold turkey, which she said brought on convulsions and other withdrawal symptoms. Then, a friend mentioned marijuana, which Maine had legalized in 1999 for chronic pain and scores of other medical conditions. Ham gave it a try in 2013 and said the pain is under control and she hasn't gone back on the opioids.\n\n\"Before, I couldn't even function. I couldn't get anything done,\" Ham said. \"Now, I actually organize volunteers, and we have a donations center to help the needy.\"\n\nBolstered by stories like Ham's, doctors are experimenting with marijuana as an addiction treatment in Massachusetts and California. Supporters in Maine are pushing for its inclusion in qualifying conditions for medical marijuana. Vermonters are making the case for addiction treatment in their push to legalize pot.\n\nAuthorities are also desperate to curb a sharp rise in overdoses; Maine saw a 31 percent increase last year, and drug-related deaths in Vermont have jumped 44 percent since 2010. Vermont officials also blame opioid abuse for a 40 percent increase over the past two years of children in state custody.\n\n\"I don't think it's a cure for everybody,\" said Maine Rep. Diane Russell, a Portland Democrat and a leader in the state effort to legalize marijuana. \"But why take a solution off the table when people are telling us and physicians are telling us that it's working?\"\n\nMost states with medical marijuana allow it for a list of qualifying conditions. Getting on that list is crucial and has resulted in a tug of war in many states, including several in which veterans have been unsuccessful in getting post-traumatic stress disorder approved for marijuana treatment.\n\nThis month, Pennsylvania became the 24th state to legalize medical marijuana. Sen. Mike Vereb, a Republican, called on lawmakers to take on what he called \"the number-one killer in Pennsylvania\" - opioid abuse.\n\n\"Opioid abuse has no party, has no color, has no religion,\" Vereb said. \"Let's face it, that's the killer. What we're doing today is the healer.\"\n\n\"It's hard to argue against anecdotal evidence when you are in the middle of a crisis,\" said Patricia Hymanson, a York, Maine, neurologist who has taken a leave of absence to serve in the state House. \"But if you do too many things too fast, you are sometimes left with problems on the other end.\"\n\nIn New Hampshire, where drug deaths more than doubled last year from 2011 levels, the Senate last week rejected efforts to decriminalize marijuana.\n\nThere are some promising findings involving rats and one 2014 JAMA study showing that states with medical marijuana laws had nearly 25 percent fewer opioid-related overdose deaths than those without, but even a co-author on that study said it would be wrong to use the findings to make the case for cannabis as a treatment option.\n\n\"We are in the midst of a serious problem. People are dying and, as a result, we ought to use things that are proven to be effective,\" said Dr. Richard Saitz, chair of the Department of Community Health Sciences at the Boston University School of Public Health.\n\nCannabis could have limited benefits as a treatment alternative, said Harvard Medical School's Dr. Kevin Hill, who last year authored the JAMA study that found benefits in using medical marijuana to treat chronic pain, neuropathic pain and spasticity related to multiple sclerosis. But he urged caution.\n\n\"If you are thinking about using cannabis as opposed to using opioids for chronic pain, then I do think the evidence does support it,\" he said. \"However, I think one place where sometimes cannabis advocates go too far is when they talk about using cannabis to treat opioid addiction.\"\n\nThe findings in the Journal of Pain study that found chronic pain sufferers reduced their opioid use when using medical pot were limited because participants self-reported the data.\n\nSubstance abuse experts argue there are already approved medications. It would also be wrong to portray marijuana as completely safe, they say, because it can also be addictive. But supporters point to doctors like Dr. Gary Witman, of Canna Care Docs, who has treated addicts with cannabis at his offices in Fall River, Stoughton and Worcester, Massachusetts. Since introducing the treatment in September, Witman said 15 patients have successfully weaned themselves off opioids. None have relapsed.\n\n\"When I see them in a six-month follow up, they are much more focused,\" Witman said. \"They have greater respect. They feel better about themselves.

Nocturnal hot flashes are among the most problematic because they can contribute to poor sleep.\n\nA new study shows that electro-acupuncture may be effective in providing some relief. The study is being published online in Menopause, the journal of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS).\n\nCompared with women who undergo natural menopause, women with breast cancer are at a greater risk of experiencing hot flashes, partially as a result of the premature menopause that results from chemotherapy and surgery, as well as estrogen deficiency caused by the use of breast cancer treatments such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors. It is estimated that by the year 2020 there will be nearly six million breast cancer survivors in the United States.\n\nResearchers analyzed data from a randomized, controlled trial involving 58 breast cancer survivors experiencing bothersome hot flashes. They compared the benefits of using electro-acupuncture (the application of a pulsating electric current) to prescribing gabapentin, an anti-seizure medication frequently prescribed to treat sleep disturbances related to hot flashes. The study showed electro-acupuncture to be comparable to, if not better than, gabapentin in helping to reduce hot flash severity and frequency and improving overall sleep quality (including falling asleep faster and fewer sleep disruptions). Although it is not exactly understood how acupuncture affects sleep, it has been shown to affect a number of neurotransmitters associated with sleep, such as serotonin and melatonin.\n\nPoor sleep is particularly bothersome for breast cancer survivors experiencing nighttime hot flashes because it has been shown to increase levels of pain, fatigue, depression and anxiety. Although electro-acupuncture produced significant sleep improvements, researchers noted that sleep quality for the participants was still not as good as it should be, implying that more research is necessary to explore possible combinations of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments.\n\n\"This study shows that, for women who need or choose to avoid medications, electro-acupuncture may be an option because it has minimal risks, but blinded controlled trials are needed,\" says Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, NAMS executive director.\n\nFunding for the study was provided in part by a grant from the National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute Cancer Center.\n\nFounded in 1989, The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) is North America's leading nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting the health and quality of life of all women during midlife and beyond through an understanding of menopause and healthy aging.

False positives are an initial finding of cancer that turns out to be benign based on additional testing. Interval cancers are those found between mammograms, either through additional tests or symptoms.\n\nThe researchers evaluated 12 years of data from 58,870 screening mammograms in 19,078 women with early-stage breast cancer and an equal number of mammograms in another 55,315 women who had never had breast cancer. The women were matched on such factors as age and breast density, a risk factor for cancer, with higher density increasing risk.\n\nWithin a year of the screening, 655 cancers were found in women with a breast cancer history and 342 in those without.\n\nMammograms had detected 76.5 percent of the cancers in women who had never had breast cancer and 65.4 percent in those who had previously had the disease. As for false positives, 1 percent of the women without a history of breast cancer were referred for biopsy but ended up being cancer-free, compared with 1.7 percent of those with a breast cancer history.\n\nThe interval cancer rate was 3.6 per 1,000 screenings in those with a history and 1.4 per 1,000 in those without, the investigators found.\n\nWomen with a history of breast cancer were also more likely to be called back for additional imaging or biopsies: 18 percent called back, compared with 8.3 percent of the others.\n\n\"I think it's mostly positive news,\" Miglioretti said. \"Of the ones that are missed, most of them are early stage.\" It points to the need, she said, for women to remain vigilant about screening after their breast cancer treatment -- and to report any symptoms to their doctor immediately.\n\nDr. William Audeh, medical director of the Samuel Oschin Cancer Center and the Wasserman Breast Cancer Risk Reduction Program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, described the findings as \"not at all surprising.\" He reviewed the study but was not involved in it.\n\nAfter surgery and radiation, he said, a woman's breasts have changed, and there is a greater chance that a radiologist will think that something is abnormal simply because of the changes. \"That helps explain the false positives,\" Audeh said.\n\nAnd though mammography did not catch all cancers in the women with a breast cancer history, the study still points out the value of the test, he said.\n\nRobert Smith, director of cancer screening for the American Cancer Society, agreed.\n\n\"Despite poorer performance compared with women without a prior history of breast cancer, overall screening mammography was effective at detecting the majority of breast cancer in women with a [history] at an early favorable stage, with the majority of tumors being diagnosed as ductal carcinoma in situ or stage 1,\" Smith said.\n\nA trend among cancer specialists, Audeh said, is to tailor follow-up for a woman who has had breast cancer.

Herniation occurs where the jelly-like material in the center of the disk bulges through a tear in the disk's tough exterior layer and puts pressure on the roots of the nerves. Herniated disks are often the source of sciatica, or pain that radiates downward from the lower back into the leg.\n\nConservative treatment options for herniated disks range from over-the-counter pain medications to injections of corticosteroids directly into the affected area of the spine. Those who don't respond may require surgery. In some cases, the entire disk must be removed and the vertebra fused together for stability.\n\nAn alternative technique, CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency (pRF), applies energy through an electrode under CT guidance to the portion of the nerve responsible for sending pain signals.\n\n\"Pulsed radiofrequency creates a nerve modulation, significantly reducing inflammation and its associated symptoms,\" said study senior author Alessandro Napoli, M.D., Ph.D., professor of interventional radiology at Sapienza University of Rome in Italy.\n\nDr. Napoli and colleagues studied the approach in patients with back pain from lumbar disk herniation that had not responded to prolonged conservative treatment. In 128 patients, the pRF treatment was delivered directly under CT guidance to the root of the nerve. The treatment was applied for 10 minutes.\n\nFor comparison, a group of 120 patients received one to three sessions of CT-guided steroid injection on the same anatomical target with no pRF.\n\nThe one-year outcomes demonstrated that CT-guided pRF was superior to the injection-only strategy. Patients who received pRF saw greater overall improvement in pain and disability scores during the first year. Relief of leg pain was faster in patients assigned to pRF, and they also reported a faster rate of perceived recovery. The probability of perceived recovery after one year of follow-up was 95 percent in the pRF group, compared with 61 percent in the injection only group.\n\n\"Given our study results, we offer pulsed radiofrequency to patients with herniated disk and sciatic nerve compression whose symptoms do not benefit from conservative therapy,\" Dr. Napoli said.\n\nThe results of the study are superior to those typically reported for usual care strategies and injections and may help a substantial number of patients with sciatic disk compression to avoid surgery, Dr. Napoli added.\n\nThe use of pRF also could improve outcomes for patients set to receive corticosteroid injections.\n\n\"We learned that when pulsed radiofrequency is followed by steroid injection, the result is longer lasting and more efficacious than injection only,\" Dr. Napoli said. \"The effect of pulsed radiofrequency is fast and without adverse events.\"\n\nToday, therapy for spine disorders allows for definitive treatment of symptoms and conditions using different techniques and technologies.\n\n\"Of the different therapies available, pulsed radiofrequency is among the least invasive,\" Dr. Napoli said. \"Treatment lasts 10 minutes, and one session was enough in a large number of treated patients.\"\n\nNote: Copies of RSNA 2018 news releases and electronic images will be available online at RSNA.org/press18 beginning Monday, Nov. 26.\n\nRSNA is an association of over 54,000 radiologists, radiation oncologists, medical physicists and related scientists, promoting excellence in patient care and health care delivery through education, research and technologic innovation.

Vaccination programs worldwide currently target routine vaccination of women 26 years and younger.\n\nThe study recruited women in 12 countries across four continents. Cosette Wheeler, PhD, at The University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, was the lead author of the report.\n\nWhyThe human papillomaviruses cause cancer of the cervix, anus, and middle throat. Five types of HPV account for about 85 percent of all invasive cervical cancer cases. HPV vaccines are expected to prevent most of these cancer cases.\n\nMany countries routinely vaccinate girls and boys 25 years and younger, although vaccination rates in the United States remain low. In the US, only about 40 percent of girls and 21 percent of boys receive the three-dose vaccination series. The earlier the vaccine is given, the more efficacious it can be.\n\nThis study focused on the benefit of vaccinating women 26 years and older. Infection with HPV can take place at any time throughout adulthood and women in this age group may have already been exposed to HPV. The study showed that women in this age group were still protected from HPV infections.\n\nThe scientists followed each woman for four to seven years. They found that the vaccine protected the women against HPV infections during the follow-up period and that the women were protected from many types of HPV across a broad age range.

And the feeling was horrible,\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt would take my heart away when I was trying to eat and I\u2019d look up and they were looking at me.\u201d\n\nSamuels, 72, has essential tremor, a movement disorder characterized by uncontrollable shaking mostly in the hands or legs. An estimated 10 million people in the United States suffer from the condition, according to the International Essential Tremor Foundation. The disorder isn\u2019t fatal, but it tends to get worse with age and to affect patients\u2019 quality of life.\n\nDoctors usually treat essential tremor with medication, but the drugs don\u2019t work well for all patients. Now a new trial finds that a treatment to kill off neurons in a certain region of the brain can do away with tremors in some patients who don\u2019t respond to drugs. But the procedure brings lasting side effects in some patients, and its long-term usefulness is still being studied.\n\nIn an ongoing clinical trial at 11 medical centers globally, researchers are using ultrasound waves to treat the source of essential tremor in the brain. The therapy, called focused ultrasound thalamotomy, uses the energy generated by sound waves to burn off certain cells in the thalamus, a region of the brain where the essential tremor is thought to originate.\n\nPatients are placed in an MRI machine with their head secured in place in a special helmet. They are awake as doctors aim over 1,000 low-energy ultrasound waves to create a lesion \u2014 an injury to the tissue \u2014 inside the thalamus.\n\n\u201cAs we make the test lesion, we see a subtle improvement in their tremor and the patients notice it,\u201d said Dr. Rees Cosgrove who is leading the trial at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. Brigham is one of the six centers running the trial in the US.\n\n\u201cAs we enlarge the lesion, the tremor just stops and they\u2019ll just look at their hand. It has been shaking for years and they look at it as though, \u2018Hmm, is this really my hand?\u2019 It\u2019s really a remarkable moment.\u201d\n\nFor Samuels, who underwent the procedure on June 29, the recovery has been surprising. She had been taking tremor medication for almost a decade with little improvement. After the procedure, which only focused on her left hand, her tremor there has almost disappeared.\n\n\u201cThis has changed the quality of my life,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s a pleasure, I can sign my name, I can write. I can eat like a normal person, doing things that I couldn\u2019t do before.\u201d\n\nIn July, the Food and Drug Administration approved the device being used in the trial. It has been developed by InSightec, which is funding the trial along with the Focused Ultrasound Foundation and the Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation.\n\nA pilot study on MRI-guided focused ultrasound treatment was published in 2013.\n\nThe randomized trial provides further data on the treatment. In the study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday, 76 patients were treated with focused ultrasound, and their tremor was evaluated after the first, third, sixth, and 12th month. Researchers found that the severity of essential tremor reduced significantly over that time in the patients who underwent the treatment versus those who had a sham procedure. The treated group also evaluated their quality of life as much better than before the procedure, despite a few persistent side effects like gait disturbance and paresthesia \u2014 the sensation of prickling pins and needles.\n\nNeurologist Dr. Bryan Ho, who is not involved in the trial, noted that tremor suppression remained sustained throughout the 12 months. But he expressed concern about the side effects of the treatment.\n\n\u201cOver a third of patients actually experienced either gait disturbance or paresthesia. It\u2019s a pretty high incidence of side effects,\u201d said Dr. Ho, who is the director of the Movement Disorders Program at Tufts Medical Center.\n\nHe added that since these patients were only followed for a year, there isn\u2019t enough data available yet to determine the long-term efficacy of the treatment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one and done,\u201d he said. \u201cPatients may have some benefit for a period of time, but how do they do five years from now or 10 years from now after the treatment? That needs to be shown.\u201d\n\nThe researchers are in the process of collecting this data; the clinical trial will run until December. The doctors at Brigham will follow up with Samuels \u2014 and others who undergo the treatment \u2014 for up to five years and run more MRI scans and neurological exams to find out for how long the lesion lasts and keeps the tremor suppressed.\n\nFor now, the treatment has had an immense impact on patients\u2019 lives. \u201cThese people are able to go back and now use that hand like you and I use our hands, without thinking about it,\u201d said Dr. Cosgrove.\n\n\u201cThey can write their names again, they can feed themselves, they are not embarrassed about being in public.

The participants fell into four groups: those with no use or low use of marijuana, early chronic users, those who only smoked during their teens and those who began using it later and continued using the drug. The early chronic users smoked a great deal -- a peak of more than 200 days per year on average when they were 22 years old.\n\nThe researchers found no links to physical or mental health issues -- including depression, psychotic symptoms or asthma -- in any group, even those with very high use. They controlled for cigarette smoking, other drug use, access to health insurance and other factors.\n\n\"What we found was a little surprising,\" lead author Jordan Bechtold, a research fellow at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said in a statement.\n\nBased on other studies in the past that seemed to allude to marijuana use and later development of psychotic symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations, the researchers had thought they might find some associations to disease or other health conditions.

A new wearable medical device developed by Kumamoto University has been found to effect visceral fat loss and improve blood glucose (sugar). The current study reports clinical trial results for optimal use frequency.\n\nType 2 diabetes is a disease of systemic organ failure due to chronic hyperglycemia and inflammation from the accumulation of excess visceral fat. Metabolic disorders such as hyperglycemia attenuate stress resistance in the human body and exacerbate insulin resistance. The ability of insulin to lower blood sugar levels is reduced and insulin secretion is decreased.\n\nThe heat shock response (HSR) is activated as a response to stress in the human body, but its function decreased in those with type 2 diabetes. A research team from Kumamoto University, Japan has found that by restoring the function of HSP72, the main protein of HSR, improved glucose-related abnormalities. The team found that a suitable combination of mild electrical stimulation (MES) with heat shock (HS) activated HSP72 more efficiently.\n\nThe researchers developed a belt-type medical device that uses a special type of rubber to transmit MES and HS at the same time. They then performed a clinical trial of MES + HS on 40 obese men suffering from type 2 diabetes. Results showed a decrease fasting glucose levels, a loss of visceral fat, improve insulin resistance, and a significant (-0.43%) improvement in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values. About half of all subjects (52.5%) achieved less than 7.0% HbA1c, which is a treatment goal for diabetes. The first trial showed that activation of the HSR produced a large therapeutic effect.\n\nIn the researcher's next clinical trial, 60 obese patients with type 2 diabetes from both genders were given a 12-week treatment with the belt-shaped MES+HS medical device. Trial subjects received treatments for 60 minutes each time, and were separated into three groups of 2, 4, and 7 treatments per week. This determined the most effective treatment frequency.\n\nThe reduction in the visceral fat area was 5.37 sq. cm in the 2 treatment per week group, 14.24 sq. cm in the 4 per week group and 16.45 sq. cm in the 7 per week group. Declines in HbA1c were 0.10%, 0.36%, and 0.65% in the 2, 4, and 7 treatment-per-week groups respectively. Improvements in chronic inflammation, fatty liver markers, renal function and lipid profile were also shown. Furthermore, adding the MES+HS treatment to a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is the most often used therapeutic drug for diabetes in Japan, showed an even stronger blood glucose improvement.\n\n\"This device is very easy to use since it simply attaches to the abdomen, and it has a low-impact on the patient. One can expect the effects to be similar to exercise therapy,\" said Dr. Tatsuya Kondo, who lead the research. \"Even in patients who have difficulty exercising, such as those who are overweight, elderly, or have some form of disability, this device can be expected to provide acceptable treatment in addition to conventional diabetic medical care.\"\n\nThis research was posted online in the nature.com journal Scientific Reports on October 19th, 2016.\n\nT.

The results are presented in the journal The Lancet Oncology.\n\nRectal cancer affects some 2,000 men and women in Sweden every year. Preoperative radiotherapy was gradually introduced in the early 1990s, with a consequent improvement in prognosis for people with rectal cancer and reduction in the risk of local recurrence.\n\n\"Back then we showed that preoperative radiotherapy reduces the risk of local recurrence by over 50 per cent for patients with rectal cancer,\" says principal investigator Anna Martling, senior consultant surgeon and professor at Karolinska Institutet's Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery. \"Thanks to our results, radiotherapy is recommended to many rectal cancer patients.\"\n\nHowever, radiotherapy can cause adverse reactions and the optimal radiotherapeutic method and the interval between it and the ensuing surgery have been mooted. The study now presented in The Lancet Oncology is based on the claim that the adverse effects of rectal cancer treatment can be reduced by administering more but lower doses of radiation for a longer time, or by increasing the interval between radiotherapy and surgery. These hypotheses have now been tested in a study in which rectal cancer patients were randomly assigned to three different treatment arms:\n\u2022 Delayed surgery with short-course (5x5 Gy) radiotherapy followed by surgery after 4-8 weeks.\n\u2022 Delayed surgery with long-course (25x2 Gy) radiotherapy followed by surgery after 4-8 weeks.\n\nThe results of the study show that patients with delayed surgery develop fewer complications with equally good oncological outcomes. It also showed that there is no difference between long-course and short-course radiotherapy other than that the former considerably lengthens the time for treatment.\n\n\"The results of the study will give rise to improved therapeutic strategies, fewer complications with a sustained low incidence of local recurrence, and better survival rates for rectal cancer patients,\" says Professor Martling. \"The results can now be immediately put to clinical use to the considerable benefit of the patients.\"\n\nEighteen Swedish hospitals took part in the study, which was financed by the Swedish Research Council and the Cancer Society in Stockholm, and through the regional ALF agreement between Stockholm County Council and Karolinska Institutet.

We ask: Should you believe this?\n\nThe Claim: If you drink coffee you\u2019ll live forever! Well, almost: nurses and other health professionals who drink coffee (regular or decaf) had a lower risk of premature death than coffee abstainers.\n\nThe Backstory: . . . is enough to make STAT cross-eyed. Decades of studies have examined links between coffee drinking and health outcomes. Overall, the conclusions have been pro-coffee. Lots of research has linked coffee drinking to a lower risk of dying early, including this, this, and this. Other studies have found associations with lower risk of specific conditions, like this on cardiovascular disease (by many of the same authors as the new study), this on stroke, this on heart failure, and this on diabetes. Most research has found the greatest benefits with daily consumption of around three or four cups \u2014 usually 6 to 8 ounces, and without distinguishing regular from decaf. Fewer studies link coffee to a higher likelihood of dying prematurely, but this classic found a link between 6-plus cups a day and dying of cardiovascular disease, while this 2013 paper, on 43,727 people followed for a median of 17 years, concluded that adults under 55 who averaged more than 4 cups a week had a 56 percent (men) or 130 percent (women) higher risk of dying over the study period than non-coffee drinkers.\n\nFirst Take: The new research, published in Circulation on Monday and funded by the National Institutes of Health, mined three large, ongoing epidemiological studies (74,890 women in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, 93,054 women in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study 2, and 40,557 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study), following them for at least 20 years. Overall, the heaviest coffee-drinkers (more than five cups a day, regular or decaf) had a tiny 2 percent additional risk of dying compared with coffee abstainers. Those drinking 1.1 to 3 cups, and 3.1 to 5 cups, had slightly (9 percent and 7 percent) lower risks of dying.\n\nThen the researchers, led by Dr. Frank Hu of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, did something clever: they ran the analysis on nonsmokers only. That eliminated the stereotypical coffee-swilling, cigarette-sucking types. Result: people drinking 1.1 to 3 cups a day had an 8 percent lower mortality risk, while the 3.1-5-cup crowd had a 15 percent lower mortality risk, mostly due to lower risk of deaths from cardiovascular disease, neurological diseases, type 2 diabetes, and suicide. Even the 5-plus\u2019s had 12 percent lower mortality.\n\nA co-author of the 2013 study linking heavy coffee drinking to higher mortality called the new one \u201cvery good,\u201d especially since it controlled for the deadly effects of smoking, which the earlier one did not. It \u201csupports the safety and efficacy of even high doses of coffee in non-smokers,\u201d said Dr. Carl Lavie, a cardiologist at Ochsner Health System. But given the 2013 research suggesting \u201ctoxicity of high coffee doses\u201d in some people, he said, \u201cto me the most reasonable approach would be to keep coffee intake to two to three cups most days.\u201d\n\nSecond Take: STAT knows better than to get between coffee lovers and their cup o\u2019 joe, so if you want to take this study as permission to keep beating a path to your Keurig, we\u2019re not going to slow you down.\n\nThis is another observational study, where researchers look for associations between people\u2019s freely-chosen diet and other lifestyle decisions and subsequent health outcomes. Correlations do not establish causation: a link between Behavior A and Health Outcome B might or might not mean that A caused B. It might mean instead that a third factor \u2014 another behavior, socioeconomic status, even personality or genetics \u2014 might go hand in hand with Behavior A and be the true cause of Outcome B. Maybe people who drink coffee have some genetic, psychological, or behavioral trait (drinking fewer sugary beverages? eating less junk food?) that causes the observed benefit.\n\nBut surely the population in this study is so huge and socioeconomically similar (all health professionals) that correlation is more likely to reflect causation?\n\nMore likely, yes, but don\u2019t count on it. This same Nurses Health Study, for instance, infamously found a correlation between post-menopausal hormone therapy and lower risk of cardiovascular disease and death, here and here. That turned out to be wrong. The definitive, randomized Women\u2019s Health Initiative study showed that hormone therapy raised the risk of cardiovascular disease, contradicting the NHS and shocking nearly everyone.\n\nTakeaway: Observational studies that associate coffee drinking with health benefits are strongly suggestive but not definitive. If you do want to infer causation from this latest study, know that drinking coffee reduced the absolute mortality risk from 6.8 deaths a year per 1,000 people to, at best, 5.8. That is, each year, coffee would be keeping 1 person in 1,000 from dying.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Coffee is widely available, and that\u2019s obvious from the story.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "WEDNESDAY, July 28, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Drinking alcohol may help keep rheumatoid arthritis at bay, possibly because it dampens the body's immune response, new research suggests.\n\nAlcohol consumption may also protect people who already have the autoimmune disease from developing a more debilitating form.\n\n\"This actually isn't a new concept. There have been other articles [stating] that alcohol might be protective,\" said Dr. Guy Fiocco, assistant professor of internal medicine at Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine and director of rheumatology at Scott & White in Temple, Texas. \"[But] I don't think we're going to be advocating alcohol to prevent rheumatoid arthritis.\"\n\nNor do the study authors advise drinking as a cure for arthritis. \"We would wish to point out that, at the moment, that our findings are preliminary, and would not recommend that patients drink alcohol with the specific purpose of treating their arthritis,\" said Dr. James Maxwell, lead author of the study and a consultant rheumatologist at The Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust in England.\n\n\"We would also remind patients to observe recommended government limits for alcohol consumption,\" he added.\n\nAccording to background information in the study, published online July 28 in Rheumatology, previous studies were mostly conducted in mice. The benefit of ethanol exposure for these rodents seemed to be due to higher levels of testosterone, the researchers wrote.\n\nFor this study, the authors compared 1,004 healthy participants to 873 people with rheumatoid arthritis. Both of those groups were divided into four groups: nondrinkers, those who drank 1 to 5 days a month, the ones who drank 6 to 10 days a month, and those who drank more frequently.\n\n\"We found that arthritis was progressively less severe as alcohol frequency increased, with a definite difference compared to nondrinkers even in the least frequent alcohol consumption group,\" Maxwell said.\n\nThe teetotalers had quadruple the risk of having rheumatoid arthritis compared with those who drank in the highest category.\n\nAnd the more often one drank, the less damaging the rheumatoid arthritis tended to be, including healthier joints as shown on X-rays and less inflammation.\n\nThe association was seen in both men and women, though it was stronger in males.\n\nAlthough no one can pinpoint a reason for the link with certainty, \"essentially we think that alcohol may be having an effect by reducing the immune response, which leads to joint inflammation, and also that it may have a mild pain-killing effect,\" said Maxwell.\n\n\"There's a little information that alcohol can suppress the immune system,\" added Fiocco. \"What's been reported is that people who drink excessive alcohol actually have higher levels of the cytokines that lead to the inflammation and moderate amounts of alcohol actually may lower these levels.\"\n\nThis finding is slightly different than what is reported in the current study (that the severity of the disease decreased with more alcohol).\n\nBecause the researchers assessed drinking frequency, rather than the amount of alcohol consumed, it is not clear how much alcohol might be helpful, they said.\n\nAnd Maxwell stressed that their preliminary findings need to be replicated in the future.\n\n\"There are limitations to any research which asks patients to report their exposure to something (such as alcohol) over a period of time,\" Maxwell added. \"We would therefore recommend that a future prospective study should be performed to further assess the impact of alcohol consumption on rheumatoid arthritis, a study recording alcohol consumption at the time rather than asking about it later.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases has more on rheumatoid arthritis.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Not applicable.

Tissue plasminogen activator, known as tPA, can dramatically reverse stroke symptoms in those whose strokes are caused by blood clots and blockages, which account for an estimated 85 percent of all strokes.\n\nStrokes strike about 795,000 Americans each year, killing 137,000, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The condition is a leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States.\n\n\"A tool that can estimate the age of stroke would be of great value in cases of unknown stroke onset time,\" said lead researcher Dr. Catherine Oppenheim, professor of radiology at Universite Paris Descartes in France. \"This concerns as many as a quarter of all stroke patients who cannot be given tPA because they wake up with stroke symptoms or are unable to say when their stroke began.\"\n\nUnder current guidelines, patients who awaken with symptoms are arbitrarily excluded from tPA therapy, Oppenheim said, because the onset is considered to be the last time the patient was symptom-free, which might have been the night before.\n\nThe clot-busting drug is recommended for use only within 4.5 hours of stroke onset because it carries a risk of brain hemorrhage, a potentially fatal prospect, with the risk increasing as more time passes.\n\nThe study, reported online Nov. 2 and in the December issue of the journal Radiology, reinforces results from similar research, Oppenheim said. Her team reviewed MRI images from 130 patients treated for clot-caused strokes at Sainte-Anne Hospital in Paris between May 2006 and October 2008.\n\nOf those patients, whose average age was 64.7 years, 63 underwent MRI within three hours of stroke onset and 67 were imaged between three and 12 hours afterwards. With the MRI data, radiologists could predict with more than 90 percent accuracy which patients had experienced stroke symptoms for longer than three hours.\n\nHowever, the study did not compare patients with unknown stroke onset who received tPA to those who did not, Oppenheim said.\n\n\"Providing stroke neurologists with a reliable marker of stroke age will help to ensure that patients . . . are managed as urgently as those with known stroke onset time,\" she said. \"These results will be useful for centers that offer 24-hour access to acute stroke patients. The main limitation is the limited access to MRI in emergency rooms worldwide.\"\n\nOppenheim said the next step would be clinical trials to validate whether MRIs serve as a \"surrogate clock\" for stroke onset.\n\nSeveral doctors specializing in stroke care were encouraged by Oppenheim's study, though they cautioned further research would be necessary to determine if the results could be replicated.\n\n\"It's potentially helpful, and I don't know that it would take years to prove that,\" said Dr. Larry B. Goldstein, director of the Duke University Stroke Center in Durham, N.C.\n\nGoldstein noted that about 40 percent of stroke patients who arrive at his facility within two hours of symptom onset receive tPA. If they don't, \"the major reason . . . is that they get there too late,\" he said.\n\nDr. Wally Ghurabi, emergency department director at Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center, said a group of ongoing studies there include a similar focus on MRIs and stroke.\n\n\"Really pinpointing the time of onset is so crucial for us. This will definitely give us that edge,\" Ghurabi said. \"I've seen it with my own eyes -- a 60-year-old male or female patient comes into the ER and they're not able to move on one side or speak. A couple of hours later [after therapy], they can walk and talk. What more could we as doctors want?\"\n\nDr. David F. Kallmes, an interventional neuro-radiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., was also optimistic about Oppenheim's results.\n\nThe MRI is \"trying to act as a surrogate clock,\" said Kallmes, who edited Oppenheim's journal article. \"Like any imaging technique, it has a certain accuracy but it won't be perfect. It's certainly an innovative approach for patients with stroke-like symptoms.\"\n\nIn October 2008, the American Heart Association, the American Stroke Association and the European Stroke Association revised their guidelines to recommend that tPA be used up to 4.5 hours after the onset of an ischemic (clot-caused) stroke, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet revised its approved treatment window of 3 hours.\n\nA study in The Lancet Neurology also found that a slight increase in deaths and bleeding in an extended treatment group over a three-month follow-up period underlined the notion that treatment within 3 hours -- although not required -- is still optimal.\n\nReview the warning signs of stroke at the American Stroke Association.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story could have done a better job raising the question of availability of MRI around the US for urgent use at times like those described in the story or in the study \u2013 when there is a question about the 3 hour window. \u00a0The story alluded to this but was not fully discussed in the context of availability of treatment.

For years, they didn't. Then his luck ran out.\n\n\"My reaction was, 'Well, you smoked for 30 years. You got away with it for another 30 years and this is it.' I thought it was a death sentence,\" he says.\n\nPollner, who lives in Monroe, N.Y., was 76 when he was diagnosed with lung cancer. Like many patients his age, he didn't expect there would be any effective treatment. Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in men and women. And it is mainly a disease of older people. Only about 2 percent of lung cancer patients are under 45 and the average age at diagnosis is about 70.\n\nOlder patients are frequently not offered curative treatment like surgery, because they and their families and even their doctors often think they won't be able to tolerate it. So they are referred for supportive care to control symptoms, rather than surgery to remove the cancer.\n\nBut many patients can survive and even thrive after surgery, says Dr. Prasad Adusumilli, a thoracic surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. He was senior author of a study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in October. The study looked at more than 2,000 patients with Stage 1 non-small cell lung cancer who had surgery to remove their tumor. About 70 percent of the patients were 65 years old or older and about 30 percent were at least 75.\n\nAnd he found that a surprising number of these older patients did quite well. One year after surgery, more people had died from other causes than died from lung cancer. And, after five years, almost 9 out of 10 patients were alive and cancer free.\n\n\"They did well and beat their lung cancer,\" Adusumilli says, proving that when it comes to surgery for early stage lung cancer, age should not be a limiting factor.\n\nThis was the case for Morton Pollner, who is one of Adusumilli's patients. His cancer had not spread, and Adusumilli told him there was a good possibility the cancerous tissue could be completely removed and he could go back to leading a normal life. That was seven years ago. Today, Pollner is 82, cancer free and enjoying life.\n\n\"Whatever I get from here on, it's like gravy,\" he says.\n\nSurgery isn't the answer for all older lung cancer patients, according to Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. Patients with heart or other health problems may not be candidates. At the same time, he says it's important to recognize that patterns of aging have changed over the past two decades.\n\nSeventy today is not the same as it was 20 years ago, Lichtenfeld says. Older adults are more functional, both physically and mentally, than ever before, and he says the medical community needs to adjust its thinking about what treatments older cancer patients can tolerate.\n\n\"We shouldn't allow numerical age to be the deciding factor,\" Lichtenfeld says.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The surgery is clearly already available.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "(Reuters Health) - Many women with severe menopausal symptoms are not being treated for them even though safe, effective remedies are available, a study from Australia suggests.\n\nThe findings may be applicable to other countries, too, according to senior author Dr. Susan R.

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which generally combines estrogen plus progestin, is very effective. But after the initial findings of the Women\u2019s Health Initiative study showed that HRT can increase the risk of breast cancer, stroke and other serious problems, many women stopped using it.\n\nAs reported in the journal Menopause, in 2013 and 2014 Davis and her team analyzed survey responses from nearly 1,500 women ages 40 to 65.\n\nSeventeen percent were having moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, and 18 percent reported moderate to severe sexual symptoms.\n\nBut most were not receiving any kind of treatment. Only 11 percent reported use of HRT, and less than 1 percent were using any type of therapy that didn\u2019t involve hormones.\n\nThe women who did use hormones were mostly taking pills containing estrogen, rather than preparations that are absorbed into the skin and that are potentially safer, the researchers found.\n\n\u201cExtrapolating our findings to 3.7 million Australian women aged 40 to 64 years, we found that 455,000 women are likely to have moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, with most women (385,000) remaining untreated,\u201d they write.\n\nIn addition, very few women were receiving vaginal estrogen therapy for sexual symptoms. Vaginal dryness is common with menopause and affects sexual functioning. Vaginal estrogen preparations are very safe and effective for this problem but were prescribed to less than 5 percent of the women, the authors say.\n\nWhy are so few women being treated?\n\n\u201cOverall, there is the uncertainty of women and of doctors as to what the options are, what is and is not safe, and of the safe options - what and how to prescribe them,\u201d Davis said.\n\nThere is also, she said, a complete lack of understanding that for most women, these symptoms are not fleeting.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t \u2018grin and bear it for a few months\u2019 and it will all pass, as many women suffer severe symptoms for five-plus years,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen and doctors simply are not aware that symptoms can last this long.\u201d\n\nFinally, many women don\u2019t realize that non hormonal options can be safe and effective, she added.\n\nDr. Wulf H.

But it takes no position on MRI imaging for women who have had breast cancer, saying there is not enough evidence to recommend one way or the other.\n\nStudying the effectiveness of MRI screening on all three groups of women, Dr. Wendy DeMartini, an assistant professor of radiology at the University of Washington Medical School, said MRI imaging found proportionally more cancers in women who had been treated for breast cancer than in the women considered at very high risk.\n\n\"Women in the personal history group [who had MRI] were also less likely to be recalled for additional testing, and less likely to have a biopsy for a false positive finding,\" she said.\n\nDeMartini was scheduled to present the findings Sunday at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America in Chicago.\n\nFor the study, her team reviewed initial breast MRI exams of 1,026 women, conducted from January 2004 to June 2009. Of these, 327 had a genetic or family history; 646 had a personal history of breast cancer that had been treated.\n\nOverall, the MRI detected 25 of 27 cancers, DeMartini said.

A new study finds that kids in the U.S. preschool program tend to have a healthier weight by kindergarten than similarly aged kids not in the program.\n\nIn their first year in Head Start, obese and overweight kids lost weight faster than two comparison groups of children who weren't in the program, researchers found. Similarly, underweight kids bulked up faster.\n\n\"Participating in Head Start may be an effective and broad-reaching strategy for preventing and treating obesity in United States preschoolers,\" said lead researcher Dr. Julie Lumeng, an associate professor at the University of Michigan Center for Human Growth and Development.\n\nFederally funded Head Start, which is free for 3- to 5-year-olds living in poverty, helps children prepare for kindergarten. The program is designed to build stable family relationships, improve children's physical and emotional well-being and develop strong learning skills.\n\nHealth benefits, including weight loss, seem to be a byproduct of the program, said Dr. David Katz, director of the Yale University Prevention Research Center.\n\n\"This paper importantly suggests that some of the best strategies for controlling weight and promoting health may have little directly to do with either,\" said Katz, who wasn't involved in the study.\n\nHead Start might provide a structured, supervised routine that's lacking in the home, Katz suggested. \"Perhaps the program fosters better mental health in the children, which in turn leads to better eating,\" he said.\n\n\"Whatever the exact mechanisms, by fostering well-being in one way, we tend to foster it in others, even unintended,\" Katz said. \"The essence of this study is the holistic nature of social, psychological and physical health.\"\n\nAlmost one-quarter of preschool-aged children in the United States are overweight or obese, and obesity rates within Head Start populations are higher than national estimates, the study authors noted. Because obesity in childhood tends to continue into adulthood, experts worry that these children are at risk of future health problems.\n\nFor the study, Lumeng's team collected data on more than 43,700 Michigan preschool-age children between 2005 and 2013. More than 19,000 were in Head Start. Information on the others -- 5,400 of whom were on Medicaid, the publicly financed insurance program for the poor -- came from two primary health care groups.

People don't even like to say the word out loud.\n\nThe good news, we're told, is that there are many things we can do \u2013 or not do \u2013 in our adult lives to lower our risk of developing different types of cancer. Want to avoid lung cancer? Don't smoke. Want to lower your risk of skin cancer? Stay out of the sun, or utilize a proper sunscreen.\n\nBut a new study published Monday in Cancer suggests that at least one decision our parents make FOR us may have an impact on our predisposition to certain types of cancer.\n\nResearchers at the University of Washington School of Medicine and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center looked at the association between circumcision and the prevalence of prostate cancer. They concluded that circumcision before first sexual intercourse is associated with a 15% reduction in the relative risk of developing prostate cancer.\n\nIt's important to note, right off the bat, that this study is not purporting to establish a cause and effect relationship. As is often the case, there are many additional factors at play.\n\nFirst, a bit of background. It has long been established that men who are uncircumcised are more prone to contracting sexually transmitted infections. As the study's authors point out, \"The mechanism(s) by which circumcision reduced acquisition of an STI [sexually transmitted infection] is thought to be related to the microenvironment of the thin, lightly keratinized mucosal lining of the inner foreskin.\"\n\nThis tissue is subject to small tears that allow potential access of pathogens into the bloodstream. Furthermore, \"The moist environment under the preputial skin may help pathogens survive for extended periods prior to direct infection.\" Circumcision, of course, removes this protective environment.\n\nWhy is this important? Infections are reported to cause almost 20% of cancers worldwide, either directly by infection, or indirectly via inflammation. Several STIs \u2013 such as gonorrhea, Chlamydia, HPV & HIV \u2013 have been found in the prostate.\n\nParticipants in the study were asked about their family\u2019s medical history, which may increase a man\u2019s risk of developing prostate cancer, and their PSA screening history, which can lead to overdiagnosis of the condition. Men were also asked to self-report their circumcision status, number of sexual partners, and their history of STIs.\n\nCircumcision was reported in 68.8% of the cases and 71.5% of the controls. Caucasian men more commonly reported circumcision (69%) than African American men (43%). For 91% who reported circumcision, the procedure was performed shortly after birth.\n\nA few potential caveats to note include the reliance on self-reporting when it comes to a man's history of STIs, as well as his sexual partners. A cursory review of the data suggests, for example, that the number of male sexual partners is greatly underreported. Male-to-male sexual activity has been shown to lead to an increased rate in STIs, including HIV.\n\nThis gives pause to make one wonder what other facts were underreported, though the numbers of circumcised vs. not circumcised do fall in line with national survey results.\n\nThe bottom line from the American Cancer Society: While this is an interesting finding, it's not likely to spur any change in recommendations or medical practice.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The availability of circumcisions is not in question.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "Sharon Belvin's nightmare with cancer began in 2004, when she was just 22.\n\nBelvin was an avid runner but said she suddenly found she couldn't climb the stairs without \"a lot of difficulty breathing.\"\n\nEventually, after months of fruitless treatments for lung ailments like bronchitis, she was diagnosed with melanoma \u2014 a very serious skin cancer. It had already spread to her lungs, and the prognosis was grim. She had about a 50-50 chance of surviving the next six months.\n\n\"Yeah, that was the turning point of life, right there,\" she says.\n\nWhat Belvin didn't know at the time was that a revolutionary treatment for melanoma had begun testing in clinical trials. An immunologist named Jim Allison, now at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, had figured out that if the immune system was tweaked just right, it could do a better job of killing the cancer than the usual treatments. (Joe Palca worked for Allison early in both men's careers.)\n\nAllison's treatment was still experimental, but if it worked, it had the potential to save Belvin's life.\n\n\"It's a new modality for treating cancer,\" Dr. Samuel Broder, a former director of the National Cancer Institute, says now of Allison's pioneering research. \"It used to be there were three basic treatment options for cancer \u2014 surgery, radiation and chemotherapy \u2014 or some combination of those three. It's fair to say there's now a fourth option.\"\n\nAllison's long search for this new kind of treatment \u2014 one that has since become a lifesaver for some cancer patients \u2014 began around a decade before Belvin got sick, when Allison was running a lab at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nAt the time, he was what you could call a research scientist's research scientist. He was fascinated by certain powerful cells of the immune system \u2014 T cells. A subset of white blood cells, T cells travel around the body and can \"protect us against just about anything,\" Allison says.\n\nT cells do recognize cancer cells, but not in a way that can eliminate the disease. Allison had been studying T cells for years, and thought that by tinkering with one key molecule on the outside of these cells, he could enhance their response to cancer, enough to eradicate the illness.\n\nHe and one of his grad students ran an experiment to test the tweaked T cells on cancerous tumors in mice, and the initial results astounded them. The T cells seemed to be doing just what Allison had hoped they would do \u2014 shrink the tumors and kill the cancer.\n\nAllison repeated the experiment with more mice over his winter break. After a few tense days, the tumors again disappeared.\n\n\"These mice were cured,\" Allison says.\n\n\"I've been doing this sort of stuff for years, and I'd never seen anything like that,\" Allison says. \"And I thought, 'If we could do that in people, this is going to be amazing.' \"\n\nAllison tried to persuade drugmakers to create a human version of the treatment that had worked in mice. He thought they would jump at the chance to try a new approach.\n\nBut the biotech companies he met with didn't bite. In those days, most firms were focused on drugs that would target tumors directly, and Allison was asking them to try something very different.\n\n\"This was targeting the immune system, not the cancer,\" he says. \"We weren't trying to kill the cancer cells. We were letting the T cells kill the cancer cells.\"\n\nThanks, but no thanks, the companies told him.\n\n\"I got very depressed,\" Allison says. He was sure this was the most important work of his career, but he had to get others on board.\n\nEventually, a scientist attending one of Allison's research talks was intrigued enough to contact a pal at the biotech firm Medarex. The company had recently developed technology that could make a human version of Allison's therapy, and was willing to give it a try.\n\nIt took a decade, but eventually Allison's big idea was ready for testing in people. A clinical trial to study the drug \u2014 now called ipilimumab, or Ippy for short \u2014 was set up at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.\n\nAllison decided he wanted to be part of this next chapter in the testing of immunotherapy, so he packed up his California lab and moved it to Sloan Kettering.\n\nAs it happens, Belvin was also in New York \u2014 a patient of Dr. Jedd Wolchok at Sloan Kettering. By the fall of 2004, Belvin had run through all the treatment options available to her. Nothing had worked to control the melanoma; it continued to spread dangerously throughout her body.\n\nBelvin remembers feeling sick and depressed, and says she wasn't even paying much attention when Wolchok walked into the exam room and suggested one last treatment.\n\n\"Sharon, we have an opportunity to participate in a clinical trial here. It's something you should consider,\" Wolchok told her.\n\nBelvin says she signed up without hesitation. After just four injections of Ippy across three months, her cancer was nearly gone. And at Belvin's follow-up appointment a year later, Wolchok delivered news that was hard for her to take in: \"Sharon, you no longer have cancer.\"\n\nAnd in the next breath, Belvin recalls, \"he goes, 'Oh, the guy who invented this is upstairs. Do you want to meet him?' \"\n\n\"Yes, of course I want to meet him!\" she told her doctor.\n\nWolchok called Allison, who was working nearby, and told him to drop everything and come to the clinic \u2014 a part of the hospital Allison had rarely seen. Though the research scientist couldn't imagine why Wolchok was in such a rush, he quickly figured it out as he opened the door and was greeted by Belvin with a huge hug.\n\nBelvin says she tried not to tackle him. \"It was hard to control myself,\" she says. \"I owe this man my life.\"\n\nBelvin was the first recipient of the immunotherapy that Allison had ever met. \"It really meant a lot,\" he says. \"It reminded me what it's all about at the end of the day.\"\n\nThat was in 2005; today, Sharon Belvin is still cancer-free.\n\nIppy is now sold under the brand name Yervoy by Bristol-Myers Squibb, which bought Medarex in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, Jim Allison has become a bit of a celebrity in the cancer research world. Among other honors, he was a 2015 recipient of the prestigious Lasker Award for his achievements in medical science.\n\nHe's become well-known among patients, too. Now and again, Allison fields calls from patients yearning to learn from the master himself what it will take to cure their disease.\n\nAllison can't really answer them. Each case is different, and using a patient's own cells to destroy tumors won't work in every patient or in every type of cancer. Still, the approach offers promise to some people that other therapies can't, and has transformed the way doctors think about cancer treatment.\n\nIt might be too early to say we're going to cure cancer, Allison says, \"but we're going to cure certain types of cancers.

On Monday, June 12, I took the train down to Washington to be hooked up while the annual meeting of the American Diabetes Association was in town.\n\nThe device, made by Medtronic MiniMed, is called the Paradigm Real-Time, a combination insulin pump and continuous glucose sensor. The sensor doesn\u2019t control the pump but allows a diabetic to make quicker, presumably better decisions. I\u2019d already been on a stand-alone MiniMed pump for a few years, but I found it only an incremental improvement over taking insulin by injection.\n\nLike the pump, the sensor requires injecting a tiny catheter (less than an inch long) into the midsection of the body, and changing it every three days to avoid infection. The sensor has a coated tip that measures the electrical conductivity of the interstitial fluid, the juice floating between fat cells right under the skin. As luck would have it, the conductivity is directly proportional to how much glucose is floating around in the juice.\n\nEven with the help of an expert trainer from MiniMed, I found that injecting the catheter took much more dexterity than injecting one for a pump. It has to be placed above the hip or the buttocks, which makes reaching it awkward, and then the wire leading from the sensor has to be connected to a transmitter that wirelessly sends the information to the pump.\n\nWhen everything was in, I had two catheters and the transmitter all taped to my body, plus the pump hanging on my belt. Kind of weird, but kind of cool, in a sci-fi way, and I remained thrilled at the prospect of seeing my first glucose reading.\n\nThen the waiting began. The sensor needs three hours to settle in before it can begin transmitting data. By late afternoon, when it was supposed to start, I got an error message instead. When I tried to recalibrate it a half-hour later, it still wasn\u2019t working right, so I had to remove it and inject a second one. It was after 9 p.m. before the second one finally began working.\n\nAt first, I was transfixed by the numbers as they were updated every five minutes. That night, however, the sensor kept beeping me awake, nearly every hour, warning that my glucose level was too high.\n\nI kept following the recommendations of the embedded calculator, taking only very small amounts of insulin to bring my sugar level down. But by morning, I was still high, so I followed my own usual guesstimate and took much more.\n\nTwo hours later, while attending a session at the diabetes association meetings, in which four experts talked about the new sensors, I heard mine beep again, this time warning me that my glucose level was plummeting. I quickly drank a juice box, and within minutes my numbers started leveling off. I had avoided my first low. All the hassles of the past 24 hours were forgiven. This bionic diabetic was in rapture.\n\nOver the next six weeks of testing, I came down to earth as I realized that while the sensor enabled me to drastically cut my usual number of lows, it did not eliminate them.\n\nThe main problem was that the sensor was simply not as accurate as a blood-glucose tester. MiniMed\u2019s studies show the sensor\u2019s accuracy can be off by as much as 18 percent. Another sensor, just approved by the F.D.A. and made by DexCom, is said by some researchers to be a bit more accurate, as is a third device, from Abbot, which has not yet been approved. But none are as accurate as a standard blood-sugar test.\n\nI also had three sensor catheters slip out and require early replacement, which would be especially annoying to anyone paying the $35 that each sensor costs; I wasn\u2019t, because MiniMed had supplied everything free for testing, but everybody else will, since the sensors are not yet covered by insurance. With each catheter intended to last just three days, the bill comes to $350 a month.\n\nBut the bottom line is that over the entire six weeks I had only a few lows that left me feeling woozy, the kind I used to put up with two or three times a week.\n\nOn July 24, my test period over, I felt like Mr. Magoo without his glasses. I made it through our annual Cape Cod vacation without incident, but Annie kept a wary eye on me. I think I owe it to her to start shelling out that $350 per month, at least until the insurance companies figure out what a lifesaver this transformative new technology can be.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story states the \u201cParadigm Real-Time\u201d combination insulin pump and glucose sensor was approved by the FDA, implying it is available to consumers.

No longer did he always have to buy the aisle seat at the theater because \"you feel guilty hanging over the person sitting next to you.\" No longer did he have to endure humiliations such as breaking a chair at his brother's wedding.\n\nThe best part, says Thayer, a Boston area professor, was not having to \"think about food for the first time in my life. It was fantastic. I ate when I was hungry, stopped when I was full. I didn't feel like I was fighting an uphill battle.\"\n\nUntil five years later, when the weight started creeping back on.\n\nWhen the 6-foot Thayer edged up to 310 earlier this year at age 45, he decided to go for a second operation: adjustable banding, more commonly known as lap-band surgery, which allows for repeated stomach-tightening and thereby offers a new opportunity for reining in appetite. Reactions to his decision vary, he says. While some people close to him worry about his going under the knife again, others have asked, \"What the hell did you do wrong?\"\n\nSecond surgeries to combat obesity are on the rise. The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery doesn't keep statistics on repeat customers, but obesity surgeons are reporting upticks. Dennis Halmi, a member of the Bluepoint Surgical Group in Woodbridge, says that in 2002 \"we did a handful\" of second operations on obesity patients, \"maybe five, six. This year we are doing probably 30.\" Scott Shikora of Tufts Medical Center in Boston says that until recently he hadn't performed a second obesity operation on anybody but is already up to about a half-dozen patients. Thayer was one of them.\n\nGeorge Fielding, whose obesity surgery practice at the NYU Medical Center in New York has gone from two or three second operations in 2004 to \"probably 20 or 25 this year,\" isn't surprised at the trend. \"There was a huge surge in gastric bypass from 1998 to 2001,\" he says. \"Going into the early 2000s, everyone thought the gastric bypass was the best thing since Eric Clapton picked up a guitar. Then they went and hid, then they came in for help.\"\n\nThe second time around, many, like Thayer, are opting for the adjustable band, which works differently from the bypass. With a bypass, 95 percent of the stomach is closed off with a stapling device. What could once stretch to the size of a football is reduced to the size of an egg that can't hold more than a tablespoon or two of food. In addition, the small intestine, where food goes when it leaves the stomach, is cut into two pieces. The lower piece, two to three feet down from the upper piece, is connected to the new, tiny stomach pouch. Thus, when food empties from the stomach, it bypasses a few feet of upper intestine, which means that fewer nutrients (including fewer calories) are absorbed by the body.\n\nObesity surgeons, Fielding included, report a high success rate for the bypass. Bypass patients lose some 60 to 80 percent of their excess weight, and 60 to 80 percent of those patients keep off at least two-thirds of the weight they lose. Such people often experience a near-complete reversal of diabetes, sleep apnea, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, arthritis pain and a host of other health-compromising problems, frequently going from several prescription drugs a day to none.\n\nThe thing is, for about 20 to 40 percent of patients, the operation fails over the long term. It's not always clear why. In a number of people, the stomach pouch softens, as does the opening between the stomach and the small intestine. That allows more food through more quickly, and the person's old level of hunger begins to return. As Joseph Moresca, a New York nurse who initially went from 440 pounds to 220 with a bypass, put it, \"instead of being able to eat a quarter of a sandwich, I was eating three-quarters of a sandwich.\" He regained 45 pounds by the time he decided to go for banding.\n\nIn contrast to the bypass, the band does its work by separating the stomach into two parts: a tiny upper pouch and a larger pouch below the band. The tighter the band, the more slowly food goes from the upper part of the stomach to the lower, reducing hunger dramatically. The operation is far safer than bypass surgery because organs are not being cut and sewn. In addition, there's no nutrient malabsorption as there is with the bypass, because the small intestine is left intact; banding patients do not have to take nutrient supplements for the rest of their lives, the way bypass patients do.\n\nBut the biggest difference is that when hunger starts to return, the banding patient can go in to his doctor's office for a tightening. The band is shaped like a little life preserver that can fill and go slack. Saline solution injected into it through a portal just beneath the skin makes it more taut. The tighter the band, the less hungry you are, the less food you can get down comfortably, and the less you eat.\n\nBut in that advantage lies the band's disadvantage. If the patient doesn't go in for adjustments, the whole thing won't work. Also, you can eat around, or rather, through, the band. Ice cream shakes and other very soft or liquid foods can go through even a tight band, and every obesity surgeon can point to band patients who have sabotaged their operations by eating foods that slip right through. The ability to control the tightness is presumably part of the reason that patients who opt for banding lose less weight, at least initially, than gastric bypass patients -- an average of 50 to 65 percent of their excess weight in the first three years.\n\nAnother difference between the band and the bypass that proves both a plus and a minus is that the band doesn't cause the dumping syndrome. That's an often frightening attack of sweating, nausea, faintness, diarrhea, cramps and rapid pulse that bypass patients sometimes suffer after eating just a bite of a sugary food -- a deterrent to consuming certain calorie-dense items.\n\nOf course, a second obesity surgery comes with increased risk. After a gastric bypass, there's often scarring that causes organs to adhere to one another. \"The liver, stomach, spleen and diaphragm -- they all get drawn in together in a big blob of scar,\" says NYU surgeon Fielding. Thayer says his banding operation, which would typically take about an hour, kept him under general anesthesia for 3 1/2 hours because his surgeon \"ran into a lot of adhesions.\"\n\nAlong with the risk comes the uncertainty of how well people will be able to lose -- and keep off -- weight the second time around. Not enough time has elapsed since the advent of second operations to get a long-term assessment.\n\nWhat obesity surgeons do feel confident saying is that no matter which type of surgery is chosen, and whether it's the first or second time, the patient has to meet the operation halfway. You \"still have to follow some semblance of dietary compliance,\" says Tufts's Shikora. \"You also have to be more physically active, take care of your health. And you have to follow up.\"\n\nIn other words, anyone who sees obesity surgery as a solution in itself is chasing weight-loss rainbows.\n\nThayer, who was down 30 pounds a month after having had his band inserted, gets it. \"You still have to diet,\" he says. \"You still have to commit to an exercise plan.\" No obesity operation is \"a magic bullet.\" But what he misses is that the bypass operation initially let him maintain his weight loss without putting extraordinary focus on his efforts.\n\nLike a lot of other obese people, he says, he \"had always been a person who could lose 100 pounds. I did it many, many times. The problem is, I'm not a great maintainer.\" The bypass, at least at first, let him not only achieve but also maintain the weight loss without thinking much about it. \"I didn't have to count calories. I exercised,o but I didn't have to exercise two hours a day in order to stay at that weight.\"\n\nHe wants the new procedure to return his appetite to a more manageable level so that it helps the pounds stay off. \"I'm hoping that this band will not allow me to eat a whole pizza anymore,\" he says. \"Last summer I was able to eat a whole pizza again, and I was like, this can't be right.\"\n\nLarry Lindner's latest book is \"Fighting Weight\" (HarperCollins), co-authored with George Fielding, Christine Ren and Khaliah Ali, Muhammad Ali's daughter, whose weight loss is the subject of the book.

You look energetic. And you've gained some weight, am I right?\" Stahl remarked.\n\n\"You're right about all of them,\" Kanzius replied.\n\nSo great, he had spent the summer outside doing things he hadn't been able to do since he'd been diagnosed with cancer six years earlier, like playing 18 holes of golf a day. What happened?\n\n\"I decided it was time to turn the switch on and try it\u2026Try treating myself,\" he explained. \"Got in the machine, adjusted it, and turned it on for a minute the first time. And [I] didn't feel anything strange.\"\n\nHe had turned himself into a human guinea pig.\n\n\"I've done it nine times,\" Kanzius told Stahl. \"Nine times and my blood work has improved all summer long. We're on vacation right now from cancer, I don't know whether it's a permanent leave but we're on vacation right now.\n\n\"Now that you feel so good, you feel great, you look good, do you have a constant worry that this is too good to be true kind of thing?\" Stahl asked.\n\n\"Sure. I mean, you wonder when the bubble's going to break,\" Kanzius admitted.\n\nSo even though he had been feeling good for awhile, he admitted there was always fear his disease could take a turn for the worse. \"The disease is relentless. It just keeps pushing and pushing and pushing.\"\n\nIt was that relentlessness of leukemia that had given Kanzius the idea to build his radio wave machine in the first place. When 60 Minutes met him back then, he showed Stahl how the radio waves - transmitted across a small field - created enough energy to light up a fluorescent bulb.\n\nWhen moving a fluorescent bulb into the force field, the bulb lit up.\n\nHe then wanted to show us that radio waves are harmless to humans, and even moved his hand back and forth into the force field. \"Nothing happens,\" he told Stahl.\n\nBut he knew that radio waves can heat up metal. So he wondered: if he injected a cancerous tumor with some kind of metal, would radio waves heat up the metal and cook the cancer cells to death, and only the cancer cells? He tried it out on a hot dog, injecting it with a metal solution.\n\nHe took a probe, and placed it into an injection site on the hot dog. When he turned the device on, the temperature went up in that one area where the metal was and nowhere else.\n\nKanzius thought he had discovered a way to attack cancer cells without the collateral damage caused by standard treatments like chemotherapy and radiation. \"I said 'Eureka, I've done it,'\" Kanzius remembered.\n\nHe managed to intrigue Dr. Steven Curley, a liver cancer surgeon at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.\n\nDr. Curley thought there was so much promise in Kanzius' invention, he began conducting his own research with the machine, using tiny bits of gold nano-particles that are so small, thousands of them can be injected into a single cancer cell. The radio waves then heat up the gold, which kills the cancer.

When a person encounters an allergen, let\u2019s say peanut protein, a type of antibody called immunoglobulin E, or IgE, gets activated. This stimulates the mast cells and basophils to release a storm of chemicals that provoke an allergic response to help exorcise peanut protein from the body.\n\nGenentech\u2019s drug is an engineered antibody that binds to human IgE, blocking it from triggering that chemical storm.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in 2003 to treat a form of asthma often triggered by allergens, but Stanford researchers are now testing it on patients with food allergies \u2014 and finding that it might help speed along classic allergy desensitization therapy, in which patients are slowly introduced to escalating quantities of the allergen, via allergy shots or those \u201chome brew\u201d concoctions.\n\n\u201cRight now, the process of immunotherapy is painstakingly long \u2014 it takes not just weeks or months, but years, to treat a single allergy this way,\u201d said Dr. Toshi Kawakami, a researcher at the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology.\n\nThis timeline becomes untenable for patients with multiple allergies \u2014 and about 70 percent of people who have an allergy to one type of food will also be allergic to another, Long said.\n\nSo Stanford has paired Xolair with desensitization therapy to treat up to five different food allergens at any given time. Instead of taking years to gird a patient\u2019s body against peanuts, they\u2019re able to help her control her reactions to, say, hazelnuts, fish, dairy, and wheat as well.\n\nLooking at IgE from a different angle, Harvard statistical geneticist Liming Liang has been hunting for new drug targets that might modulate how, exactly, the antibody is expressed. In a paper published last year in Nature, Liang\u2019s team found 30 genes that are involved in kicking off the allergic response.\n\n\u201cWe think we\u2019ll be able to identify a potential drug target here for allergy reaction \u2014 but, of course, it\u2019ll take quite a long time to turn that into a medicine used by patients,\u201d Liang said.\n\nAnother compelling approach is being taken by Japan\u2019s Astellas Pharma, which is developing a DNA vaccine meant to protect the body from cedar pollen. (Hay fever has been called a \u201cnational affliction\u201d in Japan, affecting a quarter of the population.)\n\nThe underlying research, from Immunomic Therapeutics and Johns Hopkins University, involves attaching a fragment of DNA from, say, cedar pollen to a template vaccine that can embed itself inside the cell. Once there, it revs up an aggressive immune response and imprints an \u201cimmunological memory,\u201d which means the immune system will respond even more quickly to future exposures to the allergen.\n\nThe idea is to create resistance to an allergen without ever having to expose the patient to that substance. If it works, it\u2019d be fairly easy to swap out the cedar pollen DNA for a different allergen \u2014 for instance, the genetic material that codes for peanut or cat antigens \u2014 and tack it onto this vaccine template.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of this is that, unlike food desensitization or skin patches, patients aren\u2019t exposed to the circulating antigen,\u201d Long said. \u201cThat hypothetically decreases the risk for adverse events.\u201d\n\nFor all the research on allergies, none of the drugs in the pipeline is a sure thing.\n\nFor a cautionary tale, look no further than Circassia Pharmaceuticals, which has been working on an experimental immunotherapy drug to forestall cat allergies. Interest in Circassia had been sky-high \u2014 the small biotech\u2019s market value had shot up to $1 billion earlier this year on speculation that its drug would prove effective.\n\nBut in a Phase 3 study, it turned out that the placebo effect was as effective as the drug itself. The company\u2019s stock plummeted on that news this past June.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that solving allergies is hard. Current medications \u2014 such as Benadryl, Claritin, and epinephrine (best known for powering the EpiPen) \u2014 do a decent job controlling symptoms in most patients, so there\u2019s little incentive to innovate.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a dearth of new allergy products because antihistamines work so well,\u201d said Dr. Todd Brady, CEO of Aldeyra Therapeutics, a startup in Lexington, Mass., that\u2019s developing a drug to reduce eye irritation from allergies.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re generic, they\u2019re cheap, they\u2019re safe, and easy to use \u2014 but unfortunately, a lot of patients suffer because of that phenomenon, because not everyone responds to antihistamines,\u201d Brady said.\n\nAnother reason for the hesitancy: liability concerns. It\u2019s a risky proposition to give patients the foods they\u2019re deathly allergic to \u2014 inducing anaphylactic reactions simply to test drugs in clinical trials.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s a fairly 19th-century approach,\u201d said Dr. Wayne Shreffler, a researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital who is working on the Broad Institute\u2019s Food Allergy Science Initiative. \u201cThere\u2019s really no doubt that there have been cold feet in the industry about this issue.\u201d\n\nBut investigators around the world have shown they can carry out these \u201cfood challenge\u201d trials safely \u2014 which could help hasten the development of new drugs.\n\n\u201cIn school, we didn\u2019t learn anything about allergy treatment, except antihistamines and epinephrine,\u201d Long said. \u201cBut now, we\u2019re seeing this whole new spectrum of treatments. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how this translates into making it into a pharmacy, and into the hands of patients.\u201d\n\nCorrection: A previous version of the story misstated some aspects of Aimunne\u2019s work on peanut allergies.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The article, admirably, makes clear that movement through the new drug pipeline is likely to be slow for most of the newly envisioned therapies.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "An estimated 25 million to 45 million Americans suffer from irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS, a gastrointestinal condition that can cause miserable symptoms. Making it worse for many patients, there hasn't been a conclusive test to diagnose what's wrong with them.

Dr. Mark Pimentel of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles developed the tests.\n\n\"We now have a test to say, you have a disease,\" Pimentel told CBS News. \"Having a test like this shortens the time of suffering, it shortens the time of investigation and accelerates getting the patient directly to treatment.\"\n\nThe tests, which measure antibodies in the blood, were based on research suggesting that IBS may develop after infection from a bacterial toxin found in food poisoning.

In humans and many animals the lateral sleeping position is the most common one. The buildup of brain waste chemicals may contribute to the development of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other neurological conditions. Their finding is published in the Journal of Neuroscience.\n\nDr. Benveniste, Principal Investigator and a Professor in the Departments of Anesthesiology and Radiology at Stony Brook University School of Medicine, has used dynamic contrast MRI for several years to examine the glymphatic pathway in rodent models. The method enables researchers to identify and define the glymphatic pathway, where cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) filters through the brain and exchanges with interstitial fluid (ISF) to clear waste, similar to the way the body\u2019s lymphatic system clears waste from organs. It is during sleep that the glymphatic pathway is most efficient. Brain waste includes amyloid \u03b2 (amyloid) and tau proteins, chemicals that negatively affect brain processes if they build up.\n\nIn the paper, \u201cThe Effect of Body Posture on Brain Glymphatic Transport,\u201d Dr. Benveniste and colleagues used a dynamic contrast MRI method along with kinetic modeling to quantify the CSF-ISF exchange rates in anesthetized rodents\u2019 brains in three positions \u2013 lateral (side), prone (down), and supine (up).\n\n\u201cThe analysis showed us consistently that glymphatic transport was most efficient in the lateral position when compared to the supine or prone positions,\u201d said Dr. Benveniste. \u201cBecause of this finding, we propose that the body posture and sleep quality should be considered when standardizing future diagnostic imaging procedures to assess CSF-ISF transport in humans and therefore the assessment of the clearance of damaging brain proteins that may contribute to or cause brain diseases.\u201d\n\nDr. Benveniste and first-author Dr. Hedok Lee, Assistant Professor in the Departments of Anesthesiology and Radiology at Stony Brook developed the safe posture positions for the experiments. Their colleagues at the University of Rochester, including Lulu Xie, Rashid Deane and Maiken Nedergaard, PhD, used fluorescence microscopy and radioactive tracers to validate the MRI data and to assess the influence of body posture on the clearance of amyloid from the brains.\n\n\u201cIt is interesting that the lateral sleep position is already the most popular in human and most animals \u2013 even in the wild \u2013 and it appears that we have adapted the lateral sleep position to most efficiently clear our brain of the metabolic waste products that built up while we are awake,\u201d says Dr. Nedergaard. \u201cThe study therefore adds further support to the concept that sleep subserves a distinct biological function of sleep and that is to \u2018clean up\u2019 the mess that accumulates while we are awake. Many types of dementia are linked to sleep disturbances, including difficulties in falling asleep. It is increasing acknowledged that these sleep disturbances may accelerate memory loss in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Our findng brings new insight into this topic by showing it is also important what position you sleep in,\u201d she explained.\n\nDr. Benveniste cautioned that while the research team speculates that the human glymphatic pathway will clear brain waste most efficiency when sleeping in the lateral position as compared to other positions, testing with MRI or other imaging methods in humans are a necessary first step.\n\nOther co-authors on the paper include: Lulu Xie, Hongyi Kang, and Rashid Deane of the Center for Translational Neuromedicine, University of Rochester; Jean Logan of the Department of Radiology, New York University Langone Medical Center; and Tian Feng of the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Stony Brook University.", "question": "Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Because everyone sleeps this criteria doesn\u2019t apply for this particular release.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "(Reuters Health) - People who get minimally-invasive surgery to replace damaged heart valves have an easier time completing daily tasks and a better quality of life after the procedure, a research review suggests.\n\nThe analysis focused on people with what\u2019s known as aortic stenosis, which occurs when the large blood vessels leading away from the heart narrow, forcing it to work much harder to pump blood. The condition tends to develop with age and can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue and heart failure.\n\nPatients in the study had minimally-invasive surgery that fixes the problem by inserting a replacement valve to send blood around the damaged valve while leaving it in place. This procedure, known as a transcatheter aortic valve replacement, is done by threading a catheter to the heart through a small incision in the chest or from the large artery in the groin - it doesn\u2019t require cutting open the chest.\n\nAfterward, patients could walk significantly further in six-minute walking tests used to assess their functional capacity. On average, they added almost 42 meters (138 feet) to their performance before surgery.\n\nIn addition, patients reported clinically meaningful improvements in their quality of life and their ability to complete daily tasks after surgery.\n\nThe results offer fresh evidence that transcatheter aortic valve replacement can help ease symptoms like shortness of breath and fatigue that limit the ability to handle physical exertion, said Dr. David Cohen, director of cardiovascular research at Saint Luke\u2019s Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\n\u201cThese symptoms lead to reduced functional capacity (inability to perform physical exertion) and also impact a patient\u2019s overall sense of wellbeing and quality of life,\u201d Cohen, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email.\n\n\u201cBy replacing the diseased aortic valve, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (and surgical valve replacement) reverses these effects and generally allows the patient to return to his or her \u2018normal\u2019 quality of life - limited only by the impact of other conditions that the patient may have,\u201d Cohen said by email.\n\nOverall, the current analysis included 2,775 patients from a total of 20 previously published studies on outcomes for this type of surgery.\n\nParticipants were 82 years old, on average, and they were typically considered high-risk surgical patients due to either advanced age or other medical issues.\n\nThe smaller studies in the analysis ranged in size from 36 to 484 patients, and most of them followed patients for as long as six to 12 months after surgery.\n\nOne limitation of the current analysis is that many of these smaller studies were not controlled experiments designed to prove whether or how transcatheter aortic valve replacement might improve quality of life, lead study author Nicola Straiton of the University of Sydney and colleagues note in Age and Ageing. Straiton didn\u2019t respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nPeople who don\u2019t get this type of minimally invasive surgery may instead get a more invasive procedure that involves surgeons cutting open the chest to repair a damaged valve.\n\nSurgeons may also perform what\u2019s known as angioplasty, which uses a catheter to insert a tiny balloon and inflate it to open the valve; sometimes surgeons will also insert a stent, or tiny wire mesh cage, to keep the artery propped open.\n\nResults of the current study reaffirm that a minimally-invasive procedure can be a viable option, even for elderly people who are high-risk surgical patients, said Dr. Samir Kapadia, a cardiovascular medicine researcher at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.\n\n\u201cReplacing the aortic valve improves functional capacity,\u201d Kapadia, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email. \u201cTranscatheter aortic valve replacement is an important minimally invasive treatment option for replacing the aortic valve that is narrowed.\u201d", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story doesn\u2019t discuss how widely available these procedure are.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Becky Herry has tried nearly every drug available for melanoma.\n\nA few years ago, that would have been a very short list. Until recently, people with advanced melanoma often died within a year of diagnosis, even with chemotherapy.\n\nFor the first time, however, patients such as Herry have options.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved two new melanoma drugs in 2011 \u2014 the first new therapy for the disease in more than a decade \u2014 and approved two from GlaxoSmithKline on Wednesday. All improve survival by a few months.\n\nThe FDA also has put a Merck melanoma drug, lambrolizumab, on a fast track to approval by designating it a \"breakthrough\" therapy.\n\nSeveral other drug companies are also working on melanoma therapies.\n\nMelanoma research will take center stage at the four-day annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which begins Friday in Chicago. Doctors will present 288 melanoma studies, compared to only 62 a decade ago.\n\n\"The number of new melanoma therapies is sort of astonishing,\" says melanoma researcher Lynn Schuchter, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. \"The pace is unbelievable.\"\n\nNo one can claim to have cured melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, which is diagnosed in 77,000 Americans a year and kills more than 9,400.\n\nBut after decades of failure, the spate of new drugs is helping more patients than ever before, giving people like Herry more time and better quality of life, Schuchter says. Doctors now dare to hope that giving these new drugs in sequence, or in combination, will help people with melanoma live for years while feeling relatively good.\n\nUnlike traditional chemo, which indiscriminately kills growing cells, the new generation of melanoma drugs work in a precise way, based on a better understanding of the specific genes and proteins that drive cancer growth, says Timothy Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation.\n\n\"The reason we're seeing these breakthroughs is because we did the basic science research to help us understand how this cancer happens, how it escapes therapy and how it progresses,\" Turnham says.\n\nMany of the new drugs aim to remove melanoma's \"cloaking device,\" allowing it to be recognized and killed by the immune system, says Roy Herbst, chief of medical oncology at the Yale Cancer Center.\n\nOther drugs \u2014 such as the two approved Wednesday, trametinib and dabrafenib \u2014 target growth signals within cancer cells.\n\nHerry has tried two of the newer drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb: ipilumumab, approved in 2011, and an experimental drug called nivolumab.\n\nAlthough her tumors increased while taking ipilumumab, Herry says a CT scan earlier this year found they had shrunk by half after beginning nivolumab.\n\nThe most noticeable side effects from nivolumab have been moderate fatigue and vitiligo, a loss of pigment on some areas of her hands and arms, says Herry, 57, from Santa Cruz, Calif. She's been able to continue working as a registered nurse throughout these latest treatments.\n\nOlder melanoma therapies \u2014 including interferon, interleukin-2 and five chemo drugs \u2014 caused much more serious side effects, leaving her too sick to work, Herry says.\n\nWhen the new immune therapies work, they often keep cancer at bay for a long time, says Schuchter, who has patients whose cancer has been controlled by ipilumumab for three years.\n\nAt the cancer meeting, featured presentations include a study by researcher Mario Sznol, of the Yale Cancer Center, who will discuss long-term results of nivolumab. Researcher Stephen Hodi, of Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, will present the results of combining ipilumumab with an immune-stimulating drug. Doctors from New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center will present research on uveal melanoma, which occurs in the eye, and affects about 1,200 Americans a year.\n\nOther studies released in advance of the conference have shown positive results.\n\nNone of the new drugs works for everyone. And none are risk-free.\n\nIpilumumab can cause severe side effects, created when the immune system attacks the body itself, Schuchter says. Vemurafenib, approved in 2011, can cause non-lethal skin cancers.\n\n\"Doctors will say, 'There are side effects, but they are manageable,'\" Turnham says. \"Well, 'manageable' can mean something different to patients.\"\n\nTurnham knew a 19-year-old woman with melanoma who \"woke up bleeding every morning\" because of rashes caused by one of the new drugs, which targets mutations in a gene called MEK. The woman died a year later.\n\nDrugs such as ipilumumab can seem like breakthroughs to doctors because they help 15% of patients. Patients with a limited time to live may not be so positive, Turnham says.\n\n\"If you are a patient and someone says, 'There is an 85% chance of you spending $120,000 on a drug, and spending four months of your life being sick, with no benefit,' you're not going to be so excited.\"", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The varying stages of availability of the various drugs was made clear in the story.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "University of Miami cardiologists last week reported success in a small, preliminary human clinical trial of a new stem cell therapy they hope some day will routinely mend human hearts and reduce the need for lifelong medication, even for transplants.\n\n\u201cThat's the Holy Grail, the quest the whole field has been pursuing for close to a decade, and this is evidence we're on the right track,\u201d said Dr. Joshua Hare, director of the University of Miami Medical School's Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Institute.

The procedure also reduced the size of hearts swollen by previous heart attacks, a condition called cardiomyopathy or simply heart failure.\n\nThe reduction was up to 25 percent, while current therapies including medication and pacemakers typically reduce the size by only about 5 percent, he said. The reduction in swelling increases the heart's ability to pump blood, he said. By implication, it almost certainly improves the patient's health, although that was not directly measured in the small, early study.\n\nIn the study, stem cells were taken from the patient's own bone marrow and injected by catheter into scar tissue in the patient's heart caused by an earlier heart attack. It worked in patients such as Eaton, whose heart attack was 11 years ago, Hare said. The hope was that the immature adult stem cells would turn into heart muscle, replacing the scar tissue.\n\nThe study shed new light on a question of prime interest to cardiologists: whether the injected stem cells actually transformed themselves into heart muscle, or improved heart function in some other way.\n\nSome of the stem cells did become heart muscle, Hare said; they also triggered the heart to produce more of its own stem cells which became new heart muscle as well, he said.\n\nThe next step is two more near-term studies.

Study participants who drank between less than a cup of coffee and three cups a day had 5% to 9% lower risk of dying than those who drank no coffee. Those who drank more than three cups a day did not see any benefit. The finding was murky, like previous studies, some of which suggested a benefit and some did not.\n\nBut when the researchers looked at coffee consumption only among people who said they never smoked, the relationship became clearer: Those who drank between less than a cup of coffee and three cups a day had 6% to 8% lower risk of dying than noncoffee drinkers. Those who drank three to five cups and more than five cups had 15% and 12% lower death rates.\n\n\"The lower risk of mortality is consistent with our hypothesis that coffee consumption could be good for you (because) we have published papers showing that coffee consumption is associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes and (heart) disease,\" said Ming Ding, a doctoral student in the Harvard School of Public Health department of nutrition. Ding is the lead author of the study, which was published on Monday in the journal Circulation. It might have been hard to see the link between coffee consumption and lower death rates because coffee and smoking often go hand-in-hand, and any benefits associated with the first could have been canceled out by the second. Although the study participants were asked about smoking, there might have been a tendency, especially among heavy smokers, to underestimate the average number of cigarettes they smoked per day, Ding said. It's possible that people who drink a lot of java have healthier diets overall and drink less soda, which has been linked to higher rates of death and heart disease, or that they have healthier diets overall. But that's probably not what links coffee to lower death rates -- researchers took into account the health benefits of drinking less soda and eating well. They also took into account the fact that coffee drinkers were more likely to have vices such as drinking alcohol and eating red meat. At least some of the health benefits associated with coffee consumption are probably a direct result of the ingredients in coffee, Ding said. It contains chemicals such as lignans and chlorogenic acid that could reduce inflammation and help control blood sugar, both of which could help reduce the risk of heart disease. In keeping with this possibility, Ding and her colleagues found that coffee drinkers were about 10% less likely to die of heart disease. They were also between 9% and 37% less likely to die of neurological diseases such as Parkinson's and dementia. The researchers also found that study participants who drank at least a cup of coffee a day had between 20% and 36% lower rates of suicide, although those who drank less than a cup had 36% higher rates. Several other studies have hinted at an association between coffee consumption and lower suicide rates, but it was a bit unexpected to see, Ding said. It is not clear whether chemicals in coffee have a direct effect on mental health or whether people who drink a lot of coffee have higher rates of employment or certain lifestyles that are associated with lower suicide rates, she added. Although previous studies have suggested that drinking coffee could protect against cancers such as prostate and liver, the current study did not find lower rates of cancer deaths among java drinkers.

While some people improve with customized diets that avoid certain foods that trigger symptoms, this approach doesn\u2019t help everyone and some emerging research suggests that the condition may also be influenced by processes in the brain.\n\nFor the current analysis, researchers examined data from 53 trials that compared the effects of antidepressants or psychotherapy, either alone or in combination, versus placebo treatments or \u201cusual management\u201d in people with IBS.\n\nRates of \u201cno relief\u201d were highest with placebo treatments. People were 34 percent less likely to have no relief from antidepressants and 31 percent less likely to get no relief from psychotherapy, the study found.\n\n\u201cOne component of IBS is increased sensitivity to the functions of the bowels; simply summarized, this means either the nerves taking messages from the bowel to the brain are more sensitive or that the brain is more attentive or reacts in a more emotional manner to the normal messages arising in the bowel, or both,\u201d said Dr. Michael Camilleri, a researcher at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science in Rochester, Minnesota, who wasn\u2019t involved in the current study.\n\n\u201cSince there are really no medications to reduce the nerve sensitivity, some doctors give medications that modulate the function of the brain in the hope that this approach will reduce the ability to sense or emotionally react to the signals or messages arriving from the bowels,\u201d Camilleri said by email.\n\nPsychiatric conditions including depression, anxiety, and somatisation - physical symptoms thought to have psychological origins - are common among people with IBS, researchers note in the American Journal of Gastroenterology.\n\nAlthough the use of antidepressants is common among IBS patients, psychotherapy is not, the study authors note.\n\nOne limitation of the current study is that the smaller studies used in the analysis had a wide variety of designs and methods for testing the success of treatment, researchers note. Another drawback is that these studies weren\u2019t designed to prove how antidepressants or psychotherapy might directly improve IBS symptoms.\n\nStill, a psychological evaluation may make sense for IBS patients because it\u2019s possible their symptoms might be a byproduct of untreated depression, said Dr. Agnieszka Kulak-Bejda, a psychiatry researcher at the Medical University of Bia\u0142ystok in Poland who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\nAntidepressants may work better for certain types of IBS, and the study findings also suggest that the type of medication may matter, Kulak-Bejda said by email.\n\nA family of medicines known as tricyclic antidepressants were more effective at relieving global symptoms of IBS, the analysis found. But another family of medicines known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) was better than a placebo for easing symptoms like pain and bloating and improving quality of life.\n\n\u201cThe decision to use antidepressants as a form of therapy should be taken individually,\u201d Kulak-Bejda said. \u201cThe decision should be made after considering all the pros and cons.\u201d\n\nLead author Dr. Alexander Ford of the University of Leeds in the U.K. didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story doesn\u2019t specifically state that the antidepressants and treatment options studied in these various trials are available for clinical use.

The research is also the first to show that diet and lifestyle may play a greater role than genetics in cataract development and severity.\n\nCataracts occur naturally with age and cloud the eye\u2019s lens, turning it opaque. Despite the advent of modern cataract removal surgery, cataracts remain the leading cause of blindness globally.1 Researchers at King\u2019s College London looked at whether certain nutrients from food or supplements could help prevent cataract progression. They also tried to find out how much environmental factors such as diet mattered versus genetics.\n\nThe team examined data from more than 1,000 pairs of female twins from the United Kingdom. Participants answered a food questionnaire to track the intake of vitamin C and other nutrients, including vitamins A, B, D, E, copper, manganese and zinc. To measure the progression of cataracts, digital imaging was used to check the opacity of their lenses at around age 60. They performed a follow-up measurement on 324 pairs of the twins about 10 years later.\n\nDuring the baseline measurement, diets rich in vitamin C were associated with a 20 percent risk reduction for cataract. After 10 years, researchers found that women who reported consuming more vitamin C-rich foods had a 33 percent risk reduction of cataract progression.\n\nGenetic factors accounted for 35 percent of the difference in cataract progression. Environmental factors, such as diet, accounted for 65 percent. These results make the study the first to suggest that genetic factors may be less important in progression of cataract than previously thought. How vitamin C inhibits cataract progression may have to do with its strength as an antioxidant. The fluid inside the eye is normally high in vitamin C, which helps prevents oxidation that clouds the lens. More vitamin C in the diet may increase the amount present in the fluid around the lens, providing extra protection. Researchers noted that the findings only pertain to consuming the nutrient through food and not vitamin supplements.\n\n\u201cThe most important finding was that vitamin C intake from food seemed to protect against cataract progression,\u201d said study author Christopher Hammond, M.D., FRCOphth, professor of ophthalmology at King\u2019s College London. \u201cWhile we cannot totally avoid developing cataracts, we may be able to delay their onset and keep them from worsening significantly by eating a diet rich in vitamin C.\u201d \u201cGenetic and Dietary Factors Influencing the Progression of Nuclear Cataract,\u201d Yonova-Doing, et al.

It found that bariatric surgery:\n\u2022 produced a mean weight loss of more than 100 pounds\n\nCHARLOTTESVILLE, Va., Oct. 1, 2015 - A study evaluating the effects of bariatric surgery on obese women most at risk for cancer has found that the weight-loss surgery slashed participants' weight by a third and eliminated precancerous uterine growths in those that had them. Other effects included improving patients' physical quality of life, improving their insulin levels and ability to use glucose - which may reduce their risk for diabetes - and even altering the composition of their gut bacteria.\n\nThe study speaks both to the benefits of bariatric surgery and to the tremendous toll obesity takes on health. \"If you look at cancers in women, about a fifth of all cancer deaths would be prevented if we had women at normal body weight in the U.S.,\" said Susan C. Modesitt, MD, of the University of Virginia Cancer Center. \"When you're looking at obesity-related cancers, the biggest one is endometrial cancer, but also colon cancer, breast cancer, renal cancer and gall bladder cancer. We think about 40 [percent] to 50 percent of all endometrial cancer, which is in the lining of the uterus, is caused by obesity.\"\n\nThe study looked at 71 women with a mean age of 44.2 years and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 50.9. Women are considered obese at a BMI of 30 and morbidly obese at 40 (which is typically about 100 pounds over a woman's ideal body weight), yet almost a third of women presenting for bariatric surgery did not identify themselves as obese.\n\nThe study looked at the effects of bariatric surgery in a relatively short timeframe, one to three years after surgery. A total of 68 participants underwent the procedure; two opted out of the surgery, and another died of a heart condition prior to surgery. The effects of surgery on body weight were dramatic: Mean weight loss was more than 100 pounds.\n\nTen percent of study participants who had not had a hysterectomy showed precancerous changes in the lining of the uterus, and all of those resolved with weight loss. \"We're talking about small numbers, really tiny numbers\" of study participants, Modesitt said, noting one limitation of the study. \"So I could never say that effect is definitive, but it is suggestive, given that we know already the incredibly strong link between endometrial cancer and obesity.\"\n\nModesitt, of the UVA's Division of Gynecologic Oncology in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, was most surprised by the dramatic changes seen in the patients' metabolic profiles derived from the gut microbiome, the population of microorganisms living inside us. \"The study results demonstrate that there is a huge alteration, but I don't even know what to say about that, except it is really new and intriguing area to look at in the link between obesity and cancer. For example, before groundbreaking work by Dr. John Marshall at UVA in the past, no one knew that ulcers were from bacteria. Who knows what role the gut bacteria play in promoting obesity, but metabolic parameter/markers of the bacteria definitely changed after [study participants] lost weight.\"\n\nWhile the study speaks to the transformative effect bariatric surgery can have, Modesitt urged people to avoid gaining weight in the first place and for those seeking to lose weight to exercise and eat more healthily before turning to surgery. \"We really should be working on diet and exercise from the get-go in our entire society, starting with our children. And exercise does seem to be protective -- even if you don't lose all the weight, it absolutely has beneficial effects,\" she said. \"There are lots of studies showing if you exercise, it improves your insulin, your glucose, all of those sorts of things that go along with the cancer-causing effect. Almost everybody agrees adding exercise would be wonderful and improve health on many levels. But losing excess weight would also be good.\"\n\nThe findings have been published as a lead article in the scientific journal Gynecologic Oncology. The article was written by Modesitt, Peter T.

Patients were ages 55-74 who had smoked for the equivalent of 30 years (one pack a day for 30 years, two packs a day for 15 years, etc.).\n\nThe researchers identified study participants in the CT-scan group whose initial screening was negative. They then compared those patients to other CT-scan recipients whose screenings detected an abnormality to assess any differences in lung cancer incidence and lung cancer-specific deaths.\n\nOf the initial 19,066 participants with a negative initial LDCT scan, 444 (2 percent) were diagnosed with lung cancer at the time of the last available follow-up. In the first year after a negative screen and before the scheduled first annual screen, 17 patients (0.09 percent of all initial negative LDCT participants) were diagnosed with lung cancer.\n\nAn additional 75 patients (0.4 percent of the initial negative group) were diagnosed with lung cancer between the first and second annual screening. The incidence of lung cancer at the first screen among those who were initially negative was 0.34 percent, compared to 1 percent of patients who were diagnosed during the baseline screening.\n\nThe researchers determined that eliminating the first annual screening after the initial negative test might have resulted in, at most, an additional 28 lung cancer deaths in the LDCT group (186 vs. 212 deaths per 100,000 per years) over the course of the study.\n\n\"Our analysis suggests that annual screens may not be warranted for patients who have had an initial negative scan, and future risk prediction and cost-effectiveness models could incorporate these data to improve screening guidelines,\" Patz said.\n\nHe added that improving the accuracy of LDCT screening for lung cancer would also significantly reduce the number of annual screens.

He urged people to focus on maintaining a good diet and taking exercise to keep their hearts healthy.\n\n\u201cStatins are a vital medicine for people with \u2014 or at high risk of developing \u2014 heart disease,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not a magic bullet.\u201d\n\nA study in June in the Archives of Internal Medicine suggested, in fact, that statins do not save lives in patients without heart disease, although they may prevent some non-fatal heart attacks.\n\nDr. Franz Messerli, the director of the hypertension program at two New York hospitals, St. Luke\u2019s and Roosevelt, worried about the message handing out statins would send to burger-eaters.\n\n\u201cComplimentary statin packets are prone to ... give Quarter Pounder consumers a sense of false security,\u201d he told Reuters Health by email.\n\nWhile statins might combat some of the toll that fatty foods take on cholesterol, there\u2019s a lot they can\u2019t negate: \u201csodium content is high, fibres are absent, and caloric load gargantuan,\u201d Messerli said of the fast food the authors looked at.\n\nStatins are among the most widely used drugs for the treatment and prevention of heart disease and strokes \u2014 the world\u2019s top killers.\n\nOne statin, a generic drug called simvastatin, is already available in low doses over the counter at pharmacies in Britain without a prescription. Other statins such as Pfizer\u2019s Lipitor and AstraZeneca\u2019s Crestor - which are among the biggest-selling drugs in the world \u2014 are for prescription only.\n\nIn the U.S., all statins are only available by prescription.\n\n\u201cAlthough no substitute for systematic lifestyle improvements, including healthy diet, regular exercise, weight loss, and smoking cessation, complimentary statin packets would add, at little cost, one positive choice to a panoply of negative ones,\u201d the scientists write in their paper.\n\nFrancis\u2019 team \u2014 who worked independently and had no funding from the drug or food industries for their research \u2014 used data from a previous large study to quantify how a person\u2019s heart attack risk increases with their daily intake of total fat and harmful trans fats.\n\nThey compared this with the decrease in risk from taking statins, using data from seven previously published trials.\n\n\u201cIt makes sense to make risk-reducing supplements available just as easily as the unhealthy condiments (such as salt or ketchup) that are provided free of charge,\u201d Francis said in his report of the research. \u201cIt would cost less than 5 pence ($0.07) per customer \u2014 not much different to a sachet of ketchup.\u201d", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story makes it clear that statins are widely available and only by prescription in the U.S.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The defense system that doctors are trying to breach evolved to keep out toxins and microbes. It consists mainly of cells that line the walls of capillaries in the brain and are so tightly packed that many molecules in the bloodstream cannot slip out between cells to reach the brain tissue itself. But certain drugs, like mannitol, will temporarily open the barrier and were first used more than 20 years ago to help other medicines reach the brain.\n\nThe new technique refines the art of opening the barrier: it uses microcatheters \u2014 fine, highly flexible tubes that are inserted into an artery in the groin and then threaded up into tiny blood vessels nearly anywhere in the brain \u2014 to spray chemotherapy directly onto tumors or areas from which they have been removed. The catheters are normally used to deliver clot-dissolving drugs to the brain to treat strokes.\n\n\u201cThis will substantially alter the way that chemotherapy is given in the future,\u201d said Dr. John Boockvar, the brain surgeon who devised the trial. \u201cBut we have to prove that at certain doses, nobody gets hurt.\u201d\n\nReferring to glioblastoma patients, Dr. Riina said, \u201cEveryone is looking for something to do for these people.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if you buy someone just a year, that could be a wedding or a graduation,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou never know what might happen in the year they hold onto.\u201d\n\nThe study, which began in August, is still in its earliest phase, meaning its main goal is to measure safety, not efficacy \u2014 to find out if it is safe to spray Avastin directly into brain arteries and at what dose. Nonetheless, the doctors were pleased when M.R.I. scans of the first few patients showed that the treatment seemed to erase any sign of recurring glioblastomas. But how long the effect will last remains to be seen.\n\nDespite a beautiful scan, the first patient who was treated died in October, from pneumonia and the spread of glioblastoma to his brainstem.\n\nInnovations are desperately needed to make headway against glioblastoma, which is \u201cone of the most deadly tumors that exist in humans,\u201d said Dr. Russell Lonser, chairman of surgical neurology at the National Institutes of Health.\n\n\u201cThis is a very good start,\u201d Dr. Lonser said. \u201cThe early data is very interesting and exciting.\u201d\n\nThe complexity of a study like this goes beyond the science. Clinical trials are also a complicated pact, emotionally and ethically, between desperate patients and doctors who must balance their ambition as researchers against their duty as clinicians, and must walk a fine line between offering too much hope and not enough.\n\n\u201cI tell patients, \u2018I\u2019m going to try to cure your disease, but so far glioblastoma is an incurable disease,\u2019 \u201d Dr. Boockvar said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic,\u201d Mr. Sugrue said one morning in September, after scheduling a second brain operation. But he had tears in his eyes.\n\nThere are about 10,000 new cases of glioblastoma a year in the United States, mostly in people over 45. The tumors are notorious for growing back like weeds even after being cut out and blasted with chemotherapy and radiation, and they are nearly always fatal. With the best treatment, the median survival time is about 15 months.\n\nBut in the last five years, the number of patients who survive 2 years has increased to 25 percent, from 8 percent, largely because doctors began using a chemotherapy pill called temozolomide, or Temodar, along with radiation (Temodar is believed to seep through the blood-brain barrier).\n\nDr. Boockvar said he thought that if he could just keep patients alive for two years, more advances might come along and give them time.\n\n\u201cThe glioblastoma population is very studyable, unfortunately, because the prognosis is so grim,\u201d he said.\n\nPatients often wind up on the front lines of research, figuring they have little to lose and hoping they will be lucky enough to test the big breakthrough. More than 500 studies for people with glioblastoma are listed on the government Web site www.clinicaltrials.gov.\n\nMr. Sugrue, who lives in Stamford, Conn., with his wife, Donna, and their children Molly and Tim, began having headaches in April. He thought he had a sinus problem. But a scan found a brain tumor nearly the size of a golf ball. A local doctor referred him to Dr. Boockvar. He had the standard treatment: surgery, temozolomide pills and six weeks of radiation, which ended on June 25.\n\nBy July, an ominous bright spot on his M.R.I. scan suggested that the tumor might already be growing back. He continued chemotherapy, but the spot kept enlarging.\n\nBy mid-September, the Sugrues were back in Dr. Boockvar\u2019s office to plan their next step. Stubbly hair was growing in on Mr. Sugrue\u2019s scalp, except for a bare patch, around an arcing scar above his right ear. His eyes, bright blue with thick, dark lashes that gave him a boyish look, searched the doctor\u2019s face.\n\nThe headaches had returned. New scans, displayed on a computer screen, showed signs of brain swelling and bright spots that should not have been there. Dr. Boockvar recommended more surgery and then chemotherapy with Avastin, which had recently been approved for recurring glioblastoma.\n\nIt was approved for intravenous use \u2014 to be dripped into a vein, usually in the arm \u2014 but he said Mr. Sugrue would be an ideal candidate for his study, in which the drug would be infused directly into an artery in the brain, producing levels at least 50 times what the intravenous route could achieve. One other patient had been treated that way, and M.R.I. scans showed that recurring tumors seemed to have melted away.\n\nMr. Sugrue said he was all for it, even though Dr. Boockvar warned him that the drug was no magic bullet. Then Dr. Boockvar ticked off the risks from a second brain operation.\n\n\u201cI have to quote you a 5 percent risk you\u2019ll be visibly weak,\u201d he said. \u201cA 1 percent chance of paralysis on the left side.\u201d\n\nMr. Sugrue wiped his eyes and began to apologize for losing his composure, but the surgeon cut him off and said, \u201cIn neurosurgery they say that if you don\u2019t make your patient cry, you haven\u2019t gotten informed consent.\u201d\n\nThe trial grew out of a conversation about a year ago between Dr. Boockvar and Dr. Riina, an expert in using microcatheters to treat strokes.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Why can\u2019t you infuse chemotherapy for my brain tumor patients?\u2019 \u201d Dr. Boockvar recalled. \u201cAnd he said: \u2018I can. Just show me what you want to do.\u2019 \u201d\n\nDr. Riina said, \u201cTechnically, I can go anywhere in your brain.\u201d\n\nHe said microcatheter technology had advanced \u201clight-years\u201d in the last decade and was just waiting for a new drug to come along for glioblastoma.\n\nThey wrote up a plan to test what they called \u201csuperselective intra-arterial cerebral infusion\u201d of Avastin in 30 patients with glioblastomas that had recurred after standard treatment. Each patient would receive just one treatment directed into the brain, followed weeks later by a series of intravenous treatments with Avastin.\n\nTheir study involves a technique first developed about 30 years ago, which uses mannitol to open the blood-brain barrier temporarily to get chemotherapy into the brain. Mannitol pulls water out of the tightly packed cells lining the capillaries so that they shrink and pull away from one another, opening up gaps through which drug molecules can pass into the brain.\n\nThe technique was developed by Dr. Edward A. Neuwelt, a neurosurgeon at Oregon Health Sciences University and the Veterans Affairs Hospital in Portland. Its best results have been in people with a rare type of brain tumor called a primary central nervous system lymphoma. But it has not been helpful with glioblastoma, because until recently there was no chemotherapy to infuse that would have much effect on those tumors.\n\nDr. Neuwelt said that Avastin had helped to renew interest in opening the blood-brain barrier but that researchers disagreed about whether the drug would lend itself to that use.\n\nAvastin starves tumors by blocking the growth of new blood vessels, which they need to survive. Dr. Boockvar said microcatheters should increase the odds of success by delivering a high dose of the drug directly to where it was needed most. Earlier research with other drugs used larger catheters inserted into the carotid arteries, which feed the entire brain \u2014 meaning that the tumor did not receive the most concentrated dose and that healthy brain tissue was exposed to the toxic drugs.\n\nBy mid-November, the researchers had treated five patients, including Mr. Sugrue; they first infused mannitol, waited five minutes and then sprayed in the Avastin. In all the patients\u2019 M.R.I. scans, the telltale bright spots that marked tumor growth faded away after the treatment.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you what it means,\u201d Dr. Boockvar said. \u201cNobody knows.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the death of the first patient was a reminder that glioblastoma can invade other parts of the brain and the spinal fluid and that the highly localized spray of Avastin might miss deadly seeds of cancer.\n\nBut Dr. Boockvar remained hopeful for the remaining patients, describing the scans as \u201castronomically far better than I had anticipated.\u201d\n\nMr. Sugrue was still in the hospital in late September when Dr. Boockvar burst into his room and got him out of bed to look at his own before-and-after scans.\n\n\u201cHe took me to this room with all these computers and said, \u2018I\u2019ve got to show you this,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Sugrue recalled. \u201cThis M.R.I. was a thing of beauty. I\u2019m excited that he\u2019s excited. That means a lot to me.\u201d\n\nDr. Boockvar said: \u201cAvastin may not be the best drug for this delivery technique. What\u2019s exciting about our results is that we\u2019ve proven there is a local effect.\n\n\u201cSuppose someone said, \u2018I have much better drug.\u2019 Now I can say I at least have a delivery system.\u201d\n\nWith patients, Dr. Boockvar tries to walk a fine line, trying to level with them and yet not rob them of all hope. He knows the emotional toll that a cancer diagnosis can take: his own father had leukemia for about eight years and died in September. Mrs. Sugrue said the doctor urged her and her husband to resist doing an Internet search for glioblastoma because they would just read that it was a death sentence.\n\nThey said they tried to follow his advice, but when the subject of prognosis came up in an interview, both had tears in their eyes.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t ask the question if you don\u2019t want the answer,\u201d Mrs. Sugrue said. \u201cWhat will be, will be.

(Jan. 3, 2016) - Deregulation and inhibition of the immune system contributes to cancer development. Many therapeutic strategies aim to re-stimulate the immune system to recognize cancer cells and target them for destruction. Researchers from Moffitt Cancer Center report that a dendritic cell vaccine that targets the HER2 protein on breast cancer cells is safe and effectively stimulates the immune system leading to regression of early-stage breast cancer.\n\nThe HER2 protein is overexpressed in 20-25% of all breast cancer tumors and is associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis. Researchers have previously shown that immune cells are less able to recognize and target cancer cells that express HER2 as breast cancer progresses into a more advanced and invasive stage. This suggests that strategies that can restimulate the immune system to recognize and target HER2 early during cancer development may be effective treatment options.\n\nThe researchers previously developed a vaccine that helps the immune system recognize the HER2 protein on breast cancer cells. Their approach involves creating the vaccine from immune cells called dendritic cells that are harvested from each individual patient to create a personalized vaccine.\n\nIn order to determine if the HER2-dendritic cell vaccine is safe and effective, the researchers performed a clinical trial in 54 women who have HER2-expressing early-stage breast cancer. The dendritic cell vaccines were prepared by isolating dendritic cells from each patients' blood and exposing them to fragments of the HER2 protein. Patients were injected with a dose of their personal dendritic cell vaccine once a week for 6 weeks into either a lymph node, the breast tumor, or into both sites.\n\nThe researchers report that the dendritic cell vaccines were well-tolerated and patients only experienced low-grade toxicities. The most common adverse events were fatigue, injection site reactions, and chills. They also show that the vaccine was able to stimulate an immune response in the majority of the patients. Approximately 80% of evaluable patients had a detectable immune response in their peripheral blood and/or in their sentinel lymph node wherein their cancer is most likely to spread to first. Importantly, the immune responses among the patients were similar, regardless of the route of vaccine administration.\n\nThe Moffitt researchers assessed the effectiveness of the vaccine by determining the percentage of patients who had detectable disease within surgical specimens after resection. The absence of disease is termed a pathological complete response (pCR). They report that 13 patients achieved a pCR and patients who had early non-invasive disease called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) achieved a higher rate of pCR than patients who had early-stage invasive disease. Interestingly, patients who achieved a pCR had a higher immune response within their local sentinel lymph nodes.\n\n\"These results suggest that vaccines are more effective in DCIS, thereby warranting further evaluation in DCIS or other minimal disease settings, and the local regional sentinel lymph node may serve as a more meaningful immunologic endpoint,\" said Brian J. Czerniecki, MD, PhD, Chair of the Department of Breast Oncology at Moffitt Cancer Center.\n\nThe study was published in the December 13th online issue of Clinical Cancer Research and was supported by funds received from R01-CA096997, P30-CA016520, Pennies-in-Action\u00ae, and the Henle Foundation.\n\nMoffitt is dedicated to one lifesaving mission: to contribute to the prevention and cure of cancer.

For example, psoriatic arthritis manifests most often in the lower extremities and is associated with the autoimmune skin condition called psoriasis, in which raised red, scaly patches appear on the skin. Although psoriatic rashes most often precede the onset of the arthritic stage, the reverse can also be the case.\n\nThree of the 10 top-selling drugs in the United States in dollar sales \u2014 adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab \u2014 are biologics prescribed for psoriatic arthritis as well as for the more common rheumatoid arthritis. These three drugs share a common property: They block the action of a pro-inflammatory substance called tumor necrosis factor. Secreted by various immune cells, TNF stimulates the immune response and accompanying inflammation.\n\nHowever, despite the availability of TNF inhibitors, \u201conly about half of psoriatic arthritis patients who are given TNF inhibitors get better,\u201d said Genovese.\n\nAlthough the ultimate cause of the disease remains unknown, there was a good clinical rationale for hoping it might be responsive to ixekizumab. For the last decade or so, Genovese said, another pro-inflammatory substance called IL-17 has been drawing the attention of immunologists focusing on psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.\n\nIxekizumab works by blocking IL-17. The drug, an injectable monoclonal antibody, is already commercially available for the treatment of psoriasis, for which it has been remarkably effective, said Genovese. And in an earlier Lilly-sponsored phase-3 trial, ixekizumab was shown to be effective for psoriatic arthritis patients who had not yet been treated with biologic drugs such as TNF inhibitors. (Another approved monoclonal-antibody that targets IL-17, secukinumab, was approved in 2016 for psoriatic arthritis.)\n\nOver the 24-week duration of the latest trial, 109 participants received ixekizumab every two weeks; 94 received placebo injections every two weeks; and 111 alternated every two weeks between getting injections of ixekizumab and the placebo.

And a new clinical trial suggests they are not just blowing smoke.\n\nThe study, published Monday, found that for 30 MS patients with muscle \u201cspasticity,\u201d a few days of marijuana smoking brought some relief.\n\nBut the big caveat, researchers say, is that it\u2019s not clear that the downsides of pot smoking are worth it.\n\nSome people with MS are already using medical marijuana to treat certain symptoms, including spasticity \u2014 when the muscles in the legs or arms contract painfully, in something akin to a \u201ccharley horse.\u201d\n\nThere is some science behind the idea: The body naturally produces cannabinoids, the group of chemicals found in marijuana. And studies have suggested the cannabinoid receptors on our cells help regulate muscle spasticity.\n\nBut the evidence that pot smoking actually helps with spasticity has been anecdotal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard from patients that marijuana helps their spasticity, but I think a lot us thought, \u2018Well, it\u2019s probably just making you feel good,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Jody Corey-Bloom, the lead researcher on the new study.\n\n\u201cI think this study shows that yes, (marijuana) may help with spasticity, but at a cost,\u201d said Corey-Bloom, of the University of California, San Diego.\n\nThe cost, her team found, is that smoking caused fatigue and dizziness in some users, and generally slowed down people\u2019s mental skills soon after they used marijuana.\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear if that would have any long-term consequences, Corey-Bloom said.\n\nAbout 400,000 people in the United States have MS, a chronic disease in which the protective coating around nerve fibers starts breaking down.\n\nThe new study, reported in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, included 30 MS patients with muscle spasticity that had failed to get better with standard medication.\n\nCorey-Bloom\u2019s team had each patient smoke marijuana or \u201cplacebo\u201d joints \u2014 which looked, smelled and tasted like the real thing, but lacked the active ingredient in marijuana, known as THC.\n\nEach patient smoked marijuana once a day for three days and used the placebo cigarette once a day on three separate days. Before and after each treatment, an independent rater assessed the patients\u2019 muscle spasticity.\n\nOverall, the study found, measures of spasticity dropped an average of three points \u2014about 30 percent \u2014 on a 24-point scale when patients smoked marijuana, but didn\u2019t change after they smoked the placebo.\n\nThe issue of treating spasticity is \u201ccertainly an important one,\u201d said Nicholas LaRocca, vice president of healthcare delivery and policy research at the National MS Society.\n\n\u201cSpasticity is a big problem for many people with MS, and the current medications don\u2019t necessarily work for everyone,\u201d said LaRocca, who was not involved in the new study.\n\n\u201cBut smoking marijuana does not appear to be a long-term solution, because of the cognitive effects,\u201d he told Reuters Health.\n\nPeople with MS are already at some risk of \u201ccognitive changes,\u201d LaRocca pointed out, so the potential for lasting effects from long-term marijuana smoking is a concern.\n\nHowever, LaRocca said, researchers are developing cannabinoid-based medications for MS. That includes a cannabinoid mouth spray called Sativex that has been approved in the UK, Canada, Spain and New Zealand to treat MS-related spasticity.\n\nResearch into cannabinoids and spasticity should continue, LaRocca said, because medications may be able to harness the benefits of specific cannabis compounds, without the side effects linked to smoking pot.\n\nBoth LaRocca and Corey-Bloom said there were limitations to the current study.\n\n\u201cBlinding\u201d people as to whether they are on marijuana or a placebo is tough since the drug creates a \u201chigh\u201d feeling.\n\nIn this study, 17 of 30 patients were able to correctly guess whether they were using marijuana or a placebo at each of their six visits with the researchers. And the rest often guessed correctly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that the patients were not really blinded,\u201d LaRocca said. \u201cWhat effects that might have had on the results is unclear.\u201d\n\nCorey-Bloom said that should not have influenced the spasticity findings, since an independent researcher (who didn\u2019t know whether patients were smoking marijuana or the placebo) rated spasticity using a standard scale.\n\nBut another limitation, she pointed out, is that the study looked at the effects, and side effects, of marijuana over only a few days. \u201cWe can\u2019t say anything about long-term effects,\u201d Corey-Bloom told Reuters Health.\n\nFor now, LaRocca recommended that people with spasticity see a doctor experienced in treating MS. And if you\u2019re on an anti-spasticity medication and it\u2019s not working well enough, or the side effects are too much, tell your doctor, he said.\n\nFor some people, a change in the medication dose might help.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story explained that some people with MS are already using medical marijuana to treat certain symptoms.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "WEDNESDAY, July 6, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- For the millions of Americans with chronic low back pain, a silver bullet to alleviate the condition has yet to be identified, a new study suggests.\n\nReviewing 26 studies comparing spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) to other treatments such as medication, exercise or physical therapy, researchers from the Netherlands found that SMT appears to be no better or worse than other options at relieving back pain long-term.\n\nThe analyses indicated that SMT -- which involves manual manipulation of the spine and surrounding muscles -- has only a short-term impact on pain relief, although it eases pain faster than other treatments.\n\n\"In short, no single therapy is better than another, although some individuals are likely to have more success with one therapy than another,\" said study author Sidney Rubinstein, a research fellow at VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam.\n\n\"Current studies are focusing on which subjects are more likely to benefit from spinal manipulation, exercise, or other therapies,\" he added. \"Spinal manipulation should be considered a viable treatment option for those with non-specific, chronic low back pain.\"\n\nThe study was recently published in the journal Spine.\n\nMore than 6,000 patients were included in the compilation of results, which the study authors said were sparse in data indicating participants' overall recovery, quality of life and ability to return to work. The studies also varied in quality, with only nine of 26 considered \"low [in] bias,\" according to background information accompanying the study.\n\nIn all evaluations, patients were randomly assigned to SMT or another comparison treatment, including active treatments such as exercise or inactive placebo treatments.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the studies were not included in a previous review published in 2004, and all patients had suffered from lower back pain for 12 weeks or longer.\n\nWhile chiropractors often perform SMT on patients, it is also administered by physical therapists and osteopaths. But which treatment is right for any patient depends not only on their specific pain, but their doctor's recommendations and their own comfort level with various options, said Stephen Perle, a spokesman for the American Chiropractic Association.\n\nThe cost of SMT sessions varies widely depending on the region, Perle said.\n\n\"Nobody has the answer at this time,\" Perle said. \"I guess people in almost every profession like to say, 'We have a compelling treatment and it will work almost every time,' but that's just not the case.\"\n\n\"With low back pain, there are many reasons people don't get better,\" added Perle, also a professor of clinical sciences in the College of Chiropractic at the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut. \"So the finding was not unexpected.\"\n\nAn unrelated study of 401 patients with low back pain, published July 5 in Annals of Internal Medicine, suggested that massage may be better than medication or exercise for short-term pain relief.\n\nSeattle researchers found that those who received either relaxation massage or structural massage, which involved manipulation of muscles and ligaments, had less pain and better functioning for up to a year compared to those getting \"usual medical care,\" which included medication and physical therapy.\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more information about low back pain.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The article gets a \u201csatisfactory\u201d because it pointed out that manipulation is commonly performed by multiple healthcare professions. \u00a0It would have been useful to mention that manipulation is not routinely available in conventional primary care medical settings.\u00a0 And despite its evidence record, it does not generally enjoy completely consistent insurance coverage.\u00a0 The same points apply to massage.\n \n", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Surgery for a painful, common back condition known as spinal stenosis resulted in significantly reduced back pain and better physical function than treatment with drugs and physical therapy, according to the latest findings from a large federally funded research effort.\n\nThe results from the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial, or Sport, echo findings it reported last April involving degenerative spondylolisthesis, another common spinal problem.

These set out what is currently known about golf's associations with health; the factors that may help or hinder take-up of the sport; and a series of recommendations for golfers, industry leaders, and policy makers on how best to maximise its health benefits, promote sustainability, and widen participation.\n\nThe evidence shows that playing golf regularly is associated with longevity and reducing the risk factors for heart disease/stroke. And it can boost older people's strength and balance.\n\nThe sport is also associated with good mental health and improving the overall health of those with disabilities.\n\nCompared with other sports, the risk of injury is moderate, but as it's an outdoor activity, golfers may be more at risk of skin cancer.\n\nGolf is sociable, and gets people outdoors, connecting with nature. It can provide moderate intensity aerobic physical activity, and its health benefits are greatest for players (and spectators) who walk round the course rather than opt for a golf cart.\n\nWhile around 60 million people play golf at least twice every year, the participant profile is quite narrow: players tend to be middle aged to older, male, of white European heritage, relatively well off, and living in North America, Europe, and Australasia.\n\nAnd the sport is often perceived as expensive, male dominated, difficult to learn, and not a game for the young or those on the lower rungs of the social ladder.\n\nThis can put people off, says the statement. The sport needs to be more inclusive and welcoming of people from all walks of life and ethnic backgrounds, and any such initiatives should be supported, it says.\n\nMore people might be keen to take it up if golf were promoted as an enjoyable, lifelong outdoors activity that affords a sense of community and competitive challenge while providing some 'me time' as well as helping to fulfil recommended exercise quotas, says the statement.\n\nAnd the sport can do its bit for sustainability by \"practices that prioritise diversity, healthy societies, connection with, and care of, the environment, environmental integrity and health and wellbeing,\" the statement suggests.\n\nAmong its raft of recommendations, the consensus statement says that:\n\u2022 Should aim to play for 150 minutes/week, or do less, but couple golf with other physical activity, and walk the course rather than ride a golf cart\n\u2022 Do warm-up/strengthening exercises to cut the risk of injury and use sun-cream and wear collared shirts/blouses to minimise the risk of skin cancer\n\u2022 Build on existing initiatives to promote inclusivity and develop environments and price structures that will be attractive to everyone\n\u2022 Develop a culture that will inspire more women and girls to play golf\n\u2022 Make every effort to promote equality and diversity, and boost accessibility\n\u2022 Promote sustainability through wildlife conservation and by restricting the use of water, energy, and pesticides\n\u2022 Provide additional facilities at clubs, such as a gym, walking routes, cr\u00e8ches and improve the focus on health and safety, with the provision of healthy foods, defibrillators, and speed limiters on golf carts, for example\n\u2022 Promote the benefits of regular physical activity, including golf, for people of all ages, genders, and income brackets\n\u2022 Work with industry and national associations to boost take up of the sport, particularly in groups where physical activity levels are low\n\u2022 Work with industry and regulatory bodies to get golf included in the Paralympics\n\n\"These outputs, if widely shared and adopted, will contribute to an improved understanding of golf and health, and aid these groups in making evidence-informed decisions and to improve health and wellbeing,\" the consensus statement concludes.", "question": "Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Golf is widely available worldwide.

Our results could help millions of people globally reduce their blood pressure and reduce their risk of heart attack or stroke.\"\n\nThe researchers tested an entirely new way of treating hypertension by giving patients three drugs, each at half dose, in a single pill for early treatment of high blood pressure. Traditionally patients begin treatment with one drug at a very low dose, which is increased over time with additional drugs added and increased in dosage to try to reach target.\n\nDr Webster added: \"Patients are brought back at frequent intervals to see if they are meeting their targets with multiple visits required to tailor their treatments and dosage. This is not only time inefficient, it's costly. We also know that many doctors and patients find it too complicated and often don't stick to the process. This new approach is much simpler and it works.\"\n\nThe trial, which was conducted in Sri Lanka, enrolled 700 patients with an average age of 56 and blood pressure of 154/90 mm Hg.\n\nPatients were randomly assigned to receive either the combination pill or usual care - their doctor's choice of blood pressure lowering medication. The Triple Pill, consisted of the blood pressure medications telmisartan (20 mg), amlodipine (2.5 mg), and chlorthalidone (12.5 mg).\n\nCompared with patients receiving usual care, a significantly higher proportion of patients receiving the Triple Pill achieved their target blood pressure of 140/90 or less (with lower targets of 130/80 for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease).\n\nAt six months, 83 percent of participants in the Triple Pill group were still receiving the combination pill compared to the majority of patients in the usual-care group still receiving only one and only one third receiving two or more blood-pressure-lowering drugs.\n\nProfessor Anushka Patel, Principal Investigator of the trial and Chief Scientist at The George Institute, said this was big improvement. \"The World Heart Federation has set an ambitious goal that by 2025 there will be a 25 per cent reduction in blood pressure levels globally. The Triple Pill could be a low cost way of helping countries around the world to meet this target.\n\n\"This study has global relevance. While the most pressing need, from the perspective of the global burden of disease, is low-and middle-income countries, it's equally relevant in a country like Australia where we're still achieving only 40%-50% control rates for high blood pressure.\"\n\nThe George Institute is now looking at strategies to maximise uptake of the study results.

For the most advanced patients, 50 percent survival was the norm, whether patients had surgery to totally remove the voice box or alternative treatment with chemotherapy and radiation to try to avoid surgery.\n\nBut the head and neck oncology team at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center came up with a different approach: Give patients a single dose of chemotherapy and see who responds to it. The responders can continue with combination chemotherapy and radiation. The non-responders can be referred immediately for surgery.\n\nAfter a decade of using this approach, researchers are reporting \"exceptional\" survival rates nearing 80 percent, even for the most advanced patients. The team published their outcomes in JAMA Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery.\n\n\"In trying to match the biology of the tumor to the treatment, all of the patients get better outcomes,\" says study author Gregory T. Wolf, M.D., professor and chair emeritus of otolaryngology - head and neck surgery at Michigan Medicine.\n\n\"This approach allows us to enhance quality of life for all of our patients. Many patients can spare their voice box by having chemotherapy and radiation. But that's only good if the treatment works. For patients who must go on to receive surgery, by selecting them up front, we can spare them the complications that may occur when the voice box is removed following multiple cycles of chemotherapy with radiation,\" adds study author Francis Worden, M.D., professor of hematology/oncology.\n\nThe Michigan Medicine team first tested the idea in 1995. They found that patients whose tumor shrunk by more than half after one round of chemotherapy were more likely to do well with chemotherapy and radiation and have an excellent chance of saving their voice box. If the tumor did not respond after that first dose, patients would likely fail on the chemotherapy and would do better going straight to surgery.\n\nIn a clinical trial, they saw disease-specific survival rates of 80 percent in patients with advanced disease. This was unheard of. And it wasn't just those who responded to the chemotherapy. The non-responders who were immediately referred for surgery had better outcomes too.\n\n\"We adopted the treatment approach and started offering it to all our laryngeal cancer patients,\" Wolf says. As part of a Specialized Program of Research Excellence, or SPORE, grant, the team was already maintaining long-term follow-up data on patients. Wolf suggested they look back and see if they were still maintaining such strong outcomes with this approach. The results surprised even him.\n\nOver 10 years, 153 stage 3 and 4 laryngeal cancer patients were treated at Michigan Medicine, with about half receiving the induction chemotherapy. The remainder elected to proceed straight to surgery or chemo-radiation without the induction dose.\n\nAverage disease specific survival at five years for the induction chemotherapy patients was 79 percent - equivalent to the results in patients with early stage disease, and significantly better than the 66 percent survival for patients who had chemo-radiation without the induction strategy.\n\n\"This adds ammunition to the idea that we need to pick individual therapies more carefully. Both chemo-radiation and surgery are difficult treatments with their share of challenging long-term effects. But if we tailor treatments to the individual biology of the tumor and characteristics of the patient, we'll get the best results,\" Wolf says.\n\nThe study did find lower functional preservation of the larynx in the induction chemotherapy group compared to those who elected chemoradiation. Two-thirds of the induction group achieved organ preservation, while more than three-quarters of the chemo-radiation patients did.\n\nWolf notes, however, that chemoradiation often severely damages the larynx, which may cause problems with eating or swallowing years later.\n\nThe induction approach can be done anywhere, but requires intense collaboration among surgeons, medical oncologists and radiation oncologists. All three must be involved to assess the patient and refer to the appropriate therapy.\n\nEven that single dose of chemotherapy can be debilitating and toxic for some patients.

(Table sugar, or sucrose, extracted from sugar cane or sugar beets, is a compound of glucose and fructose.) Researchers also took blood samples to measure levels of glucose, fructose and insulin, and of leptin and ghrelin, enzymes involved in controlling hunger and feelings of fullness.\n\nBefore having their drinks, the participants rated their desire to eat on a one-to-10 scale from \u201cnot at all\u201d to \u201cvery much.\u201d Then they drank the liquids and had functional magnetic resonance imaging brain scans while looking at images of food and of neutral objects like buildings or baskets. As they did so, they rated their hunger using the scale. The volunteers were then presented with images of high-calorie foods and asked whether they would like to have the food now, or a monetary award a month later instead.\n\nThe study, published in the journal PNAS, found that compared with glucose, consuming fructose produced greater responses to food cues in the orbital frontal cortex of the brain, a region that plays an important role in reward processing. The fructose drink also produced greater activity in the visual cortex when volunteers looked at images of food, a finding that suggests increased craving compared with glucose.\n\nWhen choosing between tasty high-calorie food or a delayed monetary reward, fructose drinkers were more likely than glucose drinkers to choose the food.\n\nThere was no difference in leptin or ghrelin levels between fructose and glucose drinkers. But plasma insulin response was sharply lower in fructose drinkers, which may affect what we eat, according to the senior author, Dr. Kathleen A. Page, an assistant professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California.\n\n\u201cInsulin is released when we consume glucose,\u201d she said. \u201cThe pancreas secretes insulin, and insulin drives glucose into cells so that it can be used for energy.

The participants had all been in monogamous relationships with female partners between the ages of 18 and 38 for at least a year. The men underwent testing to ensure they had a normal sperm count at the start of the study.\n\nThe men received injections of 200 milligrams of a long-acting progestogen called norethisterone enanthate (NET-EN) and 1,000 milligrams of a long-acting androgen called testosterone undecanoate (TU) for up to 26 weeks to suppress their sperm counts. Healthcare professionals gave the men two injections every eight weeks. Participants initially provided semen samples after eight and 12 weeks in the suppression phase and then every 2 weeks until they met the criteria for the next phase. During this time, the couples were instructed to use other non-hormonal birth control methods.\n\nOnce a participant's sperm count was lowered to less than 1 million/ml in two consecutive tests, the couple was asked to rely on the injections for birth control. During this period known as the efficacy phase of the study, the men continued to receive injections every eight weeks for up to 56 weeks. Participants provided semen samples every eight weeks to ensure their sperm counts stayed low. Once the participants stopped receiving the injections, they were monitored to see how quickly their sperm counts recovered.\n\nThe hormones were effective in reducing the sperm count to 1 million/ml or less within 24 weeks in 274 of the participants. The contraceptive method was effective in nearly 96 percent of continuing users. Only four pregnancies occurred among the men's partners during the efficacy phase of the study.\n\nResearchers stopped enrolling new participants in the study in 2011 due to the rate of adverse events, particularly depression and other mood disorders, reported by the participants. The men reported side effects including injection site pain, muscle pain, increased libido and acne. Twenty men dropped out of the study due to side effects.\n\nDespite the adverse effects, more than 75 percent of participants reported being willing to use this method of contraception at the conclusion of the trial.\n\nOf the 1,491 reported adverse events, nearly 39 percent were found to be unrelated to the contraceptive injections. These included one death by suicide which was assessed not to be related to the use of the drug. Serious adverse events that were assessed as probably or possibly related to the study included one case of depression, one intentional overdose of acetaminophen, and a man who experienced an abnormally fast and irregular heartbeat after he stopped receiving the injections.\n\n\"More research is needed to advance this concept to the point that it can be made widely available to men as a method of contraception,\" Festin said. \"Although the injections were effective in reducing the rate of pregnancy, the combination of hormones needs to be studied more to consider a good balance between efficacy and safety.\"\n\nThe study, \"Efficacy and Safety of an Injectable Combination Hormonal Contraceptive for Men,\" will be published online at http://press. , ahead of print.\n\nOther authors of the study include: Hermann M.

About two-thirds of breast cancers are hormone sensitive.\n\nIf approved, Tykerb \u2013 known as Tyverb in Europe \u2013 will be used along with another drug that prevents hormones from making cancer cells multiply.\n\nNormally women with advanced, hormone-sensitive breast cancer get a hormonal drug \u2013 one that blocks estrogen from attaching to cell receptors and making cancer cells multiply \u2013 along with chemotherapy.\n\nBut chemotherapy medicines, which often are given intravenously, attack healthy cells as well as cancerous ones, causing nasty side effects such as vomiting and hair loss that limit how much of those medicines can be given.\n\nIn addition, \"at a certain point in time, the cells don't respond anymore to the hormonal therapy,\" said Dr. Debasish Roychowdhury, head of oncology medicines development at GlaxoSmithKline.\n\nTykerb works by attaching to two other cell receptors and ultimately making the cells die or stop multiplying. It targets cancer cells more than healthy ones, Roychowdhury said. That can mean fewer side effects, although Tykerb can damage the liver and harm a fetus.\n\nA study GlaxoSmithKline presented in December found that in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer Tykerb, along with the hormonal treatment Femara, increased average survival without the cancer worsening from about three months to just over eight months, compared to women who got Femara pills alone.\n\nCopyright 2009 The Associated Press.

But a team from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City said the technology could help identify cases where prostate cancer has spread to the bone.\n\nRadiotracers work by injecting a small amount of a compound tagged with a radionuclide into patients. Using positron emission tomography -- also known as a PET scan -- doctors are then able to better visualize tumors and tumor spread.\n\nIn studies involving mice with prostate cancer, the researchers had the radiotracer hone in on prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the same prostate cancer marker used in the PSA test. They found that the PSA gravitated to tissues containing prostate cancer that had already grown resistant to standard hormone-based therapies.\n\nThe study also revealed the radiotracer could help identify cases where prostate cancer had spread to the bone. The researchers pointed out traditional bone scans are unable to differentiate between malignant and nonmalignant lesions.\n\nThe findings were to be presented Saturday at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting in Chicago, and are also being published in Cancer Discovery.\n\nIf used on people, the researchers claimed that the radiotracer might someday help doctors \"personalize\" treatment strategies for prostate cancer and better manage the disease.\n\n\"The ultimate goal is to be able to predict the response of patients to new and existing therapies at an early stage, thereby personalizing their treatment and improving outcomes,\" Michael J. Evans, research fellow in the Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, explained in meeting news release.\n\nEncouraged by their findings, the study's authors said they hope to begin a human trial next year.\n\nTwo prostate cancer experts said the tool, if borne out in patients, could prove very useful.\n\nDr. Michael Schwartz is director of laparoscopy and minimally invasive surgery at North Shore-LIJ Health System in Lake Success, N.Y. He noted that, as of now, doctors typically rely on results of the PSA blood test and/or standard diagnostic scans to help guide treatment decisions.\n\nBoth methods have their limits and, \"while this study is very preliminary, if this radiotracer technology can prove to detect very early recurrence or metastasis in human patients, it could become extremely useful in either the pre- or post-treatment setting in selecting a treatment algorithm,\" Schwartz said. \"It also may help reduce the need for biopsy of possible metastatic lesions.\"\n\nDr. Erik Goluboff, an attending urologist at Beth Israel Medical Center, New York City, agreed that, \"this is an exciting study using a novel radiotracer to detect PSA-expressing tissues throughout the body.\"\n\nHe believes that the new tool's \"greatest strength would be in monitoring changes in PSA expression in tissues as a result of various treatments. If a treatment showed a marked change, it could continue to be used in that patient, hence \"personalized\" medicine. If a specific change did not occur, that treatment could be abandoned and another tried instead. Since these changes could not be detected based on a PSA blood test alone, this new test would be very helpful in determining early on which therapy to choose in a given patient.\"\n\nHowever, Goluboff also noted that research from animal-based studies does not always pan out in humans and \"further, larger studies are of course required to confirm these findings.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute provides more information on prostate cancer.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story stated that the researchers \u201chope to begin a human trial next year.\u201d", "answer": 1}, {"article": "(Reuters Health) - New data from centers that aggressively treat short-term \u201cmini-strokes\u201d offer new evidence that quick action can cut the odds of a serious stroke in half.\n\nThe findings, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, are more evidence of the benefits of sending someone to a hospital even if muscle weakness or slurred speech has only lasted for a few seconds, lead author Dr. Pierre Amarenco of Bichat Hospital in Paris told Reuters Health by phone.\n\nThat\u2019s because mini-strokes, also known as transient ischemic attacks or TIAs, are often the harbinger of a potentially-deadly stroke that can come within a matter of hours or days.\n\n\u201cYou should worry about symptoms even if they last for just a few seconds or a few minutes,\u201d Amarenco said.\n\n\u201cThe study showed that the widespread, systematic implementation of specialized TIA units across multiple sites, countries, and continents can make a difference in the care of these patients,\u201d write Drs.

Under previous therapies, none had shown progress.\n\nThis success, in a small study designed as a pilot to test the safety of the technique, suggests larger trials will confirm the effectiveness of the deep brain stimulation (DBS) device, the researchers wrote in the medical journal The Lancet.\n\nAnorexia has one of the highest mortality rates of any psychiatric disorder and is among the most common psychiatric disorders in girls aged between 15 and 19 years. Symptoms include deliberate weight loss induced and sustained by the patient, and a need to control calorie intake and output.\n\nTreatment usually focuses on changing behaviour, but experts say up to 20 percent of patients get no benefit from such treatments and are at risk of dying prematurely.\n\nCommenting on the results of this small trial, Janet Treasure and Ulrike Schmidt of King\u2019s College London\u2019s Institute of Psychiatry said the technique looked promising and would give hope to patients with especially pernicious forms of anorexia.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the procedure was associated ... with improvements in affective and obsessional symptoms is of key importance,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201c(This) will go some way towards reassuring patients that DBS is not just another treatment designed to fatten them up without making them feel better.\u201d\n\nDBS is used to treat several neurological illnesses including Parkinson\u2019s disease and chronic pain. Scientists are also investigating its use in depression and epilepsy, but this was the first time it had been used in patients with anorexia.\n\nImplanting the DBS device requires minimally invasive surgery which can be completely reversed if problems occur, the researchers said.\n\nFor their study, a team at the Krembil Neuroscience Centre and University Health Network in Canada identified an area of the brain known to be important when using DBS in depression.\n\nThey implanted electrodes into the area and connected them to a pulse generator under the skin. The devices were activated 10 days later and researchers measured changes in the patients\u2019 mood and anxiety to help find the correct level of stimulation.\n\nThe patients, all women, were aged between 24 and 57 and had had anorexia for between four and 37 years.\n\nInitially all six lost weight, but researchers said this was expected since studies of DBS in patients with depression also found a delay of a few months before treatment starts to work.\n\nThree months after treatment, the weight loss began to reverse in some patients, and after nine months, three patients weighed more than before treatment - the longest period of sustained weight increase since they had become ill. Around half also had better moods and less obsessive-compulsive behaviour.\n\nAndres Lozano, who led the study, said the results were encouraging because they pointed to a genuine therapeutic effect, rather than a placebo or hunger-increasing effect.\n\nHe also said the improvements in mood and anxiety even in patients who were still underweight were \u201cespecially striking\u201d given that severely anorexic patients did not respond well to conventional medicines or psychotherapies.

Hormone treatment gives the body a smoother landing from menopause to post-menopause.\n\nBut in 2002, when concerns were raised by a set of studies by the Women\u2019s Health Initiative of the National Institutes of Health showing hormones correlated with elevated breast cancer, heart disease and stroke risk, women and their doctors hit the brakes.\n\nFor most women, menopausal symptoms degrade quality of life for at least some amount of time, maybe two years, maybe as long as 12. Even after the Women\u2019s Health Initiative news broke, some women couldn\u2019t face the changes without hormone treatment.\n\nNow doctors are once again saying they shouldn\u2019t have to.\n\nThe difference? For one thing, the conclusions of the study have been discredited by subsequent studies. Many women in the Women\u2019s Health Initiative study were well past menopause, were obese or were smokers and therefore already at risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nFor another, the formulations used were less safe in their dosage, mix of hormones and delivery method (pills, which travel through the liver and can cause clots).\n\nThe sheer number of choices today and the need for a thorough initial health assessment make the decision on hormone therapy highly dependent on close communication between a woman and her doctor, experts say.\n\n\u201cSome women need higher doses, some need lower doses. Once a woman is educated, then she knows what to go in and ask for.

But the jury's still out as to how worthwhile the extra technology is overall.\n\nFor one thing, computer-aided detection (CAD) increases the amount of diagnostic testing among women who turn out not to have breast cancer. And the technology makes mammograms more expensive.\n\nCAD is becoming more widespread, said Dr. Joshua Fenton, an associate professor of family and community medicine at the University of California, Davis, and lead study author. \"It's an add-on and now is used in probably three-quarters of U.S. mammograms,\" he said.\n\nComputer-aided detection systems use a digitized mammogram image from either a traditional film mammogram or a digitally acquired mammogram, according to the American College of Radiology. The CAD software looks for areas that may indicate cancer so the radiologist can then look more closely at the mammogram.\n\nAlthough it has rapidly become part of mammogram screening, Fenton said there is limited and conflicting research on its effect.\n\nUnder Medicare payment rates, doctors get an additional $11 for adding computer-aided detection to a mammogram, said Fenton, citing Medicare data. The Medicare rate for a film mammogram is $81 while a digital mammogram is $139.\n\nHis team evaluated more than 409,000 mammograms -- with and without computer-aided detection -- from more than 163,000 women aged 67 to 89. The study is published in the April 16 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nFenton took data from a large U.S. epidemiology database from 2001 to 2006. During that time, computer-aided detection use increased from 3.6 percent to 60.5 percent. Now, with about 75 percent of mammograms adding it, it is even more common, Fenton said.\n\n\"In our study, we assessed its impact in the Medicare program,\" he said. The researchers compared the results when mammograms included CAD to when they did not.\n\nWhen computer-aided detection was used, doctors found a greater number of early cancers known as ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS. \"But the [overall] rate of invasive breast cancer diagnosis was no different with or without CAD,\" Fenton said.\n\nHowever, among the women who did have invasive cancer, computer-aided detection was linked with a greater likelihood of finding the cancer while it was stage 1 or 2 compared to stage 3 or 4, they found.\n\n\"CAD was also associated with increased diagnostic testing among women who turned out not to have breast cancer,\" he said. These women, because breast cancer was suspected, had to be called back for additional tests, such as repeat mammograms or biopsies.\n\nSo is the new computer technology worth it? \"Our study doesn't answer that question; it raises that question,\" Fenton said. The findings, he said, are a mix of potential good news and not so good. The additional tests that turn out to be unnecessary, because no cancer is found, are not desirable, he said.\n\nSome of the very early cancers diagnosed in older women, he noted, may not have caused them a problem during their lifetime. But doctors can't say with certainty which ones will progress and which ones will not.\n\n\"Women should recognize that CAD comes with some potential risks,\" Fenton said. \"It has the potential risk of a false-positive mammogram. If you are an older woman, [there is] the risk of overtreatment of noninvasive lesions.\"\n\nDr. Daniel Kopans, a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School and senior radiologist in the breast imaging division at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the study provides additional information to doctors and women, but has some limitations. He was not involved with the study.\n\n\"The good news is the use of CAD was related to finding invasive cancers at smaller sizes and earlier stages than before the CAD era,\" said Kopans, also a member of the American College of Radiology's Breast Imaging Commission. \"There should be no argument that finding invasive cancers at a smaller size and earlier stage is beneficial,\" he said, as they are more likely to be cured.\n\nWhile he calls finding more DCIS with computer-aided detection also ''likely a good thing,\" he acknowledged the debate about the possibility that a very early cancer in an elderly woman may not cause a problem in her lifetime. Although the treatment of DCIS is debated among experts, Kopans said, \"In my mind, it is always worth it to find additional cancers.\"\n\nOne limitation of the study, he said, is that the researchers cannot say for sure it was the computer-aided detection that made the difference. Other factors could have played a role, such as the radiologists becoming more experienced, he said.\n\nTo learn more about mammography, visit the American College of Radiology/Radiological Society of North America.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Early in the article, the study author is quoted observing that \u201cIt\u2019s an add-on and now is used in probably three-quarters of U.S. mammograms.\u201d\nWomen would have to ask if CAD is being used to read their mammograms.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Newswise \u2014 Johns Hopkins Medicine specialists report they have developed a urine test for the likely emergence of cervical cancer that is highly accurate compared to other tests based on genetic markers derived directly from cervical tissue.\n\nThe new urine test, they say, is different because it analyzes not only multiple sources of human cellular DNA altered by precancerous changes, but also DNA from HPV that is sexually transmitted and causes virtually all cases of the disease.\n\nIn a proof-of-concept study, described online in Cancer Prevention Research on November 8, the investigators say their genetic markers test showed a \"sensitivity\" or accuracy rate of 90.9 percent in identifying so-called CIN2 lesions -- cervical lesions with abnormal cells likely to not only develop into cancer, but also to develop into cancers likely to spread. Additionally, they demonstrated that the DNA for all three human genes and one viral gene could be successfully extracted from urine, and they could identify such lesions with 75 percent sensitivity.\n\nTwo commercial tests based on markers of DNA chemical changes called methylation, released in Europe last summer, require Pap smears or swabs of cervical tissue, and show 64 percent sensitivity in identifying similar lesions, according to senior investigator Rafael Guerrero-Preston, Dr.P.H., M.P.H., assistant professor of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and member of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center.\n\n\"If further studies confirm these findings, we see a significant use of urine screening as a way to quickly and inexpensively determine if a biopsy is warranted, or if physicians can use a 'watch and wait' approach before intervening,\" says Guerrero-Preston. Typically, he says, a woman who tests positive for HPV and has an abnormal Pap smear undergoes a biopsy to rule out cervical cancer using cells taken directly from cervical tissue. But previous studies suggest more than 50 percent of these biopsies are unnecessary and can result in pain, worry, infertility and higher health care costs.\n\n\"Our urine test would serve as a molecular triage,\" he says, \"at times supplementing Pap test information. In developing countries that don't have the money, medical infrastructure or cultural approval for Pap test, our test could be used instead.\"\n\nThe new study builds on the Johns Hopkins team's previously published work, in which investigators identified three genes associated with cervical cancer or abnormal-looking cells known to become cancerous: FKBP6, INTS1 and ZNF516. As abnormalities progress, these genes were more likely to have a chemical methyl group attached to their DNA in certain spots.\n\nThe researchers tested the value of these genes as markers using 214 cervical cell samples collected from women undergoing Pap smears at Hospital Dr. Hernan Henriquez Aravena in Chile. The women ranged in age from 18 to 86. Among the test samples, 34 showed no abnormalities in their cervix; 87 showed one of three types of precancerous, abnormal tissue; and 90 showed clear evidence of cervical cancer.\n\nNext, Guerrero-Preston's team isolated DNA from each cervical tissue sample and used advanced genetic sequencing methods to spell out the DNA makeup of cells in the cervical tissue samples. The researchers then compared the number of methyl groups attached to each gene in samples from the 34 healthy women to 53 samples with a specific subset of precancerous markers.\n\nUsing methylation as a value to diagnose malignancy, the three genes together showed a 90 percent sensitivity, meaning that their presence was able to predict a true positive cancer sample this percentage of the time. The test had an 88.9 percent specificity, meaning the percent of time the test correctly identified someone without the disease.\n\nTo further improve the accuracy of the test, the investigators added a new gene marker to the test. This time, rather than using a human gene, they used one from the virus, HPV16-L1, which also becomes methylated in human cells as cancer develops. They did the test again with the four-gene combination on a new population of women from the University of Puerto Rico. The 115 women ranged in age from 21 to 49; 41 participants had healthy cervical tissue, and 74 had one of three types of precancerous cells. Using all four genes, the test now had a sensitivity of 90.9 percent and a specificity of 60.9 percent.\n\n\"When developing a new cancer screening test, we want something in the range of 90 to 95 percent sensitivity, which is competitive with the effectiveness of tests developed and now marketed in Europe,\" says Guerrero-Preston.\n\nThe next step, the researchers report, was to verify that the four-gene test worked using freely circulating DNA from blood and urine, rather than DNA taken directly from cervical tissue.\n\nFor this experiment, they tested 40 samples of paired cervical tissue, blood and urine from a subset of the patients from Puerto Rico. Using the DNA from blood, they found the test had an 85.7 percent sensitivity and a 60.9 percent specificity. Using urine, they found a 75 percent sensitivity and an 83.3 percent specificity.\n\nDuring the course of the study, the time to process cervical samples, blood or urine and get a test result took four days. They plan to continue modifying the test to improve the urine sensitivity to that of the cervical tissue samples.\n\nAccording to World Cancer Research Fund International, 84 percent of cervical cancers occur in less developed countries, with the highest rates in Africa, Latin American and the Caribbean. In the United States, cervical cancer used to be the highest cause of cancer deaths among women, but that soon changed when the yearly Pap smear was introduced over 40 years ago. Countries without the infrastructure or cultural acceptance for regular Pap tests have not seen declining cancer rates.\n\nGuerrero-Preston and his colleagues have a research agreement with Cepheid to develop a way to reduce the waiting time for a test result from a maximum of four days in the lab to under three hours in a Cepheid instrument using sealed cartridges to minimize sample handling and contamination.\n\nAdditional authors on the study include Blanca Valle, Anne Jedlicka, Nitesh Turaga, Oluwasina Folawiyo, Francesca Pirini, Fahcina Lawson, Angelo Vergura, Maartje Noorhuis, Amanda Dziedzic, Gabriela Perez, Marisa Renehan, Carolina Guerrero-Diaz, Bruce Trock Liliana Florea and David Sidransky of The Johns Hopkins University; Edgar De Jesus Rodriguez, Jose Rodriguez Orengo, Keimari Mendez and Josefina Romaguera of the University of Puerto Rico; and Teresa Diaz-Montes of the Institute for Cancer Care at Mercy.\n\nThe research was funded by National Cancer Institute grants (U01 CA084986, K01 CA164092 and U01 CA084986).", "question": "Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "All depends on a reader\u2019s understanding of the nature of a proof-of-concept study.\u00a0 This urine test is not yet available, but that will be murky to non-specialists unless the term is defined.

This independent, multicenter, blinded study is one of the first studies to validate that a liquid biopsy test can predict therapeutic response and demonstrate a survival benefit. The blood test called, Oncotype DX\u00ae AR-V7 Nucleus Detect\u2122 is commercially available in the U.S. through Epic Science's partnership with Genomic Health, Inc. (NASDAQ: GHDX). The research was published online today in JAMA Oncology.\n\n\"This liquid biopsy test addresses a critical unmet need at a decision point in management to predict and select the therapy that is most likely to extend a patient's life,\" said Howard Scher, M.D., who led the study and is the co-chair, Center for Mechanism Based Therapy and Head of the Biomarker Development Initiative at MSK. \"During the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer, physicians will now be able to use AR-V7 status to determine when a patient's cancer has become resistant to androgen receptor directed therapy and will respond better to chemotherapy, enabling the patient to live longer.\"\n\nThis blinded four-year study followed 142 mCRPC patients who were treated at MSK, The Royal Marsden, or the London Health Sciences Centre. Blood samples were obtained prior to treatment with ARSi therapy or chemotherapy and tested with a validated assay for the nuclear-localized androgen receptor splice variant (AR-V7) protein in circulating tumor cells. The results were that patients positive for AR-V7 who were treated with taxane-based chemotherapy had superior overall survival (OS) relative to those treated with ARSI therapy (median OS, 14.3 vs. 7.3 months). Importantly, patients negative for AR-V7 who were treated with ARSi therapy had superior OS relative to those treated with taxanes (media OS, 19.8 vs. 12.8 months). Additionally, the authors validated the test within a prognostic risk group, to ensure that the biomarker effect was due to the biomarker rather than other clinical variables.\n\n\"We developed this test specifically to address a significant clinical question in metastatic prostate cancer that previously had no clear answer: which treatment should be pursued next? This question weighs heavily on doctors and patients, but now, with the Oncotype DX AR-V7 test, we can provide them the confidence to know whether continuing with hormonal therapy or switching to chemotherapy will result in better survival outcomes,\" said Ryan Dittamore, chief of medical innovation at Epic Sciences and a co-author on the study. \"In addition, the survival benefit gained through the utilization of our AR-V7 test could make the test as valuable to a patient's outcome as a blockbuster cancer drug.\"\n\nThis is the second blinded, multi-center clinical utility validation study utilizing the nuclear-localized AR-V7 test. Earlier this month, Dr. Andrew Armstrong of Duke Cancer Institute presented data validating the test in the PROPHECY clinical trial at the ASCO 2018 Annual Meeting. The PROPHECY study investigated the AR-V7 test in patients receiving ARSi therapy and demonstrated that patients who tested positive had worse survival by all measures and had no clinical benefit from ARSi therapy.\n\nIn March of this year, based upon earlier studies utilizing the test, Palmetto GBA, a Medicare Administrative Contractor that assesses molecular diagnostic technologies, issued a draft local coverage determination (LCD) for the Oncotype DX\u00ae AR-V7 Nucleus Detect\u2122 test. A full LCD for the test is expected in the upcoming months and would support Medicare reimbursement for applicable patients considering ARSI or taxane therapies. It is estimated that 50,000 patients a year may be eligible for and benefit from the Oncotype DX\u00ae AR-V7 Nucleus Detect\u2122 test.\n\nThe paper is entitled, \"Assessment of the Validity of Nuclear-Localized Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 in Circulating Tumor Cells as a Predictive Biomarker for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.\"\n\nAbout the Oncotype DX\u00ae AR-V7 Nucleus Detect\u2122 Test\n\nDesigned by Epic Sciences and based on results from multiple studies led by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the Oncotype DX\u00ae AR-V7 Nucleus Detect\u2122 test is the first and only liquid biopsy test of its kind that can potentially prolong the lives of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) by helping their physician identify the most effective treatment. Through a blood draw, the test detects AR-V7 protein in the nucleus of circulating tumor cells utilizing Epic Sciences' No Cell Left Behind\u00ae platform to accurately identify patients who are resistant to androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapies and who should instead switch to chemotherapy.

The researchers estimated that shifting standard practice by 30 percent to the wrist approach, along with same-day discharge, could save the United States $300 million per year.\n\n\u201cWe have unequivocal evidence and data that show better outcomes when we access the heart\u2019s coronary arteries and perform angioplasty through a blood vessel in the wrist rather than through the femoral artery in the groin,\u201d said first author Amit P. Amin, MD, an assistant professor of medicine. \u201cThe femoral artery is the traditional route, but when we go in through a vessel in the wrist, we see less bleeding, fewer complications, less pain and discomfort, higher patient satisfaction, shorter hospital stays, and lower costs.\u201d\n\nPatients may undergo coronary angioplasty \u2014 also called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) \u2014 to alleviate chest pain or shortness of breath. Such symptoms suggest the coronary arteries that deliver blood to the heart are blocked or narrowed and oxygen delivery to the heart muscle is reduced. Interventional cardiologists insert a small tube into an artery in the wrist or the groin, which can be used to view the narrowed heart artery, deliver an inflatable balloon to open up the narrowed section, and possibly deliver a stent to hold the vessel open.\n\nUsing the National Cardiovascular Data Registry CathPCI Registry, the researchers analyzed data from almost 280,000 Medicare patients who underwent PCI and were eligible for same-day discharge. Despite the fact that all of these patients were capable of leaving the hospital the same day as their procedures, only about 5 percent of these patients actually were discharged without having stayed overnight.\n\n\u201cWe have seen that it is very safe to send these patients home the same day,\u201d said Amin, who treats patients at Barnes-Jewish Hospital. \u201cWe use risk-prediction models to predict their risks ahead of time, and we plan ahead to mitigate any issues so we can facilitate a same-day discharge. This is really about patient care. We want to outline health-care pathways that provide the best care for patients.\u201d\n\nThe analysis demonstrated an average cost of $13,389 for the wrist approach with same-day discharge, compared with $17,076 for the groin approach with at least one night of hospitalization, resulting in a cost savings of about $3,700 for outpatients who get the wrist-access procedure. Independent of the length of stay, the wrist approach costs about $900 less than the groin approach, on average.\n\nThe investigators estimated that if a hospital performing 1,000 of these procedures annually shifted 30 percent of these patients to the wrist-access with same-day discharge approach, the hospital would save $1 million over that period. Expanding that practice to hospitals nationwide might save the United States $300 million in health-care spending per year. Health-care costs for the 600,000 patients who receive PCI each year in the U.S. are estimated to be $10 billion.\n\nOf the study\u2019s patient population receiving PCI, 9 percent received the procedure in which doctors used wrist access. According to Amin, improved technology has allowed wrist access to become a viable route to the coronary arteries, even for complex cases, and should be considered for more patients.\n\n\u201cThe traditional way has been to go through the bigger femoral artery that is a straight pathway to the heart,\u201d Amin said. \u201cUnfortunately, that artery is also deep. It\u2019s associated with more bleeding complications. In contrast, the wrist artery is small and is associated with fewer complications. The minor challenge is in the difficulty of navigating a smaller, more twisting path of an artery through the wrist. But with advances we have in technology and equipment, those challenges are rapidly decreasing.\u201d\n\nThis work was supported by a grant from Vita Solutions, a subsidiary of The Medicines Company, for whom Amin has provided consultation; and by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), grant numbers UL1TR000448, KL2TR000450, TL1TR000449 and 1KM1CA156708-01.

Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center have found.\n\nHIF-2 inhibitors, which grew out of research begun more than 20 years ago at UT Southwestern Medical Center, work by interfering with processes that fuel the growth of cells.\n\nInvestigators conducted a pre-clinical trial in mice transplanted with kidney cancer from over 20 patients and showed that the HIF-2 inhibitor PT2399 controlled cancer in half of the tumors, according to a study published in the journal Nature.\n\n\"This is a completely new treatment for kidney cancer. We want to make HIF-2 inhibitors available to patients and are currently carrying out clinical trials,\" said Dr. James Brugarolas, Director of the Kidney Cancer Program, who is leading an $11 million SPORE grant from the National Cancer Institute seeking to translate new discoveries into novel therapies for kidney cancer patients. Part of the SPORE grant, one of just two directly related to kidney cancer in the nation, is focused on further researching HIF-2 inhibitors.\n\nIn a previous report, Dr. Kevin Courtney, Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine and a coauthor of the current study, reported at the American Association of Clinical Oncology annual meeting that HIF-2 inhibitors were safe in patients and had activity even in heavily pretreated patients. In the study in Nature, investigators show that HIF-2 inhibition was able to control metastatic kidney cancer even after 7 lines of prior therapy. See video.\n\nThe findings show that HIF-2 is a promising target to combat kidney cancer, said Dr. Brugarolas, senior author and a Virginia Murchison Linthicum Scholar in Medical Research at UT Southwestern.\n\nNearly 400,000 Americans are now living with a diagnosis of kidney cancer and more than 60,000 people are expected to be diagnosed with kidney cancer this year, according to the National Cancer Institute. Texas has the fifth highest rate of this cancer in the U.S.\n\nHIFs or hypoxia-inducible factors, like HIF-2, allow the body's cells to adjust to low-oxygen environments. HIFs activate programs that promote the development of blood vessels, facilitate oxygen delivery and promote efficient nutrient utilization. Kidney cancer cells hijack the same system to fuel their growth.\n\nHIF-2 inhibitors work by suppressing the effects of HIF-2 which include downregulating an important protein called VEGF that promotes the formation of blood vessels needed for tumors to grow.\n\n\"Unlike existing VEGF inhibitors, the HIF-2 inhibitor blocks VEGF only in the cancer and therefore does not cause cardiac toxicity or hypertension,\" Dr. Brugarolas explained.\n\nIn the Nature study, researchers compared the two drugs head to head and found that the HIF-2 inhibitor was more active than sunitinib and that it was active against tumors progressing on sunitinib.\n\n\"Furthermore, it was also better tolerated. As sometimes happens in patients, mice on sunitinib were sickly and lost weight, whereas mice on the HIF-2 inhibitor gained weight while on the study,\" he said.\n\nResearchers surprisingly found a subset of tumors that do not respond to the drug, but were able to identify biomarkers that, once verified, would help determine which patients are more likely to benefit from HIF-2 therapies.\n\n\"HIF-2 is believed to be the most important driver of kidney cancer. Traditionally, proteins like HIF-2 were disregarded as drug targets because their shape made it nearly impossible to design drugs against them,\" Dr. Brugarolas said. \"The approaches we have taken pave the way for identifying drug candidates for other proteins that have traditionally been considered undruggable.\"\n\nHIF-2 also appears significant in other types of cancer, including deadly brain cancers called glioblastomas and non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type of lung malignancy.\n\nHow HIF-2 came to be\n\nIn 1997, UT Southwestern researchers Dr. Steven McKnight, Chairman of Biochemistry, and molecular geneticist Dr. David Russell, Vice Provost and Dean of Basic Research, led research discovering and describing the protein encoded by the EPAS1 gene, also known as HIF-2\u03b1, the main HIF-2 component. Over the course of a decade, the laboratories of Dr. Richard Bruick, Professor of Biochemistry, holder of the Michael L. Rosenberg Scholar in Biomedical Research, and a coauthor of the current study, and Dr. Kevin Gardner, Adjunct Professor of Biochemistry, solved the structure of HIF-2\u03b1.\n\nBy 2009, researchers had identified a \"sweet spot\" where drugs could bind and shut down HIF-2 activity. Using the Simmons Cancer Center's High-Throughput Screening, scientists tested more than 200,000 chemicals to see which ones could interfere with HIF-2, identifying several potential drug-like compounds. The most promising compounds were licensed to Peloton Therapeutics, Inc., a biotech firm co-founded by Dr. McKnight and based at UT Southwestern's BioCenter campus.

[Brown University] -- To the tantalizing delight of chocolate lovers everywhere, a number of recent studies employing various methods have suggested that compounds in cocoa called flavanols could benefit cardiovascular health. Now a systematic review and meta-analysis of 19 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of cocoa consumption reveals some further pieces of supporting evidence.\n\nThe meta-analysis in the Journal of Nutrition, an assessment of the combined evidence from all 19 RCTs, focused on whether consumption of flavanol-rich cocoa products was associated with improvements in specific circulating biomarkers of cardiometabolic health as compared to consuming placebos with negligible cocoa flavanol content. In all, 1,139 volunteers were involved in these trials.\n\n\"Our meta-analysis of RCTs characterizes how cocoa flavanols affect cardiometabolic biomarkers, providing guidance in designing large, definitive prevention trials against diabetes and cardiovascular disease in future work,\" said corresponding author Dr. Simin Liu, professor and director of the Center for Global Cardiometabolic Health at Brown University who worked with epidemiology graduate student and lead author Xiaochen Lin. \"We found that cocoa flavanol intake may reduce dyslipidemia (elevated triglycerides), insulin resistance and systemic inflammation, which are all major subclinical risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases.\"\n\nLiu noted some limitations in the trials. All studies were small and of short duration, not all of the biomarkers tracked in these studies changed for the better, and none of the studies were designed to test directly whether cocoa flavanol consumption leads to reduced cases of heart attacks or type 2 diabetes.\n\nBut taking into account some of these heterogeneities across studies, the team's meta-analysis summarizing data from 19 trials found potential beneficial effects of flavanol-rich cocoa on cardiometabolic health. There were small-to-modest but statistically significant improvements among those who ate flavanol-rich cocoa product vs. those who did not.\n\nThe greatest effects were seen among trial volunteers who ate between 200 and 600 milligrams of flavanols a day (based on their cocoa consumption). They saw significant declines in blood glucose and insulin, as well as another indicator of insulin resistance called HOMA-IR. They also saw an increase in HDL, or \"good,\" cholesterol. Those consuming higher doses saw some of the insulin resistance benefits and a drop in triglycerides, but not a significant increase in HDL. Those with lower doses of flavanols only saw a significant HDL benefit.\n\nIn general, Lin said, where there were benefits they were evident for both women and men and didn't depend on what physical form the flavanol-rich cocoa product was consumed in --dark chocolate vs. a beverage, for example.\n\n\"The treatment groups of the trials included in our meta-analysis are primarily dark chocolate -- a few were using cocoa powder-based beverages,\" Lin said. \"Therefore, the findings from the current study apparently shouldn't be generalized to different sorts of chocolate candies or white chocolates, of which the content of sugar/food additives could be substantially higher than that of the dark chocolate.\"\n\nThe authors therefore concluded, \"Our study highlights the urgent need for large, long-term RCTs that improve our understanding of how the short-term benefits of cocoa flavanol intake on cardiometabolic biomarkers may be translated into clinical outcomes.\"\n\nIn addition to Lin and Liu, the study's other authors are Isabel Zhang, Alina Li from Brown University, JoAnn Manson, Howard Sesso and Lu Wang from Brigham and Women's Hospital.\n\nThe authors acknowledge funding from the National Institutes of Health including the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, the American Heart Association, and Pfizer.

In previous studies, folic acid levels have been linked to mental ability; however, until now this had not been linked with improved school performance, the study authors said.\n\n\"We know that folate plays a really critical role in brain development and brain function,\" said Dr. Daniel Armstrong, associate chair of pediatrics at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.\n\n\"We know that, in young children, folate deficiencies are associated with poorer neurocognitive function and neurocognitive development,\" he noted. In fact, folate deficiencies may be involved in the development of autism, he added.\n\nArmstrong thinks that a diet rich in folate might be important for brain functioning throughout life. \"It's one of those things that's no harm, no foul. It's not going to do us any harm and it might do us some good,\" he said.\n\nTo find out whether folate might do some good, a team led by Dr. Torbjorn K. Nilsson, from the department of laboratory medicine at Orebro University Hospital in Sweden, collected data on folic acid levels in 386 teens aged 15 years. The researchers also looked at any possible effects of socioeconomic status and genetics.\n\nThe investigators found that teens who had the highest levels of folic acid also got the best grades. None of the other factors they examined accounted for their finding, Nilsson's team noted.\n\n\"These results provide new information that points to the importance of keeping a closer watch on folate status in childhood and adolescence. They may also have direct implications for school meal provisions, school teaching programs and information to parents,\" the authors concluded.\n\nHowever, there is no scientific evidence that taking folate supplements will be beneficial, Armstrong noted. \"It's too early to say that everyone should start taking folate,\" he stressed.\n\nFolic acid is one of the B vitamins and is a key component in making DNA and RNA. Insufficient folic acid is a cause of certain birth defects of the spine and brain, including spina bifida.\n\nAmong the elderly, folic acid consumption appears to affect mental ability, and low levels of this vitamin have been associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease, according to several studies.\n\nFolic acid is found in leafy green vegetables, fruits, dried beans, peas and nuts.

In the U.S., about 600,000 men are being treated with endocrine therapies for prostate cancer.\n\nVan Hemelrijck and colleagues studied more than 30,000 men in Sweden with prostate cancer who got hormone therapy between 1997 and 2006, for about three years. They compared the rate of heart problems in those patients to the rate in the general Swedish population.\n\nProstate cancer patients had a 28 percent higher relative chance of having a fatal heart attack and a 21 percent increased chance of dying from heart disease. Still, these risks were low in absolute terms: researchers estimated the hormone therapies would cause an extra 10 heart problems \u2013 like chest pain or a heart attack \u2013 a year for every 1,000 prostate cancer patients.\n\n\"What patients should do is talk about this with their doctor,\" said Michael Thun, a vice president emeritus at the American Cancer Society, who was not connected to the research. \"It makes a lot of sense and could one day change treatment guidelines.\"\n\nPrevious studies have found hormone therapy given to prostate cancer patients with a history of heart disease increases their chances of dying.\n\nVan Hemelrijck hypothesized that hormone therapy disrupts the normal circulation of testosterone in the body. Scientists think testosterone has some protective effect on the heart. Thus, hormones that interfere with testosterone could be deadly.\n\n\"There is no definitive evidence, though the risk of heart problems is definitely something doctors should consider when prescribing hormone treatment,\" Thun said.\n\nHelen Rippon, head of research management at Britain's Prostate Cancer Charity, said the benefits of hormone therapy ultimately outweighed the increased risk of heart problems. \"This is not a colossal risk,\" Rippon said.\n\n\"For the vast majority of men, the benefits of hormone therapy are absolutely clear: it can halt the disease or stop it for years,\" she said. \"Clinicians always make decisions on a case-by-case basis, and this is one more piece of information for them to consider.\"", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "\n\n\n \nThe story points out that hormone therapy is commonly given to men with prostate cancer.\n However, the lead sentences mislead readers by describing hormone therapy as a single treatment, rather than a collection of different treatments.

But the fact that physical training also seems to have a protective effect on the brain in people with multiple sclerosis is new and important knowledge,\" says Ulrik Dalgas.\n\nIn the study, the researchers followed 35 people with multiple sclerosis for six months. Half of the group engaged in resistance training twice a week, while the other half continued to live their lives normally without systematic training.\n\nPrior to and following the six-month period, the test subjects had their brains MR-scanned, and the researchers could see that there was a tendency for the brain to shrink less in those patients who undertook resistance training.\n\n\"Among persons with multiple sclerosis, the brain shrinks markedly faster than normal. Drugs can counter this development, but we saw a tendency that training further minimises brain shrinkage in patients already receiving medication. In addition, we saw that several smaller brain areas actually started to grow in response to training,\" says Ulrik Dalgas.\n\nThe researchers behind the study are still unable to explain why training has a positive effect on the brain in people with multiple sclerosis. A bigger and more in-depth on-going study will help to clarify this, and may also lead to improved treatment options, says Ulrik Dalgas. However, he stresses that the aim is not to replace medication with physical training.\n\n\"Phasing out drugs in favour of training is not realistic. On the other hand, the study indicates that systematic physical training can be a far more important supplement during treatment than has so far been assumed. This aspect needs to be thoroughly explored,\" says Ulrik Dalgas.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether all people with multiple sclerosis can benefit from this type of exercise, as it has not been sufficiently tested in the more severely affected patients. Therefore, Ulrik Dalgas is not recommending that all multiple sclerosis patients throw themselves into intensive physical training regimes without first seeking professional advice.\n\u2022 Multiple sclerosis is an incurable disease of the central nervous system.\n\u2022 There are about twice as many women as men with multiple sclerosis.\n\u2022 Eighty per cent of people with multiple sclerosis live with the disease for more than 35 years.\n\u2022 The disease is found in both aggressive and more benign forms.\n\u2022 The cause of the illness is unknown, but both genetic and environmental factors play a role.", "question": "Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The release provides too little information on what types of exercises are included in the training program and whether they require coaching and monitoring from a trained physical therapist.

If not for a new surgical technique, a minimally invasive procedure which uses 3-D printing technology, the adventurous Berg might never have been able to return to her passions of traveling, snorkeling and cooking.\n\nIt began in September 2016 when Berg was rushed to the hospital after experiencing a major heart attack in her car.\n\nBut the heart attack wasn't the only danger. After a series of tests, the doctors made a shocking discovery. Parts of her aorta, the largest blood vessel in the body, were so enlarged that it could rupture at any moment. The deadly condition is called an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and Berg had not one but two of them \u2014 measuring 5 centimeters and 6.5 centimeters wide \u2014 making surgery dangerous.\n\n\u201cIt was a life-and-death situation,\u201d says Berg. \u201cI was not a candidate for open surgery. When they would open me up [the aorta] could just blow.\u201d\n\nThe bulge in the large artery that carries blood away from the heart can be immediately life-threatening if it grows large enough to rupture. The chance of survival when it ruptures is less than 10 percent.\n\nAccording to the Society for Vascular Surgery, every year, roughly 200,000 Americans are diagnosed with abdominal aortic aneurysms. These aneurysms often grow slowly, without symptoms, but some people may notice a pulsating feeling near the belly button, back pain, or nausea \u2014 often signs of impending rupture.\n\nIf an AAA is found, doctors sometimes use a stent to repair the aorta, but it doesn't always work since the aneurysms are often in places where a stent can\u2019t fit. And even if the stent does fit, patients often undergo a long, painful recovery.\n\nRelated: Heart Attack Risk With Painkillers Starts Within a Week: Study Says\n\nA personalized approach pioneered by vascular surgeon and lead researcher, Dr. Gustavo Oderich, at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota creates customized stents that are specifically designed for each patient. By using 3-D printing technology, Oderich's team can create an individualized model of the patient's aorta. Using a minimally invasive endoscopic vascular surgical technique, patient recovery times are quicker.\n\n\u201cEach anatomy of the patient is different and that's the problem, that\u2019s why we need stents that are actually specific for the patient,\u201d says Oderich. \u201cThe 3-D prints are used to rehearse the operation. We can anticipate challenges by practicing the procedure beforehand.\u201d\n\nSo far doctors at Mayo Clinic have done this personalized procedure on more than 450 patients. They are now training doctors nationally.\n\n\"The use of 3-D printing to personalize aortic repair is fascinating,\" said Dr. Ramesh Gowda, director of interventional cardiology at Mount Sinai Beth Israel. \u201cEvery patient differs in their aortic anatomical geometry so it can be hard to precisely ascertain the perfect sized graft, despite advances in CT imaging techniques, but newer patient-specific 3-D printed models may circumvent these challenges.\"\n\nThe cardiology community now prefers the endovascular approach.\n\n\"There is a fair amount of clinical research to support this,\" said Gowda. \"The data shows that similar clinical outcomes are had when you look at the traditional open approach versus the endovascular approach but the endovascular approach provides the added benefit of shorter hospital stays and a faster recovery.\"\n\n\u201cI\u2019m unsure where the technology will go but it is a very fascinating discovery.\u201d\n\nAfter her surgery, Berg is now back to back to enjoying her life. \u201cI feel absolutely terrific,\u201d says Berg. \u201cAn aneurysm in no way means that you're going to die.

But a new study this week reflects the continued view of many physicians \u2014 that screening does help to catch tumors earlier. To screen or not to screen: here's why experts still can't agree\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering why experts still can\u2019t agree on prostate-cancer screening, you\u2019re not alone.\n\nJust two months ago, a major U.S. government panel said that basically no one should get screened for prostate cancer, claiming the simple blood test for prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, does more harm than good. Now, a new study looks at government data and finds that, without PSA testing, the U.S. would have three times as many patients each year diagnosed with advanced-stage prostate cancer \u2014 and the vast majority of those cases would be fatal.\n\n\u201cAlmost all men with clinically apparent metastases at initial diagnosis will die from prostate cancer,\u201d urologist and study author Edward Messing told reporters, as he explained the importance of his study.\n\nThe new study reflects a broader divide in the medical community, between public health experts who have largely turned away from PSA screening, and many practicing clinicians who feel the test has helped their patients immensely.\n\nNo one denies that PSA tests can help to catch prostate cancer early. But two issues are still unresolved. One is how well screening can actually work to prevent cancer deaths; the other is what kind of negative effects screening brings along with its benefits.\n\nOn the first issue, there is still some uncertainty. In the U.S., a large randomized trial found no mortality benefit of screening. But an even larger randomized clinical trial in Europe has found a benefit. In its latest results published this spring, the European study team said that men who undergo routine testing have significantly lower risk of prostate-cancer death after 11 years.\n\nStill, the real crux of the debate on PSA testing is the second issue: the possible negative effects of screening. No diagnostic test is 100% accurate, and if a PSA test comes back positive for prostate cancer, the patient will usually be referred for a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. That test can have side effects. Then, if the patient does have cancer, the available treatments for it \u2014 surgery, radiation, as well as other options \u2014 also have side effects, chief among them impotence, incontinence, and urinary incontinence. The same European trial that found lower cancer mortality with PSA testing also found that, to save just one life through screening, an extra 37 men would need to be diagnosed with prostate cancer and treated. Many health experts think that\u2019s too much risky treatment to justify the results.\n\nSo when the government advisory panel \u2014 the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \u2014 recommends against routine PSA testing, it\u2019s making a judgment call. It\u2019s saying that, for most men, the (albeit small) risk of sexual dysfunction and urinary leakage from eventual treatment is not worth it, given the even smaller chance that PSA testing could save your life. But that decision does remain a judgment call. It depends on how much you value certain quality-of-life measures versus how much you value having any life at all.\n\nAs for the new paper this week, which suggests that three times as many men would be diagnosed each year with metastatic prostate cancer if it weren\u2019t for PSA testing, that study is published in the journal Cancer \u2014 and its numbers deserve a little explanation. To calculate the total number of metastatic cases we\u2019d get without screening, the study takes today\u2019s population of the United States and applies the rates (broken down by age and race) of advanced-stage prostate cancer that were observed before PSA testing was introduced \u2014 that is, the rates way back in 1983-85.\n\nIn other words, it tells us what the current U.S. population would look like if today we faced the same risks that Americans faced in the \u201980s; it finds we\u2019d have roughly 25,000 U.S. men diagnosed with advanced-stage prostate cancer each year compared to just 8,000 today. But is going back in time 30 years really the same thing that we\u2019d get if we abolished PSA testing today? Who knows? The rate of new diagnoses of all cancer types combined has been falling consistently in recent years. However, prostate cancer is one of the few cancers that\u2019s not strongly linked to smoking (and falling cigarette consumption over the past 40 years is a major reason for falling cancer rates). It is, however, linked to obesity, which has been on the rise since the 1980s.\n\nOne further fact to keep in mind is that PSA testing works to cut the number of newly diagnosed advanced-stage cancers \u2014 but it does so by increasing the number of cancers that are caught early. And, as the debate over PSA testing shows us, early diagnosis is only useful if early treatment can help patients live longer and healthier lives, preventing progression to advanced-stage cancer down the line, but without increasing the risks of other health problems too much in the process. That\u2019s what experts can\u2019t agree about.\n\nMany doctors do have very strong opinions, though. As a patient, if you\u2019re deciding whether to get a PSA test, or whether not to get a PSA test, remember you do have a right to your own opinion too. There\u2019s no easy answer.\n\nMORE: Prostate Cancer Screening: What You Need to Know", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story makes it clear that PSA screening is widely available.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Doctor Challenges Cause Of MS And Treatment\n\nOne day 7 years ago, after a long walk with his dog along the Hudson River in Manhattan, Marc Stecker noticed he was limping. Not long after, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.\n\n\"Fast forward now, and my entire right side is pretty much paralyzed and my left side is weakening,\" Stecker says.\n\nStecker is now confined to a wheelchair, from where he writes a blog about his disease, called Wheelchair Kamikaze.\n\nMore than a year ago, Stecker started writing about a theory Italian physician Paolo Zamboni proposed in 2008 called chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency, or CCSVI.\n\nIt's been thought that multiple sclerosis is caused by a misguided immune system that attacks the nerves of the brain and spinal cord and can lead to muscle weakness, paralysis and death. However, Zamboni suggests that the disease instead is the result of blocked blood veins \u2014 leading to inflammation, which, in turn, causes the immune system to attack nerves in the brain and spinal cord.\n\nZamboni proposed that treating it may be as simple as opening them up. Stecker was hopeful.\n\n\"Because my disease is so aggressive, I have been very willing to be equally aggressive in trying to combat it,\" Stecker says.\n\nTo clear the veins, his doctor tried opening them with a tiny balloon. Zamboni calls it \"the liberation procedure\" but it is actually a common technique known as angioplasty when it's used to open clogged arteries \u2014 not veins.\n\n\"At first, I was very skeptical. But anecdotal reports started coming through of almost miraculous results from it.\u2026So, I decided, you know, hey it was worth a shot,\" Stecker says.\n\nBut it didn't work. Although the doctor who treated him in New York found a significant blockage, he was unable to correct it, Stecker says.\n\nStill, some would say Stecker was lucky. Many desperate patients have spent their life savings flying overseas to have the procedure, only to have it fail a few months later. Others elect to have tiny metal tubes, known as \"stents,\" placed in the veins to hold them open and have suffered serious complications, including life-threatening blood clots. Several patients have even died as a result.\n\nStecker says if he had it to do over again, he would have waited for more research. But he says he was eager to try something that offered him the first real glimmer of hope for a cure.\n\n\"CCSVI equals hope and a lot of MS patients just are completely devoid of hope,\" Stecker says. \"People don't want to have MS. They want to go back to who they used to be. You know, along comes this theory that offers an easy-to-understand solution, so it's very, very, very seductive.\"\n\nIt's so seductive, in fact, that Canadians and Americans with MS have been flocking overseas to get the \"liberation procedure.\" Something that many researchers find very troubling. Robert Zivadinov of the Buffalo Neuroimaging Analysis Center in New York says that not only is the procedure unsafe and costly to many patients, it is impeding necessary research.\n\n\"Even if the treatment is not useful for patients with MS, I don't think that we can abandon the idea of vascular involvement in MS,\" Zivadinov says. \"And I think this merits very detailed understanding of what is going on.\"\n\nWhat is going on is still a bit of a mystery. Critics argue that although Zamboni's original research suggests a vascular cause for MS, other studies don't. These discrepancies, and growing public controversy, prompted the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in the U.S. and the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada to take Zamboni's claims seriously. They funded a number of independent studies to investigate the relationship between CCSVI and MS.\n\nRobert Fox, a neurologist at the Cleveland Clinic, currently oversees one of the studies funded by an MS Society grant. He says part of the confusion comes from variations in how CCSVI is measured.\n\n\"That's absolutely one of the potential problems in the previous studies: Are the techs who got negative results, did they just not know how to do the ultrasound in the way that Dr. Zamboni described doing the ultrasound? And that's a very important issue,\" Fox says.\n\nFox says he sent his technicians to a special training to learn how to properly measure the veins because it's not something most technicians ever do.\n\nMeanwhile in Buffalo, Zivadinov says his research on CCSVI already shows a clear picture emerging.\n\n\"CCSVI is not the cause of MS but might be a consequence or a contributing factor to progression, and I think that has to be studied,\" Zivadinov says.\n\nStudying how the vascular system is involved in neurologic disease is an entirely new concept, Zivadinov says. One that may have an impact beyond any single disease.\n\n\"What professor Zamboni discovered in terms of veins is something much bigger than multiple sclerosis,\" Zivadinov says. \"We need to understand the role of the venous system in the pathology of central nervous diseases and aging.\"\n\nZamboni himself says that even if it turns out he's wrong, coming to a greater understanding of the disease would be the big reward \u2014 both for him and thousands of MS patients.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The article implies that there aren\u2019t yet a lot of doctors performing this\u00a0procedure, but it isn\u2019t clear.\u00a0Early in the story we learn of\u00a0a patient\u00a0who recently had the procedure performed in New York, but later on\u00a0the story\u00a0says that Canadians and\u00a0Americans\u00a0are going to Europe\u00a0to have\u00a0the surgery.\u00a0Are there not enough doctors\u00a0in North America who are trained to perform this procedure?

But they do focus on the group of women for whom there is the most debate about the value of radiation.\n\n\"There is a great deal of controversy about whether women with one, two or three lymph nodes [with cancer] have sufficient risk to warrant radiation,\" he said. \"For women with four or more lymph nodes involved, everyone would recommend radiation.\"\n\nThe guidelines also strongly support input from all specialists who treat breast cancer in making the decision about radiation treatment. That typically includes the surgeon, radiation physician and an oncologist.\n\nDoctors need to weigh the risks and benefits, Edge added. Side effects can include redness of the skin, swelling and skin breakdown severe enough to compromise future breast reconstruction, he explained.\n\nEdge said that doctors need to consider patients individually.

The study discovered the specific triggers activating the development of fibrosis which accelerates heart failure. Blocking the triggers through the use of a specific kind of bile acid prevented cardiac fibrosis from occurring.\n\n\"This is something that nobody has ever seen before,\" says Marek Michalak, co-principal investigator and a distinguished professor in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Alberta's Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry. \"Cardiac fibrosis is considered a permanent remodeling of the heart. Inevitably it leads to heart failure and eventually death.

Currently patients with heart failure have poor quality of life and a dismal prognosis. Improving their quality of life will do wonders for these individuals.\"\n\nFibrosis is an early step on the path to heart failure. According to the Heart and Stroke Foundation there are currently 1.3 million Canadians living with heart disease or heart failure--a condition that severely limits physical activity because the heart cannot pump enough oxygenated blood that the body needs. About 30 per cent of patients diagnosed with heart failure will die within the first year.\n\nCardiac fibrosis itself is caused by a variety of factors including high blood pressure, overwork of cardiac muscle and long-term consumption of a diet that is high in both saturated fat and sugar--all cause increased stress to heart cells. Individuals with diabetes, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and heart transplant recipients are also known to be at high risk.\n\n\"It's almost like building a scar,\" says Michalak. \"It's exactly the same type of biological activity but it's happening in the heart tissue.

In contrast, of study participants who were assigned to a wait-list for therapy, none showed a similar decline in pain.\n\nFibromyalgia is a syndrome marked by widespread pain \u2014 including discomfort at specific \u201ctender points\u201d in the body \u2014 along with symptoms such as fatigue, irritable bowel and sleep problems. It is estimated to affect up to 5 million U.S. adults, most commonly middle-aged women.\n\nThe precise cause of fibromyalgia is unknown \u2014 there are no physical signs, such as inflammation and tissue damage in the painful area \u2014 but some researchers believe the disorder involves problems in how the brain processes pain signals.\n\nStandard treatments include painkillers, antidepressants, cognitive- behavioral therapy and exercise therapy. However, many people with fibromyalgia find that their symptoms \u2014 pain, in particular \u2014 persist despite treatment.\n\nPart of that, according to the researchers on the new study, may be because standard treatments do not specifically address the role psychological stress and emotions can play in triggering people\u2019s pain.\n\nThat is not to say that the pain people with fibromyalgia feel is \u201call in their head,\u201d stressed Dr. Howard Schubiner, of St. John Health/ Providence Hospital and Medical Centers in Southfield, Michigan.\n\n\u201cThe pain is very real,\u201d Schubiner said in an interview. But, he explained, pain and emotions are \u201cconnected in the brain,\u201d and emotional factors may act to trigger \u201clearned nerve pathways\u201d that give rise to pain.\n\nPast studies have found that compared with people without fibromyalgia, those with the disorder have higher rates of stressful life events, such as childhood abuse, marital problems and high levels of job stress. There is also evidence that they are relatively less aware of their own emotions and more reluctant to express their feelings, particularly anger.\n\nFor the new study, published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, Schubiner and his colleagues tested the effects of affective self-awareness \u2014 a technique Schubiner developed and uses in treating certain chronic-pain conditions \u2014 on fibromyalgia.\n\nThey randomly assigned 45 women with the condition to either undergo the therapy or go on a wait-list for treatment, serving as a control group. Women in the treatment group each had a one-on-one consultation, then attended three group meetings to learn the affective self-awareness techniques so that they could carry them out on their own.\n\nThe therapy involves an educational component where patients learn about the emotion-pain connection. They learn specific techniques \u2014 including mindfulness meditation and \u201cexpressive\u201d writing \u2014 for recognizing and dealing with the emotions that may be contributing to their pain. Patients are also encouraged to get back to any exercise or other activities that they have been avoiding due to pain.\n\nSchubiner\u2019s team found that six months later, 46 percent of the treatment group had at least a 30-percent reduction in their pain ratings compared with scores at the outset. And 21 percent had a 50-percent or greater reduction.\n\nNone of the women in the control group had a comparable improvement.\n\nThe study is only the first clinical trial to test affective self-awareness for fibromyalgia, and it had a number of limitations, including its small size. In addition, the control group received no active therapy to serve as a comparison.\n\nThat is important because it is possible for patients to benefit from simply receiving attention from a healthcare provider, or being part of small-group sessions with other people suffering from the same condition, for example.\n\nSchubiner also acknowledged that this general \u201cmodel\u201d for understanding and addressing fibromyalgia pain is controversial.\n\nHe said that he and his colleagues have applied for funding to conduct a larger clinical trial comparing affective self-awareness with standard cognitive-behavioral therapy.\n\nAffective self-awareness and cognitive-behavioral therapy have similarities, according to Schubiner.

Dr. Elizabeth Kavaler, a urologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said functional issues resulting from conditions such as birth defects or prostate cancer surgery may warrant penile surgery, but such cases are unusual.\n\n\"It's a very fragile organ to begin with,\" Kavaler said, \"and if you start to do all these things to it you can disfigure it... They should leave it alone.\"\n\nStudy co-author Dr. Paolo Gontero said urologists are constantly approached by men concerned about their penis size, despite the fact that the majority are average, with a flaccid length of 1 to 4 inches.\n\n\"However, most men complaining of inadequate penile size do have associated sexual problems even if their penile dimensions fall within the normal range -- so-called dysmorphophobic penis,\" said Gontero, an associate professor of urology at the University of Turin. \"No study has, however, specifically addressed the extent and type of sexual bother in this patient category.\"\n\nDysmorphophobia \"is a condition consisting of an imaginary flaw in the physical appearance,\" the study noted.\n\nWriting in the April issue of the British Journal of Urology International, Gontero and his colleagues found that penile extenders work better than techniques such as vacuum devices, exercises and Botox injections, and that psychological satisfaction is equally as important as any physical changes.\n\nA review of surgical techniques showed they increased phallus size an average of about a half-inch to 1 inch, but Gontero cautioned that the safest surgery -- which cuts the suspensory ligament of the penis to lengthen it -- often yields poor results.\n\n\"On the contrary, more complex lengthening procedures are to be considered experimental and potentially dangerous,\" he said.\n\n\"All procedures aimed to increase the penile girth should be considered unsafe, leading to potentially poor cosmetic and functional results,\" Gontero added. \"I have come across such cases that I had to re-operate in order to remove additive substances injected around the penis.\"\n\nThe men studied ranged in age from 24 to 56 and were followed between three and 16 months.\n\nMore than 70 of them used penile extenders, with six experiencing minor problems such as bruising, pain and itching.

That\u2019s because HPV \u2014 which causes changes in the cervix that can lead to cancer \u2014 may take a decade to progress to that point.\n\n\u201cNo test is perfect,\u201d said Philip Castle, an HPV expert at the American Society for Clinical Pathology in Chicago. But, he added, \u201ca single negative HPV test is very good at ruling out disease.\u201d\n\nEven when doctors use just a Pap test, Roland said, a woman who has had a few normal tests in a row can go two or three years before her next screening.\n\nFor the current study, she and her colleagues sent out questionnaires to a representative sample of about 600 office-based doctors and hospital departments around the country. They asked doctors and staff what tests they used for cervical cancer screening and presented them with three patient scenarios.\n\nIn those scenarios, a woman age 30 to 60 has had two consecutive normal Pap tests but no HPV tests; two normal Paps and a negative HPV test; or a negative HPV test but no recent Pap tests.\n\nIn all of those cases, guidelines recommend waiting three years before screening the patient again, the authors explain in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology. But for each scenario, between 67 percent and 85 percent of doctors said they would bring the woman back in a year.\n\nRoland pointed to the extra costs women may incur to get childcare and make it to the doctor\u2019s office \u2014 plus the costs to a strained healthcare system of ordering more tests.\n\nAnd any extra screening increases the chance of getting a \u201cfalse positive\u201d result on a test \u2014 meaning the test finds something that doesn\u2019t turn out to be cancer. In that case, women would need more invasive tests to rule out disease, Roland said, and risk \u201cundue harm\u201d from those procedures.\n\n\u201cSome of it is, don\u2019t go looking before you need to go looking because you\u2019ll find stuff that you\u2019d rather not find,\u201d said Castle, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nResults from a survey of the same doctors have shown that many also give the HPV test alongside Pap smears to women under 30 \u2014 which is not recommended, because HPV is common in young women and often goes away on its own (see Reuters Health story of July 4, 2011.)\n\nCastle said there could be a few reasons that doctors opt to screen women more often than is recommended. First, they might not know about the guidelines. But women may also be used to annual testing and ask for it themselves.\n\nIn addition, Roland added, some doctors might be afraid of missing very early cervical cancer and getting sued if they screen less frequently.\n\nBut if doctors and hospitals want to rein in spending and limit unnecessary risks, that attitude has to change, researchers agreed.\n\n\u201cWe need to shift toward the wellness visit as opposed to, \u2018You have to come in here every year for a Pap,\u2019\u201d Castle said.\n\nWomen should talk to their doctors about screening, especially if they think they are being screened too often, researchers added.\n\n\u201cA woman should know what test is being used,\u201d said Dr. Mona Saraiya, a co-author on the new study. \u201cOften a provider just does the HPV test\u201d without telling the patient. \u201cA woman should say, \u2018What screening tests are you doing on me?\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd if doctors want women to come back again next year, women should ask them why, Saraiya said.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The entire story was about cervical cancer screening being made TOO available too often.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Parkinson\u2019s disease is a progressive neurological disease that causes symptoms including muscle tremors, shaking, and stiffness.

Also, the longer patients used statin drugs, the greater their reduction in risk for colorectal cancer.\n\nThe findings are based on a review of 22 studies published through October 2009 and were presented at the American College of Gastroenterology's (ACG) 75th Annual Scientific meeting in San Antonio.\n\nStudy researcher N.

Other laboratory rats from the same age group were assigned to receive placebo treatment, saline injections instead of stem cells. Both groups of aged rats were compared to a group of young rats with an average age of 4 months.\n\nBaseline heart function was measured in all rats, using echocardiograms, treadmill stress tests and blood analysis. The group of older rats underwent an additional round of testing one month after receiving cardiosphere-derived cells that came from young rats.\n\n\"The way the cells work to reverse aging is fascinating,\" Marb\u00e1n said. \"They secrete tiny vesicles that are chock-full of signaling molecules such as RNA and proteins. The vesicles from young cells appear to contain all the needed instructions to turn back the clock.\"\n\nResults of those tests show lab rats that received the cardiosphere-derived cells:\n\u2022 Demonstrated longer heart cell telomeres, compound structures located at the ends of chromosomes that shrink with age\n\u2022 Improved their exercise capacity by an average of approximately 20 percent\n\u2022 Regrew hair faster than rats that didn't receive the cells\n\n\"This study didn't measure whether receiving the cardiosphere-derived cells extended lifespans, so we have a lot more work to do,\" said Lilian Grigorian-Shamagian, MD, PhD, co-primary investigator and the first author of the study. \"We have much to study, including whether CDCs need to come from a young donor to have the same rejuvenating effects and whether the extracellular vesicles are able to reproduce all the rejuvenating effects we detect with CDCs.\"\n\nSince Marb\u00e1n's team completed the world's first cardiac stem cell infusion in 2009, the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute has made significant contributions to decoding and understanding how cardiac stem cells regenerate damaged heart muscle. The team is studying the use of stem cells to treat patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy as well as patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, a condition that affects more than 50 percent of all heart failure patients.\n\nGeneral support for Marb\u00e1n's laboratory is provided by the National Institutes of Health. The CDCs, manufactured by Capricor Inc. (NASDAQ: CAPR) as their product CAP-1002, have been used in other human clinical trials.\n\nThe process to grow cardiac-derived stem cells was developed by Marb\u00e1n when he was on the faculty of Johns Hopkins University and further developed at Cedars-Sinai. Capricor has licensed the process from Johns Hopkins and from Cedars-Sinai for clinical and commercial development. Capricor has licensed additional intellectual property from Cedars-Sinai and the University of Rome. Cedars-Sinai and Marb\u00e1n have financial interests in Capricor.\n\nThe Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute is internationally recognized for outstanding heart care built on decades of innovation and leading edge research.

A brain biopsy now can be used to detect Alzheimer's plaques but is highly invasive and may miss parts of the brain where the plaques and tangles of Alzheimer's are densest. While diagnosis by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy is under study for early detection , accurate early detection by such noninvasive means is a ways away.\n\nAnd on Monday, the American Academy of Neurology released a new study showing that an agent called florbetaben also allowed detection of amyloid plaques when used with a PET scan. The florbetaben study is to be presented at the academy's \"Emerging Science\" program next week in New Orleans. Both Florbetapir F 18 and florbetaben help diagnose Alzheimer's by sticking to beta amyloid clumps and emitting radioactivity, which can then be picked up by a PET scan.\n\nThose questions are no longer hypothetical. Last week, the FDA approved an agent called Florbetapir F 18 injection (to be marketed as Amyvid), which will allow physicians using a positron emissions tomography (PET) scan to detect the presence and extent of amyloid plaques in patients concerned about declining mental function.\n\nNo one wants to hear that he or she has Alzheimer's disease. But if the beta-amyloid plaques that are the disorder's key physical hallmark could be detected before memory loss and cognitive troubles were evident to all, would you want to know? And since no treatment currently works to stem the inexorable progress ofAlzheimer's, who would pay for a costly test to detect it early -- and why?\n\nThe FDA says that Amyvid \"is not a test to predict the development of AD-associated dementia\" in those who have no problematic symptoms. It's an early test for those who already have cognitive concerns and who wonder whether Alzheimer's disease may be the cause. Among patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, about 60% have amyloid plaques and will go on to develop dementia that is likely Alzheimer's disease, said Dr. Michael W. Weiner of the Department of Veterans Affairs' Center for Imaging of Neurodegenerative Diseases.\n\nWeiner is the leading researcher on the largest and most comprehensive Alzheimer's research initiative of its kind, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. ADNI, a nationwide consortium that is still enrolling subjects, is a five-year, $60-million project that will track 800 participants to compare how mental and daily-life skills, and the brain's structure and function, change in those aging normally, those with mild cognitive impairment and those with dementia. Weiner conducted much of the research leading to Amyvid's approval.\n\nFor now, says Weiner, there is \"no consensus\" on which patients should get the costly new PET scans that use Amyvid, and large insurers such as Medicare and Medicaid have not made decisions about coverage for such tests. And some patients may question whether they would want to know that the source of their mental troubles is Alzheimer's disease, said Weiner.\n\n\"But for many, when you take a person to the doctor, you usually want an answer, whether it leads to a treatment or not. This is a way of getting closer to an answer,\" said Weiner. Many patients experiencing cognitive lapses may also be reassured if the test fails to reveal amyloid plaques, he added.\n\nWith growing understanding that the changes of Alzheimer's disease may be decades in the making, the value of early detection is gaining adherents, said Weiner. The \"real game-changer,\" he says, will be when one of the many experimental therapies under study for Alzheimer's disease succeeds in blocking or reversing its progress.

It also includes 1-2 servings of dairy foods (700-820mg calcium), which is less than half the dairy recommended by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) for older Australians.\n\n\u201cLiving in Australia, we have different dietary requirements, notably a need for more calcium to protect against osteoporosis,\u201d Wade says.\n\n\u201cThese needs are unmet in the traditional MedDiet, which makes it difficult for people to adopt in the long term.\n\n\u201cThis study delivers healthier options for Australians by tailoring the nutrients in the MedDiet to meet the needs of a non-Mediterranean population.\n\n\u201cIn Australia, women up to age 50 years \u2013 and men up to age 70 years \u2013 should consume 1000mg per day of calcium per day and 1300mg thereafter, which is roughly between 3.5 and 4.5 serves a day.\n\n\u201cThe new MedDairy diet allows for three to four servings with dairy, which means Australians can more sustainably meet their recommended daily nutrient intakes while also maintaining the significant health benefits offered through the MedDiet.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes down to it, people want to be able to enjoy a colourful, tasty and nutritious diet.

One of the best studies the panel found focused on healthy women over age 65 and concluded that screenings spaced eight years or less apart did not make much of a difference in identifying which women would be more at risk for fractures.\n\nThe report identified possible benefits of screening, but noted that there is no solid evidence \u2014 in the form of randomized trials, medicine\u2019s gold standard \u2014 comparing fracture rates of patients who have been screened with those who have not been screened.\n\nBut the panel is in the process of updating its recommendations, which were issued in 2002. A preliminary report in July packed a surprise: No direct evidence was found that testing patients for low bone density helped avoid broken bones. \u201cIt\u2019s still amazing to me,\u2019\u2019 said the report\u2019s lead author, Dr. Heidi Nelson, a professor at Oregon Health & Science University.\n\nThe task force offers no advice for women younger than 60 or for men of any age, though men account for at least 20 percent of US patients with osteoporosis.\n\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force, which sets standards on disease prevention and primary care, suggests that all women get a bone density screening by age 65, or by 60 if a patient might be at high risk for fractures. Risk factors include being female, having a family history of osteoporosis or broken bones, being small and thin, and having low levels of sex hormones, in addition to older age.\n\nOne of the first dilemmas patients typically encounter is when to get screened for osteoporosis, and then how often to repeat the test \u2014 a painless body scan that measures bone density.\n\n\u201cWhat is right in 2010,\u2019\u2019 she said, \u201cmight not be right in 2011 in a rapidly evolving medical science.\u2019\u2019\n\nDr. Felicia Cosman, clinical director of the National Osteoporosis Foundation and a professor at Columbia University, said the swirl of new information makes it critical for patients to review with their physicians their treatment decisions.\n\nEven the issues of how much vitamin D adults should take and whether calcium supplements help keep bones strong have been matters of debate.\n\nThe safety of one of the most popular types of medication used to lessen the risk of fractures \u2014 bisphosphonates, such as Fosamax and Boniva \u2014 has also been questioned.\n\nOver the past several months, studies have raised questions about the effectiveness of screening for osteoporosis, a silent disease that weakens the bones of an estimated 10 million Americans, most over age 50.\n\nSorting through all the recent news about osteoporosis, or low bone density, can be dizzying.\n\nA task force of specialists appointed by the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research reported last month that long-term use of bisphosphonates, typically beyond five years, may increase a patient\u2019s risk of an unusual but serious type of thigh fracture. The panel reviewed 310 such cases and concluded that they represent less than one-half of 1 percent of all American patients taking bisphosphonates. However the panel also said it believed the number of such fractures is under-reported.\n\nThere is little dispute over the conclusion of several studies that bisphosphonates can be effective in lowering patients\u2019 risk of fractures, some by as much as 50 percent. But in recent months, questions have grown about their safety.\n\nBisphosphonates \u2014 the class of drugs that includes Fosamax, Boniva, and others \u2014 were approved by federal regulators in 1995 and have since been prescribed for millions of patients. Taken orally or by injection, the drugs work by slowing the growth of cells that break down bones, giving the edge to other cells that rebuild them.\n\nWhen it comes to the most popular type of osteoporosis treatment, bisphosphonates, the question is not so much about how much to take, but whether there are harmful consequences from long-term use.\n\nAn updated report on recommended levels for both nutrients is due next month from the Institute of Medicine, the health arm of the National Academy of Sciences, which advises the federal government.\n\nThere are fewer differences of opinion among health professionals about calcium levels, with most recommending about 1,200 daily milligrams for adults over 50. However, the most extensive study on the calcium question, done by the Women\u2019s Health Initiative as a randomized controlled trial, was inconclusive. It found no significant reduction in fractures in the study population, which received supplements of 1,000 milligrams of calcium and 400 international units of vitamin D daily.\n\nBeyond the screening question, many physicians routinely ask patients about their calcium and vitamin D intake. The federal government recommends just 400 international units daily of vitamin D for adults over age 50, while the National Osteoporosis Foundation recommends 800 to 1,000 units. Some doctors suggest doubling those higher amounts for post-menopausal women.\n\nWaiting until women are in their 60s to scan will result in missing many who could be diagnosed and treated, she said. \u201cThe reason you want to find people at the time of menopause is because there is acceleration [of bone loss] at this time,\u2019\u2019 Cosman said. This is when estrogen plummets, and estrogen helps protect bone health.\n\n\u201cI believe all women should have a bone screening test approximately at the time of menopause,\u2019\u2019 said Cosman, emphasizing that \u201cthis is my personal opinion as a specialist who treats women,\u2019\u2019 and not representative of her position with the National Osteoporosis Foundation.\n\nIn the absence of clear guidelines, many physicians make their own judgment calls.\n\n\u201cThe thigh is one of the strongest bones in the body and it\u2019s unusual for it to break,\u2019\u2019 said Columbia University professor Dr. Elizabeth Shane, the task force cochair and a specialist who has prescribed the medications to many of her osteoporosis patients.\n\nHer task force recommended that an international registry be created for tracking such cases to help researchers better pinpoint which patients might be at risk. It also called on the US Food and Drug Administration to change medication labeling to alert physicians and patients to the possibility of these unusual fractures, and to urge awareness of possible warning signs: prolonged groin or thigh pain.\n\nIn a statement, the FDA said it is reviewing the data and is considering changing the labeling on bisphosphonates. It also recommended that patients report groin or thigh pain to their physicians, but did not suggest they stop taking the medications unless ordered to do so by their doctors.\n\nIn August, a team of researchers reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association that bisphosphonate use was not linked to an increased risk of stomach or esophageal cancer. The scientists reviewed about 80,000 patient records from a 6 million-person database in Britain.\n\nBut in September, a different group of scientists used the same database and concluded in an article in the British Medical Journal that bisphosphonates appeared to double the risk of esophageal cancer after about 5 years of use. Still, this group stressed the risk was very small, resulting in 2 cases of throat cancer in 1,000 people ages 60 to 79, compared with the normal rate of 1 per 1,000.\n\nSome doctors are giving their patients \u201cdrug holidays\u2019\u2019 in which they take them off the prescriptions for a while.\n\nPhysicians face a tough choice when it comes to frail patients who have brittle bones. If they pull them off the medications because of the possible risk of serious side effects with longer-term use, there is little else to prescribe.\n\nFor Dr. Douglas C. Bauer, a professor at the University of California-San Francisco and a researcher who also treats many osteoporosis patients, the hardest decision is when to stop the drugs in patients who still have low bone density after five years of treatment but are not especially frail.\n\n\u201cIt was appropriate to treat them to begin with, but you are not clear on added benefit for prolonged use beyond five years,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cSo I ask them, \u2018What would you like to do?\u2019 And I explain the data and say it\u2019s a gray area, and I say we can decide together.\u2019\u2019", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "All the screening, prevention, and treatment approaches described in this article are widely available and their availability doesn\u2019t merit extensive discussion.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Dr. Eric P. Winer, chief of women\u2019s cancers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said that even women who completed their five years of tamoxifen months or years ago might consider starting on the drug again.\n\nTamoxifen blocks the effect of the hormone estrogen, which fuels tumor growth in estrogen receptor-positive cancers that account for about 65 percent of cases in premenopausal women. Some small studies in the 1990s suggested that there was no benefit to using tamoxifen longer than five years, so that has been the standard.\n\nAbout 227,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year in the United States, and an estimated 30,000 of them are in premenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive cancer and prime candidates for tamoxifen. But postmenopausal women also take tamoxifen if they cannot tolerate the alternative drugs, known as aromatase inhibitors.\n\nThe new study, known as Atlas, included nearly 7,000 women with ER-positive disease who had completed five years of tamoxifen. They came from about three dozen countries. Half were chosen at random to take the drug another five years, while the others were told to stop.\n\nIn the group assigned to take tamoxifen for 10 years, 21.4 percent had a recurrence of breast cancer in the ensuing 10 years, meaning the period 5 to 14 years after their diagnoses. The recurrence rate for those who took only five years of tamoxifen was 25.1 percent.\n\nAbout 12.2 percent of those in the 10-year treatment group died from breast cancer, compared with 15 percent for those in the control group.\n\nThere was virtually no difference in death and recurrence between the two groups during the five years of extra tamoxifen. The difference came in later years, suggesting that tamoxifen has a carry-over effect that lasts long after women stop taking it.\n\nWhether these differences are big enough to cause women to take the drug for twice as long remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cThe treatment effect is real, but it\u2019s modest,\u201d said Dr. Paul E. Goss, director of breast cancer research at the Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nTamoxifen has side effects, including endometrial cancer, blood clots and hot flashes, which cause many women to stop taking the drug. In the Atlas trial, it appears that roughly 40 percent of the patients assigned to take tamoxifen for the additional five years stopped prematurely.\n\nSome 3.1 percent of those taking the extra five years of tamoxifen got endometrial cancer versus 1.6 percent in the control group. However, only 0.6 percent of those in the longer treatment group died from endometrial cancer or pulmonary blood clots, compared with 0.4 percent in the control group.\n\n\u201cOver all, the benefits of extended tamoxifen seemed to outweigh the risks substantially,\u201d Trevor J. Powles of the Cancer Center London, said in a commentary published by The Lancet.\n\nDr. Judy E. Garber, director of the Center for Cancer Genetics and Prevention at Dana-Farber, said many women have a love-hate relationship with hormone therapies.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t feel well on them, but it\u2019s their safety net,\u201d said Dr. Garber, who added that the news would be welcomed by many patients who would like to stay on the drug. \u201cI have patients who agonize about this, people who are coming to the end of their tamoxifen.\u201d\n\nEmily Behrend, who is a few months from finishing her five years on tamoxifen, said she would definitely consider another five years. \u201cIf it can keep the cancer away, I\u2019m all for it,\u201d said Ms. Behrend, 39, a single mother in Tomball, Tex. She is taking the antidepressant Effexor to help control the night sweats and hot flashes caused by tamoxifen.\n\nCost is not considered a huge barrier to taking tamoxifen longer because the drug can be obtained for less than $200 a year.\n\nThe results, while answering one question, raise many new ones, including whether even more than 10 years of treatment would be better still.\n\nPerhaps the most important question is what the results mean for postmenopausal women. Even many women who are premenopausal at the time of diagnosis will pass through menopause by the time they finish their first five years of tamoxifen, or will have been pushed into menopause by chemotherapy.\n\nPostmenopausal patients tend to take aromatase inhibitors like anastrozole or letrozole, which are more effective than tamoxifen at preventing breast cancer recurrence, though they do not work for premenopausal women.\n\nMr. Peto said he thought the results of the Atlas study would \u201capply to endocrine therapy in general,\u201d meaning that 10 years of an aromatase inhibitor would be better than five years. Other doctors were not so sure.\n\nThe Atlas study was paid for by various organizations including the United States Army, the British government and AstraZeneca, which makes the brand-name version of tamoxifen.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story indicates the drug has been available, studied, and inexpensive.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "An experimental spray improved sex for some men who regularly experience premature ejaculation, according to the results of two studies set to be presented Tuesday at a urology conference.\n\nMen who applied the aerosol spray, a mixture of the anesthetics lidocaine and prilocaine, reached orgasm a mean of 3 minutes 18 seconds after beginning sex, compared with about 56 seconds for those who got a placebo spray.

The present study was aimed to investigate whether such changes can be reversed by daily melatonin ingestion.\n\nThe older we get, the more likely our circadian rhythms are disrupted. For example, blood pressure (BP), not only tends to increase but as well become more irregular. Luckily, as we show in our research, melatonin helps to ameliorate both trends.\n\n63 senior respondents of a mean age of 80 were studied during 3 consecutive weeks. First week control data were collected for 7 successive days. Over the next 2 weeks, the seniors were administered a low dose of melatonin (1.5 mg) each day by night at 10:30 p.m. On the third week data were monitored again.\n\nMelatonin significantly reduced BP. The hypotensive effect was dependent on time. The maximum systolic BP lowering effect of melatonin falls between 3:00 and 8:00 in the morning, the time of the highest risk of heart attacks and strokes. Nighttime and morning BP decreased more profoundly on average -8/3.5 mm Hg for SBP/DBP, respectively.\n\nMoreover, the higher the mean systolic BP was during the first week, the more it dropped on the second week of melatonin administration. Melatonin also decreased the overall variability in BP.\n\nMelatonin ws effective in synchronizing disrupted circadian rhythms of BP, heart rate and body temperature, making these circadian rhythms smoother and less irregular. None of these effects was found in 34 placebo treated seniors, thus ruling out the possibility that rhythms could be improved just because of regular schedule and presence of medical personal who took measurements.\n\nIn conclusion, melatonin can be of great value for aged people suffering from hypertension as an adjuvant substance complementing basic medication as it is able to stabilize circadian BP, heart rate profiles and their phase relationships. The improvement of circadian pacemaker functions may also provide a new strategy in the treatment of hypertension.", "question": "Does the news release establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Melatonin supplements are available almost everywhere.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "SUNDAY, May 8, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Countless people -- often men with enlarged prostates -- need to visit the bathroom during the night. But help could soon be at hand in the form of a nasal spray, new research suggests.\n\nA spritz of a synthetic hormone, already used by bed-wetting kids, might benefit older people struggling with the problem called nocturia.\n\n\"Nocturia is very common in patients over 50 years old, and can cause significant problems by causing loss of sleep, and injury due to falls,\" said study lead author Dr. Jed Kaminetsky.\n\nThe millions of people with nocturia wake up two or more times a night to urinate. Besides an enlarged prostate, Kaminetsky said, common causes are bladder problems, poor circulation and obesity.\n\nKaminetsky is a clinical assistant professor of urology at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City.\n\nIn the United States there's no approved drug to treat the problem, the study authors said.\n\nThe new drug, while promising, is of concern because of its potential to lower blood sodium levels in the elderly, one doctor said. Meanwhile, another researcher suggested that exercise might help stave off nocturia.\n\nKnown as SER-120, the nasal spray contains desmopressin, a low-dose synthetic version of the naturally occurring hormone vasopressin. Vasopressin, an anti-diuretic, reduces urine production.\n\nSER-120 appears to delay urine production for four to six hours during sleep, said Kaminetsky, \"and wears off by morning when patients awaken and start to drink fluids.\"\n\nHe is scheduled to present his team's research Sunday in San Diego at a meeting of the American Urological Association. The research was funded by the spray's manufacturer, Serenity Pharmaceuticals.\n\nDesmopressin is commonly used to treat bed-wetting among children ages 6 and up, the study authors pointed out.\n\nTo assess its potential in adults, the study team enlisted nearly 1,400 men and women, 50 and older, who had a history of nocturia.\n\nFor three months, participants were randomly assigned to use either the desmopressin spray (two doses were tried) or a non-medicinal spray (a placebo).\n\nPatients kept three-day urination diaries, and filled out quality-of-life questionnaires.\n\nDesmopressin spray prompted \"a significant decrease\" in the frequency of nightly bathroom trips compared with the untreated group, Kaminetsky said. On average, patients reported at least two fewer episodes a night.\n\nThe treatment group also experienced a \"significant increase\" in the length of time they could sleep before awakening to urinate. That uninterrupted sleep period extended to more than four hours, Kaminetsky said.\n\nThe researchers also found that those in the higher-dose spray group experienced a \"significant improvement\" in overall quality of life, compared with the untreated group.\n\nThough SER-120 is still considered investigational, Kaminetsky said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is reviewing the findings, with a possible decision late this year.\n\nDr. Tomas Griebling, a professor of urology at the University of Kansas, described the study results as \"promising,\" but added a note of caution.\n\n\"Other researchers have examined the utility and safety of desmopressin for the treatment of nocturia in the past,\" he said. \"However, there have been concerns about safety, particularly in elderly patients.\"\n\nGriebling said the American Geriatrics Society includes desmopressin in the Beers Criteria for potentially inappropriate medications for older adults, primarily because of concerns about resulting low blood sodium levels.\n\nBut the lower doses used in this study (1.5 or 0.75 mcg) \"may help to improve the overall safety profile, particularly for geriatric patients,\" he said. \"Additional research will be needed to fully answer this question in the future.\"\n\nThe study team said two of the higher-dose patients developed significantly low blood sodium levels (hyponatremia) as did one person taking the placebo.\n\nDr. Julien Dagenais, a urologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, explored nocturia from another angle. He analyzed physical activity data reported by more than 10,000 men and women (aged 20 and older) in a U.S. health and nutrition survey conducted between 2005 and 2010.\n\nPeople who reported higher levels of exercise were less likely to suffer from nocturia, Dagenais found. This suggests that the anti-inflammatory impact of routine exercise may minimize nocturia, he said.\n\nThese findings will also be presented at the American Urological Association meeting. Data and conclusions presented at meetings are usually considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nThere's more on nocturia at the National Association for Continence.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story makes it clear that it\u2019s not FDA approved yet.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A female testosterone patch showed promise at boosting older women's enjoyment of sex, but concerns about the cancer risk of hormone therapies mean U.S. women won't be getting an equivalent of Viagra anytime soon.\n\nProcter & Gamble Co., the Cincinnati consumer-products giant, has worked since 1999 to secure U.S. approval for its Intrinsa patch, intended to increase sex drive and satisfaction in women after menopause.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story makes plain that the female testosterone patch is not available in the United States but is on the market in Europe.

In the United States, physicians diagnose more than 10,000 cases each year. While more than 4,000 American women die of the disease each year, the mortality rate has dropped more than 50 percent in the past four decades, largely due to the advent of well-organized screening and diagnostic programs.\n\nWhile the Pap smear can be performed by a non-specialist, colposcopy requires visualization of the cervix, relying on highly trained professionals and expensive equipment that is not easily accessible to underserved populations. These factors make cervical cancer more prevalent in women living in low socioeconomic communities.\n\nIn a new paper published on May 31 in the journal PLOS One, researchers from Duke believe they have found a better way.\n\n\"The mortality rate of cervical cancer should absolutely be zero percent because we have all the tools to see and treat it,\" said Nimmi Ramanujam, the Robert W. Carr, Jr., Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Duke. \"But it isn't. That is in part because women do not receive screening or do not follow up on a positive screening to have colposcopy performed at a referral clinic. We need to bring colposcopy to women so that we can reduce this complicated string of actions into a single touch point.\"\n\nCurrent standard practices for cervical cancer screening require three things: a speculum, a colposcope and a trained professional to administer the test.\n\nThe speculum is a metal device designed to spread the vaginal walls apart. The colposcope is a magnified telescopic device and camera designed to allow medical professionals to look through the speculum to see the cervix, which is located three to six inches inside the vagina. Colposcopes and people who know how to use them are difficult to find in many low-income regions, both domestically and internationally.\n\nRamanujam believes she can replace at least two of these requirements. Her laboratory has developed an all-in-one device that resembles a pocket-sized tampon with lights and a camera at one end. Health providers -- or even women themselves -- are able to capture images of the cervix using the rounded tip of the device to manipulate its position if necessary. The device also includes a channel through which contrast agents used for the cervical cancer screening procedure can be applied.\n\n\"We recruited 15 volunteers on Duke's campus to try out the new integrated speculum-colposcope design,\" said Mercy Asiedu, a graduate student working on the project in Ramanujam's lab. \"Nearly everyone said they preferred it to a traditional speculum and more than 80 percent of the women who tried the device were able to get a good image. Those that couldn't felt that they just needed some practice.\"\n\nRamanujam and Asiedu are now working on clinical trials to see how their design stacks up against the traditional colposcopy used with a speculum. By using both methods to visualize the cervix, the researchers will be able to make a direct comparison.\n\nAsiedu is also working to automate the screening process. By using image processing and machine learning to teach computers how to spot signs of precancerous and cancerous cells, Asiedu hopes to remove the need for a trained physician at any point in the screening process and shift the task to midwives, community health workers and even the women themselves.\n\n\"There have been a few other attempts to come up with a better solution, but none of them have succeeded,\" said Asiedu. \"One design using an inflatable cylinder proved just as uncomfortable as a traditional speculum. Another using directed airflow is just as bulky and expensive as a modern colposcope. With our handheld, low-cost design, we're hoping to redefine the entire procedure.\"\n\nThis work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (1R01CA195500, 1R01CA193380).\n\nCITATION: \"Design and Preliminary Analysis of a Vaginal Inserter for Speculum-Free Cervical Cancer Screening,\" Asiedu MN, Agudogo J, Krieger M, Miros, R, Proeschold-Bell, RJ, Schmitt JW, Ramanujam N.

According to the Medical University of South Carolina, current available treatments include SSRIs and other drug treatments that treat side effects and can cost from US$60.00 - US$535.00 per month.\n\nMore than 200 different symptoms have been associated with PMS, including emotional symptoms such as: stress, anxiety, insomnia, fatigue, mood swings, emotional sensitivity and/or changes in libido.

The findings were published today in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research.\n\n\"The development of osteoporosis drugs by pharmaceutical companies has focused heavily on blocking CatK in recent years,\" said Dieter Br\u00f6mme, a professor in the faculty of dentistry and a Canada Research Chair in Proteases and Disease. \"All clinical trials to date have failed due to side effects ranging from stroke, skin fibrosis and cardiovascular issues.

Men with high-risk cancer need long-term hormone therapy.\n\nThe hormone therapy is known as androgen deprivation therapy. It's designed to reduce the levels of male hormones (androgens) in the body, since they can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells.\n\n\"For patients with early, localized cancer of the prostate who were treated with radiation therapy, [by] adding short-term androgen deprivation therapy, we improved their cure rates and increased their chance of living 10 years from 57 percent to 62 percent,\" said lead researcher Dr. Christopher U. Jones, from Radiological Associates of Sacramento, Calif.\n\nBut when the researchers looked closely at those findings, they found that patients with low-risk prostate cancer did not need hormone therapy because the chance they would survive with radiation alone was already almost 99 percent, Jones said.\n\nAnd while short term hormonal therapy is \"not very toxic, there are [still] some toxicities,\" Jones noted. \"We don't want to treat any man unnecessarily with that type of treatment. We really want to make sure -- if we are going to recommend that treatment -- the person really needs it,\" he said.\n\nOn the other hand, hormone therapy plus radiation was most effective in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer. \"We decreased the risk of dying from prostate cancer in those patients from 10 percent to 3 percent, at 10 years,\" Jones said.\n\nFor patients with high-risk prostate cancer, using hormone therapy for just a short while is not effective, he added. \"We know from other studies that short-term androgen deprivation therapy isn't enough. You need to give long-term androgen deprivation therapy in addition to radiation to have the best results,\" Jones said.\n\nThe report was published in the July 14 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nFor the study, Jones' team randomly assigned almost 2,000 men with prostate cancer to radiation therapy alone or in combination with four months of hormone therapy. The hormone therapy started two months before radiation.\n\nSide effects of male hormone therapy can include erectile dysfunction (impotence), loss of sex drive, hot flashes, growth of breast tissue, loss of muscle and bone mass, weight gain, nausea, liver problems, fatigue, memory problems and mood swings.\n\nIn October 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration asked manufacturers to add a warning that certain drugs used in hormone therapy (including the one used in the study) were linked to a small but increased risk of diabetes, heart attack, stroke and sudden death in men.\n\nIn this study, men treated with hormone therapy experienced a much higher percentage of liver damage; toxic effects of radiation treatment were similar in both groups.\n\nOver an average of over nine years of follow-up, 62 percent of the men who had combination therapy were alive, compared with 57 percent of the men who received radiation therapy alone, the researchers found.\n\nOverall, hormone therapy reduced the risk of dying from prostate cancer over 10 years from 8 percent to 4 percent, Jones said.\n\nHe noted that the radiation treatments in use today differ from those given in 1994 when the trial began.\n\n\"We can give 15 to 20 percent higher doses of radiation now than we could then, and we can do it more safely and more accurately,\" he said. So, that brings into question how much, if any, hormone therapy is needed, he added.\n\nAn ongoing trial among patients with intermediate risk prostate cancer aims to answer that question, Jones said. \"We are going to find out if androgen deprivation therapy still applies to patients treated with modern techniques,\" he said.\n\n\"This study, in conjunction with what we know about hormonal therapy, really nails home the conclusion that hormonal therapy should not be used in men with low-risk disease because the risks outweigh any conceivable benefit,\" commented Dr. Anthony D'Amico, chief of radiation oncology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and author of an accompanying journal editorial.\n\nD'Amico noted that new studies using up-to-date high-dose radiation also found that the addition of short-term hormone therapy improved outcomes at five years for men with intermediate risk prostate cancer, compared with radiation alone.\n\n\"If you are in the low-risk category, stay away from hormone therapy. It does no good. [It] can hurt,\" D'Amico said. \"If you have anything beyond low-risk [prostate cancer], the hormonal therapy helps,\" he said. \"It's just a matter of how long you need it for. It could be four months, six months or longer.\"\n\nThese findings are good news for some men, since the effects of short term of hormone therapy are reversible, D'Amico said. \"It's not three years, where men are changed forever,\" he said.\n\nFor more information on prostate cancer, visit the American Cancer Society.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "The story explained about the treatment used in the study reported on as well as how radiation therapy has changed since the men in the study were treated.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "TUESDAY, Jan. 19, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- DNA testing for the human papillomavirus should replace the Pap smear as the main way to screen women for cervical cancer, according to Italian researchers.\n\nTheir recommendation is based on a study that found that the human papillomavirus (HPV) test prevented more cases of cervical cancer than the conventional Pap smear. Results of the study were published online Jan. 19 in The Lancet Oncology.\n\nThe HPV test should become the screening tool of choice for women 35 and older, the researchers said. It could be done less frequently than the Pap test, which could be used only in women who have tested positive for HPV, they said.\n\nThe Pap smear, first introduced in the 1950s, looks for changes in the cervix that could lead to cervical cancer. The HPV test works a step further back in the process, looking to see if women are infected with HPV.\n\nHPV causes cervical cancer, which remains a significant health problem, particularly in less resource-rich areas of the world.\n\nDNA testing for HPV, though, does have drawbacks -- namely that it is less specific, meaning it is likely to pick up more false-positives, than a Pap smear. This results in many more callbacks for women to undergo further testing.\n\nUsing HPV as a primary screening tool results in a callback rate of about 25 to 30 percent, said Dr. Mark Einstein, a gynecologic oncologist and director of clinical research at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City. By contrast, Pap smears have a callback rate of about 5 to 7 percent, he said.\n\nFor their study, the Italian researchers compared HPV testing alone with HPV testing plus a Pap smear in 94,370 women aged 25 to 60 years old.\n\nDuring the first phase of the study, women 35 to 60 who tested positive for HPV were given a cervical examination, called a colposcopy. Younger women got a colposcopy if their Pap smear was abnormal or if HPV results were positive several times, indicating that their body had not been able to clear the infection.\n\nScreening for HPV DNA appeared more effective in older women, but the testing in younger women led to over-diagnosis of a particular type of cervical lesion, the study found.\n\nNot all experts agree, though, that current practice would change based on the study's findings alone.\n\n\"I don't think this is going to change any strategies we do now, but I do think it's more evidence that HPV testing can predict who's going to develop cervical cancer,\" said Dr. Jay Brooks, chairman of hematology/oncology at Ochsner Health System in Baton Rouge, La. \"HPV testing, in certain populations, can really predict who would benefit from treatment.\"\n\nEinstein had a somewhat different take on the findings. \"This shows that the strategy does work,\" he said. \"It does make sense, it's cost-effective and effective. This is happening in single-payer health systems which have national screening. We're behind in the U.S.\"\n\nThe strategy makes particular sense in less-developed countries, where women could do an HPV test themselves with a \"self swab\" and then send the swab in for analysis, Einstein said.\n\nIn the United States, cervical cancer screening guidelines were changed in November. Women now are being told that they should get their first screening for cervical cancer -- including a Pap test -- at age 21. The previous recommendation was to start Pap tests three years after becoming sexually active or at age 21, whichever came first.\n\nAnd, rather than have an annual Pap test, most women need to be screened every other year or less, depending on their age, according to the new guidelines.\n\nCervical cancer rates have dropped more than 50 percent in the last 30 years in the United States, according to the guidelines. That decline has been largely attributed to widespread use of the Pap test.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on cervical cancer screening.", "question": "Does the story establish the availability of the treatment/test/product/procedure?", "explanation": "Clearly the HPV DNA test and pap tests are both available in the US.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Dec. 13, 2010 -- Acupuncture treatments to treat one type of lazy eye proved as good as the traditional patching of the eye used to help the eyes work together, according to a new study.

U.S. experts familiar with the study call it interesting but say the treatment needs more study and wonder if it would catch on in the U.S.\n\nWhile some previous research has found acupuncture for lazy eye effective, the researchers couldn't find a study that directly compared acupuncture with conventional treatments such as patching. So Dennis Lam, MD, a researcher at the Joint Shantou International Eye Center of Shantou University and Chinese University of Hong Kong, and his colleagues evaluated 88 children, ages 7 to 12, with the condition known as anisometropic amblyopia, in which there is a difference in the degree of nearsightedness or farsightedness between the two eyes. They assigned 43 children to the acupuncture group, and they received five treatments a week. Acupuncturists used five different points in the head, face, hand, and leg. The children were instructed to do an hour per day of near-vision activities such as homework or computer work. Another 45 children wore a patch over their normal eye for two hours daily, a typical regimen, and were also asked to do an hour of near-vision activity a day.\n\nAt 15 weeks, visual acuity with eyeglasses improved by about 1.8 lines on the vision chart in the patched eyes and 2.3 lines in those who had acupuncture. An improvement of two lines or more occurred in nearly 67% of those in the patching group but nearly 76% of those in the acupuncture group. Ambylopia was evaluated as resolved in nearly 17% of patched eyes but nearly 42% of the acupuncture group.

These conditions included generalized, social, and separation anxiety disorder as well as having a parent with bipolar disorder. Over the course of 12 weeks, each participant underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans while they practiced mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, a wide range of theraputic techiniques that include meditation, yoga, and learning how to pay nonjudgmental attention to one's life.\n\n\"These integrative approaches expand traditional treatments and offer new strategies for coping with psychological distress,\u201d said the study\u2019s co-author Sian Cotton, director of the UC's Center for Integrative Health and Wellness, in a statement. \"Mindfulness-based therapeutic interventions promote the use of meditative practices to increase present-moment awareness of conscious thoughts, feelings, and body sensations in an effort to manage negative experiences more effectively.\u201d\n\nChildren who are at a high risk for bipolar disorder or other anxiety disorders, such as the participants, often have poor coping skills when confronted by stress, and only a lucky few get help. According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, 80 percent of children with a diagnosed anxiety disorder and 60 percent of those diagnosed with depression do not receive treatment. Some mental health professionals have suggested that mindfulness exercises can help bridge the treatment gap, and there is some encouraging, if early, evidence showing that these techniques can be used to prevent relapses of depression or anxiety.\n\nCotton noted the anxiety of their patients was significantly reduced following treatment, and the more mindfulness they practiced, the less anxious they felt. Both findings reaffirm the potential that mindfulness therapy could bring to the table. If nothing else, it might allow people who would be reluctant to take medication more treatments to choose from. \"Increasingly, patients and families are asking for additional therapeutic options, in addition to traditional medication-based treatments, that have proven effectiveness for improved symptom reduction. Mindfulness-based therapies for mood disorders is one such example with promising evidence,\" said Cotton, adding the university is both studying and implenting these therapies.\n\nAfter the 12-week experiment, Cotton and his colleagues found mindfulness therapy increased neural activity in a part of the brain that plays in a role in processing cognitive and emotion information known as the cingulate. The therapy was also able to increase brain activity in the insula, a part of the brain that helps monitor how the body feels psychologically.\n\n\"This raises the possibility that treatment-related increases in brain activity during emotional processing may improve emotional processing in anxious youth who are at risk for developing bipolar disorder,\u201d said fellow co-author Dr. Jeffrey Strawn, a professor in UC's Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, as well as director of the Anxiety Disorders Research Program, in a statement. \"The path from understanding the effects of psychotherapy on brain activity to the identification of treatment response is a challenging one, and will require additional studies of emotional processing circuits.\u201d\n\nSource: Strawn JR, Cotton S, Luberto CM, et al.

Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. But because vision damage often occurs gradually, most people with the eye disease do not realize they have it until a good deal of their sight has been lost. If caught early, though, there are medications and procedures that may help treat glaucoma. In the study, researchers were able to predict who was at increased risk of developing the eye disease with some accuracy by measuring blood vessel thickness in the retinas of study participants using a computer-based imaging tool. Those with the narrowest vessels at the beginning of the study were four times more likely to have developed glaucoma a decade later.\n\nAbout 3 million Americans and 60 million people worldwide have glaucoma, and the numbers are projected to rise over the next few decades as the population ages.

The shot turned off a newly identified cholesterol regulator, PCSK9, which interferes with the liver's ability to clear bad cholesterol from the bloodstream.\n\nThe findings were presented Monday at the American Heart Association (AHA) annual meeting in Orlando, Fla. The study was funded by AMG145 manufacturer Amgen Inc.\n\nHigh cholesterol is a major risk factor for heart disease. The first step toward lowering cholesterol is typically lifestyle changes, which include eating a low-fat diet and regular physical activity.

This appears to be due to increased use of technology to detect thyroid nodules that may not otherwise been found previously. Most thyroid cancers can be treated successfully, but advanced cases can be difficult to treat, especially if they do not respond to radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy. New treatments called \u2018immunotherapies\u2019 are being explored. They target a certain protein that has the ability to shut down T cells \u2013 a part of white blood cells that help the body fight infection and disease naturally. In blocking this activity, these new immunotherapy drugs help T cells get back to work in protecting the body.\n\nJanice M. Mehnert, MD, director of the Phase I and Developmental Therapeutics Program at Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, is the lead author of research highlighting the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab and its effect on advanced thyroid cancer. The work is being presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting which begins tomorrow in Chicago. Dr. Mehnert, who is also a medical oncologist in the Melanoma and Soft Tissue Oncology Program at Rutgers Cancer Institute, shares more about the research:\n\nQ: How was the study structured?A: At the time our abstract was submitted, 22 patients with a diagnosis of advanced or metastatic papillary or follicular thyroid cancer who failed prior standard therapy were accrued from multiple international sites. Participants received 10 mg of pembrolizumab every two weeks for up to 24 months or until confirmed progression or unacceptable toxicity. Safety, tolerability and response were assessed every eight weeks for the first six months and every 12 weeks thereafter.\n\nQ: What did you find?A: At the time we reported our results, six of the 22 patients remained on treatment. Of those who completed therapy, two patients had a partial response for an overall response rate of 9.1 percent, and there was a stable disease rate of 54.5 percent. The six-month overall survival rate was 100 percent and the six month progression free survival rate was 58.7 percent. Updated results will be announced at the annual meeting. There were no treatment-related deaths or therapy discontinuations due to drug-related adverse effects. Overall, pembrolizumab shows promising antitumor activity in advanced cases of follicular or papillary thyroid cancer which progressed on standard treatment. The clinical benefit of pembrolizumab in advanced thyroid cancer will be further studied in a follow-up phase II clinical trial that is now ongoing to try to discover biomarkers which predict response to treatment with pembrolizumab.\n\nQ: How are immunotherapy drugs changing the landscape of cancer treatment?A: Although many patients treated do not respond, when immunotherapy does induce responses in patients with advanced cancers, these responses may be very long lasting in terms of disease control. As well, at least when used as single agents, these agents tend to confer side effects that patients find much more tolerable than those associated with chemotherapy. It\u2019s an exciting time in early phase drug development when we are observing these results in so many different types of cancer.

The study was published online Aug. 6, 2015, in the European Heart Journal.\n\nThe findings may sway the ongoing debate over testosterone therapy's benefits and risks, especially for the heart. Studies over the past few years have yielded mixed results, although part of that might stem from differing patient populations and research methods.\n\nFor example, the new VA study excluded men with a history of heart attacks or strokes, although it did include those with existing heart disease. A much-cited VA database study that was published in JAMA in 2013 looked specifically at men with coronary artery disease; about 20 percent of the total study group of around 8,700 men had suffered a prior heart attack.\n\nSo far, the medical community lacks results from any definitive clinical trial that might provide clear guidance. Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration issued guidance earlier in 2015 advising clinicians about the over-use of testosterone therapy, and pointing to a possible increased risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\nThe new VA study is likely to draw attention because of its large size and relatively long follow-up period.\n\nDr. Rajat Barua, the paper's corresponding author, says the study is also noteworthy because of its finding that administering the right dose is critical: Treating \"low T\" but not restoring levels to normal doesn't appear to impart much benefit, at least in terms of cardiovascular risk. Testosterone isn't prescribed with the goal of improving heart health, but that is a consideration in many cases.\n\n\"It is the first study to demonstrate that significant benefit is observed only if the dose is adequate to normalize the total testosterone levels,\" Barua and his coauthors wrote. \"Patients who failed to achieve the therapeutic range after testosterone replacement therapy did not see a reduction in [heart attack] or stroke and had significantly less benefit on mortality.\"\n\nBarua is with the Kansas City (Mo.) VA Medical Center. He's also an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Kansas.\n\nThe study team looked at national data on more than 83,000 men with documented low testosterone, all age 50 or above, who received care in VA between 1999 and 2014.\n\nThe researchers divided the men into three clinical groups: those who were treated to the point where their total testosterone levels returned to normal (Group 1); those who were treated but without reaching normal (Group 2); and those who were untreated and remained at low levels (Group 3).\n\nImportantly, all three groups were \"propensity matched\" so the comparisons would be between men with similar health profiles. The researchers took into account a wide array of factors that might affect cardiovascular and overall risk. They included, for example, age, body mass index, various chronic diseases, LDL cholesterol levels, and the use of aspirin, beta blockers, and statins.\n\nThe average follow-up across the groups ranged from 4.6 to 6.2 years.\n\nThe sharpest contrast emerged between Group 1 (those who were treated and attained normal levels) and Group 3 (those whose low testosterone went untreated). The treated men were 56 percent less likely to die during the follow-up period, 24 percent less likely to suffer a heart attack, and 36 percent less likely to have a stroke.\n\nThe differences between Group 1 and Group 2 (those who were treated but did not attain normal levels) were similar but less pronounced.\n\nLittle difference emerged between Groups 2 and 3, except for a slight benefit in survival for those who were treated.\n\nBarua and colleagues say they don't know the exact reasons for testosterone's apparent benefits for the heart and overall survival. \"The mechanisms for these effects remain speculative,\" they write. Possible explanations, they say, could involve body fat, insulin sensitivity, lipids, blood platelets, inflammation, or other biological pathways. More research is needed, they say, to clarify how testosterone affects the cardiovascular system.\n\nWhile the new study results do seem to advocate for testosterone replacement therapy, Barua stresses the need for \"appropriate screening, selection, dosing, and follow-up of patients to maximize the benefit of testosterone therapy.\"\n\nThe authors also caution that \"off-label\" use remains a concern. In other words, doctors should not write a prescription simply because an older man is complaining of symptoms such as low energy and low sex drive. According to the FDA, \"Testosterone products are FDA-approved only for use in men who lack or have low testosterone levels in conjunction with an associated medical condition.

Currently, there is no treatment that slows the progression of the disease, which is the leading cause of vision loss in people over 65.\n\n\u201cThis is the first study to show preservation of vision after a single injection of adult-derived human cells into a rat model with age-related macular degeneration,\u201d said Shaomei Wang, MD, PhD, lead author of the study published in the journal STEM CELLS and a research scientist in the Eye Program at the Cedars-Sinai Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute.\n\nThe stem cell injection resulted in 130 days of preserved vision in laboratory rats, which roughly equates to 16 years in humans. Age-related macular degeneration affects upward of 15 million Americans. It occurs when the small central portion of the retina, known as the macula, deteriorates. The retina is the light-sensing nerve tissue at the back of the eye. Macular degeneration may also be caused by environmental factors, aging and a genetic predisposition.\n\nWhen animal models with macular degeneration were injected with induced neural progenitor stem cells, which derive from the more commonly known induced pluripotent stem cells, healthy cells began to migrate around the retina and formed a protective layer. This protective layer prevented ongoing degeneration of the vital retinal cells responsible for vision.\n\nCedars-Sinai researchers in the Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) Core, directed by Dhruv Sareen, PhD, with support from the David and Janet Polak Foundation Stem Cell Core Laboratory, first converted adult human skin cells into powerful induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), which can be expanded indefinitely and then made into any cell of the human body. In this study, these induced pluripotent stem cells were then directed toward a neural progenitor cell fate, known as induced neural progenitor stem cells, or iNPCs.\n\n\u201cThese induced neural progenitor stem cells are a novel source of adult-derived cells which should have powerful effects on slowing down vision loss associated with macular degeneration,\u201d said Clive Svendsen, PhD, director of the Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute and contributing author to the study. \u201cThough additional pre-clinical data is needed, our institute is close to a time when we can offer adult stem cells as a promising source for personalized therapies for this and other human diseases.\u201d\n\nNext steps include testing the efficacy and safety of the stem cell injection in preclinical animal studies to provide information for applying for an investigational new drug.

Co-authors of the paper include Robert Akins, PhD, the project principal investigator, who directs the Center for Pediatric Clinical Research and Development at Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children; UD molecular biologist Adam Marsh, PhD, who is chief science officer at GenPro; and Karyn Robinson, MS and Stephanie Yeager, MS, of Nemours Biomedical Research.\n\nCerebral palsy is a common yet understudied neurodevelopmental problem in the U.S. In fact, there is no national surveillance here, but the CDC estimates that 1 in 323 American children have the condition. CP is a group of disabilities with a wide spectrum of severity. Spastic CP, the most common type, is a lifelong condition characterized by joint stiffness, spasms, and muscle tightness that affects movement and posture and restricts the activity of affected children.\n\nAlthough most children (85-90%) with cerebral palsy are born with it, diagnosis may be delayed until 2+ years of age. A diagnosis is made by monitoring motor milestones; infants thought to be at risk for CP are enrolled in early intervention programs where their progress is closely watched. New and better ways to identify infants with CP are needed so that interventions can start earlier for more children.\n\nNemours, internationally recognized for its CP center at Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, serves a diverse population of more than 3,000 children and young adults with CP, one of the largest programs in the U.S. Clinicians and researchers at Nemours continuously seek to improve the diagnosis and care of CP patients. Funding from the Swank Foundation enabled Nemours to develop a cerebral palsy tissue bank that stores blood and tissue samples from hundreds of surgical patients at Nemours.\n\nIn the study, the research team profiled blood samples collected in a blinded study from children and adolescents 9-19 years to explore whether patients with spastic CP showed differences at the cellular level that routine orthopedic patients (needing ACL repairs, spinal fusions or other surgeries) did not. The researchers identified a strong set of methylation markers, or patterns, that indicate differences in the genome between children with spastic CP and those without it. In a second study, using samples from children aged 2-5 years, the researchers were able to validate their results and predict with 73 percent accuracy whether the blood samples came from children who had CP.\n\n\"The evidence suggests that there is some epigenetic connection,\" said Crowgey. \"If we can do a better job of screening for these at time of birth versus waiting for the disorder to be diagnosed at 2 years of age, then potentially we'll be able to deliver earlier therapeutics and have better outcomes and lower medical costs.\" Medicaid data show that annual medical costs for a child with CP are 10 to 26 times higher than for those without CP.\n\nThe power of data science, analytics and machine learning\n\nThe study leverages a unique statistical method and software platform originally developed by Dr. Marsh at UD and commercialized by GenPro to measure methylation patterns in DNA (a cell's genetic code) using next generation sequencing (NGS) data. NGS is a technique that enables scientists to decode DNA faster and more cheaply than traditional DNA sequencing methods. Each person's genome, or complete set of DNA, is like a word that's the length of 3 billion characters; but spelled with only the letters A, T, C or G. Traditional DNA sequencing techniques decode sections of DNA 700 characters at a time, while NGS takes advantage of parallel computing capabilities, enabling scientists to decode millions of DNA fragments. Subtle changes in a patient's physical health are paralleled by changes in DNA methylation, making it a useful tool to understand disease.\n\n\"Many of the signals that we pick up are based on immune system shifts--meaning the way a person's immune system responds to external stress events. When we find that epigenetic response, or signal, in the genetic sequencing, it provides another line of evidence for clinicians to use in making decisions,\" said Marsh.\n\nThe approach uses sophisticated machine learning techniques and algorithms to sort through hundreds of gigabytes of NGS data looking for these distinct DNA methylation patterns. \"The data set is massive. It's not something a human can do. You need infrastructure, machine learning, data analysis, and data science,\" said Crowgey.\n\nWhile the study findings indicate that there is a consistent signal present in circulating blood cells of children with spastic CP that remains from early childhood to the teenage years, the researchers say they need to further study samples from different age groups, including teenagers, toddlers, and infants from birth to 2 years. Learning more about methylation signals across ages will allow the approach to be further refined to identify cases and also could provide researchers new clues to understanding the cellular processes involved in advancing CP, and consequently, new therapeutics to manage the disease.\n\n\"We're still in the early phases, but the results are extremely promising and we're excited about the sensitivity of the test that we are seeing in our retrospective analysis,\" said Crowgey. If successful, the researchers say the type of blood test in development also may be useful for other disorders, such as infant leukemia.\n\nAkins was optimistic. \"This is an example of the kind of innovation that can happen when people with different skill sets collaborate. The experimental testing went from idea to validated execution in less than 12 months. We're now working toward a goal of eventually forming a clinical diagnostic test and applying it to a broad population.\" Akins added that Nemours is in a unique position for such an undertaking with its large CP population, its growing strength in data science and analytics, and its recent acquisition of newborn screening for the state of Delaware. \"Many issues will need to be addressed, but we predict routine screening for CP in the near (<10 years) future,\" he said.\n\nThis research is funded by the Delaware Bioscience Center for Advanced Technology, the National Science Foundation, the American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine, and Nemours.\n\n\"This blood test could be a game changer. The earlier the diagnosis, the earlier we can direct therapies at the child.

Three years after receiving two administrations of the bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine four weeks apart, all members of a group of adults with longstanding type 1 diabetes showed an improvement in HbA1c to near normal levels - improvement that persisted for the following five years. The study from a Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) research team - published in npj Vaccines - also reports that the effects of BCG vaccine on blood sugar control appear to depend on a totally novel metabolic mechanism that increases cellular consumption of glucose.\n\n\"This is clinical validation of the potential to stably lower blood sugars to near normal levels with a safe vaccine, even in patients with longstanding disease,\" says Denise Faustman, MD, PhD, director of the MGH Immunobiology Laboratory , principal investigator of BCG clinical trials at MGH and senior author of the npj Vaccines report. \"In addition to the clinical outcomes, we now have a clear understanding of the mechanisms through which limited BCG vaccine doses can make permanent, beneficial changes to the immune system and lower blood sugars in type 1 diabetes.\"\n\nFaustman will also present five-year follow-up results of a separate group of BCG clinical trial participants with longstanding type 1 diabetes on Saturday, June 23, at the 78th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association in Orlando.\n\nUsed for almost a century to prevent tuberculosis, BCG has been known for more than 30 years to boost production of a cytokine called tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which may be beneficial in autoimmune diseases both by eliminating the autoreactive T cells that attack an individual's tissues - in the case of type 1 diabetes, pancreatic islets - and by inducing production of regulatory T cells (Tregs) that could prevent an autoimmune reaction. Faustman's team first reported in 2001 that inducing TNF production could cure type 1 diabetes in mice, but since TNF dosing is toxic in humans, clinical trials have utilized BCG for its ability to elevate TNF levels safely.\n\nInitial clinical trial results, published in a 2012 PLOS One paper, reported that two doses of BCG spaced four weeks apart led to reductions in autoreactive T cells, an increase in Tregs and what turned out to be a transient increase in insulin production. But by the end of that short, 20-week trial, there was no reduction in HbA1c, the established measure of blood sugar levels over time. An extension and expansion of that trial with long term follow-up, the current results are based on data from 282 human study participants - 52 with type 1 diabetes who participated in the BCG clinical trials and 230 who contributed blood samples for mechanistic studies.\n\nRegular monitoring of clinical trial participants found that HbA1c levels of those receiving BCG had dropped by more than 10 percent at three years after treatment and by more than 18 percent at four years. That reduction was maintained over the next four years, with treated participants having an average HbA1c of 6.65, close to the 6.5 considered the threshold for diabetes diagnosis, and with no reports of severe hypoglycemia. Participants in the placebo group and in a comparison group of patients receiving no treatment experienced consistent HbA1c elevations over the same eight-year time period.\n\nIn investigating how BCG administration produces its beneficial effects, the research team identified a mechanism never previously seen in humans in response to treatment with any drug - a shifting of the process of glucose metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation, the most common pathway by which cells convert glucose into energy, to aerobic glycolysis, a process that involves significantly greater glucose consumption by cells. The researchers also found that BCG could reduce blood sugar elevations in mice that were caused by means other than autoimmune attack, raising the possibility that BCG vaccines could also be beneficial against type 2 diabetes.\n\nMihai G. Netea, PhD, professor in the Department of Internal Medicine at Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, says of this study, \"The clinical effects and the proposed mechanism demonstrated are exciting and add to the emerging consensus that the BCG vaccine can have a lasting and valuable impact on the immune system. We know, and this study shows, that BCG vaccination induces epigenetic reprogramming at the chromatin architecture level and functional alterations indicative of a permanent change in immunity. The MGH trials and other, larger prevention and intervention trials underway around the globe may lead to a major shift in the prevention and treatment of infections and autoimmunity.\" Netea was not involved in the current study.\n\nThe MGH team's findings set the stage for further testing of BCG administration, including the FDA-approved phase 2 study currently underway, testing multiple BCG doses in a large group of participants with longstanding type 1 diabetes. That trial is fully enrolled, and there are seven additional BCG clinical trial groups currently recruiting or enrolling at MGH, with a pediatric trial in the planning stages.
