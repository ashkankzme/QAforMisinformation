[{"article": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - Women derive twice the benefit from a device to treat heart failure as men, U.S. researchers said on Monday, underscoring the different ways in which men and women experience heart disease.\n\nWomen treated with a combination pacemaker and defibrillator device had a 70 percent reduction in heart failure compared with a 35 percent decline in men, they said.\n\n\u201cOur finding was unexpected, but extremely important because this is the only heart treatment that is clearly better in women than men,\u201d Dr. Arthur Moss of the University of Rochester Medical Center, whose study appears in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, said in a statement.\n\nThe findings come from a large Boston Scientific study of cardiac resynchronization therapy known as MADIT-CRT, in which a pacemaker is used to restore normal coordinated heart beats in people whose damaged hearts are less efficient at pumping blood.\n\nThe device also included a defibrillator used to shock dangerous heart beats back into normal rhythm.\n\nThe original study, published in 2009 in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed patients fared better with a combination cardiac resynchronization therapy and a defibrillator rather than a defibrillator alone.\n\nBut it also suggested that women benefited more from resynchronization therapy than men. In the latest study, Moss and colleagues explore how much better women did, and why.\n\n\u201cWe found there was a dramatic reduction not only in heart failure events, but a very dramatic reduction in death from any cause,\u201d Moss said in a telephone interview.\n\n\u201cThis was far greater than expected. Men got a good result but women got a fantastic result,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe think this is the first (study) to show this.\u201d\n\nMoss said women have often been overlooked in studies of heart disease, which until recently were dominated by men.\n\nOther studies have shown heart attack symptoms are much different in women than in men, something that has been publicized with the American Heart Association\u2019s \u201cGo Red for Women\u201d campaign.\n\nIn the MADIT-CRT trial, women were more likely to suffer heart failure caused by a viral infection of the heart, whereas in men, the condition is more often caused by blocked heart arteries, Moss said.\n\nWomen are also more likely to experience a condition known as left bundle branch block, a pattern of disorganized electrical impulses that responds well when the left side of the heart is treated with a pacemaker.\n\nWomen tend to have smaller hearts than men and Moss said the treatment works better in smaller hearts.\n\nBoston Scientific\u2019s device was originally approved to treat severe heart failure, but last September, U.S. regulators extended the approval to patients with mild heart failure.\n\nIn November, Medtronic Inc showed its heart failure device helped mild heart failure and its study also suggested women benefited more than men.\n\nCurrently, 42 million American women are living with heart disease. It is the leading killer of women in the United States, claiming more women each year than men.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "It seemed clear from the story that the combination device was not new but that its use had recently been expanded.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Pilot study published in the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association finds targeted pressure device significantly increased sleep for those with moderate to severe symptoms\n\nAuthors from Lake Erie Research Institute in Pennsylvania report an adjustable foot wrap caused to treat restless legs syndrome (RLS) is 1.4 times more effective than the standard pharmaceutical treatment. The pilot study published today in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association.\n\nThe eight-week clinical trial involved 30 otherwise healthy adults with moderate to severe restless leg syndrome. Researchers studied Clinical Global Impression responses as well as the mean change in the International Restless Leg Syndrome Study Group Study Scale (IRLSSGS). A meta-analysis was then used to compare the RLS device with three historic studies of the medication ropinirole and a placebo.\n\nClinical Global Impression responses indicated significantly greater improvement with the RLS device (90 percent) compared with ropinirole (63 percent), the current standard dopamine therapy for RLS. Additionally, change in IRLSSGS score was significantly greater for the RLS device (17.22) compared to historic reports for ropinirole versus the placebo (12 versus 8.9 respectively). Patients using the RLS device also reported an 82 percent decrease in sleep loss.\n\nThe RLS device was designed to put adjustable targeted pressure on two muscles in the foot known to relax symptoms of RLS, the abductor hallucis and the flexor hallucis brevis. Researchers indicate that the pressure produced by the device may also stimulate a dopamine release, similar to massage therapy or acupressure.\n\n\"By putting pressure on specific muscles in the feet, we are able to create a response in the brain that relaxes the muscles activated during RLS,\" said Phyllis Kuhn, MS, PhD, and the study's lead researcher. \"It's a near perfect example of the body regulating itself without drugs, many of which have the potential for significant adverse side effects.\"\n\nRestless leg syndrome (RLS) is a neurologic disorder causing unpleasant sensations and an urge to move the legs when at rest. The sleep loss associated with RLS can cause extreme fatigue, anxiety and depression. According to the National Institute of Health, RLS may affect as many as 10 percent of the U.S. population, with more than nine million experiencing moderate to severe symptoms.\n\nUntil recently, potent drugs including opioids, depressants and dopamine agonists have been used to ease symptoms, but each of these is accompanied by negative side effects such as dizziness, nausea, vomiting and the added risk of addiction.\n\n\"Restless legs syndrome really erodes quality of life because it causes extreme fatigue for many patients. As an osteopathic physician, it's a challenge to balance the need to restore sleep while preventing additional harm from medication. These results show promise in otherwise healthy individuals for a nonpharmaceutical option that appears to have rather minor, temporary adverse effects for some users,\" said Rob Danoff, DO, an osteopathic family physician and program at Aria Health Care in Philadelphia.\n\nAdverse effects were reported by seven patients in the study. The effects included pain (1), pins and needles sensation (2), irritability (3), spasm (1) and warm feet (1).\n\nOpen access to the full review is available until September 1, 2016: http://jaoa. .\n\nDisclosures: Dr Kuhn worked without compensation through Lake Erie Research Institute (LERI) during the 5 years of the study of the device and is now receiving compensation for that work.

Symptoms include weakness, muscle stiffness and difficulty thinking--a phenomenon often referred to as \"brain fog.\" MS affects an estimated 2.5 million people worldwide, according to the Multiple Sclerosis Foundation.\n\nDamage to the thalamus, a structure in the middle of the brain that acts as a kind of information hub, and its connections with other parts of the brain play an important role in the cognitive dysfunction many MS patients experience.\n\nResearchers led by Laura De Giglio, M.D., Ph.D., from the Department of Neurology and Psychiatry at Sapienza University in Rome, recently studied the effects of a video game-based cognitive rehabilitation program on the thalamus in patients with MS. They used a collection of video games from the Nintendo Corporation, called Dr. Kawashima's Brain Training, which train the brain using puzzles, word memory and other mental challenges. The games are based on the work of Japanese neuroscientist Ryuta Kawashima, M.D.\n\nTwenty-four MS patients with cognitive impairment were randomly assigned to either take part in an eight-week, home-based rehabilitation program--consisting of 30-minute gaming sessions, five days per week--or be put on a wait list, serving as the control group. Patients were evaluated by cognitive tests and by 3-Tesla resting state functional MRI (RS-fMRI) at baseline and after the eight-week period. Functional imaging when the brain is in its resting state, or not focused on a particular task, provides important information on neural connectivity.\n\n\"Functional MRI allows you to study which brain areas are simultaneously active and gives information on the participation of certain areas with specific brain circuits,\" Dr. De Giglio said. \"When we talk about increased connectivity, we mean that these circuits have been modified, increasing the extension of areas that work simultaneously.\"\n\nAt follow-up, the 12 patients in the video-game group had significant increases in thalamic functional connectivity in brain areas corresponding to the posterior component of the default mode network, which is one of the most important brain networks involved in cognition. The results provide an example of the brain's plasticity, or ability to form new connections throughout life.\n\n\"This increased connectivity reflects the fact that video gaming experience changed the mode of operation of certain brain structures,\" Dr. De Giglio said. \"This means that even a widespread and common use tool like video games can promote brain plasticity and can aid in cognitive rehabilitation for people with neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis.\"\n\nThe modifications in functional connectivity shown in the video game group after training corresponded to significant improvements in test scores assessing sustained attention and executive function, the higher-level cognitive skills that help organize our lives and regulate our behavior.\n\nThe results suggest that video-game-based brain training is an effective option to improve cognitive abilities of patients with MS.\n\nIn the future, the researchers hope to study whether the plasticity induced by video games in MS patients is also related to improvements in other aspects of their daily lives. They also plan to look at how the video game can be integrated into a rehabilitation program together with other rehabilitative techniques.\n\n\"Multiple Sclerosis: Changes in Thalamic Resting-State Functional Connectivity Induced by a Home-based Cognitive Rehabilitation Program.\" Collaborating with Dr. De Giglio were Francesca Tona, M.D., Francesca De Luca, Psy.D., Nikolaos Petsas, M.D., Ph.D., Luca Prosperini, M.D., Ph.D., Valentina Bianchi, Psy.D., Carlo Pozzilli, M.D., Ph.D., and Patrizia Pantano, M.D.\n\nRadiology is edited by Herbert Y.

But robotic surgeries took longer than non-robotic surgeries by about 40 minutes - 3 hours and 11 minutes compared to 2 hours and 29 minutes, on average. Longer surgeries often mean a more tired surgeon and more chances for things to go wrong.\n\nThe robot-surgeon team might not have outperformed the surgeon alone because the procedure was a relatively simple one.\n\nSurgical robots do not operate on their own. Rather, surgeons move electronic instruments that are linked to the movement of other instruments inside the body, while they watch a three-dimensional image of what\u2019s going on inside. One robot can cost around $1.5 million.\n\n\u201cWe were surprised that (surgery with the robot) did not have better outcomes than (the surgeon alone), as we have always believed if you can see more and see better you can do more and do better,\u201d the authors write.\n\nHowever, they suggest that more complicated procedures for severe endometriosis, which might require open surgery, would benefit from the help of a robot.\n\nInexperienced doctors might also take advantage of the robot for surgery if they don\u2019t think they have the skills to do the surgery with only a small cut, Dr. Nezhat said. In this case, the robot could turn what would have to be an open surgery into a simpler one.\n\nDr. Tommaso Falcone, chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Cleveland Clinic, said this study shows that more technology is not always better. Using a robot for basic surgery, like the kind studied here, would be like using a computer to do addition, he told Reuters Health.\n\n\u201cI just need a calculator to add a few things,\u201d said Falcone, who was not involved in the study. \u201cYes it\u2019s true that if I\u2019ve got that supercomputer maybe it looks better. But all I need to do is add 5 and 5.\u201d\n\nEspecially in a time of concern over rising medical costs, \u201cwe should not simply use the highly sophisticated technology just because it\u2019s there,\u201d Falcone said.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The novelty here is that the humans beat the robots.

Some experts think women should start getting them at age 40. Other think women should discuss the pros and cons of the test at 40, decide on an individual basis and start screens routinely at 50. Otto's study only looked at women aged 49 and older.\n\nOtto tracked 755 patients who died from breast cancer from 1995 to 2003 and another 3,739 control patients matched by age and other measures.\n\nAmong the women with breast cancer, nearly 30 percent of tumors were found at screening and about 34 percent between screens. Nearly 36 percent of these women had never had a mammogram.\n\nAdvanced tumors were found in about 30 percent of the patients who had never been screened but in just over 5 percent of those who had mammograms.\n\nWomen who underwent screening reduced their risk of dying from breast cancer by 49 percent. Women aged 70 to 75 had the greatest risk reduction, reducing the risk of dying from breast cancer by 84 percent. The risk reduction in younger women, aged 50 to 69, was smaller, at 39 percent, but still considered substantial.\n\nThe greater risk reduction in women aged 70 to 75, Otto said, is probably a result of the long-term good effects of screening participation in the earlier target age group, 50 to 69, before the upper age limit for screening was extended in the Netherlands from 69 to 75.\n\nThe study findings ''add to the body of evidence supporting the fact that mammography matters in improving detection and survival,\" said Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"This study focuses on survival.\"\n\nThe study, however, has some limitations, Bernik noted. It's not clear, for instance, whether the women who died of cancer got less aggressive treatment or refused treatment. That could have affected survival, of course.\n\nMammography does lead to ''overtreatment\" in some cases, Bernik acknowledged. Some cancers that are found on mammography may not have proven to be an issue in a woman's lifetime. \"But there is no way to figure out which cancers will be a problem or not,\" she said.\n\nTo learn more about mammograms, visit the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "Screening mammography is not a new approach to detecting breast cancer.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "\"If you have a technique to soften the cataract, there appears to be less chance of damage [to the eye ],\" Salz says.\n\n\"There certainly seems to be a benefit to using the laser,\" says American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) spokesman James Salz, MD, clinical professor of ophthalmology at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. He reviewed the findings for WebMD.\n\nMore than 1.5 million cataract surgeries are performed annually in the U.S. One in three mostly older Americans will have the surgery at some point in their lives.\n\nThe surgery is performed to remove the natural lens of the eye after it has become clouded over time. A permanent artificial lens is then implanted to replace the natural lens and provide appropriate vision correction for each patient.\n\nCurrently, most aspects of cataract surgery, including the initial incision and the breakup and removal of the clouded lens from the lens capsule, are performed manually by the surgeon. An ultrasound instrument with a vibrating needle is used to break up the cataracts, and a vacuum sucks them out.\n\nThe new studies looked at using the so-called femtosecond laser to deliver near-infrared light to fragment the cataract into tiny segments prior to removal.\n\n\"The idea is that all the surgeon will have to do is remove the pieces with a vacuum,\" says researcher Mark Packer, MD, of Oregon Health and Sciences University in Portland. \"Ideally, you won't need ultrasound, or at least you'll need less ultrasound.\"\n\nThat's important because ultrasound can cause collateral damage to the eye, he says. It can hinder recovery and cause clouding of the cornea, which is the clear outer layer of the eye.\n\nAlthough approved by the FDA, the femtosecond laser procedure is not widely used in the U.S., according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The story did not exaggerate the novelty of this procedure, which is just starting to be evaluated clinically.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "\u201cThe evidence to date does not come close to establishing that there would be a loss to public health from making this information widely available from credible sources. \u201d\n\nBUFFALO, N.Y. \u2013 Millions of people visit the websites of the Mayo Clinic, American Cancer Society and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, among others, seeking authoritative health information. But are they receiving it?\n\nWhen it comes to learning about the differences in risk among certain types of nicotine products, many government websites are actually misleading or under-informing the public, according to two researchers who analyzed the content of numerous health websites.\n\nThis \"information quarantine\" in turn helps explain the woeful lack of public knowledge about relative risks, violating basic consumer rights as well as the public health principles of individual rights and health literacy, the researchers say.\n\n\n\nWriting in the International Journal of Drug Policy, Lynn Kozlowski of the University at Buffalo and David Sweanor of the University of Ottawa point out that many websites omit information showing that products such as e-cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and snus are far less harmful than traditional cigarettes.\n\n\u201cPublic health ethics always has a concern to avoid any net harm to population health,\u201d explains Kozlowski, professor of community health and health behavior at UB and the paper\u2019s lead author.\n\n\u201cThe fear has been that much safer tobacco and nicotine products like snus, smokeless tobacco and vape will possibly cause a net loss to public health because more people will use these products and these products may lead to cigarette use. This fear, however, is not based on actual evidence and cannot be used to suppress or otherwise keep the public uninformed of what is clearly known about the lower risks of these products,\u201d adds Kozlowski, PhD, one of the world\u2019s leading researchers on smoking behavior.\n\nAn information quarantine functions similarly to a medical quarantine \u2013 think of your favorite zombie movie or television show in which the infected person is secluded from everyone else to protect the overall public. In order to justify a quarantine, there has to be clear evidence that the need to protect population health should overrule personal autonomy.\n\nIn the case of providing information on differential health risks of nicotine products, \u201cThe evidence to date does not come close to establishing that there would be a loss to public health from making this information widely available from credible sources,\u201d Kozlowski says.\n\nKozlowski and Sweanor reviewed several major health websites \u2014 including the CDC, Mayo Clinic, American Cancer Society, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the National Cancer Institute \u2014 and found three types of examples of information on smokeless tobacco, \u201cbut no-to-modest efforts to inform consumers of the significantly lower risks compared to cigarettes for lifelong users,\u201d the researchers write.\n\nIn fact, they found that the Mayo Clinic perpetuated a misrepresentation discovered in 2003 \u2014 erroneously informing visitors that smokeless tobacco was as dangerous as cigarettes. The day after the article was released, the Mayo Clinic removed the headline, replacing it with the still misleading statement that smokeless tobacco was \u201cnot a safe product.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople can only make as good a decision as the information available to them allows,\u201d said Sweanor, an adjunct professor in the University of Ottawa\u2019s Faculty of Law who has spearheaded the development of world-leading tobacco control initiatives in Canada since the early 1980s.\n\n\u201cThe public is dramatically misinformed about the relative risks of substitutable tobacco and nicotine products. The risk differentials are huge, but this is simply not known by a vast majority of those whose lives are at risk,\u201d adds Sweanor.\n\nEngland has an example of a website \u2014 Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) \u2014 that gets it right on vaping, the researchers said. A briefing posted on the site specifically states: \u201cCompared to tobacco products, electronic cigarettes are significantly safer.\u201d\n\nIn their paper, the researchers note that information on comparative risks is common for other products and activities, like over-the-counter medicines and even safety ratings of vehicles.\n\nThey argue that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates the sale of tobacco products, isn\u2019t doing its part to inform consumers of important differences in harm among tobacco products.\n\nTo illustrate their point, Kozlowski and Sweanor use the example that if one type of alcoholic beverage caused 3 in 5 regular users to die prematurely \u2014 as is the case with smoking traditional cigarettes \u2014 while another caused massively fewer deaths, consumers would want to know which product was the safer alternative.\n\n\u201cIt would be scandalous, even criminal, to keep such facts from consumers,\u201d the researchers write. \u201cYet, such facts are being kept from adult consumers of legal tobacco/nicotine products, either by not informing or actively misinforming consumers. It is as if tobacco consumers were blindfolded and not allowed to see dramatic differences in harm from different products.\u201d", "question": "Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The news release does not establish that this study is an update of an earlier 2003 study that reported similar conclusions.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "An app called Natural Cycles has become the first to be classified as a medical device for use as contraception.\n\n\n\nNatural Cycles uses a woman's body temperature and menstrual cycle data to tell her when she is fertile. On fertile days, users must abstain from sex or use other protection such as condoms to prevent pregnancy. The app was approved as a class IIb medical device by T\u00fcv S\u00fcd, a notified body in Sweden where it is based.\n\nBut sexual health organisations are warning that being classed as a medical device does not guarantee that the app will effectively prevent pregnancy. Sexual health charity the FPA, Fertility UK, and the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists are jointly calling for more large-scale independent trials to ensure that evidence for such apps is on a par with other rigorously tested methods of contraception.\n\nNatural Cycles is one of numerous apps that help women practise a method of contraception called natural family planning, also known as the fertility awareness method.\n\n\n\nNatural family planning involves monitoring your body for signs of ovulation, like an increase in your temperature, or a change in cervical mucus.\n\n\"The thing about the female egg is that it only lives for about 24 hours. So if you could reliably know when you've ovulated as a woman, and then you give that egg two or three days to die, any time after that in the cycle you will not get pregnant because there's no egg to fertilise,\" Dr Susan Walker, a senior lecturer in sexual health at Anglia Ruskin University, told BuzzFeed News.\n\n\n\nTaking your temperature is what sets Natural Cycles and other apps like it apart from standard period-tracking apps. Without temperature information an app can can guess at your ovulation day based on your average cycle length, but can't be sure when you actually have ovulated, and so you can't use it as a reliable form of birth control.\n\nYou don't actually need an app to practise natural family planning \u2013 although it does cut down on paperwork. Even so, the FPA advises that natural family planning is most effective if you\u2019re taught how to do it by a specialist teacher, and you monitor all three fertility indicators \u2013 temperature, menstrual cycle length, and cervical secretions.\n\nBut natural family planning is not for everyone. For starters, it can only protect against pregnancy, not STIs.\n\nAnd if you're considering ditching the Pill because remembering to take it each day is too much effort, you probably won't like having to remember to take your temperature every morning.\n\n\"You really have to commit to it, whether you're doing it the traditional way or you're using an app. You have to take your temperature every morning and record that, because without all that data it's not really any use to you,\" Bekki Burbidge, head of communications at the FPA, told BuzzFeed News. \"It's not a method that's going to suit everybody.\"\n\nBut for women like Natural Cycles co-founder Dr Elina Berglund, who want an alternative to hormonal contraception, it's an option worth pursuing. Along with her husband and co-founder Dr Raoul Scherwitzl, Berglund created the algorithm used in the app for personal use, before deciding it was something she should share with the rest of the world.\n\n\"When it comes to contraception it's all about choice. It's not like one solution will fit all women,\" said Berglund.\n\n\"Our typical user is in a stable relationship a few years before wanting to have kids. At first she starts to use the app to prevent pregnancy, and when she's ready [to get pregnant] she switches to plan, and usually she gets pregnant quite quickly, because the app already knows her body and cycle.\"\n\n\n\nTo use the app, you need a monthly or yearly subscription, and a thermometer that you have to use to take your temperature each morning before you get out of bed.\n\n\n\nThe app then tells you if you're likely to be fertile or not that day.

They say these are less likely to trigger the autoimmune response that can create a wide range of painful and irritating symptoms.\n\nThe re-engineered enzyme, named KumaMax, appears to be highly effective, at least in a test tube. It dismantled more than 95 percent of a gluten peptide that is thought to cause celiac disease, according to the study, which was published recently in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.\n\nIdeally, the team could develop the enzyme into a food additive such as the gas remedies Beano or Gas-X and offer it without a prescription, said lead study author Justin Siegel, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of California, Davis. But this could take a few years to develop. If the researchers opt to make a prescription drug, the process of clinical trials and obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval could take a decade or more, he said.\n\nAn enzyme is a protein that performs a chemical reaction. Proteins are the workhorses in every cell of every living thing, and their function is defined by their shape and structure.\n\nIn this case, the researchers re-engineered the natural enzyme to recognize the peptide that triggers celiac disease and modified the protein in the laboratory so it would survive the acidic stomach environment. \"We did the engineering to change the genes and sent that into standard microorganisms to create the protein,\" Siegel said.\n\nThe next step is to show that the enzyme is not toxic and functions as designed in animals. \"It shouldn't be toxic; it's just a protein you're eating,\" Siegel said.\n\nHow effective might the enzyme be? \"For some people, even flour in the air makes them stop breathing. Some are very sensitive, and in some it just upsets their stomach a little,\" Siegel said. \"For those who are hypersensitive, this probably is not going to solve the problem, but it would allow them to go to dinner, and in case any gluten ended up in their meal, they wouldn't have to worry about it.\"\n\n\"For those less sensitive, they could pop one before each meal and eat anything they want,\" he added.\n\nThe process of identifying the precise trigger for a disease or condition and engineering a drug to circumvent the disease-causing process is part of what some call the personalized medicine revolution, Siegel said. \"We can design a small molecule, a pill, that can be specific to an exact target and have few side effects, if any,\" he said.\n\nSome experts identified limitations to the research.\n\n\"This is the earliest phase, and you now have to show that it actually breaks down the gluten peptides that trigger a response in the stomach at a speed that will protect the human,\" said Dr. Joseph Murray, a professor of medicine in the division of gastroenterology and the department of immunology at the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minn. \"Let's see how it goes with a whole slice of bread.\"\n\nMurray said that dismantling 95 percent of the protein component that is thought to trigger celiac disease may still not be enough to provide celiac patients protection. \"It will probably be helpful to someone who gets a low-level exposure [to glutens] by accident,\" he said.\n\nBut celiac disease is a common problem, with about 2 million to 3 million Americans suffering from it. \"People need alternatives, and this is an example of the scientific community taking novel approaches to helping people with celiac disease,\" Murray said.\n\nLearn more about celiac disease from the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The story makes it sound like this is the only pill-type treatment that is currently being developed for celiac disease.

But until now, information on the prognostic value of grip strength was limited, and mainly obtained from select high-income countries.\n\nThe current study followed 139691 adults aged between 35 and 70 years living in 17 countries from The Prospective Urban-Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study for an average (median) of four years. Grip strength was assessed using a handgrip dynamometer.\n\nThe findings show that every 5kg decline in grip strength [2] was associated with a 16% increased risk of death from any cause; a 17% greater risk of cardiovascular death; a 17% higher risk of non-cardiovascular mortality; and more modest increases in the risk of having a heart attack (7%) or a stroke (9%).\n\nThese associations persisted even after taking into account differences in other factors that can affect mortality or heart disease such as age, education level, employment status, physical activity level, and tobacco and alcohol use.\n\nA low grip strength was linked with higher death rates in people who develop cardiovascular (eg, heart attack or stroke) and non-cardiovascular diseases (eg, cancer), suggesting that muscle strength can predict the risk of death in people who develop a major illness.\n\nAccording to lead author Dr Darryl Leong from the Population Health Research Institute, Hamilton Health Sciences and McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada, \"Grip strength could be an easy and inexpensive test to assess an individual's risk of death and cardiovascular disease. Further research is needed to establish whether efforts to improve muscle strength are likely to reduce an individual's risk of death and cardiovascular disease.\" [3]\n\nWriting in a linked Comment, Professor Avan Aihie Sayer from the University of Southampton, Southampton, UK, and Professor Thomas Kirkwood from Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK discuss whether grip strength could be a new biomarker of ageing, writing that, \"This is not a new idea, but findings from PURE add support.

The women were enduring hot flashes at least twice a day.\n\nThirty women each received real acupuncture that also included a bit of an electric buzz or the inactive placebo pill, 32 women got sham acupuncture, and 28 women received gabapentin (Neurontin). The drug is typically used to treat seizures and nerve pain.\n\nThe women documented their hot flashes in diaries, noting frequency and severity, for 8 weeks of treatment, and then continued to keep track of their hot flashes up to 24 weeks total. The investigators used a hot flash score to see how much frequency and severity changed from when the study started to what the women reported at 8, 12 and 24 weeks.\n\nAcupuncture had the greatest effect on overall hot flash scores at 8 weeks, when all interventions ended, followed by sham acupuncture and then gabapentin. At 24 weeks, 16 weeks after treatments ended, acupuncture was still associated with the greatest reduction in hot flashes. But even those who had sham acupuncture or placebo pills had steeper drops in hot flash scores at 24 weeks than those who took gabapentin.\n\n\"The placebo effects for both acupuncture and drugs are quite intriguing, as they both seem to persist over time,\" Mao said. \"The magnitude of the placebo effect for acupuncture is bigger than for the drug.\"\n\nThe results with the sham acupuncture, which bested gabapentin, suggest that \"there is more than a placebo effect with the sham acupuncture,\" said Dr. Gary Deng, interim chief of the integrative medicine service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. \"There is a component of behavior of doing a sham procedure, so it psychologically may trigger a different kind of reaction from patients versus taking the placebo pill.\"\n\nDeng pointed out that clinicians have come to realize that the placebo effect is very important in treatment. \"In fact, in clinical practice, every doctor uses it all of the time,\" he said. \"The so-called bedside manner or communication with patients -- all of these enhance the effect of the patients feeling they're getting something.\"\n\nNo one is quite sure why placebos work for some people and not for others, said Deng. \"It's like psychotherapy,\" he added. \"Why does it work for some people and not others?\" He suggested that differences in anatomy and genetics might be possible explanations, but said \"there is a fertile field for further research.\"\n\nSome patients might wonder if acupuncture that's helpful for hot flashes among breast cancer patients might be helpful for the hot flashes associated with natural menopause. But Mao pointed out that hot flashes in breast cancer patients are more common, more severe and longer lasting than menopausal hot flashes.\n\nHowever, Deng said that both might have similar causes related to lower estrogen levels. \"Breast cancer survivors have hot flashes because of hormonal repression,\" he said. Menopause also is linked to declining estrogen levels.\n\nOne big distinction between the two populations, though, is that breast cancer survivors do not have the option of hormone replacement therapy open to them because those hormones are linked to breast cancer. Some women undergoing natural menopause still might have that option available. For this reason, most studies of acupuncture for hot flashes have focused on breast cancer survivors, Deng explained.\n\nBut should a woman undergoing natural menopause try acupuncture for hot flashes?\n\n\"For patients suffering symptoms, they can look for all kinds of possible solutions and are better off talking to their doctor to find out what's most appropriate for them,\" Deng said.\n\nVisit the U.S. National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health for more on acupuncture.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "Close call here, but the story doesn\u2019t really establish what is new about the research.

In humans and many animals the lateral sleeping position is the most common one. The buildup of brain waste chemicals may contribute to the development of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other neurological conditions. Their finding is published in the Journal of Neuroscience.\n\nDr. Benveniste, Principal Investigator and a Professor in the Departments of Anesthesiology and Radiology at Stony Brook University School of Medicine, has used dynamic contrast MRI for several years to examine the glymphatic pathway in rodent models. The method enables researchers to identify and define the glymphatic pathway, where cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) filters through the brain and exchanges with interstitial fluid (ISF) to clear waste, similar to the way the body\u2019s lymphatic system clears waste from organs. It is during sleep that the glymphatic pathway is most efficient. Brain waste includes amyloid \u03b2 (amyloid) and tau proteins, chemicals that negatively affect brain processes if they build up.\n\nIn the paper, \u201cThe Effect of Body Posture on Brain Glymphatic Transport,\u201d Dr. Benveniste and colleagues used a dynamic contrast MRI method along with kinetic modeling to quantify the CSF-ISF exchange rates in anesthetized rodents\u2019 brains in three positions \u2013 lateral (side), prone (down), and supine (up).\n\n\u201cThe analysis showed us consistently that glymphatic transport was most efficient in the lateral position when compared to the supine or prone positions,\u201d said Dr. Benveniste. \u201cBecause of this finding, we propose that the body posture and sleep quality should be considered when standardizing future diagnostic imaging procedures to assess CSF-ISF transport in humans and therefore the assessment of the clearance of damaging brain proteins that may contribute to or cause brain diseases.\u201d\n\nDr. Benveniste and first-author Dr. Hedok Lee, Assistant Professor in the Departments of Anesthesiology and Radiology at Stony Brook developed the safe posture positions for the experiments. Their colleagues at the University of Rochester, including Lulu Xie, Rashid Deane and Maiken Nedergaard, PhD, used fluorescence microscopy and radioactive tracers to validate the MRI data and to assess the influence of body posture on the clearance of amyloid from the brains.\n\n\u201cIt is interesting that the lateral sleep position is already the most popular in human and most animals \u2013 even in the wild \u2013 and it appears that we have adapted the lateral sleep position to most efficiently clear our brain of the metabolic waste products that built up while we are awake,\u201d says Dr. Nedergaard. \u201cThe study therefore adds further support to the concept that sleep subserves a distinct biological function of sleep and that is to \u2018clean up\u2019 the mess that accumulates while we are awake. Many types of dementia are linked to sleep disturbances, including difficulties in falling asleep. It is increasing acknowledged that these sleep disturbances may accelerate memory loss in Alzheimer\u2019s disease.

The drug contains only trace amounts of the psychoactive element THC and does not induce euphoria.\n\nEpidiolex was approved for patients age 2 and older who suffer from Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet syndromes. Both cause uncontrolled daily seizures and put patients at high risk for other physical and intellectual disabilities, injury and early death.\n\nThe disorders afflict fewer than 45,000 people in the United States, but experts expect Epidiolex to be prescribed for other types of epilepsy as well. The drug is the first treatment approved for Dravet syndrome.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the approval was \u201ca reminder that advancing sound development programs that properly evaluate active ingredients contained in marijuana can lead to important medical therapies.\u201d The medication, tested in three randomized, placebo-controlled trials with more than 500 patients, was effective in reducing seizures, the FDA said.\n\nGottlieb noted that the action was \u201cnot an approval of marijuana or all of its components\u201d but rather of one specific CBD medication for a particular use.\n\nThe agency, he added, remains concerned about \u201cthe proliferation and illegal marketing of unapproved CBD-containing products with unproven medical claims.\u201d\n\nIn April, an advisory committee unanimously recommended approval of the drug for the two types of epilepsy.\n\nThe FDA previously cleared medications containing synthetic versions of THC for nausea for patients getting chemotherapy and for other uses, but it had not approved any drug derived from the plant itself. Marijuana and its components, including CBD, are Schedule 1 controlled substances \u2014 meaning they are banned because they are thought to have a high abuse potential, no medical value and serious safety implications.\n\nNow that Epidiolex is approved by the FDA, cannabidiol is expected to be reclassified by the Drug Enforcement Administration within 90 days. However, it isn\u2019t clear whether such a reclassification would involve CBD products in general, the CBD formulation used specifically in Epidiolex or something else.\n\nFor those who have long argued that cannabis offers medical benefits, the FDA approval represents a milestone, \u201ca recognition that the plant is a rich source of compounds which have potential therapeutic activity,\u201d Justin Gover, chief executive of GW Pharmaceuticals, the London-based company that developed the drug, said in an interview last week. \u201cWe are just scratching the surface of what could be a range of cannabis-based medications.\u201d\n\nThe medication, which will continue to be manufactured in Britain, will be marketed by Greenwich Biosciences, the U.S. subsidiary of GW Pharmaceuticals.

Taking Prozac (fluoxetine) doubled the chances that a patient would show overall improvement, measured by their clinicians. Half of the participants taking Prozac had significant reductions in obsessive-compulsive symptoms, compared with 8% taking placebo. Side effects were mild to moderate and participants taking Prozac did not show increases in suicidal thoughts or ideas.\n\n\u201cRepetitive behavior is a core symptom of the illness,\u201d says lead author Dr. Eric Hollander, medical director of the Autism and Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum Program at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, explaining that \u201cfrom a very early age, these children have rituals and routines. For example, they like to line up their toys and they get very bent out of shape if there is any deviation.\u201d\n\nMORE: What Does a 400% Increase in Antidepressant Use Really Mean?\n\nA previous, larger study of a similar medication, Celexa (citalopram), in autistic children did not find a reduction in repetitive behaviors, but the drug did reduce irritability and was superior to placebo among children who had the highest levels of irritability. Irritability can sometimes lead to repetitive behaviors because autistic people often engage in these activities to soothe themselves.\n\nBoth Prozac and Celexa belong to a class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. Prior research on SSRIs in autistic people has also looked at Luvox (fluvoxamine) and found a reduction in repetitive behavior in adults but not children. It is not known if the differences between these studies are due to differences between the medications or other factors.\n\nObsessive behaviors may also arise in autistic people in response to the stress or discomfort of unpredictable situations. \u201cMany of these individuals have expectations for what\u2019s going to happen, and if there is an unexpected deviation, they experience a lot of discomfort and then they do all these kinds of behaviors,\u201d says Hollander. That\u2019s why people with autism may obsessively avoid locations where they previously experienced discomfort, for example, or they may engage in a repetitive habit like washing, checking, counting, touching or tapping.\n\nWhen taking Prozac, Hollander says, \u201cPatients acknowledge experiencing less discomfort. They\u2019re more able to go outside their comfort zone and to better resist their habits and rituals.\u201d One participant in Hollander\u2019s study was previously too anxious to take the subway or eat in a restaurant, but, when taking Prozac, was able to tolerate these unpredictable environments.\n\n\u201cIt takes the edge off,\u201d Hollander explains, noting that the findings were statistically significant and clinically meaningful. \u201cThe clinicians could tell that people were doing better not only in terms of OCD symptoms but overall distress and ability to function.\u201d\n\nMORE: Why Are So Many Foster Care Children Taking Antipsychotics?\n\nThe only drugs approved to treat irritability and repetitive behaviors in autistic children are the atypical antipsychotics Risperdal (risperidone) and Abilify (aripiprazole), which tend to have more severe side effects than Prozac does. Those drugs carry significant risk for weight gain, diabetes and movement disorders.\n\nResponding to the research, Yale Child Study Center director Fred Volkmar told WebMD: \u201cThe question remains, \u2018Is fluoxetine better than risperidone for this symptom?\u2019 It would be interesting to see studies comparing these two drugs head to head.\u201d\n\nHollander has previously received funding from pharmaceutical companies, but the current study was paid for by a grant from the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s \u201corphan\u201d drug program. That program funds research on rare conditions with new drugs or those no longer patented that are not likely to be pursued by industry.

Both of these problems are exacerbated during exertion when kids play sports.\n\nAccording to Zipes, \"The adrenalin that is released when you're participating [in sports] can stimulate this abnormally thick heart muscle and cause a fatal heart rhythm problem, that is a very rapid heartbeat with no effective contraction, no blood being ejected to the brain and other organs.\" The result is sudden cardiac death.\n\nTypically, schools require kids to provide a family history and have a simple physical exam before participating in sports. But Zipes says more should be done.\n\nCardiologist Debauche agrees. He recently screened more than 2,000 high school athletes in the Houston area, using electrocardiogram, or EKG, to measure the electrical activity of the heart.\n\nAbout 10 percent of the students had an abnormal EKG. One of them was Louis Anthony, who suffered from asthma. In severe cases, asthma can cause the heart to thicken and put kids at risk of cardiomyopathy and sudden death. Anthony's asthma diminished over time, and he says he can still play soccer, run fast and breathe \"just fine.\"\n\nAfter the abnormal EKG result, however, Debauche told Anthony and his parents to closely monitor the asthma. They have.\n\nFor other students who had abnormal EKG results, some received medication for blood pressure and others were treated for abnormal heart rhythms. About 1 percent were told it was too dangerous for them to continue in sports.\n\nThree students had serious heart problems, including one who suffered from a rare disease in which the heart muscle is spongy and contracts poorly.\n\n\"He was literally running the stadium stairs at the time we found him,\" Debauche says. \"He was preparing for track season by running up and down the stadium stairs.\"\n\nDebauche says the heart screening turned out to be life-saving for this student athlete. The student now has an implantable defibrillator and is awaiting a heart transplant.\n\nThe severity of this and the other two problems that turned up as a result of the abnormal EKGs are reason enough, Debauche says, to screen all school athletes nationwide.\n\nSome health experts argue that would be too costly. There's no official policy from the American College of Cardiology, but officials say most members support screening student athletes.\n\nThe American Heart Association suggests that athletes who are identified as at risk for heart problems as a result of a family history or physical exam be referred for further cardiovascular examination, which could include an electrocardiogram.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "\n\n       \n \nScreening athletes for heart problems is not a new idea, and the story does not suggest that it is. However, the story could have done a better job of explaining how athletes are currently screened and the role of EKGs in this process. Current American Heart Association guidelines recommend EKG and other diagnostic testing for children presumed to be at higher risk of heart problems based on personal history, family history and physical examination. The report does not provide this important information until the final sentence of the story.\u00a0 \n \n", "answer": 1}, {"article": "For decades, research has suggested a link between oral health and inflammatory diseases affecting the entire body -- in particular, heart attacks and strokes.\n\nThe results released today from a randomized trial of a novel plaque identifying toothpaste, (Plaque HD\u00ae), show statistically significant reductions in dental plaque and inflammation throughout the body. Inflammation throughout the body is accurately measured by high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a sensitive marker for future heart attacks and strokes. These results, published today online ahead of print in the American Journal of Medicine, with an accompanying editorial by the editor-in-chief, show that Plaque HD\u00ae, produced statistically significant reductions in dental plaque and inflammation throughout the body as measured by hs-CRP.\n\nIn this trial, all randomized subjects were given the same brushing protocol and received a 60-day supply of toothpaste containing either Plaque HD\u00ae or an identical non-plaque identifying placebo toothpaste. To assess dental plaque, all subjects utilized a fluorescein mouth rinse, and intraoral photographs were taken under black light imaging. For hs-CRP, levels were measured by an independent laboratory using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.\n\n\"While the findings on reducing dental plaque extend a previous observation, the findings on decreasing inflammation are new and novel,\" said Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., Dr.P.H., senior author and first Sir Richard Doll Professor, and senior academic advisor to the dean in the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine at Florida Atlantic University.\n\nLast month, the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine ranked the original manuscript by Hennekens and colleagues on aspirin, inflammation and cardiovascular disease, published in 1997, as their most influential original report of the last 20 years. The original research from the landmark Physician's Health Study, in which Hennekens was the founding principal investigator, was the first to demonstrate that hs-CRP predicted future heart attacks and strokes.\n\nIn the accompanying editorial titled, \"Can a Toothpaste Reduce Heart Attacks and Strokes?,\" Joseph S. Alpert, M.D., an internationally renowned cardiologist, noted the importance and timeliness of these findings and commented on how his father, a dentist, had told him even before he went to medical school, that dental health may affect heart attacks and strokes.\n\nPlaque HD\u00ae is the first toothpaste that reveals plaque so that it can be removed with directed brushing. In addition, the product's proprietary formulation contains unique combinations and concentrations of cleaning agents that weaken the core of the plaque structure to help the subject visualize and more effectively remove the plaque.\n\nThis investigator initiated randomized trial was published in collaboration with academic collaborators from the University of Illinois at the Chicago School of Dentistry and the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health.\n\nBased on these findings, Hennekens and colleagues are drafting an investigator initiated research grant proposal to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under the direction of co-author Patrick E. McBride, M.D., M.P.H., professor of medicine and interim associate dean for faculty affairs at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. This large scale randomized trial will test whether Plaque HD\u00ae reduces risks of heart attacks and strokes. The trial will be conducted in the Wisconsin Network for Health Research (WiNHR) and the Wisconsin Research and Education Network (WREN), both of which McBride directs.\n\nAmong the numerous honors and recognition Hennekens has received include the 2013 Fries Prize for Improving Health for his seminal contributions to the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease, the 2013 Presidential Award from his alma mater, Queens College, for his distinguished contributions to society, and the 2013 honoree of the American Heart Association, which he shared with FAU's College of Medicine for reducing premature deaths from heart attacks and strokes.\n\nFrom 1995 to 2005, Science Watch ranked Hennekens as the third most widely cited medical researcher in the world and five of the top 20 were his former trainees and/or fellows. In 2012, Science Heroes ranked Hennekens No. 81 in the history of the world for having saved more than 1.1 million lives.\n\nIn 2014, he received the Ochsner Award for reducing premature deaths from cigarettes. In 2016, he was ranked the No. 14 \"Top Scientist in the World\" with an H-index of 173.\n\nFlorida Atlantic University, established in 1961, officially opened its doors in 1964 as the fifth public university in Florida.

It is also been reported that LAGB patients are likely to regain much of their lost weight years down the road.\n\nTo explore satisfaction levels and the long-term complication history of gastric banding, in 2009 Himpens and his team examined a pool of patients who had undergone the surgery between 1994 and 1997.\n\nThe results: 12 years or more later, more than 60 percent of the banding patients said they were \"satisfied\" with their experience. On average, excess weight loss had been maintained at a level approaching nearly 43 percent, and quality of life appeared to be equal to that of patients who had not undergone the surgery.\n\nHowever, 39 percent of the patients had experienced serious complications, including abnormal pouch expansion (9), band erosion (23) and band infection (1). Another 22 percent experienced relatively minor complications. Almost 50 percent had to have the bands entirely removed, while 60 percent needed to undergo subsequent surgery. The procedure \"appears to result in relatively poor long-term outcomes,\" the researchers concluded.\n\nOne in six of the patients ended up deciding to have a gastric bypass procedure, and all of these patients demonstrated good outcomes following their subsequent surgery.\n\nHimpens said that patients should limit their expectations with respect to banding, noting that \"all weight-loss operations have a high failure rate\". But he added that \"it is still defendable for surgeons to continue doing this.\"\n\n\"The high failure rate of the band gastroplasty [in] the long term is not that much worse than other procedures,\" he noted. \"[I] therefore think patients will continue to ask for the procedure.\"\n\nBut he cautioned that patients undergoing band surgery should do so knowing that they need to commit themselves to rigorous long-term follow-up.\n\nMeanwhile, in a critique published alongside Himpens work, Dr. Clifford W. Deveney, a professor of surgery in the department of surgery at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, concluded that the current study does \"not shed a favorable light on the use of LAGB\".\n\n\"The band has a spotty history,\" Deveney said. \"Some groups have very good results, with 60 to 70 percent weight loss. But other groups have either poor weight loss or complications, or both.\"\n\n\"So I think,\" he continued, \"that the patient should be made aware of these facts, and also that the weight loss is going to be less with the band than with a gastric bypass. And that it'll take longer to achieve the weight loss, because with gastric bypass most of the weight loss occurs over the first year, while with a band it takes five to six years.\"\n\n\"It's also easier to 'cheat' on the band,\" he added. \"You can eat around the band and render it ineffective if you're not disciplined in following a healthy diet. With gastric bypass that's not as much of an issue. But all this is not to say that I think we shouldn't be doing bands. It's just not as good as bypass.\"\n\nDr. Mitchell S. Roslin, chief of bariatric surgery at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y., said he was not surprised by the findings.\n\n\"I always tell my patients that bands are like going a diet with a seatbelt,\" he said. \"And that there's bound to be a 5 percent extraction rate of these bands per year that they're in. Which actually comes to about the same percent of band removals these researchers observed among their patients.\"\n\n\"I think the problem with the bands is simply that having a fixed obstruction underneath your esophagus is not a natural occurrence,\" Roslin noted. \"And also these bands make it more difficult to eat, but they do not make every patient less hungry. So there's a big variability in treatment effect. You'll see patients who do great and patients who don't. Almost like a camel with two humps.\"\n\n\"So bands are easy to sell and very heavily marketed,\" he added. \"But for many patients, there are better options.\"\n\nFor more on gastric banding, visit the National Institutes of Health.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "It is clear from the story that the procedure is not new.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "CHICAGO -- Among women with dense breast tissue, for whom traditional mammograms are less effective at detecting cancer, who request additional screening after a negative mammogram, abbreviated breast MRI (AB-MR) may be a valuable cancer detection tool. In a study of 195 asymptomatic women with dense breast tissue who had a negative mammogram within the previous 11 months, AB-MR detected five additional cancers after a negative screening mammography, according to preliminary findings from a Penn Medicine team presented this week at the Radiological Society of North America meeting in Chicago.\n\nTo put this in perspective, the cancer detection rate of mammography is roughly 4 cancers in 1,000 women who have a mammogram. Digital tomosynthesis (DBT), or 3D mammography, does slightly better, detecting approximately 25 percent more cancers, or roughly 5 cancers in 1,000 women screened. Based on the preliminary results at Penn Medicine, the cancer detection rate of AB-MR screening is 25 cancers per 1,000 patients.

However, screening ultrasound examinations have higher rates of false positives, meaning more cases of positive screenings where no cancer is present.\n\nBased on the results from Penn's study, the AB-MR may be a better option. American Cancer Society guidelines currently recommend a full breast MRI, not an AB-MR, in women who, based on family history of breast or ovarian cancer and/or previous treatment for Hodgkin disease, have a 20 to 25 percent or greater lifetime risk of breast cancer.\n\nIn addition to Weinstein, additional authors include Mitchell D.

However, the procedure doesn't work for everyone and there are risks of complications, researchers report.\n\nAtrial fibrillation increases the risk of early death by two times in women and 1.5 times in men. It causes 20 to 30 percent of all strokes and can decrease quality of life due to palpitations, shortness of breath, tiredness, weakness and psychological distress, the study authors explained.\n\nAbout 2.7 million Americans suffer from atrial fibrillation, according to the American Heart Association.\n\nFor those whose atrial fibrillation can't be controlled with medications, catheter ablation may be recommended.\n\n\"Catheter ablation is a valid alternative for the management of atrial fibrillation with a satisfactory success rate,\" said study lead researcher Dr. Elena Arbelo.\n\nBut the procedure can have complications, which should be considered carefully by doctors and patients, said Arbelo, a senior specialist in the Cardiovascular Institute at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona in Spain.\n\nComplications can include fluid buildup around the heart, called cardiac tamponade, which makes it difficult for the heart to pump blood. Other complications include stroke or mini-stroke, Arbelo said.\n\nIn addition, many patients need to continue blood thinners and medications that control irregular heartbeats after the procedure, she explained.\n\nDuring the procedure, a wire is threaded through the blood vessels into the heart and used to burn or freeze small areas of the upper chamber, called the atrium.\n\nThe burning or freezing creates a scar and stops abnormal electrical signals that cause the irregular heart rhythm, Arbelo said.\n\nAccording to Dr. Hugh Calkins, \"Atrial fibrillation ablation is a well-established procedure that has imperfect results.\" Calkins is a professor of medicine and director of the cardiac arrhythmia service at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.\n\nThe complication rate is higher than hoped, and the success rate is lower than hoped, he said.\n\n\"Patients don't get a lifetime certificate saying you're cured,\" Calkins said. \"For one in four patients, atrial fibrillation comes back five years after the procedure. Patients should not be going into this thinking they will have a 99 percent cure rate with no risk,\" he added.\n\nThe new study included information from more than 3,600 patients in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. Their average age was 59, and all had undergone catheter ablation.\n\nAblation was successful in 74 percent of patients, Arbelo said. These patients had no atrial arrhythmias -- irregular heart beats -- for three to 12 months after the procedure.\n\nAccording to Arbelo, 91 percent of patients choose to have ablation to relieve symptoms, while 66 percent do so to improve their quality of life.\n\nAtrial arrhythmias in the first three months after ablation were classified as early recurrences and not considered as failures, Arbelo said. In addition, 45 percent of patients who had a successful procedure were still taking antiarrhythmia drugs 12 months later.\n\nAbout 11 percent suffered complications during the year after the ablation, she said.\n\nAfter the procedure, patients with two or more risk factors for stroke should be prescribed oral blood thinners, while those with no risk factors don't need them, Arbelo suggested.\n\nThe study investigators found that 27 percent of patients with two or more risk factors for stroke were not on blood thinners, but one-third of low-risk patients were taking them.\n\nDr. Gregg Fonarow is a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Dr. Nagele's work focuses on utilizing autoantibodies as blood-based biomarkers to accurately detect the presence of myriad diseases and pinpoint the stage to which a disease has progressed. By detecting Alzheimer's disease long before symptoms emerge, Dr. Nagele hopes those with disease-related autoantibody biomarkers will be encouraged to make beneficial lifestyle changes that may help to slow development of the disease.\n\n\"There are significant benefits to early disease detection because we now know that many of the same conditions that lead to vascular disease are also significant risk factors for Alzheimer's. People found to have preclinical disease can take steps to improve their vascular health, including watching their diet, exercising and managing any weight and blood pressure issues to help stave off or slow disease progression,\" Nagele said.\n\nWhile the cause of Alzheimer's remains elusive, it is clear that maintaining a healthy blood-brain barrier is a critical preventative measure. Diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, stroke and being overweight jeopardize vascular health. As blood vessels in the brain weaken or become brittle with age, they begin to leak, which allows plasma components including brain-reactive autoantibodies into the brain. There, the autoantibodies can bind to neurons and accelerate the accumulation of beta amyloid deposits, a hallmark of Alzheimer's pathology.\n\nThe blood test developed by Dr. Nagele has also shown promise in detecting other diseases, including Parkinsons's, multiple sclerosis and breast cancer. His team's research on the role of autoantibodies explains that:\n\u2022 All humans possess thousands of autoantibodies in their blood;\n\u2022 These autoantibodies specifically bind to blood-borne cellular debris generated by organs and tissues all over the body;\n\u2022 An individual's autoantibody profile is strongly influenced by age, gender and the presence of specific diseases or injuries; and\n\u2022 Diseases cause characteristic changes in autoantibody profiles that, when detected, can serve as biomarkers that reveal the presence of the disease.\n\nIn Alzheimer's, the brain begins to change years before symptoms emerge. Detecting Alzheimer's antibodies at the preclinical stage would give patients an opportunity to work with their physician to make lifestyle changes or receive available treatments before they become symptomatic. Potentially, this early intervention could help those with preclinical Alzheimer's avoid or delay the most devastating symptoms.\n\n\"As osteopathic physicians, we constantly tell patients that a healthy lifestyle is the best medicine for preventing disease. We also know that many people tune out messages about nutrition and exercise until a health crisis gets their attention,\" said Jennifer Caudle, DO, assistant professor of family medicine at Rowan University. \"I can't think of a single patient who wouldn't take steps to prevent the progression of Alzheimer's if they could directly affect their prognosis.\"\n\nToday, there is no definitive FDA-approved blood test for Alzheimer's, which affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans. It is among the top 10 causes of death in America.\n\nDr. Nagele's research has been supported by grants from the Michael J.

The examination relies on gadolinium-based contrast agents that need to be injected intravenously.\n\nResearchers recently studied an alternative approach that eliminates the need for contrast agents in some cases by using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) measurements derived from MRI. The technique, known as diffusion kurtosis imaging, provides a picture of breast tissue on a microstructural level.\n\n\"Diffusion kurtosis imaging has been introduced in DWI to provide important information on tissue structures at a microscopic level,\" said study lead author Sebastian Bickelhaupt, M.D., from the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg, Germany. \"Since malignant lesions disrupt the tissue structures at this level, diffusion kurtosis might serve as a relevant marker of changes.\"\n\nDr. Bickelhaupt, co-lead author Paul Jaeger, M.Sc., and colleagues evaluated a retrospective analysis of data collected from 222 women at two independent study sites. The women had suspicious findings on mammography that were classified under the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) as BI-RADS 4 and 5 breast lesions. A BI-RADS 4 lesion is considered a suspicious abnormality, while a 5 is considered highly suspicious of malignancy. The women underwent DWI followed by biopsy.\n\nFor the analysis, a software algorithm was developed for lesion characterization, and imaging features were extracted using a kurtosis-based radiomics model. Radiomics is a rapidly growing field that enables the extraction of a large amount of quantifiable data from images.\n\nIn an independent test set of 127 women, the radiomics analysis reduced false-positive findings by 70 percent, while detecting 60 of 61 malignant lesions, or 98 percent.\n\n\"The model might help to lower the number of BI-RADS 4 lesions suspected of being cancer on the basis of screening mammography while retaining a high sensitivity similar to the sensitivity reported for biopsies themselves,\" Jaeger said.\n\nShould the results hold in larger trials, the model has potential advantages in the clinic beyond its ability to reduce unnecessary biopsies in women with BI-RADS 4 lesions. The software algorithm makes the assessment reader-independent, ensuring that its accuracy is maintained across different imaging facilities.\n\nThe new approach is not intended to replace current contrast-enhanced breast MRI protocols in general, Dr. Bickelhaupt emphasized, but to expand the spectrum of options available for answering specific clinical questions.\n\n\"This might also improve the efficiency of reporting,\" he said.\n\n\"Radiomics Based on Adapted Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging Helps to Clarify Most Mammographic Findings Suspicious for Cancer.\" Collaborating with Dr. Bickelhaupt and Jaeger were Frederik Bernd Laun, Prof. Dr., Wolfgang Lederer, M.D., Heidi Daniel, M.D., Tristan Anselm Kuder, Dr. rer nat, Lorenz Wuesthof, Daniel Paech, M.D., David Bonekamp, M.D., Alexander Radbruch, M.D., Stefan Delorme, Prof. Dr., Heinz-Peter Schlemmer, Prof. Dr., Franziska Steudle, and Klaus H.

In a summary of the guidelines written for patients and their families, this is how migraines are described:\n\nPreventive treatment involves taking a seizure drug and a beta-blocker every day to reduce the frequency, severity and duration of migraines. Neurologists estimate that about 38% of people who suffer from migraines stand to benefit with such a regimen, and studies suggest that as many as half of migraines can be prevented with drugs, according to Dr. Stephen D. Silberstein, a neurologist at the Jefferson Headache Center at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. Silberstein was the lead author of new migraine treatment guidelines presented Monday at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in New Orleans.\n\nActually, odds are you wouldn\u2019t. Neurologists say that only about one-third of those who could benefit by migraine-preventing medication actually use it.\n\nIf you had a history of suffering from migraines and could prevent the debilitating headaches by swallowing a few pills, you\u2019d do it \u2013 wouldn\u2019t you?\n\nMany migraines can be prevented by taking medication every day. New guidelines\u2026 (Photo illustration by Gary\u2026)\n\n\u201cMigraine is a condition that involves recurring headaches. Each headache may last from four hours to two days. It can cause throbbing pain in the head. Other symptoms may include nausea (upset stomach), vomiting and extreme sensitivity to light or sound. Most people with migraine have attacks that happen repeatedly.\u201d\n\nPeople whose migraines are infrequent or mild may not be able to prevent them with drugs, the guidelines say. But for those who can, the best seizure drugs are divalproex sodium (Depakote), sodium valproate (Depakote, Depakene, Stavzor) and topiramate (Topamax or Topiragen). Beta-blockers are usually taken to treat high blood pressure, heart arrhythmias and other cardiovascular conditions, though metoprolol (Lopressor or Toprol), propranolol (Inderal) and timolol (Blocadren) can also help with migraines.\n\nThe authors also noted that frovatriptan (Frova), which is used to treat migraine symptoms, can also help prevent menstrual migraines.\n\nThese medications \u201care effective for migraine prevention and should be offered to patients with migraine to reduce migraine attack frequency and severity,\u201d Silberstein and colleagues wrote in the new guidelines, which were based on a review of 284 publications.\n\nIn addition, an herbal remedy derived from a family of plants called Petasites or butterbur was found to be effective, according to the review.\n\nThe review identified a handful of drugs that \u201care probably effective and should be considered for migraine prevention.\u201d These include the antidepressants amitriptyline (Elavil, Endep or Vanatrip) and venlafaxine (Effexor); the beta blockers atenolol (Senormin or Tenormin) and nadolol (Corgard); and for menstrual migraines, naratriptan (Amerge) and zolmitriptan (Zomig).\n\n\u201cPeople need to keep in mind that all drugs, includingover-the-counter drugsand complementary treatments, can have side effects or interact with other medications, which should be monitored,\u201d Silberstein said in a statement.\n\nFive of the six co-authors of the new guidelines, including Silberstein, disclosed that they receive research funding, speaking fees and other payments from drug companies.\n\nThe guidelines will be published in Tuesday\u2019s edition of the journal Neurology.

These are signals that a debilitating migraine is on its way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re possessed,\u201d said Lorie Novak, who has suffered from chronic migraines since childhood. \u201cI almost feel separate from my body, like it\u2019s just this painful shell around me that\u2019s not me.\u201d\n\nNovak, now in her 60s, is one of the roughly 35 million Americans who suffer from migraines. There are few effective treatments, and no new drugs have been developed since the early 1990s.\n\nBut that could soon change. A handful of drug companies are pressing ahead with novel injectable therapies for migraines, chasing a blockbuster market that Wall Street analysts say could reach $8 billion a year in worldwide sales.\n\nThe new drugs target a bodily protein called CGRP, which plays a role in the dilation of blood vessels in the brain. Scientists haven\u2019t nailed down just how the protein affects migraines, but they\u2019re sure about two things: CGRP levels rocket up when headaches attack and normalize when they go away.\n\nAnd thus four drug makers \u2014 Amgen, Eli Lilly, Teva Pharmaceuticals, and Alder Biopharmaceuticals \u2014 have fashioned antibodies that can bind to CGRP molecules and block their activity. The goal: to relieve the scourge of chronic migraines by stopping CGRP in its tracks.\n\nSo far, it seems to be working. In mid-stage clinical trials, each of the four treatments has eased symptoms for about half of study participants, cutting the number of days they\u2019re afflicted by migraines roughly in half. It\u2019s by no means a cure for migraines, but it should be enough to merit Food and Drug Administration approvals if the companies can replicate those results in larger trials, according to Eric Schmidt, a securities analyst at Cowen and Co.\n\nEach treatment is now in late-stage development, targeting the roughly 38 percent of migraine sufferers who, like Novak, have at least four headache days per month. The first therapy could hit the market in 2018, and, if everything works out, all four could available by the end of the decade.\n\nSo far, the four drugs have performed similarly in clinical trials, and analysts expect the contenders will have to compete on price to grab market share.\n\n\u201cThere will certainly be hypercompetition,\u201d said William Ratner, Lilly\u2019s senior director of global headache marketing. But the companies\u2019 fortunes are intertwined, he said, and \u201cthe class only wins if headache care in America improves.\u201d\n\nAiming to prevent migraines before they start\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of room for improvement. Existing therapies are plagued by inconsistent efficacy and troublesome side effects, and patients are often left to rely on a repurposed treatment for epilepsy. That medication, Topamax, has been dubbed dubbed \u201cSleepomax\u201d by doctors and patients because it\u2019s also a heavy sedative.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very enthusiastic, as I think everyone in the field is, about having another treatment option for people with migraines,\u201d said Dr. Elizabeth Loder, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and chief of the headache division in the department of neurology at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital.\n\nTargeting CGRP is not a particularly new idea. Researchers picked up on the protein\u2019s scent more than 30 years ago, and drug companies spent years trying to craft pills that might block its activity. Merck got all the way into late-stage trials with an anti-CGRP tablet, spending more than $1 billion only to find in 2011 that the drug had toxic effects on the liver and thus no future.\n\nWith the \u201cexquisite sensitivity\u201d of an antibody, however, scientists believe they can block CGRP without triggering dangerous side effects, Alder CEO Randy Schatzman said.\n\nBecause antibodies stay active in the body for weeks, the drug companies see their new products as preventative therapies, injected monthly or quarterly to keep headaches at bay. (Merck\u2019s failed pill, by contrast, was meant as an on-the-spot treatment after the pain started.)\n\n\u201cSo in some senses, it\u2019s a paradigm shift,\u201d Schatzman said.\n\nBut there are still hurdles to clear. Only about half of patients seem to respond to CGRP antibodies, and the companies have no way of predicting who they are ahead of time. A genetic test would be \u201cthe Holy Grail of personalized medicine,\u201d said Rob Lenz, Amgen\u2019s global development lead for neuroscience, but no one has made one yet.\n\nAnd long-term safety remains a major question mark. To date, none of the companies has reported serious side effects in clinical trials, but they\u2019ve only reported data from 12-week studies on about 1,500 total patients. It will take years to determine just what the new therapies do to the body over time, Loder said.\n\n\u2018I felt like my life was being stolen from me\u2019\n\nAny advance, even an incremental one, would be a major leap for the field, said Emily Bates, who studies the genetic causes of headaches at the University of Colorado and is not affiliated with any of the companies working on migraine treatment.\n\nBates struggled with chronic migraines in high school and college. Like many patients, she didn\u2019t respond to any of the preventative therapies available.\n\n\u201cThe pain is more than anything I\u2019ve ever experienced, and I\u2019ve run on broken legs before,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like my life was being stolen from me.\u201d\n\nCollectively, Americans miss about 113 million workdays each year because of migraine. That lost productivity costs society about $13 billion each year, according to the Migraine Research Foundation.\n\nYet scientific progress has been slow, in part because migraine was long considered a psychosomatic condition not worthy of serious research funding, Bates said.\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201csubjective symptom that predominantly affects women,\u201d said Loder, the Harvard neurologist. \u201cThat\u2019s a perfect combination of things that make people feel able to dismiss it.\u201d\n\nNovak, a professor of photography at New York University\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts, spent years trying to hide her migraines because of the stigma attached to the condition. But she decided to change all that in 2009 with a project called Migraine Register. She takes a photo of herself each day she has a migraine. Some years, that\u2019s more than 120 pictures.\n\nThe idea, in part, was to humanize chronic migraines. But the project also forced Novak to reckon with the toll of the disease, something she had tried to ignore for years.\n\n\u201cThat for me was like a concrete proof of how it really does affect my life,\u201d Novak said, \u201cof how much time I lose.\u201d", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The story\u00a0notes that \u201ctargeting CGRP is not a particularly new idea,\u201d and cites an earlier drug that caused liver toxicity.

So much so that the FDA recently cut recommended doses of Ambien and other drugs that contain zolpidem for fear that their use, even the night before, might impair driving or other activities the next day.\n\nLunesta and Ambien affect GABA receptors, which are found throughout the brain and are associated with side effects, including thinking disturbances, and deficits in attention and memory, explained Uslaner.\n\nAbout 15 years ago, scientists discovered chemical messengers known as orexins, which are released by a relatively small brain region known as the lateral hypothalamus. This area of the brain releases orexins during the day to keep us awake and lowers levels at night so we can sleep.\n\nThe appeal of orexin antagonists, said Dr. Michael Thorpy, director of the Sleep-Wake Disorders Center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, is that they \"target a system that's more specific for sleep.\"\n\nThat means, theoretically, fewer side effects and perhaps less of a tendency to be habit forming, Thorpy explained.\n\nUslaner and his colleagues investigated a compound called DORA-22, which has the same mechanism of action as suvorexant, to see how it fared alongside not only Ambien and Lunesta but also diazepam (Valium) in rats and rhesus monkeys.\n\nDORA-22 did not lead to the same mental impairments as the other three drugs. Rhesus monkeys and rats performed just as well on memory and attention tasks shortly after being administered DORA-22 as they did on an inactive placebo.\n\nIn each case, the minimum dose to achieve sleep was compared with the minimum dose that altered memory and thinking. DORA-22 promoted sleep at lower doses than those that impaired mental skills when compared with the \"control\" drugs.\n\nThis is the first time in years that scientists have targeted a totally different receptor in the quest to combat insomnia, said Dr. Alexandre Abreu, co-director of the UHealth Sleep Center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.\n\nBut many questions remain: Do the drugs truly have fewer side effects? Will they be habit forming? And will they change the quality of sleep in any way?\n\nThose questions will only be answered with more testing and use in humans, he said.\n\nExperts note that findings from animal studies do not always hold up in human trials.\n\nThe U.S. National Institutes of Health has more on insomnia.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The story makes it clear that DORA-22 is one of a new class of drugs designed to help with sleep disorders.\u00a0 The story does describe how this drug works on a different part of the sleep-wake mechanism in our brains than currently-available drugs.

A brain biopsy now can be used to detect Alzheimer's plaques but is highly invasive and may miss parts of the brain where the plaques and tangles of Alzheimer's are densest. While diagnosis by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy is under study for early detection , accurate early detection by such noninvasive means is a ways away.\n\nAnd on Monday, the American Academy of Neurology released a new study showing that an agent called florbetaben also allowed detection of amyloid plaques when used with a PET scan. The florbetaben study is to be presented at the academy's \"Emerging Science\" program next week in New Orleans. Both Florbetapir F 18 and florbetaben help diagnose Alzheimer's by sticking to beta amyloid clumps and emitting radioactivity, which can then be picked up by a PET scan.\n\nThose questions are no longer hypothetical. Last week, the FDA approved an agent called Florbetapir F 18 injection (to be marketed as Amyvid), which will allow physicians using a positron emissions tomography (PET) scan to detect the presence and extent of amyloid plaques in patients concerned about declining mental function.\n\nNo one wants to hear that he or she has Alzheimer's disease. But if the beta-amyloid plaques that are the disorder's key physical hallmark could be detected before memory loss and cognitive troubles were evident to all, would you want to know? And since no treatment currently works to stem the inexorable progress ofAlzheimer's, who would pay for a costly test to detect it early -- and why?\n\nThe FDA says that Amyvid \"is not a test to predict the development of AD-associated dementia\" in those who have no problematic symptoms. It's an early test for those who already have cognitive concerns and who wonder whether Alzheimer's disease may be the cause. Among patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, about 60% have amyloid plaques and will go on to develop dementia that is likely Alzheimer's disease, said Dr. Michael W. Weiner of the Department of Veterans Affairs' Center for Imaging of Neurodegenerative Diseases.\n\nWeiner is the leading researcher on the largest and most comprehensive Alzheimer's research initiative of its kind, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. ADNI, a nationwide consortium that is still enrolling subjects, is a five-year, $60-million project that will track 800 participants to compare how mental and daily-life skills, and the brain's structure and function, change in those aging normally, those with mild cognitive impairment and those with dementia. Weiner conducted much of the research leading to Amyvid's approval.\n\nFor now, says Weiner, there is \"no consensus\" on which patients should get the costly new PET scans that use Amyvid, and large insurers such as Medicare and Medicaid have not made decisions about coverage for such tests. And some patients may question whether they would want to know that the source of their mental troubles is Alzheimer's disease, said Weiner.\n\n\"But for many, when you take a person to the doctor, you usually want an answer, whether it leads to a treatment or not. This is a way of getting closer to an answer,\" said Weiner. Many patients experiencing cognitive lapses may also be reassured if the test fails to reveal amyloid plaques, he added.\n\nWith growing understanding that the changes of Alzheimer's disease may be decades in the making, the value of early detection is gaining adherents, said Weiner. The \"real game-changer,\" he says, will be when one of the many experimental therapies under study for Alzheimer's disease succeeds in blocking or reversing its progress. Once that happens, physicians, researchers and insurers will need to figure out who should get the test and at what cost, and who will pay.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The story does not overstate the novelty of the test or its approval by the FDA.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Newswise \u2014 City of Hope patient Susan Young has had a remarkable response to a potentially revolutionary new treatment, a combination of the p53 cancer vaccine and a drug that blocks a specific cancer-aiding protein.\n\nThe 69-year-old came to City of Hope in August 2016 from UC Davis with advanced triple-negative breast cancer that had metastasized to her bones and skin. She had exhausted all of her chemotherapy options, and this experimental treatment was her last hope. The only other option was hospice.\n\n\u201cAt least 60 to 70 percent of her body was covered by lesions, inflammation and thickened, purplish skin,\u201d said Yuan Yuan, M.D., breast cancer oncologist at City of Hope, who treated Young. \u201cSix weeks into her treatment, the skin lesions were gone, her itchiness went away. It\u2019s quite a dramatic response.\u201d\n\nSo dramatic, in fact, that Yuan refers to Young as her \u201cmiracle patient.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis in some ways is pretty unprecedented. This patient is at a late stage of her disease. There are no treatments available that would have done the same thing,\u201d said Don J. Diamond, Ph.D., chair of the Department of Experimental Therapeutics at City of Hope.\n\nYoung received a combination of the p53 vaccine and the drug pembrolizumab. Diamond developed the vaccine and has been studying its effectiveness in clinical trials at COH since 2010. He currently is testing it on ovarian cancer and other solid tumors, such as pancreatic and gastrointestinal masses.\n\n\u201cI've responded great. I'm feeling good,\u201d said Young, who has received six of seven pembrolizumab infusions, each of which takes about a half-hour, and all three p53 vaccine injections. \u201cMy skin has cleared up. I think the prognosis is going to be good now.\u201d\n\nThe most frequent mutation across all cancers occurs in a gene called p53, which contributes to cells becoming oncogenic when they produce a mutant form of the p53 protein (p53 gene mutations are present in about 50% of malignancies). Diamond\u2019s vaccine boosts the immune response to many different mutant forms of p53. The researchers tested this vaccine, known as p53MVA, in a 2013 clinical trial and found it to be safe in patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancers.\n\nHowever, patients whose T cells had pre-existing high levels of a protein named PD1 \u2014 a molecule that instructs immune cells to shut down \u2014 responded poorly to the anti-p53 vaccine. In a subsequent laboratory study, the COH researchers showed that these patients\u2019 immune cells could be reactivated by treatment with a PD1 inhibitor that is a biosimilar to the clinical drug called pembrolizumab. Together, the vaccine and the drug potentially could form a potent team to reactivate the immune system to quickly clear out cancer cells.\n\nBefore Young, the combination had been tried on patients with recurrent solid tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and many other cancer types.\n\nSo far, while Diamond has noted an immune response in patients given the combination treatment in clinical trials, he has not seen a clinical benefit.\n\nThat is, until he met Young.\n\n\u201cWe have treated a number of different types of patients with the combination, but nothing is even in the same universe as this,\u201d he said.\n\nYoung, who tested positive for the p53 mutation, has been fighting breast cancer for eight years and has undergone \u201cone chemo after another,\u201d Yuan said.\n\nReferred to City of Hope by her physician at Davis, she began responding to the experimental treatment right away, Yuan said, her skin tumors disappearing and the latest biopsies showing no cancer. \u201cThe purple, thickened skin has faded away, the skin color has normalized. She\u2019s healed, basically,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a promising early response. It\u2019s quite unusual,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have two drugs here so it\u2019s hard to dissect which drug did what, but we do think the vaccine played a key role.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was shocking to me,\u201d said Diamond. \u201cWhat we have noticed is that her immune response to p53 has been increasing as time goes on. It was of tremendous magnitude in the last [blood] draw.\u201d\n\nThe next step will be to take bone and CT scans to see if the cancer is disappearing internally as well as externally, which Young will receive in a couple of weeks.\n\nEven now, though, Young is \u201cextremely happy with the results,\u201d Yuan said. \u201cHer psychological wellbeing has improved. Her appetite is better, she\u2019s more functional. She went through a lot. It will be very interesting to follow up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn't look at myself. It was really hard,\u201d Young said of the skin lesions she had endured for five years. They started to go away after the third treatment, she said. \u201cEven the marks where it was climbing up my neck are all gone.\u201dFurther study needed\n\nWhat Diamond is hoping for now is funding for a full clinical trial so that he can test the combination in advanced triple-negative breast cancer patients who test positive for p53. A couple of major drug companies have already expressed interest in his vaccine, he said.\n\n\u201cWhat we would like is to have women come here from all over the country and the world to receive this vaccine formula so that we can test this combination,\u201d Diamond said. \u201cIf it happened once, maybe it will happen twice. But we\u2019ve got to get these patients in.\u201d\n\nFollowing the success in Young, the formula has recently been given to two other triple negative breast cancer patients at City of Hope.

It\u2019s estimated that about 1 in every 100 people in the UK has ASD. More boys are diagnosed with the condition than girls.\n\nResearch indicates that ASD most likely develops in the womb and that a mother\u2019s diet during pregnancy could have an influence. But results from previous studies have been inconsistent, suggesting that other unmeasured factors (confounding), such as a mother\u2019s overall health and lifestyle, could also play a role.\n\nSo an international research team set out to assess whether nutrient supplementation during pregnancy is associated with reduced risk of ASD, with and without intellectual disability.\n\nThey applied three analytical methods to a sample of 273,107 mother-child pairs living in Stockholm, Sweden.

However strengths included the relatively large population-based sample size and the advanced analytical methods used to gauge the robustness of findings.\n\n\u201cTogether, the three analyses appear to point toward a potential inverse association between multivitamin use with ASD with intellectual disability,\u201d say the authors.\n\nGiven the current understanding and strength of evidence supporting the importance of nutritional supplementation during pregnancy, \u201cit is impossible to imagine that these results, on their own, should change current practice,\u201d they write.

Food addicts suffer from the same neurobiological conditions so we believe it will help food addicts as well and our initial tests have backed up that theory.\n\n\"This could have important implications for people who are obese. There is mounting evidence to show that there is a substantial number of obese people who are food addicts because they have an inability to control their impulsive actions and this drug has shown it can give them more control, which will help overweight people lose weight and so improve their health.\n\n\"Food addicts know they need to lose weight, but the desire for more food is overwhelming, leading to a spiral of depression that can lead to psychological issues as well as health problems.\"\n\nThe drug, which is sold under a wide variety of brand names around the world, was one of two drugs tested by researchers, the other being Atomoxetine. Both drugs have been used for impulsive conditions, including ADHD.\n\nIn the paper Pharmacological manipulation of impulsivity: A randomized controlled trial published in Personality and Individual Differences, the scientists conducted a series of trials on 60 men aged between 19 and 32, with 20 taking a placebo, 20 Atomoxetine and 20 Modafinil.\n\nThe tests revealed that those who had taken Modafinil had a significantly reduced level of impulsiveness, whereas Atomoxetine produced no difference compared to the placebo group.\n\n\"Modafinil was found to have an effect on impulsivity in healthy individuals and so would be able to have an even bigger effect on food addicts, who are lacking in certain types of dopamine,\" said Professor Vlaev.\n\n\"This drug could be a real help to those people struggling to control their desire for food even though they know they should lose weight.\n\n\"The drug improves self-control, which is a key factor in determining obesity, so our hypothesis is that this drug should help in treating the disease.\"\n\nFor a copy of the paper email Ashley.potter@wbs.ac.uk\n\nWarwick Business School is the largest department of the University of Warwick and is triple accredited by the leading global business education associations - the first in the UK to attain this accreditation.

The report greatly expands the universe of people who should be screened to see if they need the medication to everyone over age 40 regardless of whether they have a history of cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe recommendations also support the position of the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association, which in 2013 radically shifted their advice from suggesting that doctors focus on the level of a patient\u2019s low-density lipoproteins (LDL) or \u201cbad cholesterol\u201d to looking at a more comprehensive picture of risk based on things such as weight and blood pressure, as well as lifestyle factors.\n\n\u201cPeople with no signs, symptoms, or history of cardiovascular disease can still be at risk for having a heart attack or stroke,\u201d said Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, who chairs the task force.\n\n[Could these new cholesterol drugs save many people from heart attacks?]\n\nThe task force, which is made up of independent experts but commissioned by the government, concurred after a comprehensive review of the evidence on the topic determined that a broader evaluation of risk is needed. But it puts a greater emphasis on age than the ACC and AHA did in determining who might benefit from the medication in preventing heart attack or stroke. It is also slightly more conservative when it comes to determining the benefits of taking the medications, which include Lipitor, Crestor and Zocor.\n\nThe new guidelines, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, suggests that people ages 40 to 75 who have one or more risk factors \u2014 such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes or smoking that put them at a 10 percent or greater risk of having a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years \u2014 should be on statins. The group also said that people with a 7.5 percent to 10 percent risk \u201cmay also benefit\u201d but did not definitively recommend they take them. \u201cPeople in this group should make an individual decision with their doctor about whether to start taking statins,\u201d the task force advised.\n\nIn contrast, the ACC and AHA recommend that people with a 7.5 percent or greater risk take the drugs.\n\n[Who should take statins? A vicious debate over cholesterol drugs.]\n\nAnother important difference between the groups is that the task force withheld a recommendation about starting statins in adults who are 76 and older, saying that \u201cthe current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms.\u201d In a commentary accompanying the recommendations, Philip Greenland and Robert Bonow note that there is \u201cuncertainty and hesitation\u201d in the guidelines regarding older people but said it appears that it is not necessary to stop taking statins at age 76 if you are already on them.\n\nThe task force and AHA groups carry tremendous influence in medical practice and in what insurance companies will cover. Medicare typically follows USPSTF guidelines in determining coverage and the Affordable Care Act specifies that USPSTF recommendations rated at the strongest levels must be used as a floor for coverage for private insurers. In the case of statins, this would apply to the use of the drug by those who are 40 to 75 years old with one or more risk factors for cardiovascular disease and who have a 10 percent or greater risk \u2014 but not those with 7.5 to 10 percent risk.\n\nIndividual doctors are free to take the advice or leave it, and in recent months there has been a lot of debate about what the scientific evidence really shows regarding the therapy.\n\nThere is a consensus among experts that people at substantial risk for heart disease benefit from statins but considerable disagreement about those at lower risk. Last month, National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins wrote in the journal Lancet that \u201cit\u2019s a force for good.\u201d But Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California at San Francisco and editor of JAMA Internal Medicine, and others have been vocal about their belief that the drugs are overprescribed and that the side effects \u2014 which range from muscle pain and cataracts to possibly an increased risk for diabetes in women \u2014 should be taken more seriously.\n\nIn an opinion piece Sunday, Redberg and Mitchell Katz, deputy editor of JAMA Internal Medicine, advised everyone to take \u201ca step back\u201d and ask \u201cwhy this debate is so contentious.\u201d They suggest that the estimates of the benefits of statins may be inflated, that the drugs as an intervention are \u201cweak,\u201d and that the reports of adverse events are incomplete.\n\n\u201cIn deciding on any therapy, it is important to understand the risks and benefits, particularly for healthy people,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe two U.S. guidelines are notably more aggressive in recommending drugs than reports issued by their counterparts in other parts of the world, including the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (which recommends statins in men 40 and older but only after age 50 in women, and the U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which recommends discussing lifestyle modification before offering statin therapy). The European Society of Cardiology focuses more on managing LDL.\n\nStatins are among the best-selling drugs in the United States, with a 2011 study showing at least 32 million Americans were taking them. The 2013 ACC and AHA guidelines recommend an estimated 24 million more people should be on them.\n\nThe task force\u2019s recommendations come on the heels of an important new study, published Saturday, that shows that people who use statins survive heart attacks better than those who do not. They are more likely to not only get to the hospital and survive until they are discharged but also survive in greater numbers a year after their hospitalization than those who do not use statins.\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nStatin intolerance is real, researchers find.

Such regular use of low-dose aspirin reduced the risk by 20 percent of estrogen or progesterone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer, which is the most common breast cancer subtype.\n\n\"The study found an interesting protective association between low-dose aspirin and breast cancer,\" said lead author Christina A. Clarke, Ph.D., M.P.H., from the Cancer Prevention Institute of California. \"We did not by and large find associations with the other pain medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. We also did not find associations with regular aspirin since this type of medication is taken sporadically for headaches or other pain, and not daily for prevention of cardiovascular disease.\"\n\nThis study differed from other studies that have looked at aspirin and cancer risk because it focused on the dose levels of the aspirin women had taken and tracked the frequency of the use of low-dose aspirin as opposed to regular aspirin. It was also able to look in detail at subtypes of breast cancer.\n\n\"We already knew that aspirin is a weak aromatase inhibitor and we treat women with breast cancer with stronger aromatase inhibitors since they reduce the amount of estrogen postmenopausal women have circulating in their blood,\" said Bernstein. \"We thought that if aspirin can inhibit aromatase, it ought to reduce the likelihood that breast cancer would develop and it could also be an effective way to improve breast cancer patients' prognosis once they no longer take the more potent aromatase inhibitors.\" Bernstein added, \"Aspirin also reduces inflammation, which may be another mechanism by which aspirin taken regularly can lower risk of breast cancer developing or recurring.\"\n\nAs part of the study, researchers analyzed data recorded in questionnaires submitted by 57,164 women in the California's Teacher's Study. In 2005, participants answered questions regarding family history of cancer and other conditions, use of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), menstrual and reproductive history, use of hormones, weight and height, living environment, diet, alcohol use and physical activity. In the ensuing years before 2013, 1,457 of these participants developed invasive breast cancer.\n\nThe team of researchers chose to focus on low-dose \"baby\" aspirin, because not only is it inexpensive and readily available as potential means of prevention, but because there are already a lot of people already taking it for prevention of other diseases such as heart disease and even colon cancer.\n\nNow that we have some data separating low-dose from higher-dose aspirin, more detailed research can be undertaken to understand the full value of low-dose aspirin for breast cancer prevention,\" said Clarke.\"\n\nOther collaborating authors include Alison J.

At study enrollment, none had signs of dementia. The participants were recruited from people already taking part in the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a study of residents of more than 40 retirement communities and senior public housing units across northern Illinois, plus older adults identified through church groups and social service agencies.\n\nDuring the course of the study, each person received annual, standardized testing for cognitive ability in five areas -- episodic memory, working memory, semantic memory, visuospatial ability and perceptual speed. The study group also completed annual food frequency questionnaires, allowing the researchers to compare participants' reported seafood intake with changes in their cognitive abilities as measured by the tests.\n\nThe questionnaires included four types of seafood: tuna sandwiches; fish sticks, fish cakes and fish sandwiches; fresh fish as a main dish; and shrimp, lobster and crab. The participants were divided into two groups: those who ate at least one of those seafood meals per week and those who ate less than one of those seafood meals per week.\n\nParticipants in the higher seafood consumption group ate an average of two seafood meals per week. Those in the lower group ate an average of 0.5 meals per week.\n\nSeafood is the direct nutrient source of a type of omega-3 fatty acid (docosahexaenoic acid) that is the main structural component of the brain. While epidemiologic studies have shown the importance of seafood and omega-3 fatty acids in preventing dementia, few prior studies have examined their associations with specific types of cognitive ability.\n\nIn the new Neurology article, the researchers report associations between seafood consumption and two of the areas of cognitive ability that they tested. People who ate more seafood had reduced rates of decline in the semantic memory, which is memory of verbal information. They also had slower rates of decline in a test of perceptual speed, or the ability to quickly compare letters, objects and patterns.\n\nThe study did not find a significant difference in the rate of decline in episodic memory (recollection of personal experiences), working memory (short-term memory used in mental function in the immediate present) and visuospatial ability (comprehension of relationships between objects).\n\nThe results were the same after researchers adjusted for other factors that could affect memory and thinking skills, such as education, physical activity, smoking and participating in mentally stimulating activities.\n\nFurther, the protective association of seafood was even stronger among individuals with a common genotype (APOE-\u03b54) that increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.

We're simply providing a product to help people know what's in their food and guide their habits.\"\n\nGluten-free diners can place a sample of food into a capsule or \"test pod\" and then insert the capsule into a black, triangular device that basically acts like a mini chemistry test. In about two minutes, Sundvor said Nima can tell if the food sample has 20 parts per million or more of gluten. A smiley face means it's OK; a frowning face means it doesn't pass muster.\n\nAs a point of reference, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires manufacturers who choose to put a \"gluten free\" label on food packaging to meet the same 20 parts per million of gluten standard.\n\nGluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. People with celiac disease experience an immune reaction when they eat gluten that can lead to intestinal damage and impact the health of other organs if it's not managed well. It can cause stomach pain, a swollen belly, acid reflux, diarrhea, skin problems, and other symptoms.\n\nThe National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases estimates that about 1 in 141 Americans has celiac disease, but many people don't know they have the condition. Gluten-sensitive people experience similar symptoms to those with celiac disease and improve when they eliminate gluten from their diets.\n\nNima is triangular and relatively dainty, about three and a half inches tall by three inches wide, and a little less than an inch thick. \"Small enough to fit into your pocket along with your keys and mobile phone or a small clutch,\" said Sundvor.\n\nNima was first conceived when Sundvor and company co-founder Shireen Yates met about two years ago and realized they both had gluten intolerance and other food issues.\n\n\"We met at MIT through mutual friends. She was getting her MBA and I'd gotten my engineering degree from there. We had this shared experience; Shireen has several food allergies and I also have several food intolerances. We both just had these issues where we'd eat out and get sick or feel uncomfortable,\" Sundvor said. \"Shireen had the idea, 'Why can't I just test my food and figure out what's in it?' So we started talking about the idea and we researched the market and realized it's something we could make happen.\"\n\nIt costs $179 to pre-order a tester plus three one-time-use pods, and $47.95 for a refill pack of 12 pods; prices will increase later this month, according to the company's website. The company plans to deliver the product by the middle of next year after they've tested it more thoroughly, Sundvor.\n\nMarilyn Grunzweig Geller, chief executive officer of the Celiac Disease Foundation, said she is not familiar with the new gluten-sensing device and was unable to comment on it directly.\n\n\"Certainly an FDA-approved device that could help people determine if they were accidentally ingesting gluten could go a long way to helping people and would be useful.\" However, she adds, \"I would never comment on a device that's not FDA-approved.\"\n\nShe said she's anecdotally aware of a number of \"treatments\" for celiac disease and has heard of gluten sensors, but is skeptical.\n\nAs for Nima, Sundvor said, \"We're doing a huge amount of testing and one thing we want to be sure of before we start shipping is that we're 99.9 percent accurate.\"\n\nHe said they have received Nima prototypes and he and his girlfriend, who has celiac disease, are already trying it out.\n\nThe company also aims to create similar versions that could test for peanut and dairy allergens, among other problematic ingredients. A Nima app is in the works, too, that he says will let users share information about restaurants and log their results.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "This is not the only product under the sun designed to quick-test for gluten, although to be fair, it\u2019s unclear whether another product would be better/worse/as good.

By the end of the six-month study, patients who had received the text messages had reduced their cholesterol, blood pressure and body mass index.\n\n\"I have to say, we were pretty surprised that it worked,\" says Clara Chow, lead author of the study and program director of community-based cardiac services at Westmead Hospital in Sydney, Australia.\n\nAnd it worked to improve not just one risk factor for heart disease, but many. \"These are the things that medications usually do, not text messages,\" says Chow, who is also an associate professor at Sydney Medical School at the University of Sydney.\n\nIn a randomized clinical trial, more than 700 patients with coronary heart disease were split into two groups: half received four text messages per week for six months plus usual care, while the other half received just usual care.\n\nThe texts that patients received were semi-personalized, based on background information about each person, such as smoking status and preferred name. For example, vegetarian participants wouldn't receive the text message about how grilling steak is healthier than deep-frying it.\n\nOther texts might include something like, \"Hi, Elizabeth. Have you gone for your walk today?\" or \"Have you taken your medications yet today? It's important to take them at the same time each day.\"\n\nThere's a lot of hype over mobile health interventions these days, Chow says. \"Everyone thinks it has a lot of potential, but there's actually very little evidence.\"\n\nWhile there are more than 100,000 health-related apps on the market, the evidence to date is lacking as to whether many of those apps are safe or effective, according to Zubin Eapen, a cardiologist and assistant professor of medicine at Duke University School of Medicine.\n\n\"We [as physicians] are always looking for evidence to make sure that we are recommending the right things for our patients, whether it's a drug, a device or a digital product, like an app,\" says Eapen, who is also medical director of the Duke Heart Failure Same-Day Access Clinic.\n\nEapen coauthored an editorial, which was published alongside Chow's study, with Eric Peterson, the Fred Cobb Distinguished Professor of Medicine in the division of cardiology at Duke and an associate editor of JAMA.\n\nNot only does this research provide evidence that a text-based program can improve heart disease risk factors, but it also shows that a bunch of bells and whistles aren't required for successful health outcomes. A simple, low-cost program of text messaging can do the trick.\n\n\"I like to look for things that are able to be used in multiple corners of our world, from low-income settings to high-income settings,\" Chow says. \"Everybody owns a mobile phone these days. You don't have to have a smartphone to text.\"\n\nThat means more access across more sectors of a population. While almost two-thirds of American adults own a smartphone, that number rises even higher when you're talking about plain old cell phones \u2013 a full nine out of 10 American adults own some kind of cell phone.\n\nGlobally, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death. \"If we are going to reach a global population, we need solutions that are both scalable and affordable,\" Eapen says. \"And mobile health \u2013 and text messaging, maybe, in particular \u2013 represents both a scalable and affordable approach.\"\n\nMaking healthy changes in behavior can be tough, but for patients with heart disease, it can be vital.\n\nYet those daily decisions \u2013 whether to smoke that cigarette, eat that piece of cake or skip the gym \u2013 are often \"far removed from the rewards or consequences,\" Eapen says. It can be hard to view those everyday decisions in light of more distant consequences, like having another heart attack or not living as long a life as desired. Encouraging text messages may help to inform those everyday decisions and keep a bigger goal in mind.\n\nChow and Eapen say the study has its limitations. It can't tell us whether text messaging could eventually lead to fewer subsequent heart attacks among the patients receiving those messages or whether the positive health outcomes would continue past the six-month study window. Yet patients in Chow's study resoundingly said that the text messaging helped them make the necessary changes \u2013 more than 90 percent of the participants found the program useful.\n\n\"People said things like, 'It wasn't actually what the messages said, it was that someone was there supporting me, thinking about me,' \" Chow says.\n\nAnd although Chow and her colleagues told study participants that they did not need to reply to the text messages, many of them still did. \"Heaps of them replied to us,\" she says. \"They would say, 'Thanks for the message.

The authors, from Cleveland Clinic in the US, say considering radiosurgery earlier on could make a big difference to patients' lives.\n\nTrigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a very painful nerve disorder that causes an electrical shock feeling in the face, usually in older people. Some things can trigger it, like chewing or even the wind blowing, but attacks can be random. On a scale of 1-10, patients often describe the pain as 15 - off the scale. TN is commonly treated with anti-epileptic medications. While this can reduce the pain, it makes patients drowsy and tired, and they report feeling drunk. This has an impact on their quality of life and frequently causes depression, as it stops them from driving, working or even just leaving the house.\n\nAccording to the new study, radiosurgery, which is normally a second line treatment to be used following the medication, helps improve quality of life and reduce depression in patients with TN. By considering it earlier as a treatment option, doctors could help improve the lives of patients with TN more quickly.\n\n\"We knew radiosurgery results in pain relief, but we didn't know if the patients actually felt better,\" said Dr. Samuel Chao, corresponding author of the study. \"I think people go and see their neurologist and get the pain under control with medication, but they don't realize how lousy this can make them feel. Using radiosurgery earlier on allows patients to get off the medications, improving their quality of life by allowing them to return to activities they used to do.\"\n\nRadiosurgery is a method for physically treating the nerve using radiation - with stereotactic radiosurgery, doctors can focus 192 beams of radiation on a single point. It is non-invasive, so doesn't require the healing time of traditional surgery. Treatment takes less than an hour and requires no anesthetic. However, it is often overlooked or delayed as a treatment because there is a lack of capability and experience with the method. Research has shown that radiosurgery reduces pain for 80% of patients, but the broader impact on their lives remained unknown.\n\nIn the new study, Dr. Chao, Dr. Kotecha and his colleagues prospectively collected data from 50 patients they treated with radiosurgery using two questionnaires: EuroQOL 5-Dimension and Patient Health Questionnaire 9. They asked questions about the patients' pain and facial numbness, their health and their ability to take care of themselves. The researchers analyzed patients' answers before treatment and at each follow-up appointment, and found that patients reported an improved quality of life and lower rates of depression after radiosurgery. Importantly, the benefit of treatment was strongly driven by improvements in pain and discomfort as well as self-care.\n\n\"Pain and the medication to stop the pain make it difficult for people with TN to go outside and live life,\" explained Dr. Chao. \"With radiosurgery, we can reduce pain, improve quality of life and decrease depression - people can go out and enjoy life without worrying they will have a random attack. Giving options empowers the patient to be more aware of themselves and manage their own condition.\"\n\nThe team plans to analyze the impact of other treatment options and carry out a cost-based analysis to establish the best treatment options for TN.\n\nThe article is \"Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Trigeminal Neuralgia Improves Patient-Reported Quality-of-Life and Reduces Depression,\" by Rupesh Kotecha, Jacob A.

Its purpose is to liquefy the semen to release sperm, freeing them to fertilize an egg. The PSA level, measured in nanograms per milliliter of blood, reflects how much of this antigen is being produced and released into the bloodstream. The larger a man\u2019s prostate, the more PSA is produced, which makes the test very confusing in older men with benign enlargement of this gland.\n\nAside from cancer and prostatic growth with age, factors that can change PSA measurements include inflammation or infection of the prostate; a decline in testosterone levels or the drug finasteride, taken for hair loss, both of which lower the PSA; and variations in laboratory assays and in the inherent biology of a person. Biological variability can result in as much as a 15 percent difference between readings, and in nearly half of men with an abnormal PSA, the test will normalize in one to four years without any treatment.\n\nBut Dr. H. Ballentine Carter, a urologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, notes that no significant changes in PSA result from recent sexual intercourse or ejaculation, a digital rectal examination or riding a bicycle. \u201cEven long-distance bikers do not have prostate trauma\u201d that causes their PSA to increase, Dr. Carter said.\n\nCurrent guidelines recommend that all men have an annual PSA test starting at age 50 and that biopsies be conducted if the level exceeds 4 or if a \u201csignificant rise\u201d occurs between two tests. The guidelines also suggest limiting screening to men with more than a 10-year life expectancy.\n\nThis approach has resulted in many biopsies in men who did not have cancer \u2014 about 70 percent of those with elevated PSAs are cancer free \u2014 and debilitating prostate surgery in men with cancers that would never have become a threat in their remaining years of life.\n\nOn the Way: New Guidelines\n\nBased on recent studies, the American Urological Association will soon release revised guidelines that, experts hope, will reduce unnecessary biopsies and prostate surgeries, which even in the best hands can leave a man impotent and incontinent. The revised guidelines are expected to reduce the cost of screening, the cost per life saved and overall deaths from prostate cancer.\n\nThe new guidelines will no longer rely on a single reading. Rather, they will suggest that doctors focus on changes in levels over time. They will also suggest that testing start at 40 to obtain a baseline measurement, with the test repeated at 45 and 50, after which it should be given annually until 70.\n\n\u201cIf a 70-year-old man has a PSA history that hasn\u2019t changed over the years, maybe he doesn\u2019t need further testing,\u201d Dr. Carter suggested. \u201cPSA testing of men over 70 is not rational.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to a Scandinavian study showing that among men older than 65, to prevent one death from prostate cancer over 10 years, 330 men would have to have prostate surgery.\n\n\u201cThis has created a huge dilemma in urology,\u201d Dr. Carter said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to miss the possibility of a life-threatening disease, but we end up diagnosing and treating disease that would never have caused harm.\u201d\n\nThe new guidelines will lower the PSA level at which a biopsy should be considered, because, as Dr. Carter put it, \u201cthere\u2019s no level below which we can tell a man he doesn\u2019t have prostate cancer or life-threatening prostate cancer.\u201d\n\nAs one important trial showed, among men with a very low PSA \u2014 that is, a reading below the current cutoff of 4 \u2014 biopsies found that 15 percent had prostate cancer. Among that 15 percent, Dr. Carter said, 15 percent had high-grade, potentially life-threatening cancers. That means that 2.25 percent of the total number of men with a PSA less than 4 had life-threatening cancers.\n\nBut, he added, \u201cIf we biopsied every man with a PSA below 4, we\u2019d be looking at a sea of cancers that would never grow to be life threatening.\u201d\n\nThese facts and the results of a recent study by Dr. Carter, among others, indicated that rather than acting on the basis of a single PSA test, the rate of change in levels over time is a better indicator of who might have a serious cancer. This rate, known as PSA velocity, will be part of the new guidelines, which will suggest that in men with low readings, doctors consider the changes in levels over the course of three measurements.\n\n\u201cWe need at least 1 \u00bd to 2 years\u2019 worth of data\u201d to make a meaningful judgment about how to proceed, Dr. Carter said.\n\nHe explained that in men with an initially high level \u2014 say 10 or higher\u2014 velocity is not an issue. For them, if other factors like prostate infection are not the cause of the high level, a biopsy is in order. But in men with a PSA from 0 to 4, knowing the velocity of changes can add useful information, he said.\n\nAnother approach to assessing the meaning of a PSA reading is to analyze how much antigen is traveling free in the blood and how much is bound to a companion protein, Dr. Scardino suggested. If more than 25 percent of the PSA is free, chances are that it is being produced by a benignly enlarged prostate. The lower the amount of free PSA, the more likely cancer is the cause and the more likely the disease is aggressive, requiring treatment, according to Dr. Patrick C. Walsh, a Johns Hopkins urologist and the author of \u201cDr. Patrick Walsh\u2019s Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer.\u201d", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The article describes the time PSA testing began to be used \u2013 in the early 1990's.\u00a0 It also talks about several variations of PSA testing (PSA velocity, free-PSA, complexed PSA), which are relatively new.\u00a0 ", "answer": 1}, {"article": "MADISON, Wis. -- More than 700 million adults and children worldwide are obese, according to a 2017 study that called the growing number and weight-related health problems a \"rising pandemic.\"\n\nNew battery-free, easily implantable weight-loss devices developed by engineers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison could offer a promising new weapon for battling the bulge.\n\nIn laboratory testing, the devices helped rats shed almost 40 percent of their body weight. Results of the study were published today (Dec. 17, 2018) in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nMeasuring less than 1 centimeter across, or about a third of the area of a U.S. penny, the tiny devices -- which are safe for use in the body and implantable via a minimally invasive procedure -- generate gentle electric pulses from the stomach's natural churning motions and deliver them to the vagus nerve, which links the brain and the stomach.\n\nThat gentle stimulation dupes the brain into thinking that the stomach is full after only a few nibbles of food.\n\n\"The pulses correlate with the stomach's motions, enhancing a natural response to help control food intake,\" says Xudong Wang, a UW-Madison professor of materials science and engineering.\n\nUnlike gastric bypass, which permanently alters the capacity of the stomach, the effects of the new devices also are reversible. When Wang and his collaborators removed the devices after 12 weeks, the study's rats resumed their normal eating patterns and weight bounced right back on.\n\nWang's device has several advantages over an existing unit that stimulates the vagus nerve for weight loss. That existing unit, \"Maestro,\" approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2015, administers high-frequency zaps to the vagus nerve to shut down all communication between the brain and stomach. It requires a complicated control unit and bulky batteries which frequently must be recharged.\n\nThat ongoing maintenance can be a big barrier to use, says Luke Funk, a surgery professor in UW-Madison's Division of Minimally Invasive, Foregut and Bariatric Surgery. \"One potential advantage of the new device over existing vagus nerve stimulators is that it does not require external battery charging, which is a significant advantage when you consider the inconvenience that patients experience when having to charge a battery multiple times a week for an hour or so.\"\n\nIn fact, Wang's device contains no batteries, no electronics, and no complicated wiring. It relies instead on the undulations of the stomach walls to power its internal generators.\n\nThat means the device only stimulates the vagus nerve when the stomach moves.\n\n\"It's automatically responsive to our body function, producing stimulation when needed,\" says Wang. \"Our body knows best.\"\n\nWang is a world expert in wearable and implantable capacitive electricity-generating devices, having previously created implantable nanogenerators that harvest energy from people's beating hearts and breathing, a motion-powered bandage for wound healing, and other such devices.\n\nHe and his collaborators patented the weight-loss device through the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and are moving forward with testing in larger animal models. If successful, they hope to move toward human trials.\n\n\"Our expectation is that the device will be more effective and convenient to use than other technologies,\" says Wang.\n\nUW-Madison radiology professor Weibo Cai is also a senior author on the study.\n\nThis research was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (R01EB021336 and P30CA014520).", "question": "Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The release says this device could be an improvement on an approved device that also stimulates the vagus nerve to alter hunger perception.

Breast cancer afflicts 1 in 8 women in their lifetime and 1 in 25 die from this disease. Although a number of randomized trials demonstrate the clear benefits of mammography screening in women up to age 74 on reducing mortality, data are sparse in women over the age of 74, especially minorities. In 2010, 41 percent of breast cancer deaths occurred in the more than 19 million women who are between the ages of 65 to 84 years.\n\nIn a new study published in the American Journal of Medicine, Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., senior author and first Sir Richard Doll Professor and senior academic advisor to the dean in the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine at Florida Atlantic University, indicates that black and white women ages 75 to 84 years who had an annual mammogram had lower 10-year breast cancer mortality than corresponding women who had biennial or no/irregular mammograms.\n\nAmong elder women, the American Cancer Society and the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommend regular mammography for ages 65 to 74.\n\nAlthough many guidelines rely on self-reports, Hennekens and his collaborators from Baylor College of Medicine and Meharry Medical College, used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program file linked to the Medicare administrative claims file, which allowed them to identify screening mammography use from 1995 to 2009 from 64,384 non-Hispanic women (4,886 black and 59,498 white). These linked files also permitted them to explore breast cancer mortality differences between elderly black or white women who self-selected for regular annual or biennial mammography screening. The researchers selected 69 as the lower age limit because Medicare coverage of the general population begins at age 65, and the exposure of interest was regular mammography screening in the four years immediately preceding breast cancer diagnosis.\n\nThree mutually exclusive categories were defined: no or irregular mammography; biennial mammography; and annual mammography. They looked at data from non-Hispanic, white or black women; Hispanics were not included because Hispanic white women have substantially lower mortality than non-Hispanic whites, and the number of Hispanic blacks is small. The researchers also measured socioeconomic status looking at median household income, the percentage of individuals living below the poverty level, and whether or not they had a high school education.\n\u2022 White women who had died tended to be older, to have a later stage diagnosis, to have received chemotherapy, and to have a higher socioeconomic status.\n\u2022 White women who died were less likely to have undergone surgery and receive radiation therapy.\n\u2022 Similar characteristics were seen in black women as in white women.\n\u2022 69- to 84-year-old women receiving regular annual screening mammography during the four years immediately preceding breast cancer diagnosis had consistently lower five-year and 10-year risks of breast cancer mortality than women with no or irregular screening regardless of race.\n\u2022 10-year risks were more than three times higher among white and more than two times higher among blacks aged 69 to 84 years with no or irregular screening compared with annual screening.\n\nHennekens notes that further research is needed, but that in the future, the use of regular claims-based surveillance for mammography as a source of data may offer some unique advantages over self-reports.\n\nFrom 1995 to 2005, according to Science Watch, Hennekens was the third most widely cited medical researcher in the world and five of the top 20 were his former fellows and/or trainees.

The results, based upon nearly 3 million people with ADHD in the United States, are reported in the American Journal of Psychiatry.\n\n\"This study contributes to growing evidence that ADHD medication is linked to lower risk for many types of harmful behavior, including substance abuse,\" said Patrick D. Quinn, a postdoctoral researcher in the IU Bloomington College of Arts and Sciences' Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, who led the study. \"The results also highlight the importance of careful diagnosis and compliance with treatment.\"\n\nAs one of the largest analyses on the risks and benefits of ADHD medication, the study drew on anonymous health care data from 146 million people with employer-based health insurance in the United States from 2005 to 2014.\n\nSpecifically, the researchers mined the data to identify people with ADHD whose records showed periods of ADHD medication use and periods without ADHD medication use -- as well as one or more visits to the emergency room due to drug or alcohol use. They then calculated the odds of the visits occurring during the person's use of ADHD medication versus the same person's non-use of ADHD medication.\n\n\"Many factors can influence who receives ADHD treatment, including socioeconomic factors, health care access, the strength of support networks and disorder severity,\" Quinn said. \"Although no single study of real-world treatment practices can definitively show whether medication use lowers risk, studying the same people at different points in their medical history helps us control for these factors and isolate the role of medication in their behavior.\"\n\nOf the nearly 3 million people with ADHD in the study's database, about 57 percent experienced periods in which they were and were not prescribed medication to treat the disorder. About 2 percent experienced an emergency room visit due to substance abuse. The median age of the study's participants was 21 for men and 28 for women.\n\nThe majority of the ADHD medicines used in the study were stimulants such as Adderall, an amphetamine, and Ritalin, or methylphenidate. A significantly smaller number used nonstimulant ADHD medication such as Strattera, or atomoxetine.\n\n\"While concerns about prescribing medications to treat ADHD that have the potential for abuse are understandable, this study provides further evidence that the use of these medications is not associated with increased risk of substance use problems in adolescence or adulthood,\" Quinn said. \"Rather, this and other recent studies find that the risk of such problems is lower during and after periods of use of these medications.\"\n\nQuinn is a member of the lab of Brian M.

Osteoporosis was defined broadly, using both BMD criteria as well as recent history of nonvertebral fracture and confirmed prevalent vertebral fracture on x-ray. Overall, 2,463 patients between 49 and 86 years of age were randomized to one of three treatment arms for 18 months: double-blind 80 micrograms of abaloparatide-SC, blind-matched placebo, or open-label 20 micrograms of subcutaneous teriparatide (an FDA-approved prescription drug known to increase bone density and strength).\n\nAt 18 months, abaloparatide-SC significantly increased bone mineral density from baseline at the lumbar spine by 9.2%, the total hip by 3.4% and the femoral neck by 2.9%, compared with placebo. Abaloparatide-SC also reduced new vertebral fractures by 86%, nonvertebral fractures by 43%, clinical fractures by 43%, and major osteoporotic fractures by 70% compared with placebo after 18 months of treatment.

Oct. 8, 2018 \u2013 The Maryland Proton Treatment Center (MPTC) is now offering deep-tissue external thermal therapy in combination with high-precision proton-beam radiotherapy as a potential way to boost survival chances for certain cancer patients. MPTC is the only center in the world to offer these two treatments at the same facility, an advantage to patients because these therapies are typically given within an hour of each other.\n\nResearch has shown that thermal therapy can be especially useful in difficult-to-reach cancers in the abdomen and pelvic region. Studies have found that adding thermal therapy to standard treatments can significantly shrink tumors and can improve survival for some patients. External thermal therapy, or hyperthermia \u2013 in the range of 104\u00b0 up to 110\u00b0 F. \u2013 sensitizes tumor cells to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In addition, heat has been shown to enhance anti-tumor immune response.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased to be able to offer deep-tissue thermal therapy, which can be combined with standard radiation therapy as well as proton-beam therapy to enhance the cancer-killing effects of the radiation,\u201d says Zeljko Vujaskovic, MD, PhD, a professor of radiation oncology and director of the Division of Translational Radiation Sciences (DTRS) in the Department of Radiation Oncology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM).\n\n\u201cEarly research suggests that adding thermal therapy to proton-beam therapy may be associated with an even greater benefit than when combined with standard radiation therapy, and we are excited to be at the forefront of making this combination therapy available to cancer patients,\u201d says Dr. Vujaskovic, an internationally recognized expert in hyperthermic oncology.\n\nProton therapy is a precise form of radiation therapy that deposits all of its energy within the tumor and allows for less irradiation of noncancerous tissue. MPTC \u2013 which is affiliated with the University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center (UMGCCC) at the University of Maryland Medical Center \u2013 is the only proton treatment center in Maryland.\n\nRadiation oncologists at UMGCCC already use external thermal therapy to treat a range of cancers, but do not currently use it for cancers that are deeper in the body.\n\nAccording to Dr. Vujaskovic, the new deep-tissue thermal therapy equipment, which is made by Pyrexar, will be used to treat cancers of the abdominal and pelvic region, including cancer of the bladder, rectum, cervix, ovaries, pancreas and connective tissue, which are known as sarcomas. Patients would typically receive the thermal therapy two times a week for an hour before or after they receive standard (photon) radiation or proton-beam therapy.\n\nThe system heats the tumor tissue to 108\u00b0 F. with internal and external probes that enable doctors to continuously monitor the temperature. A water-filled applicator is placed over the area to be treated, and non-invasive radio frequency energy is directed at the tumor. The heat causes the blood vessels in the tumor to dilate, bringing more oxygen into the tumor, which makes cancer cells more vulnerable to radiation therapy.\n\nThe acquisition of the deep-tissue thermal therapy system was made possible by donations from Jack and Emily Howell and the Middendorf Foundation, Inc.\n\n\u201cWithin the Department of Radiation Oncology and throughout our cancer center, we strive to make every available tool in the cancer-fighting toolbox available to our patients,\u201d says William F. Regine, MD, FACR, FACRO, the Isadore & Fannie Schneider Foxman Endowed Chair and Professor of radiation oncology at UMSOM and chair of radiation oncology at UMGCCC. \u201cBy continuing to develop a comprehensive thermal oncology program, we are giving patients more effective treatment options and therefore another reason to hope for better outcomes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Maryland Proton Treatment Center has achieved another milestone by becoming the first center to offer both deep-thermal therapy and proton therapy,\u201d says E.

Lasker Award in Medical Research. With an operating budget of more than $1 billion, the School of Medicine works closely in partnership with the University of Maryland Medical Center and Medical System to provide research-intensive, academic and clinically-based care for more than 1.2 million patients each year. The School has over 2,500 students, residents, and fellows, and nearly $450 million in extramural funding, with more than half of its academic departments ranked in the top 20 among all public medical schools in the nation in research funding. As one of the seven professional schools that make up the University of Maryland, Baltimore campus, the School of Medicine has a total workforce of nearly 7,000 individuals. The combined School and Medical System (\u201cUniversity of Maryland Medicine\u201d) has a total budget of $5 billion and an economic impact of nearly $15 billion on the state and local community.

It is a highly effective treatment for a wide range of localized tumors such as those found in the brain, base of the skull, head and neck area, eye tumors, tumors of the esophagus, lung, prostate, liver, breast, spinal cord, as well as gastrointestinal malignancies. It is also an important treatment option for children with cancer.\n\nAt MPTC, each treatment room is equipped with the most advanced form of \u201cpencil beam\u201d proton therapy, which essentially paints the radiation onto the tumor while stopping precisely at the site of the tumor. Proton therapy is performed on an outpatient basis and is a well-tolerated, non-invasive treatment that can reduce side effects. It can be used in conjunction with other modalities of cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and surgery. MPTC offers a robust clinical trial program to all its patients to further evidence-based medicine.\n\nMPTC has been patient-centered from the beginning \u2013 with a focus on accessibility and affordability. The center was designed to be a regional resource, providing the same training, privileges and clinical guidelines to physician groups across the region that work side-by-side with MPTC faculty and staff, thus improving efficiency and affordability. MPTC offers free concierge services to ensure a seamless patient experience and a successful reconnection back to their referring physician. One of the goals of MPTC is to remain cost-neutral to insurance providers, meaning patients pay the same for proton treatment as they would for other more conventionally available intensity-modulated treatments at the University of Maryland Medical Center. www.mdproton.com", "question": "Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The news release mentions several times that the Maryland Proton Treatment Center is the only facility in the world to offer both treatments in the same location.

Followers of the popular regime eat during an eight-hour window, in this case between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. And for the 16 hours in between, they consume only calorie-free drinks, such as water.\n\nFor 12 weeks, the scientists measured various factors, including the participants' fat mass, blood pressure and cholesterol and glucose levels. The researchers compared the results to existing data from a separate weight loss trial carried out between 2011 and 2015.\n\nIndividuals who ate between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. consumed around 350 fewer calories, resulting in a loss of 3 percent body weight, and their blood pressure dropped by around 7mm Hg.

Gluten is not a carbohydrate; it\u2019s a mix of proteins found in wheat and its close relatives (including spelt, kamut and farro), as well as in barley and rye. It\u2019s what gives bread its elasticity, but it also sets off the immune system of people with celiac disease, damaging the small intestine and sometimes producing painful and unpleasant symptoms.\n\nEven some people who don\u2019t have celiac disease feel better when they don\u2019t eat wheat. They may assume that they have gluten sensitivity, but some researchers believe that it\u2019s not the gluten they\u2019re sensitive to. Instead, it\u2019s fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols, or FODMAPS.\n\nNever was a group of molecules more desperately in need of an acronym. FODMAPs are a group of carbohydrates that don\u2019t get broken down and absorbed in the small intestine. Instead, they pass through to the large intestine, where they draw water into the gut and start to ferment. The process by which FODMAPs are broken down and fermented can cause gastrointestinal distress: diarrhea, bloating, pain, flatulence and constipation. Wheat and rye are high in FODMAPs, as are onions, garlic, apples, stone fruit, pistachios and many other foods.\n\nResearch by Peter Gibson, a professor of gastroenterology at Australia\u2019s Monash University, has found that some people who believed they were gluten-sensitive were, instead, FODMAP-sensitive. A low-FODMAP diet eased their symptoms, as it does for about 70 percent of people who suffer from irritable bowel syndrome, a condition that causes abdominal pain and bowel changes. Gibson estimates that, overall, about 10 percent of the population may be FODMAP-sensitive.\n\nBut there\u2019s a problem with a low-FODMAP diet. The fermentation that is painful to that 10 percent is good for your gut because it stimulates growth of the kind of bacteria associated with digestive health. \u201cFollowing strictly the low-FODMAP diet is associated with changes in the microbiota that many would not equate with good health,\u201d says Gibson, who stresses that a low-FODMAP diet should be used to reduce specific symptoms, not as a way to improve health.\n\nIf your gut can handle FODMAPs, foods that contain a lot of them can be very good choices \u2014 partly because the fermentation helps your gut biome and partly because the way FODMAPs are digested means you\u2019re absorbing fewer calories than indicated on a FODMAP-rich product\u2019s label.

Steve Byrd, MD, and colleagues of Pediatric Plastic Surgery Institute, Dallas. Dr. Byrd comments, \"The EarWell system is effective in eliminating or reducing the need for surgery in all but the most severe congenital ear malformations.\"\n\nThe researchers review their experience with nonsurgical correction of congenital ear malformations in 175 infants. The EarWell system is a relatively simple technique for molding and reshaping the ear, taking advantage of the increased malleability of the ear cartilage in newborns. For best results, treatment should start within the first three weeks after birth, or correspondingly later in infants born prematurely.\n\nThe technique and length of EarWell treatment varies according to the type and severity of the infant's ear deformity. Dr. Byrd and colleagues present a classification system and technical details for plastic surgeons to follow in evaluating the best treatment for specific types of malformations.\n\nFor most infants in the study, both ears were treated, for a total of 303 ears. Ninety-eight percent of infants had relatively mild \"constricted\"-type ear deformities. EarWell treatment started at an average age of 12 days and continued for 37 days, including an average of six follow-up visits to the plastic surgeon's office.\n\nEarWell treatment was highly successful in correcting or reducing the severity of congenital ear malformations. Results were judged good to excellent in 97 percent of ears with one simple deformity and 88 percent with more complex \"mixed\" deformities. About 70 percent of ears with constricted malformations were graded as having no deformity after treatment.\n\nComplications consisted mainly of skin injuries that healed without further problems. In eight cases, treatment had to be stopped because of an allergic reaction to the adhesive tape used.\n\nWhile the EarWell system is not new, the report is the largest study of congenital ear malformations treated with this approach--including a standardized approach to treatment and assessment of the results. The results strongly support its use, especially in infants with deformities and less-severe malformations.\n\nBut lack of awareness of this nonsurgical alternative is a key limiting factor. \"The opportunity for early treatment can be hampered by a failure to convince pediatricians that the majority of misshapen newborn ears do not self-correct,\" Dr. Byrd and coauthors write. They also point out that EarWell is highly successful in the treatment of prominent ears--a condition that commonly goes unnoticed by parents and pediatricians, but is likely to get worse as the child grows.\n\n\"While we can operate on ears later in the patient's life, waiting not only increases the surgery's difficulty and expense, but may expose the child to teasing, bullying, and loss of self-esteem,\" comments Editor-in-Chief Rod J. Rohrich, MD, in a featured video on the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery website. \"If your baby has any type of ear deformity, plastic surgeons can help with or without surgery.

The results will be presented in a poster presentation titled Lung EpiCheck \u2122 - Results of the Training and Test Sets of a Methylation-Based Blood Test for Early Detection of Lung Cancer at the IASLC 19th World Conference on Lung Cancer hosted by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, to take place on September 22-26, 2018 in Toronto, Canada.\n\nIn the study, blood was prospectively collected from 20 centers and 3 biobanks in Europe and Israel. The samples were used for detection of lung cancer with the Lung EpiCheck blood test. Lung EpiCheck was validated on this independent test set comprising 181 lung cancer cases and 141 current or former smoker controls. Results show specificity of 91% and a sensitivity of 74% with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 89%. These results demonstrated similar performance to the preceding training set results from 102 lung cancer cases and 265 current or former smoker controls.\n\nIn particular, in the non-small-cell lung carcinoma group (n=162), the most prevalent type of lung cancer affecting about 85% of lung cancer patients, Lung EpiCheck was able to identify correctly approximately 70% of patients. With a correct identification of 59% of stage I patients, 77% of stage II, 76% of stage III and 83% of stage IV patients.\n\nIn the small cell lung cancer group (n=13), Lung EpiCheck was able to identify correctly 92% of the patients, with a sensitivity of 100% in the limited stage, and 86% at the extensive stage.\n\n\"Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer worldwide due to the high incidence of the disease, and the low rate of diagnosis at early and more curable stages,\" stated Prof. Mina Gaga, the President of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and a lead investigator in the study. \"Clearly, we must establish screening programs for lung cancer worldwide. At the moment, low-dose computerized tomography (LDCT) screening which has been shown to reduce mortality from lung cancer in the very large NLST study is only reimbursed in the US for high-risk individuals. LDCT screening is not reimbursed in Europe or most areas in the world while there is still a debate about its cost and safety. Screening is however necessary in order to identify lung cancer at early, operable, stages for the entire at-risk population so currently, not only CT screening but also methods of molecular screening are being tested. I am therefore very encouraged with the results of this study, showing that EpiCheck has the ability to identify both non-small-cell and small-cell lung cancer at early stages, with a high level of sensitivity and specificity. Such promising results combined with the simplicity of the test, could allow us to detect lung cancer at the early stages and hence improve 5-year survival from about 15% to about 50-70%. This will offer significant added value in the fight against lung cancer.\"\n\n\"We are very excited to present the best published clinically validated results of a blood test for the early detection of lung cancer,\" said Opher Shapira, PhD, CEO of Nucleix. \"Furthermore, these results were validated prospectively in an independent cohort. Currently, early stage lung cancer can be detected either accidentally, when testing for other conditions, or by using low-dose CT scans, which are costly, carry associated risks such as high radiation, and are employed only for a very high-risk population. Early detection of lung cancer can be a game-changer in the fight against this devastating disease, and we are looking forward to begin extensive clinical trials in the US, Europe and China next year, in order to get the test to the market as soon as possible at an affordable price.\"\n\nThe Lung EpiCheck blood test is based on a proprietary molecular biomarker technology, which combines new biochemical assays and sophisticated algorithms. The technology is based on identification and analysis of subtle changes in DNA methylation patterns, a powerful tool for distinguishing between cancer and healthy cells and thus for detection of tumors in the body. Dying tumor cells release cell-free DNA (cfDNA) into the blood, where cancer-specific methylation changes can be detected at any disease stage. The Lung EpiCheck blood test detects changes in DNA methylation in 6 markers in cfDNA associated with lung cancer.\n\nLung cancer is the deadliest and most common of all cancer types. It is estimated that there are about 1.8 million new cases of lung cancer annually worldwide and about 1.55 million die from the disease each year. The reason for the high mortality rate is that currently most cases are detected when the patient becomes symptomatic, which is usually at late stages of the disease. To date, there is no adequate screening process for the early detection of lung cancer, bringing 5-year survival rate to approximately 15%. In addition, there is a well-defined risk group for developing the disease \u2013 mostly smokers and former smokers above the age of 50. In the US, low-dose CT is available for screening of individuals 55-79 years old who smoked at least 1 pack a day for 30 years, which represent less than half of the lung cancer population. Therefore, a screening test aimed at the entire risk group to assist in the early detection of the disease is highly needed and can dramatically increase lung cancer survival.\n\nNucleix Ltd. develops, manufactures and markets innovative, non-invasive, molecular cancer diagnostic tests.

Hundreds of patients who received the model have had to undergo new operations to replace it. Also, scar tissue often builds up around intravenous wires, a process that can make removing and replacing them difficult or dangerous.\n\nDr. Bardy said in a telephone interview that the deaths of several patients many years ago because of wire-related injuries were a factor in his interest in developing the new device.\n\n\u201cYou are looking at a therapy that can avert, we hope, complications and be as effective,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the study published Wednesday, Dr. Bardy and others reported that the new device had undergone several successful initial trials, including one in which it was used for a year in about 60 patients.\n\nThe device is being developed by Cameron Health, a small company in San Clemente, Calif., that was co-founded by Dr. Bardy.

Co-authors of the paper include Robert Akins, PhD, the project principal investigator, who directs the Center for Pediatric Clinical Research and Development at Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children; UD molecular biologist Adam Marsh, PhD, who is chief science officer at GenPro; and Karyn Robinson, MS and Stephanie Yeager, MS, of Nemours Biomedical Research.\n\nCerebral palsy is a common yet understudied neurodevelopmental problem in the U.S. In fact, there is no national surveillance here, but the CDC estimates that 1 in 323 American children have the condition. CP is a group of disabilities with a wide spectrum of severity. Spastic CP, the most common type, is a lifelong condition characterized by joint stiffness, spasms, and muscle tightness that affects movement and posture and restricts the activity of affected children.\n\nAlthough most children (85-90%) with cerebral palsy are born with it, diagnosis may be delayed until 2+ years of age. A diagnosis is made by monitoring motor milestones; infants thought to be at risk for CP are enrolled in early intervention programs where their progress is closely watched. New and better ways to identify infants with CP are needed so that interventions can start earlier for more children.\n\nNemours, internationally recognized for its CP center at Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, serves a diverse population of more than 3,000 children and young adults with CP, one of the largest programs in the U.S. Clinicians and researchers at Nemours continuously seek to improve the diagnosis and care of CP patients. Funding from the Swank Foundation enabled Nemours to develop a cerebral palsy tissue bank that stores blood and tissue samples from hundreds of surgical patients at Nemours.\n\nIn the study, the research team profiled blood samples collected in a blinded study from children and adolescents 9-19 years to explore whether patients with spastic CP showed differences at the cellular level that routine orthopedic patients (needing ACL repairs, spinal fusions or other surgeries) did not. The researchers identified a strong set of methylation markers, or patterns, that indicate differences in the genome between children with spastic CP and those without it. In a second study, using samples from children aged 2-5 years, the researchers were able to validate their results and predict with 73 percent accuracy whether the blood samples came from children who had CP.\n\n\"The evidence suggests that there is some epigenetic connection,\" said Crowgey. \"If we can do a better job of screening for these at time of birth versus waiting for the disorder to be diagnosed at 2 years of age, then potentially we'll be able to deliver earlier therapeutics and have better outcomes and lower medical costs.\" Medicaid data show that annual medical costs for a child with CP are 10 to 26 times higher than for those without CP.\n\nThe power of data science, analytics and machine learning\n\nThe study leverages a unique statistical method and software platform originally developed by Dr. Marsh at UD and commercialized by GenPro to measure methylation patterns in DNA (a cell's genetic code) using next generation sequencing (NGS) data. NGS is a technique that enables scientists to decode DNA faster and more cheaply than traditional DNA sequencing methods. Each person's genome, or complete set of DNA, is like a word that's the length of 3 billion characters; but spelled with only the letters A, T, C or G. Traditional DNA sequencing techniques decode sections of DNA 700 characters at a time, while NGS takes advantage of parallel computing capabilities, enabling scientists to decode millions of DNA fragments. Subtle changes in a patient's physical health are paralleled by changes in DNA methylation, making it a useful tool to understand disease.\n\n\"Many of the signals that we pick up are based on immune system shifts--meaning the way a person's immune system responds to external stress events. When we find that epigenetic response, or signal, in the genetic sequencing, it provides another line of evidence for clinicians to use in making decisions,\" said Marsh.\n\nThe approach uses sophisticated machine learning techniques and algorithms to sort through hundreds of gigabytes of NGS data looking for these distinct DNA methylation patterns. \"The data set is massive. It's not something a human can do. You need infrastructure, machine learning, data analysis, and data science,\" said Crowgey.\n\nWhile the study findings indicate that there is a consistent signal present in circulating blood cells of children with spastic CP that remains from early childhood to the teenage years, the researchers say they need to further study samples from different age groups, including teenagers, toddlers, and infants from birth to 2 years. Learning more about methylation signals across ages will allow the approach to be further refined to identify cases and also could provide researchers new clues to understanding the cellular processes involved in advancing CP, and consequently, new therapeutics to manage the disease.\n\n\"We're still in the early phases, but the results are extremely promising and we're excited about the sensitivity of the test that we are seeing in our retrospective analysis,\" said Crowgey. If successful, the researchers say the type of blood test in development also may be useful for other disorders, such as infant leukemia.\n\nAkins was optimistic. \"This is an example of the kind of innovation that can happen when people with different skill sets collaborate. The experimental testing went from idea to validated execution in less than 12 months. We're now working toward a goal of eventually forming a clinical diagnostic test and applying it to a broad population.\" Akins added that Nemours is in a unique position for such an undertaking with its large CP population, its growing strength in data science and analytics, and its recent acquisition of newborn screening for the state of Delaware. \"Many issues will need to be addressed, but we predict routine screening for CP in the near (<10 years) future,\" he said.\n\nThis research is funded by the Delaware Bioscience Center for Advanced Technology, the National Science Foundation, the American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine, and Nemours.\n\n\"This blood test could be a game changer.

Those with the newly identified form of vertigo experienced uncontrolled eye movements for 12 seconds -- twice as long as those with Meniere's and five seconds longer than those with vestibular migraine and another inner ear disorder called vestibular neuritis.\n\nThose with the new form of vertigo were also more likely to have severe motion sickness than those with other forms of the condition, the study showed.\n\nPreventative medication was given to 20 of the 35 people with the newly detected type of vertigo. Of these, one-third saw their symptoms reduced or they recovered completely.\n\nThe researchers followed the new vertigo patients for an average of 12 years. Five had no more attacks, 14 had an improvement in their condition, and only one person had a worsening of symptoms.

SHP465 (triple-bead mixed amphetamine salts - MAS) is an investigational oral stimulant medication being evaluated in the U.S. as a potential treatment for ADHD, a therapeutic area with significant need for additional treatment options.\n\nThe primary efficacy analysis of study 305 demonstrated that SHP465, administered as a daily morning dose, was superior to placebo on the change from baseline in ADHD-RS-IV (ADHD rating scale) total score, with a Least Squares (LS) mean difference from placebo at Week 4 of -9.9 (95% CI: -13.0 to -6.8, p<0.001), suggesting a significant improvement in ADHD symptoms. SHP465 was also superior to placebo in the key secondary efficacy analysis on the clinical global impression improvement scale (CGI-I), with an LS mean difference from placebo at Week 4 of -0.8 (95% CI: -1.1 to -0.5, p<0.001), indicating a significantly higher proportion of patients were rated improved on the CGI-I rating scale. The CGI-I is a standardized assessment tool that allows clinicians to rate the severity of ADHD illness, change over time and efficacy of medication.\n\nTreatment-emergent adverse events \u2265 5% for SHP 465-305 were decreased appetite, headache, insomnia, irritability, nausea, weight decrease and dizziness. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity and similar to those observed in previous SHP465 studies and with other amphetamine compounds.\n\nThe completion of SHP465-305 addresses an FDA requirement to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SHP465 in children and adolescents prior to filing a Class 2 resubmission of the medicine for FDA approval.\n\n\"We are pleased with the positive results of the SHP465-305 study,\" said Philip J. Vickers, Ph.D., Head of Research & Development, Shire. \"These results represent an important step toward a new treatment option for patients with ADHD. Shire looks forward to including these data as part of the FDA resubmission and is eager to continue advancing this clinical program.\"\n\nDr. Matthew Brams, M.D., Clinical Assistant Professor at Baylor College of Medicine and principal investigator for study 305, added: \"The study of SHP465 in children and adolescents is an essential next step to progressing the clinical program. I'm excited about these positive data from SHP465-305 because of the benefit that this potential new treatment option may provide for patients with ADHD.\"\n\nIncluding study 305 and previous studies, Shire now has a robust database of 15 clinical studies evaluating SHP465 in more than 1,100 subjects. Once the pharmacokinetic study and an additional safety and efficacy Phase 3 trial in adults currently under way are complete later this year, Shire plans to add these study results to its existing SHP465 data set to submit a Class 2 resubmission for FDA approval of the medicine for treatment of ADHD. SHP465 remains on track for potential U.S. launch in the second half of 2017.\n\nIn previous adolescent and adult clinical studies, SHP465 demonstrated a statistically significant difference versus placebo at 16 hours post dosing, with onset of action starting 4 hours post dosing, as measured by the Permanent Product Measure of Performance (PERMP). PERMP was not measured in the SHP465-305 study.\n\nThere are patents supporting Shire's overall ADHD franchise in the U.S. that extend to 2029.

There is no such screening tool currently in use.\n\n\u201cThis is an important step forward in the effort to develop an early detection system for this very lethal disease,\u201d said Dr. Karen Lu, a professor in M.D. Anderson's department of gynecologic oncology and the study's principal investigator. \u201cIf the study's findings are confirmed in larger studies, I think this new strategy will be practice-changing.\u201d\n\nThe method used in the nine-year study of 3,252 initially healthy postmenopausal women caught five ovarian cancers, three of them invasive. There were only a few false positives.\n\nLu said the study isn't large enough to justify recommending yet. But she added that an ongoing study in the United Kingdom involving 200,000 women should more definitively determine the test's value. That study is due to show results in 2015.\n\nOvarian cancer, though rare, is the fourth-leading cancer killer among U.S. women. In 2009, according to the American Cancer Society, it was diagnosed in 21,550 women and killed 14,600. More than 75 percent of women are diagnosed when the disease has already become advanced.\n\nThe new strategy involves an existing blood test for a protein discovered in the 1980s by an M.D. Anderson researcher and long used for predicting ovarian cancer recurrence. The protein, known as CA-125, has not been good at identifying new early-stage ovarian cancer because it can become elevated for other reasons, leading to false positives.\n\nIn the last decade, hopeful of finding a better test, ovarian cancer researchers have invested much time in the investigation of other biomarkers and technologies. But none proved as accurate as CA-125 after a Harvard scientist developed a mathematical model combining trends in test results and a patient's age.\n\nOne expert said the study is an important step but definitely needs follow-up work.\n\n\u201cIt's a well-done study about which its authors are appropriately careful in their conclusions,\u201d said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy medical director at the American Cancer Society. \u201cBut more research and refining needs to be done before it should be implemented. I can remember when doctors all rushed to adopt the Prostate Specific Antigen test, and we still don't know how to use it.\u201d\n\nLu acknowledged there are comparisons to the PSA test, which has come under fire in recent years for being better at detecting prostate cancer than improving survival. But Lu said that if the UK study replicates her results, the ovarian cancer test would have the advantage of producing much fewer false positives and being able to spot aggressive cancers.\n\nStudy participants were grouped as low, medium or high risk based on how much their CA-125 levels changed over time. Low-risk women repeated the blood test in a year, medium-risk women were referred for an ultrasound, and high-risk women had exploratory surgery.\n\nOver the study's nine years, 85 women had ultrasounds and eight had surgery. Three of the eight turned out to have benign tumors.\n\nAmong the study participants was Liz Stegall, who enrolled at the request of the family of Linda Nelson Taylor, a friend who died of ovarian cancer that wasn't diagnosed until it was advanced. Stegall had no family cancer history, but six years into the study last year, she was diagnosed with early stage disease after a blood test showed a spike in her CA-125 levels.\n\n\u201cI would say I'm ecstatic,\u201d said Stegall, 59, of Sugar Land, who finished treatment at the end of December and is cancer free. \u201cThis new test came too late to save Linda, but thanks to her and it, I should be alive for some time still. And if I can be saved, so can other people.\u201d\n\nThe study results were unveiled Thursday in advance of a major cancer conference next month.\n\nMore than half of the women in the study came from Houston.

Doctors can begin treatment immediately, trying to save the most important organ in the body. The brain, however, is also vulnerable to many more, much less visible ailments.\n\nConsider the case of Allie Orlando, a 23-year-old social service coordinator, who has received a plethora of diagnoses since she first saw a psychologist at 14. First, it was generalized anxiety disorder. Next, she was told she had depression. Then, when she was 17, it was settled: She suffered from borderline personality disorder. But when Orlando traveled out of state for college, she began seeing a new psychologist who strongly disagreed with her borderline diagnosis. Meanwhile, she continued to struggle and entered the hospital for suicidal ideation her sophomore year. The doctors there agreed: Borderline wasn\u2019t the right diagnosis, and maybe she should stop taking the meds she had been prescribed.\n\n\u201cI was just frustrated because the stigma attached to borderline is very strong,\u201d Orlando says. She had been open about her diagnosis in high school, but felt the \u201cborderline\u201d label may have scared some people off. She recalled her boyfriend at the time searching the web for her diagnosis and saying: \u201cOh God, no.\u201d After that, she kept quiet about her diagnosis, worried it would drive friends away. \u201cI\u2019m sure it also affected what meds I was prescribed. It took a few years to find the right \u2018formula\u2019 of meds.\u201d While the doctors recommended some medication that helped, it was a matter of trial and error, since Orlando still doesn\u2019t have a concrete diagnosis today.\n\nThe problem is that mental health diagnosis has essentially remained unchanged for 100 years, relying on symptoms and clinical interviews. Mental disorders lack what most other health diagnoses rely on: biological markers. A tumor seen on a scan, bacteria identified by a throat culture, a fracture captured on an X-ray: They\u2019re all clear signs something is wrong. Mental health disorders are difficult to diagnose even by the most well-trained, well-meaning psychiatrists, because all they have to go on are questions and, sometimes, answers. \u201cDiagnosis is really asking lots and lots of questions about their [patients\u2019] experience, looking at patients\u2019 answers both from what they say and how they say it,\u201d says Dr. Michael Dulchin, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the New York University Medical Center. The uncertainty can lead to dangerous misdiagnoses.\n\nWithout such signs to confirm their diagnosis, patients with mental illnesses are often burdened by the perception that they somehow have something less \u201creal\u201d than most other ailments. For years, researchers searched, in vain, for concrete signs in the brain that could tell them the difference between, for example, bipolar and depression. Now some believe the key may be realizing that mental illnesses are not necessarily contained in the brain: Biomarkers may be found throughout the entire body.\n\nDr. Sabine Bahn, a professor of neurotechnology at Cambridge University, leads a team researching this premise. As a Ph.D. student, she investigated the postmortem brains of psychiatric patients and was surprised to find differences in glucose regulation processes and certain parts of cell production in the brains of schizophrenia patients.\n\nBahn\u2019s team then looked at the cerebrospinal fluid of early-stage schizophrenia patients who had not yet taken any medication and again saw abnormalities in glucose handling. Bahn says it was a revelation that such changes could be spotted in the blood of patients in such early stages of the disease. What if, her team began to think, it could come up with a blood test for schizophrenia? Having this kind of tool would be invaluable\u2014with the current interview-based methods of diagnosis, subtle symptoms of schizophrenia are missed until too late, delaying treatment by months, or even years.\n\nArmed with her previous research, Bahn and her team detailed a panel of blood biomarkers in individuals who have an increased risk of schizophrenia but have no visible symptoms yet. The test, says Bahn, can accurately predict whether someone will \u201cdevelop schizophrenia over the next two years.\u201d\n\nBahn\u2019s finding is one of several recent advancements toward a comprehensive system of biological mental health diagnostic tools. One group of researchers, for example, recently worked backward to take on the problematic overlap between depression and bipolar disorder\u2014many bipolar patients are initially and incorrectly diagnosed with depression. The team took urine samples from patients who had been diagnosed with one of the two disorders and looked for differences between the two groups. The results, published in the Journal of Proteome Research, showed that 20 different metabolites differentiated the two groups. Another team of scientists identified differences in the throat bacteria of schizophrenic and healthy people. Previous research had suggested tentative links between immune disorders, which are influenced in part by microbes in the body, and schizophrenia; the new study, published in PeerJ, furthered the possibility that differences in oral bacteria could be associated with the disorder.\n\nDespite these exciting preliminary findings, there aren\u2019t yet any biological tests for mental illness widely used in medical practice. In some cases, the reason is primarily financial. \u201cThe problem with schizophrenia is that although about 1 percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia, the number of new patients per year is quite low, at 0.02 percent,\u201d says Bahn. \u201cAs the development costs of a test are very high, there is a risk that the test will not be commercially viable.\u201d For severe mental illnesses like schizophrenia, it\u2019s also the case that even if a test made it through development and hit the market, it may not be successfully integrated into psychiatric practice. That\u2019s because, Dulchin says, if a patient comes in with schizophrenia symptoms that a doctor knows can be alleviated with drugs, the doctor is not likely to deny that patient treatment\u2014no matter what a biological test says.\n\nThose working on these sorts of tests see them being implemented in a different setting entirely: when a patient comes into their internist seeking treatment for other conditions. \u201cPsychiatric disorders often present with other diseases such as diabetes and some immune disorders,\u201d says Bahn. If there was a blood test for depression, it could just become part of a standard panel\u2014and thus help achieve earlier diagnoses, and in turn earlier treatment, across the board.\n\nBut, if biological tests for mental illness do come to fruition, even those already living with a condition could benefit. \u201cI think if this biological aspect was attached to it, then people would see that stigmatizing someone for their depression is as ridiculous as stigmatizing someone for their diabetes,\u201d Orlando says. \u201cPeople often need concrete, tangible facts, and that\u2019s what scares them about mental illness and what causes the stigmatization\u2014they just don\u2019t understand it.\u201d", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "It\u2019s made clear that lab-based biomarker diagnostic tests for mental illnesses would be novel.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "It may seem strange to fight bacteria with more bacteria, but it could lead to a long-term solution for eczema patients\n\nEczema is the most common skin disease worldwide. People suffering from it often deal with a lifetime of painful symptoms. A new clinical trial is testing a natural treatment that researchers hope will provide a long-term solution for those dealing with the dry, itchy and painful skin that comes with chronic eczema. The trial uses a cream containing beneficial bacteria to fight harmful bacteria on the skin. While it may seem counterintuitive to treat bacteria with more bacteria, experts say this approach seeks to restore the natural microbial balance of healthy skin.\n\n\"There are over 1,000 species of bacteria that all live in balance on healthy skin, some that even produce natural antibiotics. However, we know that eczema patients lack the beneficial bacteria needed to kill Staph aureus, harmful bacteria that can worsen eczema,\" said Donald Leung, MD, head of the Division of Pediatric Allergy & Immunology at National Jewish Health.\n\nTo fight harmful bacteria, researchers isolate beneficial bacteria from our skin and grow it in a lab. It is then applied to eczema patients' skin as a lotion twice a day for a week. Bacterial DNA from patients' skin is then analyzed in a lab to determine if the cream effectively reduced the amount of bad bacteria present.\n\n\"Ideally, we want to eliminate all staph aureus from the skin of eczema patients,\" said Leung. \"What the cream does is help the skin gain back its natural balance and create that barrier needed to keep it healthy.\"\n\nResearchers hope that using the bacteria-infused cream will offer a long-term solution where other treatments fall short. Powerful antibiotics are commonly prescribed for eczema, but they kill good bacteria on patients' skin along with the bad. Creams containing corticosteroids are also often prescribed to eczema patients, but they come with harsh side effects, and patients usually can't tolerate them for long periods of time.\n\n\"The worst symptom of eczema is the itching and the scratching, and the more you scratch, the more it spreads. It can be very painful,\" said Cassandra Rodriguez, 33, who has struggled with eczema all her life.\n\nCassandra has tried just about every cream and medication on the market, and says when she learned about the clinical trial, she was on board to give it a try.\n\n\"The trial coordinator explained that it's like a probiotic for your skin,\" said Rodriguez. \"You hear all these things about good bacteria for your gut, so it seemed like a promising idea to apply that same concept to the skin.\"\n\nCassandra's son also has eczema, and she's hoping this research will lead to an effective treatment so that he won't have to suffer with the pain and embarrassment of the disease for as long as she has. \"He's little now, but dealing with eczema as a teen and an adult is really difficult,\" said Rodriguez. \"If there were something on the market that could help him and help everyone suffering with eczema every day, that would be amazing.\"\n\nExperts say there is more research to be done, but that the goal of the trial is to discover the best combination of bacteria to clear eczema from the skin and then make it available to patients as a prescription cream. The next steps involve testing those different combinations, ensuring they're safe and conducting a longer trial to see if the benefits of bacterial cream can truly provide a permanent solution for eczema patients.\n\nNational Jewish Health is the leading respiratory hospital in the nation.

Everyday behaviours and optional app support are used to cue imagery practice until it becomes a cognitive habit.\n\nMaximum contact time was four hours of individual consultation, and neither group received any additional dietary advice or information.\n\nDr Solbrig, who completed the work as part of a PhD funded by The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) South West Peninsula, said: \"It's fantastic that people lost significantly more weight on this intervention, as, unlike most studies, it provided no diet/physical activity advice or education. People were completely free in their choices and supported in what they wanted to do, not what a regimen prescribed.\"\n\nThe study showed how after six months people who used the FIT intervention lost an average of 4.11kg, compared with an average of 0.74kg among the MI group.\n\nAfter 12 months - six months after the intervention had finished - the FIT group continued to lose weight, with an average of 6.44kg lost compared with 0.67kg in the MI group.\n\nDr Solbrig continued: \"Most people agree that in order to lose weight, you need to eat less and exercise more, but in many cases, people simply aren't motivated enough to heed this advice - however much they might agree with it. So FIT comes in with the key aim of encouraging someone to come up with their own imagery of what change might look and feel like to them, how it might be achieved and kept up, even when challenges arise.\n\n\"We started with taking people through an exercise about a lemon. We asked them to imagine seeing it, touching it, juicing it, drinking the juice and juice accidently squirting in their eye, to emphasise how emotional and tight to our physical sensations imagery is. From there we are able to encourage them to fully imagine and embrace their own goals. Not just 'imagine how good it would be to lose weight' but, for example, 'what would losing weight enable you to do that you can't do now? What would that look / sound / smell like?', and encourage them to use all of their senses.\n\n\"As well as being delighted by the success of the study in the short term, there are very few studies that document weight loss past the end of treatment, so to see that people continued to lose weight despite not having any support shows the sustainability and effectiveness of this intervention.\"\n\nTrisha Bradbury was one of the participants allocated to the FIT study, and she explains: \"I lost my mum at 60, and being 59 myself with a variety of health problems, my motivation was to be there for my daughter. I kept thinking about wearing the dress I'd bought for my daughter's graduation, and on days I really didn't feel like exercising, kept picturing how I'd feel.\n\n\"I've gone from 14 stone to 12 stone 2 and have managed to lower the dosage I need for my blood pressure tablets. I'd still like to lose a touch more, but I'm so delighted with the mind-set shift.\"\n\nProfessor Jackie Andrade, Professor in Psychology at the University of Plymouth, is one of the co-creators of FIT, and she explains: \"FIT is based on two decades of research showing that mental imagery is more strongly emotionally charged than other types of thought. It uses imagery to strengthen people's motivation and confidence to achieve their goals, and teaches people how to do this for themselves, so they can stay motivated even when faced with challenges.

In recent years, the FDA has approved six drugs for men with metastatic disease, all of which can increase survival. In a study published in Urology\u00ae, researchers demonstrate for the first time that an aggressive combination of systemic therapy (drug treatment) with local therapy (surgery and radiation) directed at both the primary tumor and metastasis can eliminate all detectable disease in selected patients with metastatic prostate cancer.\n\nWhile the study is only a first step, one-fifth of the patients treated had no detectable disease, with an undetectable prostate-specific-androgen (PSA) and normal blood testosterone, after 20 months. The results suggest that some men who have previously been considered incurable can possibly be cured; investigators also establish a new paradigm for testing various drug combinations in conjunction with local treatment of the prostate to determine which is the best approach (ie, has the highest undetectable disease rate). Such results could not have been achieved with any single therapy alone.\n\nAccording to lead investigator Howard I. Scher, MD, Chief of the Genitourinary Oncology Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, \"The sequential use of the three different modalities helped illustrate the role and importance of each in achieving the undetectable PSA with normal testosterone level end point, which represents a 'no-evidence of disease' status.\" Longer follow-up is needed to determine whether these patients were in fact cured.\n\nTwenty men with metastatic prostate cancer, five with extra-pelvic lymph nodal disease and 15 with bone with or without nodal disease, were treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), radical surgery that included a retroperitoneal lymph node dissection as needed, and radiation therapy to visible metastatic lesions in bone. ADT was stopped after a minimum of six months if an undetectable PSA was achieved after combined modality therapy. Other patients were treated continuously.\n\nThe combined treatment regimen including surgery was well tolerated. Matthew J. O'Shaughnessy, MD, PhD, Urology Service, Department of Surgery, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, commented \"While the role of local therapy in metastatic prostate cancer is still under investigation, aggressive resection of visible disease performed by experienced surgeons was critical to the outcome.\"\n\nOf the five patients with extra-pelvic lymph node involvement, four achieved an undetectable PSA after ADT and surgery, while the fifth needed radiation to reach this milestone. However, none achieved the primary end point of undetectable PSA with testosterone recovery at 20 months after initiation of therapy with ADT alone, although one patient had a PSA of Of the 15 patients with bone metastases, 14 (93%) reached an undetectable PSA when ADT, surgery, and radiation were used. Ultimately, four (27%) achieved the proposed end point, a PSA of 150 ng/dL at 20 months after the start of ADT, which remained undetectable in two patients for 27 and 46 months, respectively. Commenting on the study, Oliver Sartor, MD, Cancer Research, Department of Medicine and Urology, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, LA, stated, \"The end point deserves special mention, as the end point of undetectable PSA after testosterone recovery has been previously discussed but rarely studied. The authors proposed that this end point may serve as a first step toward establishing a curative paradigm. Many in the field agree, but note that the longevity of effect is essential to prove the point of curability. Regardless, the movement toward a curative paradigm is much needed and the investigators are to be congratulated for setting forth a paradigm that can be used to assess the possibility of cure in a reasonable period of time.\" \"A multimodal treatment strategy for patients who present with disease that is beyond the limits of curability by any single modality enables the evaluation of new approaches in order to prioritize large-scale testing in early stages of advanced disease. The end point also shifts the paradigm from palliation to cure,\" remarked Dr. Scher.

An already approved drug could be quickly available and would then be the first breast cancer prevention drug.\n\nAbout one in eight women will develop invasive breast cancer over the course of her lifetime. Causes can be the use of synthetic sex hormones and other environmental factors, but also gene mutations like in the BRCA1 gene (BReast CAncer). US actress Angelina Jolie who underwent a preventive double mastectomy is the most famous carrier of a \u201efaulty\u201c BRCA1 gene. On average, women with this mutation have an up to 87% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. Tumors usually develop early in life. Until now, prophylactic surgery is the only procedure which significantly reduces the breast cancer risk, but which is also often associated with postoperative complications.\n\nIn 2010, Josef Penninger, the scientific director of IMBA in Vienna and his team have shown that sex hormones can trigger breast cancer (Schramek et al., Nature) through proteins called RANKL and its receptor RANK, which are key factors in bone metabolism. RANKL and RANK also link sex hormones to breast cells by providing signals telling the breast cells to grow. This occurs normally in every woman during pregnancy and the menstruation cycle. However, if deregulated, mammary cells start to divide and multiply and fail to die when they should, ultimately resulting in breast cancer.\n\nA multinational research effort now made the discovery that RANKL is also the main driver of BRCA1 mutation-driven breast cancer. In the current study, Verena Sigl, graduate student from Penninger's research group, showed that blocking the RANKL/RANK system in BRCA1 mutant mice led to largely normal mammary glands whereas invasive carcinomas could be found in the control group. To determine the relevance of their results for humans, scientists in Vienna and Toronto isolated breast tissue cells from women who had undergone preventive mastectomy because of their BRCA1 mutation. In the human cell culture, too, RANKL inhibition led to a significant reduction of growth and spreading of breast tissue cells. Moreover, the scientists \u2013 together with colleagues in Barcelona and from the CIMBA* consortium mapping more than 23,000 women \u2013 showed that genetic variants in the RANK gene are associated with a higher risk of developing breast cancer in women who carry BRCA1 and also BRCA2 mutations.\n\n\"Our finding is so exciting because there is already an approved drug against RANKL called \u201eDenosumab\u201d. It is an antibody with very few side effects, which binds tightly to RANKL, thereby inhibiting its ability to act. Based on our discovery, the already approved drug Denosumab or other future drugs that will block RANKL/RANK, could be used for breast cancer prevention in BRCA mutation carriers,\" explains Verena Sigl.\n\nScientists at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore have already tried the preventive use of a RANKL blocking drug in mice. Animals carrying BRCA1 mutations were divided into two groups. In the control group multiple early breast cancer lesions developed. The second group received RANKL blockade treatment for prevention with the result that virtually no malignant changes in breast tissue could be observed even over a longer period of observation.\n\nCareful phase III clinical trials are now needed to confirm the efficacy in humans. Thereafter, any woman who has been tested positive for a BRCA1 mutation could take RANKL blockade as prevention measure to reduce her dramatically increased breast cancer risk. Josef Penninger adds: \u201cThis work is a great example of an international collaboration of many scientists with one grand vision: Prevention of breast cancer. Cancer prevention is one of the key issues we face in medicine today, a world where much fewer women will get breast cancer in the first place. We have also shown that RANKL/RANK are critically involved in sex hormone-driven breast cancer. If the uncovered mechanism indeed works in the prevention of breast cancer in high risk patients, this could possibly be used to prevent breast cancer in general. One door for breast cancer prevention has now been opened and this can be tested very fast.\u201d\n\nThe present work is the result of international collaboration. Scientists from Austria (IMBA, AKH Wien) participated as well as researchers from the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore and the University of Maryland-Baltimore County, Baltimore, USA; Toronto, Canada and Barcelona, Spain.

But hormone use plummeted after the federal government's massive Women's Health Initiative shocked women and doctors by concluding the risks of the medication outweighed its benefits.\n\nSince then, many women have been suffering through hot flashes and searching for effective alternatives. Some small pilot studies have indicated that the newer class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin and serotonin norepinephrine reupdate inhibitors (SSRIs and SNRIs) might be effective.\n\nIn the new study, Ellen Freeman of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia and colleagues gave 205 women who were either starting to go through menopause who had already gone through menopause either Lexapro or a placebo for eight weeks. When the study started, the women were having an average of nearly 10 hot flashes each day.\n\nThe number of hot flashes among the women taking Lexapro, which is also known as escitalopram, dropped to about five on average after eight weeks--a 47 percent decrease or about 4.6 fewer hot flashes per day, the researchers reported. The severity of the hot flashes also decreased. Among those taking a placebo, the number of hot flashes dropped to 6.43 per day, a 33 percent decrease of 3.2 fewer hot flashes per day.

While their high blood pressure was not affected, cardiac health improved.\n\nHigh blood pressure is a major contributor to a form of heart failure that affects the way heart relaxes between contractions. About half of the human patients with heart failure suffer from this particular condition, known as diastolic heart failure. The majority of those patients are elderly women with high blood pressure. Importantly, there are currently no effective treatments for diastolic heart failure.\n\n\"This low dose of thyroid hormone safely restored depressed cardiac tissue T3 levels to normal while largely preventing the accumulation of collagen, or scar tissue, resulting from sustained high blood pressure,\" said Gerdes. \"Thus, T3 treatment inhibited the major cause of stiffening of the heart in hypertension. The rats experienced overall improvement in contractile proteins and heart function too.\"\n\nGerdes has published 32 animal studies showing a link between improvements in thyroid hormone levels and heart health in rats and mice.\n\n\"The challenge now is to determine if humans benefit the same way,\" said Gerdes. \"If we can improve heart disease outcomes in patients by restoring normal thyroid function in the heart, we could save lives along with billions of dollars in health care expenses.\"\n\nIn 2014, a study in Molecular Medicine showed that administering low doses of a thyroid hormone to rats with diabetes helped restore hormone levels in their hearts and prevented deterioration of heart function, adverse gene changes, and pathology. Earlier, a study in the Journal of Cardiac Failure found that thyroid hormone replacement therapy in rats significantly reduced the incidence of atrial fibrillation. A 2013 study in The Journal of Translational Medicine showed thyroid hormone treatment administered to rats at the time of a heart attack led to a significant reduction in the loss of heart muscle cells and improvement in heart function.\n\nGerdes has long argued that medical opinion on thyroid treatment for patients with heart disease is largely shaped by outdated studies that used toxic doses of thyroid hormones.\n\n\"What we have tried to do here is show the effect of safe doses of thyroid hormones and we're seeing amazing results in multiple studies, with dramatic improvements in heart function, gene expression, and collagen levels, just by restoring depressed thyroid levels in the heart,\" said Gerdes. \"The studies demonstrate that we should be able to implement a similar, safe treatment and monitoring program for use in human clinical trials. The experts once warned that Beta blockers were too dangerous to use in heart failure patients. But, they were proven to be wrong and these life-saving drugs are now standard therapy for heart failure treatment. I predict the same will eventually be true for thyroid hormones in a large subpopulation of cardiac patients.

A nationwide survey by the National Institutes of Health found that 28 percent of adults in the U.S. are heavy drinkers or drink more than is recommended.\n\nYet, most heavy drinkers don't get the help they need.\n\n\"The biggest problem we have in the field is that less than 10 percent of individuals with an alcohol use disorder get any treatment whatsoever,\" says George Koob, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.\n\nPart of the challenge, researchers say, is that many drinkers don't realize that a medicine long used to help people addicted to opioids quit their drug habit can help alcoholics and other heavy drinkers cut back, too.\n\n\"I thought my only option was AA,\" John tells NPR. We've agreed to use only his middle name; disclosing his trouble with alcohol publicly, he says, would jeopardize his business.\n\nHe's a 47-year-old professional who says he started out as a social drinker \u2014 a few beers with his softball team after a game. But he sank into a deep depression after several deaths in his family, and sought \"solace in the bottle,\" he says.\n\n\"I wanted to numb my thoughts,\" says John.\n\nHe'd often start with hard liquor in the morning, John says, and it wasn't uncommon to have eight drinks or more before the end of the day.\n\nHe worked from home, so he was able to mask the problem for a while. But eventually his wife confronted him.\n\n\"She had come home and I was rushing to hide a glass and she was furious with me,\" he recalls. \"Just absolutely furious.\"\n\nHe went to see Paula DeSanto, a therapist and director of Minnesota Alternatives, in Spring Lake Park, Minn. The center provides outpatient mental health and substance use treatment services.\n\n\"I would say John's story is not unique,\" DeSanto tells us. \"A lot of people are reluctant.\"\n\nSometimes, traditional treatments \u2014 such as residential rehab or a 12-step program like Alcoholics Anonymous \u2014 \"can [lead to] a significant disruption in their lives,\" she explains. \"There's stigma, shame and embarrassment.\"\n\nDeSanto suggested a different approach to John. To help work through the loss and grief he was feeling, counseling can help, she told him. She also recommended he try naltrexone, a prescription drug.\n\n\"Naltrexone is an effective medication for the treatment of alcohol use disorders,\" says Koob. He points to a recent meta-analysis published in the journal Addiction that concluded that naltrexone helped reduce heavy drinking and cravings for alcohol.\n\nThe analysis included data from 64 clinical trials in which people were given either the medication or a placebo pill to test the effectiveness of the treatment. The analysis also found that another drug, acamprosate, is effective at helping people who have already stopped drinking to maintain abstinence, perhaps partly by easing the physical and emotional cravings experienced by heavy drinkers who quit.\n\nSo, how does naltrexone work? The drug seems to curb the euphoric and sedative effects of opiates in the brain. Alcohol is known to activate some of the same receptors in the brain that opioids do, and studies find that by tempering the pleasure from alcohol, naltrexone can help people drink less.\n\n\"It blunts the effects of alcohol,\" says Koob. \"People [who use naltrexone] will say they have a drink, and it's not doing much for them.\"\n\nThat was exactly John's experience. After taking the naltrexone pill, he didn't get the buzz he was used to getting, so didn't want to keep drinking. \"I actually didn't feel the alcohol's effects,\" he says. \"It was startling.\"\n\nIt's now been about five months since he started taking the medication. He has not stopped drinking completely, but says he has cut way back.\n\n\"This is helping me,\" John says. \"I can go out with friends and not worry that I'm going to end up inebriated or sloppy.\"\n\nAccording to the findings of a recent review, both naltrexone and acamprosate, are safe, cost-effective and efficacious. But they are substantially underused, according to the review.\n\nMany physicians are \"unaware that there are medications to treat alcohol use disorders,\" says Koob. His institute is stepping up efforts to work with the medical community on that front, he says, and is also touting Rethinking Drinking, a website aimed at consumers that offers the latest research-based information on a range of treatment options.\n\nAny health care provider who is licensed to prescribe medicine can prescribe naltrexone \u2014 not just mental health professionals or addiction specialists. As as long ago as 1997, a published study showed that treatment of alcohol dependence with naltrexone by primary care doctors can be effective; follow-up research has confirmed that the primary care approach not only works, but makes treatment much more accessible.\n\nAccording to the NIAAA, \"patients can now receive effective alcohol treatment from their primary care doctors or mental health practitioners by combining the newer medications with a series of brief office visits for support.\"\n\nNaltrexone is certainly not a cure-all, researchers say. And it won't help everyone who has a drinking problem \u2014 especially if the disorder is severe.\n\n\"I use these medications as an adjunct to therapy, and group [sessions] and 12-step meetings\" says Dr. Jeffrey Hsu, a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University who is certified in addiction medicine. He says that when used alone the medicines are only modestly effective.\n\nBut there's good evidence that the combination of counseling and drugs such as naltrexone can help people cut back on drinking, or move toward abstinence.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The story makes it clear that this drug has been around a long time, and what\u2019s\u00a0novel here is a recent analysis showing that it is underutilized.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "For two decades, Patricia DiGiusto struggled with severe asthma. Powerful medications and frequent use of her inhaler could not prevent repeated trips to the emergency room.\n\nOn one particularly bad night, Ms. DiGiusto watched from her hospital bed as doctors and nurses prepared to insert plastic tubing down her windpipe to help her breathe. Gasping for air, she was certain she would not survive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget that feeling,\u201d said Ms. DiGiusto, 65, a speech pathologist in Braintree, Mass. \u201cThe feeling that I\u2019m never going to see my kids or husband again and that asthma is finally going to get me.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago, Ms. DiGiusto\u2019s doctor told her about a new procedure called bronchial thermoplasty, the first non-drug therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration for patients with severe asthma.\n\nDuring the procedure, a doctor guides a bronchoscope into a patient\u2019s airways. There, it heats the lungs to 149 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 cooler than a cup of coffee, but warm enough to shrink the smooth muscle in the airways, which swells during an asthma attack and restricts breathing. After the procedure, the airways no longer are so prone to constricting, studies show. Asthma patients suffer fewer attacks and need fewer hospital visits.\n\nMs. DiGiusto had the procedure in March 2011. Since then, she has ended most of her medications and has not had a single asthma attack. \u201cI\u2019m a language therapist,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I can\u2019t even think of the word to describe how much better this has made my life.\u201d\n\nAcross the country, about 24 million people suffer from asthma. Every year, about 3,400 die because of it.\n\nAvoiding allergens and using inhaled medications are enough to keep asthma under control in most patients. But for the minority with severe persistent asthma, medication and lifestyle changes are not enough. Frequent hospital trips are almost inevitable, and powerful steroids like prednisone \u2014 which can cause thinning bones, cataracts, depression and other debilitating side effects \u2014 become a necessity.\n\nNationwide, asthma treatment costs exceed $10 billion a year, and over half of that is spent on severe asthmatics, who make up only 10 percent of the asthma population.\n\nDoctors say bronchial thermoplasty has given them a new weapon in the battle against severe asthma, and many patients call it life-changing. But the procedure is expensive, costing around $20,000, and insurers have been reluctant to cover it. As a result, many people who need it, doctors say, are forced to go without it.\n\n\u201cFor those of us in the field who work with severe asthmatics and see how limited they are, it\u2019s frustrating because we have this new therapy, we\u2019ve seen it work, and the data says it works,\u201d said Dr. Roy St. John, a pulmonary disease specialist at Columbus Pulmonary and Critical Care in Ohio. \u201cBut the big insurers have all denied it.\u201d\n\nAlthough bronchial thermoplasty was approved by the F.D.A. only two years ago, clinical studies on it began in 2000. Since then, about 650 patients across the country have had the procedure.\n\nIt takes place in three steps, each separated by about three weeks. Each time, a different section of the lungs is treated. Some patients report temporary coughing, mucus and other respiratory symptoms brought on by irritation of airways.\n\nBut several five-year studies showed no long-term safety issues. And researchers at Washington University School of Medicine found that compared with a control group, bronchial thermoplasty patients saw their asthma attacks drop by a third, their emergency room visits fall by 84 percent, and the number of days they lost from work and school drop by 66 percent.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a cure, but it is definitely a breakthrough,\u201d said Dr. Pratik S. Patel, director of Interventional Pulmonary Medicine at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center in New Jersey. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to get rid of asthma, but it is going to reduce symptoms and hospitalizations and make patients more functional in their daily life.\u201d For now, the procedure is only for severe asthmatics, who \u2014 unlike a vast majority of asthma patients \u2014 cannot keep flare-ups at bay with standard medications, said Dr. Kyle Hogarth, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago who was involved in clinical studies of the treatment.\n\n\u201cThere are millions and millions of asthmatics,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will not be millions of thermoplasty patients.\u201d\n\nStill, even patients with severe asthma often are denied insurance coverage for the procedure. Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the industry trade group, said insurers are awaiting the results of an additional five-year clinical trial, required by the F.D.A. when it approved bronchial thermoplasty. That trial will not be completed until at least 2018.\n\nUntil then, Ms. Pisano said, many insurers are denying coverage on the grounds the procedure is experimental. \u201cThe issue here for health plans is the long-term safety and efficacy have yet to be established,\u201d she said.\n\nBut three five-year studies have already been completed. Many asthma specialists believe that insurers are taking a shortsighted approach. The one-time cost of $20,000, they say, is dwarfed by the tens of thousands of dollars in hospital bills and medication costs that a severe asthmatic can easily accumulate in a single year.\n\nOne such patient, Alberto Gaulion, 68, a retired importer in Miami, estimated that for much of the last decade, his insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield, spent about $50,000 a year on his medical care.\n\n\u201cEvery two or three weeks I had to go to the hospital,\u201d he said, \u201cand I was taking everything that was on the market. I was on a cocktail of drugs.\u201d\n\nBlue Cross would not cover the procedure for him, so Mr. Gaulion paid out of pocket when he had it in 2010. Since then, he has had no hospital visits and no asthma attacks, and takes only one medication instead of five.\n\n\u201cNow I can breathe,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019m saving my insurance company a fortune.\u201d\n\nDr. Charlene McEvoy, a director of an asthma center run by Health Partners, the largest health plan in Minnesota, believed in thermoplasty enough to push the insurer to start covering it. Dr. McEvoy argued that it made economic sense, and earlier this year Health Partners agreed.\n\n\u201cWhen plans look at the cost savings, I think they\u2019re going to cover it,\u201d said Dr. McEvoy, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota. \u201cYou have to show that there\u2019s a return on investment.\u201d", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The story doesn\u2019t make any inappropriate claims regarding the treatment\u2019s novelty.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "For babies under age 1 year, lidocaine cream, combined with a small amount of sugar given by mouth and infant soothing, can help relieve pain from routine vaccinations, according to a study in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal).\n\n\"Vaccinations cause acute distress for both infants and their parents, contributing to vaccination avoidance,\" states Dr. Anna Taddio, a pharmacist and senior associate scientist at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) and professor, Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario. \"However, there are gaps in knowledge about what is the best way to alleviate pain during vaccination.\"\n\nTo address this gap, researchers conducted a randomized controlled trial including 352 healthy infants from 3 pediatric outpatient clinics, including 7 physician practices, who received scheduled vaccinations in their first year of life.

That difference was not significant in statistical terms.\n\nHowever, men in the vitamin D group were more likely to have no days missed from work due to a respiratory illness.\n\nOverall, 51 percent remained \u201chealthy\u201d throughout the six-month study, versus 36 percent of the placebo group, the researchers report.\n\nThe findings, Laaksi said, offer \u201csome evidence\u201d of a benefit from vitamin D against respiratory infections.\n\nStill, the extent of the benefit was not clear. While recruits in the vitamin group were more likely to have no days missed from duty, they were no less likely to report having cold-like symptoms at some point during the study period.\n\nMoreover, recent studies on the usefulness of vitamin D for warding off respiratory ills have come to conflicting conclusions.\n\nA study of Japanese schoolchildren published earlier this year found that those given 1,200 IU of vitamin D each day during cold and flu season were less likely to contract influenza A. Of 167 children given the supplement, 18 developed the flu, compared with 31 of 167 children given placebo pills.\n\nOn the other hand, a recent study of 162 adults found that those who took 2,000 IU of vitamin D everyday for 12 weeks were no less likely to develop respiratory infections than those given placebo pills.\n\nLaaksi said that larger clinical trials looking at different doses of vitamin D are still needed before the vitamin can be recommended for curbing the risk of respiratory infections.\n\nIn the U.S., health officials recommend that adults up to the age of 50 get 200 IU of vitamin D each day, while older adults should get 400 to 600 IU. The upper limit is currently set at 2,000 IU per day; higher intakes may raise the risks of side effects.\n\nSymptoms of vitamin D toxicity are often vague and include nausea, vomiting, constipation, poor appetite and weight loss. Excessive vitamin D in the blood can also raise blood pressure or trigger heart rhythm abnormalities.\n\nSome researchers believe that people need more vitamin D than is currently recommended, and that intakes above 2,000 IU per day are safe. However, exactly what the optimal vitamin D intake might be remains under debate.\n\nFood sources of vitamin D include milk, breakfast cereals and orange juice fortified with vitamin D, as well as some fatty fish, like salmon and mackerel.

In their article in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, the researchers pointed out that by studying military conscripts much of the variability that complicates population studies was filtered out. All the participants were from a narrow age group, had passed the same entry physical examination, lived in the same military housing, ate the same food, followed the same daily routines and so on. Also, the classification of their daily status (healthy or ill) was more uniform than would be expected in a study of people in varied civilian occupations. The strengths of the study would be expected to filter out much of the background noise that fogs typical population studies.

This was achieved by assessing the DNA of 80,000 prostate cancer patients and 61,000 men without the disease.\n\nThe resulting test hones in on these and the existing 100 known markers to pinpoint the 1 percent of men who are at six times greater risk of developing the condition, and the 10 percent of men who have a threefold greater risk of developing the disease, a study author told The Guardian.\n\nThe new method is being trialed on 300 men in doctors' offices across London, and is due to be expanded to 5,000 next year, according to BBC News.\n\nIf it is found to be effective, it could be an important tool for physicians. Although prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. after lung, few risk factors have been found, and it is difficult to accurately diagnose.\n\nMost men with prostate cancer do not experience symptoms. Doctors can use the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test to detect protein produced by prostate and cancerous cells, respectively. But as these antigens can be present in men without the cancer, it carries a risk of returning a false positive that can kick-start unnecessary, life-changing treatment. Rectal examinations and biopsies are also used to test for the disease.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, over 160,600 new cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed each year, and around 29,400 people die of the disease. The condition is rare in those below the age of 40; older men and African-Americans are most at risk. The majority of cases are caught at around 66.\n\nRosalind Eeles, an author of the study at the U.K.-based Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) who specializes in finding genetic variants that increase the risk of prostate cancer, told The Guardian the team is \u201cexcited by the test\u201d because it can be used by doctors to offer patients targeted screenings.\n\nCarl Alexander, a spokesman from the charity Cancer Research UK, said: \u201cThis study is an exciting example of how research can find clues in our genes to help us uncover those more likely to develop the disease.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture provided partial funding for the study.\n\nMany foods can have an effect on cholesterol levels, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Foods containing saturated fats, trans fats and dietary cholesterol can raise your cholesterol levels, while foods with healthier fats such as olive oil can lower your cholesterol. Foods with fiber, such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains, can reduce cholesterol levels, while carbohydrates that are low in fiber tend to raise triglyceride levels and lower \"good\" HDL cholesterol levels.\n\nIn the current study, the researchers wanted to assess the long-term effect that apple consumption might have on cardiovascular health.\n\nThey recruited 160 women between the ages of 45 and 65. The women were randomly assigned to one of two dietary intervention groups. One group was given 75 grams of dried apples every day for a year, while the other group was given dried prunes daily for a year.\n\nThe daily serving of dried apples contained about 240 calories, according to the study. An apple contains about 5 grams of fiber, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nThe researchers found that women eating dried apples lowered their total cholesterol by 14 percent. LDL cholesterol dropped by 23 percent. Daily apple consumption also significantly lowered levels of C-reactive protein and lipid hydroperoxide, two substances that may indicate an increased risk of heart disease. What effects, if any, the prunes had on cholesterol levels were not mentioned in the study abstract.\n\nThe researchers theorized that the nutrients in apples may reduce inflammation in the body.\n\nDespite the addition of several hundred calories a day to their diet, the apple-eating women didn't gain weight over the course of the study. In fact, they lost an average of 3.3 pounds.\n\nRegistered dietician Jessica Shapiro said she wasn't surprised that the women didn't gain weight. The addition of apples to the diet probably kept the women feeling fuller because of the fiber content in the apples, she explained.\n\n\"Apples really are an amazing fruit for many reasons,\" said Shapiro, who is a clinical nutritionist who counsels cardiac patients at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City. \"A large reason apples are so good is the fiber. Apples have both soluble and insoluble fiber. Insoluble is found more in the skin, and the pulp is more soluble fiber.\"\n\n\"The pulp of an apple gets to be a very viscous gel-like substance that grabs cholesterol and pulls it out of the body. It's kind of like nature's toothbrush, and it's brushing the bad stuff out,\" she explained.\n\n\"Another good thing in apples is pectin. It's a substance that's used to make jellies or jams, and pectin contributes to the viscosity of what's going through the body, and bulks it up to help remove it. Apples also have tons of antioxidants and other natural components,\" she said.\n\nShapiro said she would recommend fresh apples over dried apples, because some nutrients are probably lost in the drying process.\n\nBut Shapiro stressed that making healthy changes to what you eat can only do so much.\n\n\"Changing your diet can make a big difference, but eating a healthy diet is only part of it. Once your cholesterol is high, diet may not be enough,\" she said. \"Some people are predisposed because of their genes to having high cholesterol, and a healthy diet may not be enough.\"\n\nShapiro also advised against making any changes to your medications, including cholesterol-lowering drugs, without talking to your doctor first.\n\nAlso, she cautioned, when increasing the fiber in your diet, do it slowly. This will help prevent bloating and gas that may occur if you increase your fiber intake too quickly. She said that 25 to 30 grams of fiber daily is the recommended intake, and she suggested increasing your current intake by about 5 grams daily each week to give your body a chance to get used to the increased fiber.\n\nLearn more about the importance of fruits and vegetables from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "If apples have ever been studied before by anyone else for cardiovascular heatlh, we weren\u2019t told about it in this story.

This new drug is being developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi, who funded the research.\n\n\u201cWars for PCSK9 are far bigger than the statin wars,\" said Dr. Evan A Stein, lead author of the study and researcher at the Metabolic and Atherosclerosis Research Center in Cincinnati, Ohio. \u201cThis is a hot research area and everybody is so close together.\"\n\nOther companies including Amgen, Merck & Company, Novartis and Pfizer, are also hot on the trail developing their own PCSK9 inhibitor drugs. Stein said.\n\nAdditional results for PCSK9 inhibitor drugs are expected to be presented at the annual American College of Cardiology meeting which begins Saturday in Chicago, he said.\n\nThe REGN727 study included three trial arms. Two arms used 72 healthy volunteers who were either injected with a single dose of the drug in increasing amounts to test for side effects, which is the purpose of a phase one clinical trial. A third arm included 21 people with a family history of high cholesterol, and 30 people with nonfamilial high cholesterol. All of those subjects were also receiving treatment with the statin Lipitor.\n\nA control group of subjects with nonfamilial high cholesterol was treated only with a special diet. None of the subjects who received REGN727 discontinued the study because of adverse effects, and the subjects who received REGN727 had a striking reduction of 60 to 65% in LDL cholesterol, according to Stein.\n\nStein characterized the results of the trial as \u201cpretty dramatic.\u201d\n\nA PCSK9 inhibitor, Stein said, differs from statins \"because it's unlike any other drug.

Soon, we can expect more human trials in which investigators will dissect the properties of different PCSK9 antibodies and assess the effect of these agents.\u201d\n\nHowever, without long-term safety data and evidence that PCSK9 inhibitors truly help prevent heart disease, Young and Fong caution that it will remain unclear how important this class of drugs will be.\n\nThe cost of this drug will also play a role in determining which patients might use it, Fong and Young say.

He walks about 50,000 steps a week, golfs, works out and tap dances and consumes about 1,800 daily calories.\n\nHis results do not surprise researchers.\n\nThe blood-sugar level for a healthy adult, measured as milligrams of glucose per deciliter, is generally 70 to 100 mg/dl.

That means lifestyle changes were twice as effective as medicine in delaying or preventing diabetes.\n\nThe study also concluded that participants who underwent positive lifestyle changes delayed type 2 diabetes by about four years, compared with the control group. Benefits of intensive lifestyle changes were most pronounced in the elderly, with people 60 or older reducing the rate of developing type 2 diabetes by half.\n\nIntensive lifestyle changes include lowering fat and calories in the diet, learning behavior modification skills and increasing physical activity to 150 minutes per week.\n\nElizabeth M.

HER2 has been established as a therapeutic target in breast cancer, and breast cancers in which the HER2 gene is not amplified do not, in general, respond to HER2-directed therapeutic approaches.\n\nA few years ago, when the research teams of Dr. Matthew Ellis and others carried out a molecular characterization of breast cancer tumors, they found a new mutation in HER2 that was different from gene amplification but also resulted in tyrosine kinase being constantly activated.\n\n\"In this particular activation mechanism, the cells develop a subtle mutation within the functional part of the HER2 gene that activates the enzyme,\" said Ellis, professor and director of the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center, part of the National Cancer Institute-designated Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center at Baylor College of Medicine. \"The mutation locks the enzyme into an 'on' position.\"\n\nEllis and his colleagues developed a preclinical model to study this new HER2 mutation and discovered that the enhanced enzymatic activity could trigger tumor formation. Furthermore, these tumor cells were sensitive to an experimental drug, neratinib. With this information in hand, the researchers took the next step.\n\n\"We launched a phase II clinical trial of neratinib in patients with metastatic breast cancer carrying a HER2 mutation,\" Ellis said. \"Finding patients that are positive for a HER2 mutation required a national collaboration because we had to screen hundreds of patients to identify the 2 to 3 percent that have a tumor driven by a HER2 mutation. The results of the clinical trial were encouraging in that about 30 percent of the 16 patients treated with neratinib had a meaningful clinical response showing significant disease stabilization or regression. Neratinib was well tolerated by most patients.\"\n\n\"This is the first time we had a reasonable number of patients treated for HER2 mutations in whom we could estimate the response rate.\"\n\nThe number of patients who could potentially benefit from this new treatment approach is estimated to be in the thousands. The researchers estimate that as many as 200,000 patients are likely to be living with metastatic breast cancer today in the United States. Based on the estimate that the new mutation is present in 2 to 3 percent of cases, the researchers calculated that approximately 4,000 to 6,000 patients with metastatic breast cancer carry a HER2 mutation and are therefore potential candidates for neratinib treatment.\n\nTo identify the patients in this study who carried the new HER2 mutation, the researchers required tissue from the tumor, a biopsy, from which they could extract and sequence the genetic material to determine the presence of the HER2 mutation. This task turned out to be a major challenge because for 20 to 30 percent of the patients the researchers did not have sufficient material to make the diagnosis.\n\n\"To assist in our ability to identify patients with HER2 mutation-positive tumors, we conducted circulating tumor DNA analysis,\" Ellis said. \"The tumor's DNA is released into the human bloodstream, and we were able to determine the presence of the mutation in blood samples from the patients. Importantly the circulating tumor DNA results were highly concordant with the tumor sequencing results, and they were much easier to determine. Notably, the blood test was sensitive enough that we could use it as a tool to determine eligibility for the clinical trial.\"\n\nIn addition to bringing to the table a novel treatment for metastatic breast cancer carrying a HER2 mutation, the researchers have tested the value of the circulating tumor DNA as a disease-monitoring marker.\n\n\"A circulating tumor DNA-based blood test also could therefore be potentially used to monitor tumor progression and to determine whether patients are responding or not to treatment after just one month of therapy,\" Ellis said.\n\nEllis also is a McNair Scholar at Baylor.\n\nRead all the details of this study, the full list of contributors and their financial support in Clinical Cancer Research.", "question": "Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The release made it seem that neratinib was an experimental drug that could be used for women with a particular gene mutation related to HER2+ metastatic breast cancer.

It is led by Enrique Schisterman of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Results are in the current online issue of Human Reproduction.\n\nRusso says, \"One of our main findings is that there was no overall relationship between most types of physical activity and the likelihood of becoming pregnant for women who had already had one or two pregnancy losses, except for walking, which was associated with higher likelihood of becoming pregnant among women who were overweight or obese.\"\n\nWhitcomb, whose research on the determinants of fertility and pregnancy outcomes usually involves studying biomarkers at the molecular level, adds, \"Lifestyle is definitely relevant to these outcomes because it can have an effect at the molecular level. What we eat and what we do are potential factors we can change to shape our health. So this sort of research is important because it helps provide information on the things people can actually do something about.\"\n\nFurther, he says, \"We were happy to be able to add scientific evidence to general recommendations about physical activity. This is especially true for the results about walking for even limited blocks of time. Walking has great potential as a lifestyle change because of its low cost and availability.\"\n\nFor the 1,214 women in the study, the association of walking with the ability to become pregnant, known as fecundability, varied significantly by body mass index, the authors report. Among overweight/obese women, walking at least 10 minutes at a time was associated with improvement in fecundability. Further, in statistically adjusted models, women reporting more than four hours a week of vigorous activity had significantly higher pregnancy chances compared to no vigorous activity.\n\nModerate activity, sitting and other activity categories were not associated with fecundability overall or in BMI-stratified analyses, they add. Russo and Whitcomb say one finding that is still not clear is the different associations related to vigorous compared to moderate and low-intensity activities. Whitcomb says, \"We don't know what to make of the finding that high intensity physical activity may have different biological effects than walking, but our study doesn't offer enough detail to get at why vigorous activity would work differently than other levels.\"\n\nAmong a number of cautions the researchers point to in this work is that physical activity is related to other behaviors and lifestyle factors, and women who are more physically active may be different from women who are less active in many ways. Russo says, \"We did our best to try to account for the differences and to address them statistically.\"\n\nThe researchers also note that the overall generalizability of this work is limited because the study population may not be representative of the general population with regard to fecundability, and exercise habits may differ in women with prior miscarriage compared to those without.\n\nWhitcomb says another way in which this study is distinct from other work in this area has to do with who was included in the study. The EAGeR trial focused on women with a history of one or two prior pregnancy losses. However, he adds, \"We were happy to be able to conduct research considering women having the most difficulty getting and staying pregnant, and to provide messages about common lifestyle factors they may be able to address.\"\n\nThe researchers conclude that \"these findings provide positive evidence for the benefits of physical activity in women attempting pregnancy, especially for walking among those with higher BMI.

But those experiencing hip pain or stiffness have had more-limited options.\n\n\"Most people, especially athletes, when they had hip symptoms, usually they just got diagnosed as a chronic groin pull,\" said J.W. Thomas Byrd, a Nashville orthopedist who specializes in sports medicine and hip injuries. Rest and physical therapy might be prescribed, but no other solutions were available. Byrd also noted that because it's difficult to get standard surgical instruments into the hip safely, it has been \"a bit more of a challenging joint to tackle\" than the knee or shoulder.\n\nBut that's changing. In the past 10 to 15 years, doctors have discovered one specific cause of hip pain: a tear in the acetabular labrum, a condition in which the cartilage that lines the hip socket is damaged. And they've found that it can be fixed using arthroscopic surgery, which uses narrow instruments inserted through smaller incisions than traditional surgery.\n\nNew York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez recently made headlines when he opted to have arthroscopy on such a tear in his right hip, a decision that has him sidelined from baseball for weeks.\n\nDerek Ochiai, a surgeon with the Nirschl Orthopaedic Center in Arlington, who began performing hip arthroscopy six years ago, estimates that he did only about a dozen of the procedures that year. Now, he performs more than 100 annually.\n\nOchiai also occasionally serves as an instructor at the Orthopaedic Learning Center, a surgeon's training lab in Rosemont, Ill., where he said three sessions are offered each year in hip arthroscopy and all are booked solid. This is a marked uptick from a decade ago, when Ochiai said the single course in hip arthroscopy was nearly canceled due to lack of interest.\n\nThe labrum is a thin ring of cartilage that lines the acetabulum, or hip socket. It acts as a cushion when the leg bends and provides stability to the joint. Left untreated, labrum tears can lead to arthritis. So, indirectly, \"hip arthroscopy may be a way of delaying or even possibly preventing hip arthritis,\" Ochiai said.\n\nThese tears are not detectable by X-ray, and though they usually can be seen by MRI, even those images can sometimes be inconclusive. Ochiai said many patients see three or four orthopedists before getting a proper diagnosis.\n\nThere are several causes for labrum tears, but rigorous physical activity or stress is almost always a factor. Also, doctors often find some structural flaw in the hip joint, most commonly femoral acetabular impingement, known as FAI. This means that a bone deformity causes the ball and socket to rub against each other in a way that pinches the labrum. Doctors say FAI is not something a patient is born with; rather, it develops in adolescence, for unknown reasons. Byrd said it is more common in men than in women.\n\nDuring arthroscopic surgeries on the labrum, doctors can fix the FAI by shaving down the bony defect.\n\nRecovery time varies. When minimal work is done, it can be four to six weeks; when FAI is corrected, it can be more like three to four months.\n\nWhy has it taken so long for hip arthroscopy to catch up to its shoulder and knee counterparts?\n\n\"The big difference is that with the knee, most of the things we're doing arthroscopically evolved from things we were doing in open surgery,\" Byrd said. With the hip, however, doctors using arthroscopes discovered a host of conditions, including labrum tears and FAI, that had not been recognized. As a result, surgeons are trying to find remedies for problems that, Byrd said, had received \"no treatment at all\" in the past.\n\nPlus, surgical techniques have improved. Byrd said that five to 10 years ago, the focus was on \"cleaning it up,\" meaning taking out problem-causing bits of cartilage. While that is still done, restorative techniques have been introduced that allow for the preservation of the labrum instead of its removal.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "\n\n\n \nThe story provides accurate information on the novelty of the treatment and its growth in popularity over the past 15 years.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A new non-surgical treatment for low-risk prostate cancer can effectively kill cancer cells while preserving healthy tissue, reports a new UCL-led phase III clinical trial in 413 patients. The trial was funded by STEBA Biotech which holds the commercial license for the treatment.\n\nThe new treatment, 'vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy' (VTP), involves injecting a light-sensitive drug into the bloodstream and then activating it with a laser to destroy tumour tissue in the prostate. The research, published in The Lancet Oncology, found that around half (49%) of patients treated with VTP went into complete remission compared with 13.5% in the control group.\n\n\"These results are excellent news for men with early localised prostate cancer, offering a treatment that can kill cancer without removing or destroying the prostate,\" says lead investigator Professor Mark Emberton, Dean of UCL Medical Sciences and Consultant Urologist at UCLH. \"This is truly a huge leap forward for prostate cancer treatment, which has previously lagged decades behind other solid cancers such as breast cancer. In 1975 almost everyone with breast cancer was given a radical mastectomy, but since then treatments have steady improved and we now rarely need to remove the whole breast. In prostate cancer we are still commonly removing or irradiating the whole prostate, so the success of this new tissue-preserving treatment is welcome news indeed.\"\n\nAt the moment, men with low-risk prostate cancer are put under 'active surveillance' where the disease is monitored and only treated when it becomes more severe. Radical therapy, which involves surgically removing or irradiating the whole prostate, has significant long-term side effects so is only used to treat high-risk cancers.\n\nRadical therapy causes lifelong erectile problems and around one in five patients also suffer from incontinence. By contrast, VTP only caused short-term urinary and erectile problems which resolved within three months, and no significant side-effects remained after two years.\n\nIn the trial only 6% of patients treated with VTP needed radical therapy compared with 30% of patients in the control arm who were under active surveillance. The chances of cancer progressing to a more dangerous stage were three times lower for patients on VTP, and the treatment doubled the average time to progression from 14 months to 28 months.\n\nThe trial involved 47 treatment sites from ten different European countries, most of which were performing VTP for the first time.\n\n\"The fact that the treatment was performed so successfully by non-specialist centres in various health systems is really remarkable,\" says Professor Emberton, who is supported by the National Institute for Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre. \"New procedures are generally associated with a learning curve, but the lack of complications in the trial suggests that the treatment protocol is safe, efficient and relatively easy to scale up. We would also expect the treatment to be far more precise if we repeated it today, as technology has come a long way since the study began in 2011.\n\n\"We can now pinpoint prostate cancers using MRI scans and targeted biopsies, allowing a much more targeted approach to diagnosis and treatment. This means we could accurately identify men who would benefit from VTP and deliver treatment more precisely to the tumour. With such an approach we should be able to achieve a significantly higher remission rate than in the trial and send nearly all low-risk localised prostate cancers into remission. We also hope that VTP will be effective against other types of cancer - the treatment was developed for prostate cancer because of the urgent need for new therapies, but it should be translatable to other solid cancers including breast and liver cancer.\"\n\nThe VTP therapy approach was developed by scientists at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel in collaboration with STEBA Biotech, and the European phase I, II and III trials were all led by UCL. The drug used in the procedure, WST11, is derived from bacteria at the bottom of the ocean. To survive with very little sunlight, they have evolved to convert light into energy with incredible efficiency. This property has been exploited to develop WST11, a compound that releases free radicals to kill surrounding cells when activated by laser light.\n\nOne of the first people to be treated with VTP was UCLH patient Gerald, a man in his sixties who took part in the latest trial under the care of Professor Emberton. He says:\n\n\"When I was diagnosed with early prostate cancer, I had the option of active surveillance but I didn't want to wait until it got worse so when I was offered a place on the trial I signed up straight away. Some men prefer to delay treatment, but I couldn't live with the fear of the cancer spreading until it either couldn't be treated or needed a treatment that would stop me living a normal life.\n\n\"The treatment I received on the trial changed my life. I'm now cancer-free with no side-effects and don't have to worry about needing surgery in future. I feel so lucky to be in this position. I've met other men who had surgery - they had to stay in hospital for days whereas I could go home the next day, and one suffered from terrible incontinence which he found very distressing. I had some minor side-effects for a few weeks after the operation, but I'm back to normal now. I am incredibly grateful to Professor Mark Emberton and his team for the excellent care that I received, and I hope that other patients will be able to benefit from this treatment in future.\"\n\nThe VTP treatment is currently being reviewed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), so it is likely to be a number of years before it can be offered to patients more widely.", "question": "Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The news release does not appear to overstate the novelty of this treatment.

It's potentially huge.\"\n\n\"This is something we've been waiting to see,\" he continued.\n\n\"This directly interferes with the genetic mechanisms that promote cancer to stop the production of a particular protein,\" added Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. \"This is one step away from getting into the actual DNA.\"\n\nAs reported online March 21 in Nature, this is the first time the process, known as RNA interference (RNAi), has been shown to work in humans.\n\nThe process of RNA interference involves putting two strands of RNA together to form so-called \"small interfering RNAs\" (siRNAs) and inserting them into cells. Once there, these interlopers cut the messenger RNA (mRNA) that is ordinarily used to make specific proteins. This discovery won the Nobel Prize in 2006.\n\nBut the work that nabbed the prize was done in worms -- a far cry from humans.\n\nAnd there were other challenges, not the least of which was how to get the siRNAs into the appropriate cell and then make sure they did what they were supposed to do.\n\nThis team, from the California Institute of Technology (CalTech), devised a super-small nanoparticle system that, when injected into the body, would make its way to the tumor, deposit the siRNAs into the tumor cell and leave them to their assigned task.\n\nThis early-phase clinical trial involved actual patients with melanoma, a particularly virulent form of skin cancer.\n\nThe experiment proceeded just as planned, as biopsies later showed.\n\nThe researchers injected the cargo-laden nanoparticles into the patients, much as you would administer a flu or any other type of shot. They did not inject directly into the tumor as many other researchers have done.\n\nThe nanoparticles made their way smoothly to the target -- the tumor cell -- and cleaved the mRNA in just the right place, stopping production of the culprit protein.\n\nThe precision of the process is crucial to limiting side effects, the researchers said.\n\n\"Now you can go selectively at proteins involved in the disease and not have off-target effects,\" explained Mark E. Davis, lead author of the paper, and professor of chemical engineering at CalTech in Pasadena. \"Normally when you make drugs, it's hard to say 'attack only that protein.' In this particular case, I'm going to go in at the genetic level and eliminate that one protein I want to eliminate.\"\n\nAnd unlike conventional gene therapy -- where the offending gene is replaced by a new one or overridden -- this therapy is reversible, said Adams.\n\n\"This will run its course. Ultimately, it will restore itself,\" he said.\n\nThe authors believe the same system could provide a highly targeted, selective way to reach many different genes and affect tumors that have untll now eluded drug therapy.\n\nObviously, the process will have to be refined and optimized before it's actually used for treatment.\n\n\"This is the first qualitative 'yes, we can do it' publication and it really has to be kept in that perspective,\" Adams said.\n\nThere's more on RNA interference at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "Good job on establishing the novelty of this approach \u2013 and reminding readers that this work lead to a Nobel Prize in 2006 for research in worms \u2013 \"a far cry from humans,\" as the story states.

The study is published today by The Lancet. Unlike the more common obstructive sleep apnea, in which the airway partially collapses and causes pauses in breathing, central sleep apnea (CSA) occurs when the brain fails to control breathing during sleep.\n\n\"CSA is a serious concern because it affects about a third of people with heart failure and it's known to make the condition worse,\" Abraham said. \"Currently, we don't have good treatments available. Positive airway pressure devices have been used, but many patients don't tolerate them well and a recent study showed them to be harmful.\"\n\nAbraham, along with lead author Dr. Maria Rosa Costanzo at Advocate Heart Institute in Naperville, IL, led the study at 31 hospitals in the United States, Germany and Poland. The research team tested the safety and effectiveness of a transvenous phrenic nerve stimulator made by Respicardia Inc. Much like a pacemaker, it sends a regular signal telling the diaphragm to breathe during sleep.\n\nIn the randomized study, 151 patients were implanted with the device. Ten were excluded due to non-study related medical issues or deaths, exiting the study or missing visits. During the first six months of evaluation, 68 devices were activated for treatment, while 73 were left inactive as the control group. Between six and 12 months of follow-up, all patients received the neurostimulation treatment.\n\nAt the six month evaluation, the device reduced CSA events per hour by half or more for 35 of the 68 members (51 percent) of the treatment group. Only eight (11 percent) of those in the control group achieved the same reduction. Other important sleep measures, such as the amount of time spent with a low blood oxygen level, were also significantly improved. About a third of patients in the treatment group reported therapy-related discomfort that was resolved with some reprogramming of the device.\n\n\"Not only did we see this reduction in events per hour, the patients also rated themselves better on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (meaning they were less sleepy during the day) and on a global assessment of their overall quality of life,\" Abraham said. \"This tells us the effects of neurostimulation are clinically relevant and this could be a promising therapy for those with central sleep apnea.\"\n\nIn addition to Abraham, Ohio State's Dr. Rami Khayat and Dr. Ralph Augostini participated in this research, making Ohio State one of the high enrolling centers participating in the study worldwide.\n\nThe study was funded by Respicardia.

This is the time right after her period and before ovulation.\n\n\"While overall more men than women smoke cigarettes, women and girls take less time to become dependent after initial use and have more difficulties quitting the habit,\" the researchers write in their study. \"One of the factors contributing to these differences may be that women crave cigarettes more than men and that their desire to smoke is influenced by hormonal fluctuations across the menstrual cycle.\"\n\nThe study, which was published in Psychiatry Journal, involved 19 women and 15 men who were all chronic smokers but otherwise healthy.

The results showed no differences in IQ.\n\n\"There is growing evidence from a number of studies that all infants, those born at term and those born early, benefit from receiving extra blood from the placenta at birth,\" said Dr. Heike Rabe, a neonatologist at Brighton & Sussex Medical School in the United Kingdom. Rabe's editorial accompanied the study published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics.\n\nDelaying the clamping of the cord allows more blood to transfer from the placenta to the infant, sometimes increasing the infant's blood volume by up to a third. The iron in the blood increases infants' iron storage, and iron is essential for healthy brain development.\n\n\"The extra blood at birth helps the baby to cope better with the transition from life in the womb, where everything is provided for them by the placenta and the mother, to the outside world,\" Rabe said. \"Their lungs get more blood so that the exchange of oxygen into the blood can take place smoothly.\"\n\nPast studies have shown higher levels of iron and other positive effects later in infancy among babies whose cords were clamped after several minutes, but few studies have looked at results past infancy.\n\nIn this study, researchers randomly assigned half of 263 healthy Swedish full-term newborns to have their cords clamped more than three minutes after birth. The other half were clamped less than 10 seconds after birth.\n\nFour years later, the children underwent a series of assessments for IQ, motor skills, social skills, problem-solving, communication skills and behavior. Those with delayed cord clamping showed modestly higher scores in social skills and fine motor skills. When separated by sex, only the boys showed statistically significant improvement.\n\n\"We don't know exactly why, but speculate that girls receive extra protection through higher estrogen levels whilst being in the womb,\" Rabe said. \"The results in term infants are consistent with those of follow-up in preterm infants.\"\n\nDelayed cord clamping has garnered more attention in the past few years for its potential benefits to the newborn. Until recently, clinicians believed early clamping reduced the risk of hemorrhaging in the mother, but research hasn't borne that out.\n\nMuch of the research has focused on preterm infants, who appear to benefit most from delayed cord clamping, Rabe said. Preemies who have delayed cord clamping tend to have better blood pressure in the days immediately after birth, need fewer drugs to support blood pressure, need fewer blood transfusions, have less bleeding into the brain and have a lower risk of necrotizing enterocolitis, a life-threatening bowel injury, she said.\n\nThis study is among the few looking at healthy, full-term infants in a country high in resources, as opposed to developing countries where iron deficiency may be more likely.\n\nThe American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has not yet endorsed the practice, citing insufficient evidence for full-term infants. The World Health Organization recommends delayed cord clamping of not less than one minute.\n\nIt is unclear whether the practice could harm infants' health. Some studies have found a higher risk of jaundice, a buildup of bilirubin in the blood from the breakdown of red blood cells. Jaundice is treated with blue light therapy and rarely has serious complications.\n\nAnother potential risk is a condition called polycythemia, a very high red blood cell count, said Dr. Scott Lorch, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine and director of the Center for Perinatal and Pediatric Health Disparities Research at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\n\"Polycythemia can have medical consequences for the infant, including blood clots, respiratory distress and even strokes in the worst-case scenario,\" Lorch said. Some studies have found higher levels of red blood cells in babies with delayed cord clamping, but there were no complications.\n\nLorch also pointed out that this study involved a mostly homogenous population in a country outside the U.S.\n\n\"We should see whether similar effects are seen in higher-risk populations, such as the low socioeconomic population, racial and ethnic minorities and those at higher risk for neurodevelopmental delay,\" Lorch said.\n\nSo far, studies on delayed cord clamping have excluded infants born in distress, such as those with breathing difficulties or other problems. But Rabe said these infants may actually benefit most from the practice.\n\nThese babies often need more blood volume to help with blood pressure, breathing and circulation problems, Rabe said. \"Also, the placental blood is rich with stem cells, which could help to repair any brain damage the baby might have suffered during a difficult birth,\" she added. \"Milking of the cord would be the easiest way to get the extra blood into the baby quickly in an emergency situation.\"", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The delay in clamping is not novel.

Seven continued to show a positive response at three months. Five remained in remission beyond the three months.\n\nRobin Carhart-Harris, who led the study at Imperial College London\u2019s department of medicine, said the results, published in the Lancet Psychiatry journal, were striking.\n\nMany patients described a profound experience, he said, and appeared to undergo a shift in the way they perceived the world.\n\n\u201cBut we shouldn\u2019t get carried away with these results,\u201d he told reporters at a briefing in London. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a magic bullet.

But hallucinogenic drugs can also cause unpleasant reactions, including anxiety and paranoia, so Nutt\u2019s team wanted to find out if psilocybin can be given safely.\n\nThe trial involved six men and six women, aged between 30 and 64, all diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression. They all went through a full screening process before being allowed to participate and they were fully supported before, during and after they received psilocybin.\n\nThe patients were given psilocybin capsules during two dosing sessions, seven days apart.\n\nBlood pressure, heart rate and the self-reported intensity of the effects of psilocybin were monitored during each session, and the patients were seen by a psychiatrist the next day and one, two, three and five weeks after the second dose.\n\nCarhart-Harris said no serious side effects were reported during the study, although all volunteers said they were slightly anxious before and during initial drug administration.\n\n\u201cPsychedelic drugs have potent psychological effects and are only given in our research when appropriate safeguards are in place,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want members of the public thinking they can treat their own depressions by picking their own magic mushrooms.

Doctors often give Lucentis less frequently, but even if that regimen produces good results, patients must still get checkups every month to make sure their vision is not deteriorating.\n\nRegeneron\u2019s drug, which is called VEGF Trap-Eye, \u201cgives us the opportunity to not have to see them monthly,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Heier of Boston, an investigator in one of the trials and a consultant to Regeneron. That would be \u201cvery meaningful to patients and their families,\u201d he said.\n\nRegeneron and its partner, Bayer, said they planned to apply for approval of the drug in the first half of 2011.\n\nThe two similar trials involved a total of 2,457 patients who were randomly chosen to receive either Lucentis every four weeks or VEGF Trap-Eye either every four weeks or every eight weeks. In the eight-week arm, the first three doses were given every four weeks.\n\nAfter a year, roughly 95 percent of the patients in all the arms of the trial maintained their vision, meaning their ability to read an eye chart declined by no more than 15 letters, or three lines.\n\nVEGF Trap-Eye was also \u201cnoninferior\u201d to Lucentis in terms of the average change in vision after one year. Lucentis recipients had a mean gain of 8.1 letters and 9.4 letters in the two trials. Those getting Regeneron\u2019s drug every eight weeks had gains of 7.9 letters and 8.9 letters.\n\nRegeneron said the two drugs were equally safe.\n\nBoth VEGF Trap-Eye and Lucentis block a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor that causes blood vessels to grow and leak into the eye.\n\nVEGF Trap-Eye could become the first big product for Regeneron, which was founded in 1988 and is based in Tarrytown, N.Y. It sells one drug for a rare disease and has garnered hundreds of millions of dollars from licensing deals with big pharmaceutical companies.\n\nRegeneron\u2019s drug is likely to face competition from off-label use of Genentech\u2019s cancer drug Avastin. When used in the eye, Avastin costs about $50 a dose, compared with about $2,000 for Lucentis. Still, even with such low-priced competition, Lucentis has sales exceeding $2 billion globally.\n\nMeanwhile, Advanced Cell Technology, of Marlborough, Mass., said it would test its stem cell therapy on 12 adults with severe vision loss caused by Stargardt\u2019s, an inherited disease.\n\nThe company has turned human embryonic stem cells into retinal pigment epithelial cells, which will be surgically implanted into the eye. The hope is that the implanted cells will replace those injured by the disease.\n\nHuman embryonic stem cells are controversial because their creation usually entails the destruction of human embryos, although Advanced Cell Technology is working on a technique to avoid that.\n\nEmbryonic cells can also form tumors if injected into the body. Dr. Robert Lanza, chief scientist at Advanced Cell, said the company had to prove to the F.D.A. that its retinal cells contained virtually no residual embryonic stem cells. It took a year for the company to get clearance for the trial from the F.D.A.\n\nIt is likely to be several years before such a treatment can reach the market, if it works. Still, even starting the trial could be a boost to Advanced Cell, which often makes headlines but has struggled to raise money. Its shares closed at 5 cents on Friday.\n\nDr. Peter J. Francis, an associate professor at the Oregon Health and Science University, which will be a site for the trial, says the eye is a good place to test stem cell therapy because it is accessible. Also, he said, there is less chance of rejection of the implanted cells because the eye is shielded somewhat from the body\u2019s immune system.\n\nThere is no treatment for Stargardt\u2019s, which affects more than 25,000 people in the United States.

But those who stuck with therapy had improved as much six months and one year later as those who had arthroscopic surgery right away, researchers found.\n\n\"Both are very good choices. It would be quite reasonable to try physical therapy first because the chances are quite good that you'll do quite well,\" said one study leader, Dr. Jeffrey Katz, a joint specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.\n\nHe was to discuss the study Tuesday at an American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons conference in Chicago. Results were published online by the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nA meniscus is one of the crescent-shaped cartilage discs that cushion the knee. About one-third of people over 50 have a tear in one, and arthritis makes this more likely. Usually the tear doesn't cause symptoms but it can be painful.\n\nWhen that happens, it's tough to tell if the pain is from the tear or the arthritis \u2014 or whether surgery is needed or will help. Knee surgery for a torn meniscus is done about half a million times each year in the U.S.\n\nThe new federally funded study compared surgery with a less drastic option. Researchers at seven major universities and orthopedic surgery centers around the U.S. assigned 351 people with arthritis and meniscus tears to get either surgery or physical therapy. The therapy was nine sessions on average plus exercises to do at home, which experts say is key to success.\n\nAfter six months, both groups had similar rates of functional improvement. Pain scores also were similar.\n\nThirty percent of patients assigned to physical therapy wound up having surgery before the six months was up, often because they felt therapy wasn't helping them. Yet they ended up the same as those who got surgery right away, as well as the rest of the physical therapy group who stuck with it and averted an operation.\n\n\"There are patients who would like to get better in a 'fix me' approach\" and surgery may be best for them, said Elena Losina, another study leader from Brigham and Women's Hospital.\n\nHowever, an Australian preventive medicine expert contends that the study's results should change practice.

This can cause less blood to reach the brain and, in rare cases, may also trigger a stroke if plaque breaks off and becomes lodged in the small vessels in the brain.\n\n\"Only a small minority of patients with carotid stenosis will suffer a stroke,\" said lead researcher Dr. Raffi Topakian, from the Academic Teaching Hospital Wagner-Jauregg in Linz, Austria.\n\nThe problem is identifying the patients at the highest risk for stroke, he said. Most patients with carotid stenosis can be managed with medications such as cholesterol-lowering drugs, blood pressure-lowering drugs and blood thinners such as aspirin, he added.\n\nBut those at highest risk may need a surgical procedure called an endarterectomy, which clears the carotid arteries of plaque.\n\n\"We found with two ultrasound methods we could differentiate the patients who are at very low risk of suffering a stroke -- lower than 1 percent per year -- from patients at high risk of stroke -- higher than 8 percent per year,\" Topakian said.\n\nThe patients who are at high risk are candidates for surgery, he said. Endarterectomy is not recommended for most people with carotid stenosis since the problem can be managed with drugs and there are risks, including stroke, with the procedure, Topakian said.\n\nThose who would benefit from the ultrasound test are people with known carotid stenosis who are fit for surgery, Topakian said. \"If they are too sick or frail for surgery, it makes no sense to do the ultrasound,\" he said.\n\nIn addition, people at high risk for stroke are also candidates for ultrasound, Topakian said. This would include people with high cholesterol, high blood pressure or heart disease, he said. \"This test could be a good tool to identify the right patients for surgery,\" Topakian said.\n\nOf course, anyone with symptomatic carotid stenosis is a candidate for immediate surgery, Topakian said. Warning signs include transient ischemic attacks (TIAS), or mini-strokes, which cause no permanent damage but are often followed by a stroke within a few days.\n\nThe report was published in the Aug. 17 online edition of Neurology.\n\nFor the study, a research team led by Topakian followed 435 people with asymptomatic carotid stenosis for two years.\n\nEach participant had an ultrasound to see if there were signs that a stroke might occur. These included tiny blood clots, which pass into the brain, and a type of plaque called echolucent plaque, which is fattier than other plaque and linked with an increased risk for stroke.\n\nAmong those in the study, 38 percent had the fattier-than-normal plaque, 17 percent had signs of blood clots and 27 percent had both the fattier plaque and blood clots, the researchers found.\n\nIn addition, over the two years of the study, 10 people had TIAs.\n\nMoreover, people with the fattier plaque were more than six times more likely to have a stroke than those people without the plaque, and those with the fattier plaque and clots had a risk that was 10 times higher, Topakian's team found.\n\nNonetheless, some experts said that research suggests that patients with no symptoms are better off without the surgery.\n\nDr. Lars Marquardt,a professor of surgery at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in Germany and co-author of an accompanying journal editorial, said surgery for people with asymptomatic carotid steno sis is done too frequently.\n\nMarquardt noted that the risks associated with the surgery are a lot higher than leaving the stenosis as it is and starting aggressive medical treatment.\n\n\"Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis don't get the surgical procedure early enough, and patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis have too many surgical interventions,\" Marquardt said.\n\nWhen treating asymptomatic carotid stenosis, Marquardt doesn't think the case has been made for distinguishing between high- and low-risk patients. Right now, the work done by Topakian's group is still \"experimental,\" he said.\n\nAnother expert, Dr. Larry B. Goldstein, director of the Duke University Stroke Center, said that \"what remains uncertain is whether surgical intervention would result in an overall improvement in stroke-free survival.\"\n\n\"It is also unclear how optimal medical management [lifestyle changes in addition to anti-platelet medication and statins] would affect overall stroke and cardiovascular risk, and stroke-free survival,\" he said.\n\nBoth the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the American Heart Association currently recommend against general population screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, Goldstein noted.\n\nFor more information on stroke, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "It is really not clear from this story whether the 2 ultrasound techniques are new, are currently in use for other applications, are both in use for visualizing carotids but are not usually used in combination as in the study.\u00a0 Is this something new or not?", "answer": 0}, {"article": "The finding is another in a series suggesting that early detection of cancer might not always lead to better outcomes for patients.

Both tend to be diagnosed late, because the symptoms are ambiguous, meaning the five-year survival rate for these two types of cancer is only 15%.\n\nThe new research, involving more than 300 patients, showed that the test could diagnose cancer with an overall accuracy of 85%.\n\nDr Sheraz Markar, an NIHR Clinical Trials Fellow from Imperial College London, under the supervision of Professor George Hanna, told the Congress: \"At present the only way to diagnose oesophageal cancer or stomach cancer is with endoscopy. This method is expensive, invasive and has some risk of complications.\n\n\"A breath test could be used as a non-invasive, first-line test to reduce the number of unnecessary endoscopies. In the longer term this could also mean earlier diagnosis and treatment, and better survival.\"\n\nThe trial was based on the results of previous research that suggested differences in the levels of specific chemicals (butyric, pentanoic and hexanoic acids, butanal, and decanal) between patients with stomach or oesophageal cancer and patients with upper gastrointestinal symptoms without cancer. The new research aimed to test whether this 'chemical signature' that seemed to typify cancer could be the basis of a diagnostic test.\n\nIn the new study, the research team collected breath samples from 335 people at St Mary's Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust; University College London Hospital; and the Royal Marsden Hospital, London. Of these, 163 had been diagnosed with stomach or oesophageal cancer and 172 showed no evidence of cancer when they had an endoscopy.\n\nAll the samples were analysed with a technique called selected ion flow-tube mass spectrometry, which is able to accurately measure small amounts of different chemicals in mixtures of gases such as breath.\n\nResearchers measured the levels of the five chemicals in each sample to see which ones matched to the 'chemical signature' that indicated cancer.\n\nThe results showed that the test was 85% accurate overall, with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 81%. This means that not only was the breath test good at picking up those who had cancer (sensitivity), it was also good at correctly identifying who did not have cancer (specificity).\n\nDr Markar said: \"Because cancer cells are different to healthy ones, they produce a different mixture of chemicals. This study suggests that we may be able detect these differences and use a breath test to indicate which patients are likely to have cancer of the oesophagus and stomach, and which do not. However, these findings must be validated in a larger sample of patients before the test could be used in the clinic.\"\n\nOver the next three years, the researchers will continue with a larger trial, using the test with patients who are being given an endoscopy for gastrointestinal symptoms but not yet diagnosed with cancer. This will assess the ability of the test to pick up cases within a group that is likely to contain only a small percentage of cancers.\n\nThe team is also working on breath tests for other types of cancer, such as colorectal and pancreatic, which could be used as first-line tests in general practice surgeries.", "question": "Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "We\u2019ll give the release a pass on this since a breath test for screening for these specific cancers would be a new development, if proven effective, and the release does reference other research that formed the foundation for the new study.\nHowever, the release did not explain how this research is distinct from other work in the area.

It is expected to be available as an inexpensive, over-the-counter product.\n\nOutdoor air pollution is a global health crisis that kills over 3 million people a year and it has long been linked to lung and heart disease and strokes. But research is also uncovering new impacts on health, including degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s, mental illness and, this week, diabetes.\n\nThe impact of air pollution costs $5tn a year, according to a World Bank report published last week. In the UK, at least 40,000 people a year die prematurely from air pollution, with a cross-party committee of MPs calling it a \u201cpublic health emergency\u201d.\n\nBut the government\u2019s plans to tackle the issue were heavily criticised this week, just as alerts were issued for extreme air pollution across much of northern England. A day later, it was announced that more ambitious plans for London from Mayor Sadiq Khan were overwhelmingly backed by the public.\n\nVehicles are a key contributor to air pollution but, a year after the VW emissions scandal broke, most new diesel cars still emit far more toxic nitrogen oxides on the road than the official lab-based limit.\n\nAction to clean up air is urgently needed across the world, but cutting emissions for vehicles and other sources will take years, meaning ways to reduce the harm in the meantime could be vital. The new inhaler has been developed by German medical devices company Bitop and is based on a molecule called ectoine, discovered in the 1980s in a desert bacterium which uses the compound to conserve water in 60C heat.\n\n\u201cIt is quite an inert molecule that does one main thing, which is bind water, which stabilises cell membrane tissues against physical or chemical damage,\u201d said Dr Andreas Bilstein, at Bitop. \u201cIt supports the natural barrier.\u201d\n\nWhen inhaled, this helps prevent the damage caused by air pollution particles that can lead to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer, Bilstein said: \u201cDamage cannot occur as strongly and there is less inflammatory response, and so disease progression is reduced. The perfect situation is that the patient inhales in the morning and evening at home.\u201d\n\nThe inhaler has been tested in three small groups of patients particularly at risk from air pollution, due to asthma, COPD and bronchitis, with the positive results due to be published soon, Bilstein said.\n\nEctoine does not interact with cell receptors, so it is classed as a medical device rather than a drug. This means large clinical trials are not required for official approval and the inhaler could be on sale soon, at an estimated cost of \u00a317 a month, after Bitop selects a marketing partner. A version of the product for use in nebulisers will be available this year in Germany and Poland, while an ectoine-based nasal spray for allergy relief is already available.\n\nBilstein said the inhaler could be useful around the world, as particulate air pollution is not just a European problem: \u201cEspecially in Asia \u2013 China in particular \u2013 the demand for such a product is even higher. I was in New York last week, and the air was also not very clean.\u201d\n\nThe protective effect of ectoine was discovered by Prof Jean Krutmann and colleagues at the Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine, while investigating whether the molecule could protect skin against sun damage. Bitop funded a series of studies, now published in prominent scientific journals.\n\n\u201cThe point that it can prevent the lung inflammation induced by ultrafine particles is established \u2013 there is no more doubt,\u201d Krutmann said. Antioxidants can also provide some protection but there has been controversy over the effectiveness of such food supplements, he said: \u201cPersonally, I think it is much better to eat lots of vegetables and fruit rather than taking any supplements.\u201d\n\nDr Richard Russell, a consultant respiratory physician in the NHS and medical advisor to the British Lung Foundation, who was not involved in the research, said the inhaler was both credible and promising: \u201cEctoine is a beautifully elegant molecule and it clearly works by helping water to stabilise, giving you a film of water in times of stress.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe work that has been published thus far, in credible, internationally recognised journals, show that this stuff has positive properties, protecting against triggered inflammation,\u201d he told the Guardian. Russell, who also lectures at Imperial College and Oxford University, said it might also be useful for the treatment of asthma, COPD and other lung diseases, not only prevention. \u201cIt could potentially do so much more. It is actually quite exciting and there is clearly a lot more to come from this story.\u201d\n\nKrutmann said slashing air pollution remained paramount. \u201cIt is very nice to be able to protect people against the detrimental effects, but this should not be used as an argument that we can now stop working on reducing particulate [air pollution].

That vaccine \u2014 dubbed ZPIV for purified inactivated Zika virus \u2014 uses a more traditional vaccine approach and depends on dead virus particles.\n\nTo develop the vaccine, researchers kill the virus with chemicals, leaving behind harmless proteins that the body can learn to recognize as foreign invaders. Using those proteins as targets, the immune system can then produce antibodies to latch onto live virus particles and destroy them. This kind of vaccine is much safer than ones that depend on live virus particles to foster immunity.\n\nRelated: Company Gets OK to Test New Zika Vaccine\n\nThe researchers gave 16 monkeys an initial dose of ZPIV and then a booster four weeks later. Then the monkeys were exposed to active forms of the virus. In tests afterwards, the monkeys showed antibodies against Zika and no detectable virus in their blood or urine, meaning that the protection from the vaccine was complete. Monkeys that got a sham vaccine developed no antibodies.\n\nThe results were \u201cstriking,\u201d said study coauthor Dr. Dan Barouch, a professor of medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School. \u201cThe findings published today substantially increase our optimism for the potential for the development of a Zika vaccine for humans.\u201d\n\nBeyond that, \u201cthis is a promising [vaccine] candidate that can be easily produced in large quantities,\u201d said coauthor, Col. Nelson Michael, an Army doctor who specializes in flaviviruses, such as Zika and dengue.\n\nTo continue the development of the vaccine, the researchers will be partnering up with the largest pharmaceutical company solely devoted to vaccines, Sanofi Pasteur.\n\nThe researchers hope to test the vaccine in people by October, Barouch said.\n\nRelated: New Study Shows Just How Tricky the Zika Virus Is\n\nThe two other experimental vaccines described in the new report also sparked an immune response in monkeys. Both of these vaccines depend on new technology in which scientists learn the exact DNA of proteins on the surface of the virus and then create copies to be put in a vaccine. One vaccine had just the man-made proteins in it, the other wrapped a common cold virus around the proteins. The protein/cold virus vaccine was especially effective, sparking a significant immune response after just one dose.\n\nAnother experimental vaccine, developed by researchers at the National Institutes of Health, is a bit further along.\n\nTrials of that vaccine in people, which is also based on man-made copies of virus proteins, began on August 2, when the first study volunteer was given a vaccination through a needle free injector, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nResults are expected by December and if they are promising, a bigger phase II trial will be launched in Zika endemic countries\n\nThat puts the project ahead of schedule, since the original launch of the phase I trials was expected to start in September, Fauci said.\n\nStill, with many years of experience in vaccine development behind him, Fauci said, \u201cyou\u2019re never overconfident of the clinical results.\"\n\n\"But we are optimistic that this new DNA Zika is a viable platform,\" Fauci said. \"So we\u2019re cautiously optimistic.\u201d\n\nAnd if problems turn up, there are the three potential vaccine described in the new study.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always good to have multiple different vaccine candidates in both clinical and pre-clinical testing,\u201d Barouch said. \u201cThat increases the chance that we will have at least one, if not more than one, that works in the end.\u201d", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The news story does a good job of explaining how the Harvard-Walter Reed vaccine differs from another one further along in development.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A treatment traditionally used on patients with certain cancers is being tried on a small number of people with multiple sclerosis with \u201cremarkable results\u201d, according to a professor involved in the research.\n\nThe treatment destroys patients\u2019 faulty immune systems through chemotherapy and then rebuilds them using stem cells previously harvested from their blood.\n\nDoctors at Royal Hallamshire hospital in Sheffield stress that the treatment, so far given to about 20 patients over three years, is not suitable for everyone with the disease, which attacks nerves in the brain and spinal column.\n\nThe hospital is part of an international trial also involving patients in the US, Sweden and Brazil to see whether the treatment can benefit those with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, a form that involves flare-ups of symptoms such as loss of vision, fatigue, muscle problems and difficulties with balance that can last from a few days to a few months.\n\nThese will be followed by periods where symptoms are mild or disappear altogether.\n\nMost people with MS \u2013 there are thought to be more than 100,000 in the UK \u2013 are diagnosed with this form, and although drugs may help slow progression, there is currently no cure.\n\nConsultant hematologist John Snowden said: \u201cThe immune system is being reset or rebooted back to a time point before it caused MS ...

However, it can be considered a concrete option for patients showing aggressive MS who have not responded to approved treatments,\" said study co-author Dr. Riccardo Saccardi. He's from the cell therapy and transfusion medicine unit at Careggi University Hospital in Florence, Italy.\n\nUsing patients' own stem cells to reboot the immune system is a way to halt the advance of the disease. But the treatment can be risky because the patient's immune system has to be wiped out before the stem cells are transplanted, the researchers said.\n\nIn fact, nearly 3 percent of the patients died shortly after receiving the transplant, and those deaths were directly related to the transplant, the researchers reported.\n\nThose deaths are a major concern, one neurologist said, because MS is not in itself life-threatening.\n\nIn effect, those patients gambled with a treatment that could be fatal for a disease that isn't, said Dr. Michael Racke, a professor in the department of neurology at Ohio State University.\n\nRacke pointed out that stem cell transplants were first used to treat deadly diseases, such as leukemia, lymphoma and other cancers.\n\n\"There may be a population of MS patients that could be identified that might do well with transplant,\" he said. \"It's important to select patients in such a way that they actually get well with the transplant.\"\n\nA trial that compares stem cell transplants with other therapies to see whether stem cell transplants can become a treatment for patients who have progressive MS is about to start, added Racke, who co-authored an editorial that accompanied the study.\n\nMore than 2 million people in the world suffer from MS, in which the body attacks the central nervous system, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.\n\nMS can cause many symptoms, including blurred vision, loss of balance, poor coordination, slurred speech, tremors, numbness, extreme fatigue, problems with memory and concentration, paralysis and blindness.\n\nThese symptoms can come and go, or persist and worsen over time. Most people are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, although individuals as young as 2 and as old as 75 have developed the disease, the society says.\n\nMedications can slow the progression of MS and help patients manage symptoms, but there's no cure.\n\nTo see how patients did over the long term after stem cell transplants, Saccardi and colleagues followed 281 patients from 13 countries who received stem cell transplants between 1995 and 2006.\n\nThe researchers found that 46 percent of the patients experienced progression-free survival at five years after transplant.\n\nWithin 100 days of transplant, however, eight patients died (nearly 3 percent).

It affects an estimated 1 million people in the United States, men far more often than women.

He is scheduled to present the findings in Toronto at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in April.\n\nThe findings came from an analysis of data on 136,474 people who did not have Parkinson's at the start of the study.

Survival was shown to be greatest among those prescribed first-generation nonselective beta-blockers. According to The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center investigators, the drugs block the effects of stress pathways involved in tumor growth and spread. With further research, they may also prove beneficial in conjunction with other treatment regimens and across other cancer types.\n\nPublished today in the journal CANCER, the findings are the result of a multi-institutional retrospective analysis of the medical records of 1,425 women with ovarian cancer treated between 2000 and 2010. Researchers compared overall survival among patients with documented beta-blocker use during chemotherapy and those without. Among the 269 patients who received beta-blockers, 193 (71.7 percent) received beta-1-adrenergic receptor selective agents (SBBs) and the remaining patients received nonselective beta antagonists (NSBBs). The research team found:\n\u2022 For patients receiving any beta-blocker, the median overall survival was 47.8 months versus 42 months for nonusers.\n\u2022 Median overall survival based on beta-blocker receptor selectivity was 94.9 months for those receiving NSBBs versus 38 months for those receiving SBBs.\n\u2022 Even among patients with hypertension, a longer median overall survival was observed among users of NSBBs compared with nonusers (90 months versus 38.2 months).\n\nThis study builds on a large body of research by principal investigator Anil Sood, M.D., professor in Gynecologic Medical Oncology and Cancer Biology at MD Anderson. It showed that stress hormones fuel progression of ovarian and other cancers, and that beta-blockers - among the most proven drugs in cardiovascular medicine - might be a new way to stifle that effect.\n\n\"Beta-blockers treat a variety of conditions, such as heart disease, high-blood pressure, glaucoma and migraines. They target a receptor protein in heart muscle that causes the heart to beat harder and faster when activated by stress hormones,\" Sood said. \"Our research has shown that the same stress mechanisms impact ovarian cancer progression, so these drugs could play a new role in cancer treatment.\"\n\nAccording to Sood, the usefulness of beta-blockers was unclear until now. \"The ability to show improved survival using nonselective agents - which inhibit a specific stress pathway - is the culmination of years of research into ovarian cancer biology and pathogenesis.\"\n\nHe added that beta-blocker users in the study presented at a higher stage of disease, had an increased average BMI and were more likely to be hypertensive. All these factors were associated with decreased survival, yet those who received beta-blockers had either equivalent or improved overall survival. Further examination revealed that NSBB users had improved overall survival regardless of the presence of such prognostic factors or comorbidities. This was not true for patients who took SBBs.\n\nAlthough further study is needed, these results highlight the importance of adrenergic receptor-\u03b22 (ADRB2), a signaling pathway important to ovarian carcinogenesis and targeted by NSBBs (versus the ADRB1 pathway targeted by SBBs).\n\nOvarian cancer is the 5th most deadly cancer among women, accounting for more deaths than any other female reproductive system cancer. An estimated 21,290 new cases are diagnosed, and some 14,180 women die from the disease each year in the U.S., according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nFuture trials will seek to identify patients who would benefit most from beta-blocker use and the best beta-blocker for a specific tumor type based on adrenergic receptor expression. Then they potentially could be used as an adjuvant therapy during surgical recovery and chemotherapy to decrease tumor growth, delays in wound healing and metastasis. Beta-blockers may also reduce cancer-related psychological distress in newly diagnosed patients, according to the study authors.\n\nThere are currently two clinical trials, one led by MD Anderson, evaluating the combination of chemotherapy and propranolol (a type of NSBB) on cancer biology and on stress modulators in patients with newly diagnosed EOC. According to Sood, the preliminary data from these feasibility trials will be used to design prospective, randomized clinical trials examining NSBBs on patient outcomes.\n\n\"The stratification of patients by beta-blocker use and selectivity in this study makes it unique among all other studies examining the impact of these drugs on cancer.

That\u2019s what the findings of two new studies published this week suggest.\n\nIn the first study, published Monday in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention, scientists found that men who took a daily dose of acetaminophen (Tylenol) for five years had a 38% lower risk of developing prostate cancer, compared with other men. Additionally, daily acetaminophen was associated with a 51% reduced risk of developing an aggressive form of the disease. Men who took acetaminophen for less than five years saw no protective benefit.\n\nPrevious research has shown that taking aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) every day may help reduce prostate cancer risk.

During the follow-up, there were 8,092 cases of prostate cancer \u2014 significantly fewer in the group who took acetaminophen daily for five years.\n\nThe second study, published online Tuesday by Cancer Research, involved 1,455 men who had already been diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer. Researchers from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and Harvard School of Public Health followed the men from 2004 to 2009 and found that those who engaged in regular brisk walking after diagnosis were significantly less likely to see their disease progress.\n\nMen who walked briskly \u2014 at a pace of about 3 miles per hour or faster \u2014 at least three hours per week were 57% less likely to experience disease progression (including elevated PSA levels, secondary treatment, bone metastasis or prostate cancer-related death), compared with men who walked less and more slowly.\n\n\u201cThe important point was the intensity of the activity,\u201d Erin Richman, a postdoctoral fellow at UCSF, said in a statement. \u201cThe walking had to be brisk for men to experience a benefit.\u201d\n\nThe researchers said the effect of brisk walking persisted independent of age, diagnosis, type of treatment and characteristics of disease.

The findings are in line with previous research suggesting that physical activity may help reduce the risk of disease-related death in certain cases of prostate cancer.\n\nRichman and colleagues noted that the brisk walks may reduce insulin resistance, which decreases bioavailable insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) and increases adiponectin levels, which are all associated with decreased risk of advanced or fatal prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo. Another potential source of the associated reduction was reduced inflammation due to a lower circulation of interleukin-6, high levels of which \u201cpredicted a 73% increased risk of dying from prostate cancer among normal-weight men,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nProstate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men. According to the National Cancer Institute, about 32,050 men died from prostate cancer in 2010 and 217,000 new cases were diagnosed. More than 2.2 million men in the U.S. are living with prostate cancer.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The story explained that there\u2019s been prior research in both fields \u2013 studying effects of anti-inflammatory drugs and walking on prostate cancer.\nSo it didn\u2019t inappropriately paint either pursuit as totally new.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Jessie Quinn of Sacramento was 36 years old when loss of appetite, weight loss, some eye issues and finally pelvic pain sent her to the emergency room in 2010. Tests quickly revealed she had acute myeloid leukemia \u2014 a type of blood cancer that progresses quickly \u2014 and doctors told her that chemotherapy would probably not be enough; she would need a bone-marrow transplant.\n\nQuinn, who has a science background, knew that finding a donor would be difficult. In college, she had donated to a bone-marrow registry after learning that people like her, with a mixed racial heritage, have a much harder time than others finding a match.\n\nIn fact, when she and her doctors scoured the registry for a match for her, only one name came up: her own.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry,\u201d Quinn said.\n\nWhile searching unsuccessfully for a match for five months, Quinn underwent four cycles of chemotherapy to keep the leukemia at bay. What eventually saved her, though, was an experimental transplant using stem cells from the blood of a baby\u2019s umbilical cord, an approach that can be used without perfectly matching blood types.\n\nThis therapy and another \u2014 haploidentical transplantation, which uses bone-marrow cells that are only half-matched to a patient \u2014 have revolutionized the treatment of blood cancers in the past few years. Every biological child is a half-match for a parent, and vice versa.\n\n\u201cMany patients who previously died for lack of a match are now cured of their underlying malignancy,\u201d said Richard Jones, director of the bone-marrow transplant program at Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center.\n\nBone-marrow transplants, which infuse healthy blood cells taken from a donor, are used when chemotherapy and radiation fail to stop cancerous blood cells from taking over and ultimately destroying a person\u2019s immune system.\n\nThe transplant can be taken from either the blood or bone marrow, which produces blood cells. The procedure is typically preceded by high doses of chemotherapy and radiation that wipe out the patient\u2019s faulty blood cells and replace them with healthy ones from a donor.\n\nThe process is dangerous because it leaves a patient vulnerable to life-threatening infection for months before the reconstituted immune system begins to work.\n\nIn the past, a patient\u2019s body would reject as a foreign intruder anything but a perfect or near-perfect match, a usually fatal development. Umbilical-cord stem cells, however, are sort of a blank slate because they haven\u2019t been exposed to much life \u2014 such as bacteria and viruses \u2014 and thus are more easily accepted even if they aren\u2019t a perfect match.\n\nWhen Quinn\u2019s doctors found no match on the donor registry, she turned to a clinical trial examining the safety of taking blood cells from umbilical cords, expanding their numbers in a laboratory and then infusing them into patients.\n\nBecause each umbilical cord produces only a tiny number of stem cells, umbilical-cord transplants take longer to work than standard transplants, which makes patients more likely to get fatal infections. And if cells from several umbilical cords are used, the chances of immunity problems increase.\n\nThis expanded cord-blood technique has been a \u201chuge home run\u201d for patients, said Colleen Delaney of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, who helped create it.\n\n\u201cNo one had successfully taken stem cells and gotten them to grow and put back in a person,\u201d she said. The advance should be particularly valuable for minorities and people of mixed-race background, whose chances of finding a matched donor were slim to none.\n\n\u201cThis is where cord blood becomes an amazing and beautiful resource,\u201d Delaney said. \u201cWe can find cord-blood donors for 99 percent of patients who cannot find a donor.\u201d\n\nQuinn was hospitalized for 30 days, and she said the recovery was difficult but relatively uneventful. Mostly she had to deal with overwhelming fatigue for the first year. She also developed graft-versus-host disease, which caused rashes when her skin was exposed to the sun. But she has been free of cancer for five years.\n\nShe remembers learning that she had leukemia and assuming that she would soon die.\n\n\u201cIt still gives me pause \u2014 I went to Costa Rica \u2014 that I am able to travel and went backpacking and kayaking,\u201d Quinn says. \u201cI was so sure I would never get to do those things again. It\u2019s an indescribable feeling.\u201d\n\nIn haploidential transplants, rather than wiping out the patient\u2019s immune system, doctors use just enough drugs to suppress it. This reduces the risk of damaging organs or causing a rejection of the donated marrow.\n\n\u201cParents are always haploidentical. Children are always haploidentical,\u201d Jones said. \u201cSiblings are half the time and all second-degree relatives (grandchildren, nieces, nephews) have a 50 percent chance of being a half-match. . . . Everybody now has a donor, and that is a major advance.\u201d\n\nYet doctors and patients may not be aware there are choices other than conventional bone-marrow transplants, Jones said.\n\n\u201cDespite the recent data showing equivalency of half-matched and cord-blood transplants with conventional matched transplants, many cancer doctors and even some transplant doctors still consider these newer transplants not standard practice,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere are still lots of patients in need of transplants that are not getting them because of lack of matched donors, and that is unacceptable in the year 2016.\u201d\n\nJones estimates that about 7,500 transplants of donated stem cells were done in 2014 \u2014 primarily for leukemia and lymphoma but also for nonmalignant blood disorders such as sickle cell and aplastic anemia \u2014 but that more than 15,000 could easily be done annually if more doctors embraced the new methods now available.\n\nGregg Gordon, 44, developed leukemia in 2011. He noticed two bumps under his shin and had been feeling unusually tired. He went to his internist, who drew blood and within 24 hours Gordon was in the hospital receiving chemotherapy.\n\nHis wife, Caryn, recalls how little they knew about his disease \u2014 acute myeloid leukemia \u2014 as doctors discussed treatment with them.\n\n\u201cWe knew it would be a very long journey to battle this disease,\u201d Caryn Gordon said. \u201cHe decided he would be focused on being the patient and said, \u2018Do whatever you have to do with me because I want to walk my girls [who were then 12 and 16] down the aisle.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOn advice of their hematologist, the Gordons traveled to Hutchinson, which has established a national reputation as a bone-marrow transplant center, but quickly discovered there was no good donor match.\n\n\u201cWe thought we would find a match. It was extraordinarily shocking to us that it was impossible,\u201d Caryn recalled.\n\nAccording to Be the Match, which operates the national donor program, a patient\u2019s likelihood of finding a donor match on their registry ranges from 66 to 97 percent, depending on ethnic background.\n\nBut Gregg Gordon was able to participate in Delaney\u2019s clinical trial and, like Quinn, received lab-expanded cord blood following intensive chemotherapy and radiation. He also will be five years cancer-free in September.\n\nNot everyone is as lucky. Quinn, Gordon and 11 other participants in Delaney\u2019s clinical trial \u201care all alive, in remission, at a median age of about 4.7 years,\u201d the researcher said, but two patients died when the disease relapsed.\n\nA larger trial using umbilical cord blood that had been expanded in a lab is underway.\n\nHe beat leukemia, so why was he feeling so bad?\n\nNew therapies offer hope for a really bad brain cancer\n\nScientists just doubled the number of known contagious cancers", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "There is a very bold statement of novelty in the piece that is not backed up by evidence or independent sources.\n\u201cThis expanded cord-blood technique has been a \u2018huge home run\u2019 for patients,\u201d said Colleen Delaney of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, who helped create it.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018No one had successfully taken stem cells and gotten them to grow and put back in a person,\u2019 she said.

The SelectMDx test can help predict the likelihood that clinically significant prostate cancer will be found by a biopsy.\n\nThe study published in The Journal of Urology, led by researchers at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, was designed to elucidate the cost-effectiveness of SelectMDx in a population of U.S. men with elevated PSA, a marker of prostate cancer risk. Researchers analyzed the impact of utilizing the non-invasive diagnostic test prior to prostate biopsy. The primary objective was to characterize changes in health outcomes, measured in quality-adjusted life years, and a secondary objective was evaluating healthcare costs.\n\nThe researchers found that incorporating SelectMDx resulted in an average gain of 0.045 life years, or approximately 16 days, in full health gained at a cost-savings of $1,694 for each patient undergoing biopsy. Extrapolating these data to a conservative estimate of 311,879 patients per year undergoing biopsy resulted in 14,035 life years in full health gained with an annual cost saving of more than $500 million for each cohort.\n\n\"This study demonstrated that routine use of SelectMDx to guide biopsy decision-making improves health outcomes and lowers healthcare costs associated with prostate cancer risk assessment in a population of U.S. men,\" said Dr. Matthew Resnick from the departments of Urologic Surgery and Health Policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN. \"We believe that this strategy improves the value of conventional risk assessment strategies through improvements in both quality and cost, the numerator and denominator of the health care value equation.\"\n\nEvery year, 1.3 million men in the U.S. undergo a prostate biopsy.i Although a biopsy is the only way to diagnose prostate cancer, the procedure is invasive and results in complications in 18 percent of patients, with 3 percent hospitalized for infection within 30 days.ii,iii,iv Common complications from a prostate biopsy may include bleeding, infection, sepsis/bacteremia, urinary symptoms/retention, and sexual dysfunction.\n\n\"While biopsy is the only path to prostate cancer diagnosis, no man wants to, nor should have to, go through the uncomfortable, costly procedure if it can be avoided,\" said Dr. Jan Groen, Chief Executive Officer of MDxHealth. \"We developed SelectMDx to help reduce unnecessary biopsies and now we have the data to show how we can both improve outcomes and save the system money.\"\n\nThe full paper is accessible via the online edition of The Journal of Urology.\n\nAbout SelectMDx\u00ae for Prostate Cancer \n\nSelectMDx for Prostate Cancer is a proprietary urine-based, molecular diagnostic test that offers a non-invasive 'liquid biopsy' method to assess a man's risk for prostate cancer. SelectMDx helps identify men at increased risk of harboring aggressive, potentially lethal, prostate cancer who may benefit most from a prostate biopsy and earlier detection. The test helps to reduce the need for MRI procedures and invasive prostate biopsies by up to 50%, thereby improving quality of life and lowering healthcare costs per patient. SelectMDx is available in the US and all EU member states. Since the introduction of the SelectMDx test in mid-2016, over 23,000 patients have been tested and 15 commercial contracts have been signed with US based insurance companies.

When taken within 24 hours of the first runny nose or sore throat, zinc lozenges, tablets or syrups can cut colds short by an average of a day or more and sharply reduce the severity of symptoms, according to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, a respected medical clearinghouse.\n\nIn some of the cited studies, the benefits of zinc were significant. A March 2008 report in The Journal of Infectious Diseases, for example, found that zinc lozenges cut the duration of colds to four days from seven days, and reduced coughing to two days from five.\n\nWhile the findings are certain to send droves of miserable cold sufferers to the drugstore in search of zinc treatments, the study authors offered no guidance on what type of zinc product to buy. The authors declined to make recommendations about the optimal dose, formulation or duration of zinc use, saying that more work was needed before they could make recommendations.\n\n\u201cOver all, it appears that zinc does have an effect in controlling the common cold,\u201d said Dr. Meenu Singh, the review\u2019s lead author and a professor in the department of pediatrics at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in Chandigarh, India. \u201cBut there still needs to be consensus about the dose.\u201d\n\nZinc experts say that many over-the-counter zinc products may not be as effective as those studied by researchers because commercial lozenges and syrups often are made with different formulations of zinc and various flavors and binders that can alter the effectiveness of the treatment.\n\n\u201cA lot of preparations have added so many things that they aren\u2019t releasing zinc properly,\u201d said Dr. Ananda Prasad, professor in the department of oncology at Wayne State University School of Medicine in Detroit and an early pioneer of research into zinc as an essential mineral. Two of Dr. Prasad\u2019s studies were included in the Cochrane report.\n\n\u201cThe public is confused because people have used the wrong dose, they have used the wrong sort of zinc or they have not started the treatment within 24 hours of onset,\u201d he said.\n\nEven so, the new report gives credence to the long-debated theory that zinc can be an effective treatment for colds. While it\u2019s not certain how the mineral curbs colds, it appears to have antiviral properties that prevent the cold virus from replicating or attaching to nasal membranes.\n\nThe first study to show that zinc might be a useful treatment for the common cold was published in 1984, but the research was criticized for its poor methods. Since that study, 18 more trials of zinc for colds have been conducted: 11 of them showed it to be a useful treatment, while seven of them showed no benefit, according to the review.\n\nAlthough a majority of trials have shown some benefit from zinc, many of them have been criticized for failing to \u201cmask\u201d the treatment, meaning the participants most likely knew they were using zinc, which may have skewed the results. At the same time, many of the trials that showed no benefit from zinc have been criticized for using formulations that may have contained ingredients that blunted the effectiveness of zinc.\n\nThe Cochrane reviewers selected 15 studies that enrolled a combined 1,360 participants. The studies were all considered to have good methodological quality with a low risk of bias, but they were far from perfect. All the studies compared zinc use with a placebo, but in several studies the zinc users complained about the taste of lozenges, suggesting that some people may have known that they were using zinc rather than a placebo.\n\nEven so, when the data was pooled, the effect shown was strong. The review found that not only did zinc reduce the duration and severity of common cold symptoms, but regular zinc use also worked to prevent colds, leading to fewer school absences and less antibiotic use in children. People who used zinc were also far less likely to have a cold that lasted more than seven days.\n\nThe studies used various forms and doses of zinc, including zinc gluconate or zinc acetate lozenges and zinc sulfate syrup, and the dose ranged from 30 to 160 milligrams a day. Several studies in the Cochrane review used zinc acetate lozenges from the Web site ColdCure.com, created by George Eby, the researcher who wrote the first zinc study in 1984.\n\nDr. Prasad said his studies have used zinc acetate lozenges from ColdCure.com that contained about 13 milligrams of zinc. Study participants took a lozenge every three to four hours during the day for four consecutive days, resulting in a daily dose of 50 to 65 milligrams a day, he said.\n\nSome cold sufferers have been wary about using zinc since the Food and Drug Administration warned consumers to stop using Zicam nasal sprays and swabs, which contain zinc, after numerous reports that some users lost their sense of smell after using the product.

Similar results were obtained by the National Cancer Institute USA in tests conducted on 60 cell lines.\n\nThe new drug works by forcing cancer cells to use their mitochondria, the \u2018power house\u2019 of a cell, to generate the energy necessary to function. Whilst healthy cells use mitochondria to generate energy, cancer cells contain defective mitochondria which are incapable of sustaining the cell\u2019s energy requirements.\n\nIn the absence of FY26, cancer cells switch from using their defective mitochondria to using metabolic activity in their cytoplasm to generate energy. By stopping this switch of energy source, the drug causes the cancer cell to die.\n\nLead researcher Professor Peter Sadler, of the University of Warwick\u2019s Department of Chemistry, said explains:\n\n\u201cHealthy cells generate their energy in organelles called mitochondria, but cancer cells have defective mitochondria and are forced to generate energy through glycolysis in the cytoplasm. Our new compounds work by attacking the energy balance in cancer cells\u201d.\n\nCommenting on the drug\u2019s benefits when compared to existing platinum-based drugs, such as Cisplatin, Professor Sadler says:\n\n\u201cPlatinum-based drugs are used in nearly 50% of all chemotherapeutic regimens and exert their activity by damaging DNA and cannot select between cancerous and non-cancerous cells. This can lead to a wide-range of side-effects from renal failure to neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, nausea and vomiting.\u201d\n\n\u201cExisting platinum-based cancer treatments often become less effective after the first course, as cancer cells learn how they are being attacked, but our new osmium compound with its different mechanism of action, remains active against cancer cells that have become resistant to drugs such as Cisplatin\u201d.\n\nThe research could also lead to substantial improvements in cancer survival rates, suggests co-researcher Dr Isolda Romero-Canelon:\n\n\u201cCurrent statistics indicate that one in every two people will develop some kind of cancer during their life time, with approximately one woman dying of ovarian cancer every two hours in the UK according to Cancer Research UK and two deaths every hour from bowel cancer.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that a new generation of drugs is necessary to save more lives and our research points to a highly effective way of defeating cancerous cells\u201d.\n\nThe research, supported by the European Research Council and titled Potent organo-osmium compound shifts metabolism in epithelial ovarian cancer cells, is published by PNAS. The paper describes the comprehensive systems biology approach used to elucidate the mechanism of osmium action of FY26, led by PhD student Jess Hearn. Importantly this analysis also pinpointed 3 mutations in the mitochondrial DNA of ovarian cancer cells.\n\nFollowing the successful test results the researchers have been awarded a Wellcome Trust Pathfinder grant to begin preclinical development of organo-osmium compounds.\n\nThe researchers thank the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (Grant 324594, Systems Biology studentship for J.M.H.), the European Research Council (Grants 247450 and 324594), and the Wellcome Trust (Grants 086357 and 102696) for support, as well as the European Union COST Action CM1105.", "question": "Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The novelty of this compound and potential advantages over existing treatments are clear from the story.\u00a0The release also notes that NIH is conducting similar studies.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A therapy that allows hay fever sufferers to get allergy shots in the form of a tablet or drops can help alleviate symptoms and cut people\u2019s reliance on allergy medication, a new research review confirms.\n\nKnown as sublingual immunotherapy, the treatment relies on the same principles as traditional allergy shots, but is delivered by tablets or drops that dissolve under the tongue.\n\nAllergy shots may be used for hay fever when antihistamines and other allergy medications do not control a person\u2019s symptoms adequately, or for people who want to reduce their reliance on medication.\n\nThe shots help prevent hay fever symptoms by exposing people, over time, to small amounts of the pollen to which they are allergic, essentially desensitizing the immune system to the allergen.\n\nAllergy shots are typically given weekly at first, followed by monthly injections over several years. The treatment does not cure hay fever but is generally effective at reducing symptoms. However, inconvenience and discomfort limits patients\u2019 willingness to try allergy shots.\n\nSublingual immunotherapy is an alternative and has become commonly used in Europe, where two tablet-based products against grass-pollen allergies are available: Grazax and Oralair. There are also a number of drop-based products. No sublingual immunotherapy products have yet been approved in the United States, however.\n\nFor the new study, reported in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Italian researchers combined the results of 19 clinical trials conducted since 1995 on the effectiveness of immunotherapy tablets and drops against hay fever caused by grass pollen.\n\nThe trials lasted anywhere from three months to three years.\n\nAcross the studies, which included a total of 2,971 adults and children with grass-pollen allergies, immunotherapy reduced symptoms by about 20 percent to 30 percent, on average. It also allowed patients to reduce their use of antihistamines and other medications.\n\nThe researchers, led by Dr. Gabriele Di Lorenzo of the University of Palermo, describe the benefits as \u201cmodest.\u201d\n\nIn an email, Di Lorenzo told Reuters Health that the findings suggest that sublingual immunotherapy is \u201chighly effective in many, but not in all patients.\u201d He said that more work is needed to identify which patients might be most likely to benefit.\n\nDr. Harold Nelson, an allergist at National Jewish Health in Denver, said that the body of evidence indicates that sublingual immunotherapy beats antihistamines and other medications used to control hay fever symptoms.\n\nIn an interview, he noted that antihistamines reduce symptoms by about 12 percent to 15 percent, on average. Nasal steroids, another hay fever option, appear to cut symptoms by about 17 percent.\n\nOn the other hand, Nelson said, allergy shots appear to outperform the oral versions, with a symptom reduction about twice that of sublingual immunotherapy.\n\nIn addition, the long-term effectiveness of the grass-pollen tablets is not yet fully clear.\n\nLike allergy shots, the oral immunotherapy takes time. Grazax, for instance, is taken daily, starting several months before the start of the next grass-pollen allergy season and continuing for three years thereafter.\n\nResearch so far suggests that the symptom relief persists in the year after patients stop taking Grazax. A study published earlier this year \u2014 and not included in the current analysis \u2014 found that during that post-treatment year, Grazax patients had one-quarter fewer hay fever symptoms than those who had been given a placebo for comparison.\n\nBut longer term data are not yet available. The benefits of allergy shots, by contrast, have been shown to persist for 10 years or beyond, Nelson noted.\n\nThe ultimate cost-effectiveness of sublingual immunotherapy has also yet to be determined; in the UK, for example, Grazax treatment costs about 2.25 pounds ($3.50) per day. In theory, that could pay off if long-term use of allergy medications was cut, but that has yet to be shown.\n\nStill, Nelson said that if sublingual products do win approval in the U.S., they will likely boost the number of hay fever sufferers who want to use under-the-tongue immunotherapy.

Previously, the appropriate blood pressure treatment for these patients used risk calculations and some guesswork, potentially leaving many vulnerable to heart disease or taking drugs they don't need. Nearly one in three adults in the U.S. has prehypertension, blood pressure higher than normal but not considered high yet.\n\nThe scans detect levels of calcium in the heart's arteries, and the physicians suggest those people with the highest calcium levels would benefit most from aggressive blood pressure treatment, whereas those with little or no calcium may not need to be treated as intensively, depending on their other heart disease risk factors.\n\nIn the study, published on Jan. 10 in Circulation, the researchers say these calcium scores allow physicians to go beyond the traditionally calculated risk factors to determine which blood pressure treatment strategy may be most appropriate for a particular patient.\n\n\"If a health care provider wants to target blood pressure in a patient with traditional heart disease risk factors and above-normal blood pressure, he or she can look at coronary artery calcium to help with tiebreakerlike decisions,\" says J. William McEvoy, M.B.B.Ch., M.H.S., assistant professor of medicine and member of the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \"Our study, along with others, such as SPRINT and HOPE, positions cardiac risk and coronary artery calcium as helpful ways to determine if a given patient would either benefit from more intensive blood pressure control or do just fine with a more traditional blood pressure target.\"\n\nIn late 2015, the SPRINT trial showed improved outcomes for participants with increased risk for heart disease whose physicians targeted their systolic (the top number) blood pressures to 120 millimeters of mercury, rather than the traditional 140 millimeters of mercury. But not all people deemed \"higher risk\" by traditional methods may need to be aggressively treated, McEvoy says. Some people react poorly to higher doses of blood pressure medicines and experience side effects, such as sexual dysfunction, dizziness, falls, weakness and more. And the risk factor equations that determine whether certain people are at higher risk and should be treated more intensively with blood pressure medications may have inaccuracies on the individual level, says McEvoy. \"We can predict that about 15 out of every 100 people with a particular risk score will die of a heart attack, but the equations don't tell us which of those people will be one of the actual 15; they don't give us personalized information,\" says McEvoy.\n\nConventionally, coronary artery calcium scores have informed physicians' decisions of whether to put a patient on statins, but the researchers say they haven't been evaluated before for their potential ability to determine blood pressure treatment. To determine if coronary artery calcium scores could inform blood pressure recommendations too, the researchers used data from 3,733 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) who had systolic blood pressures between 120 and 179 millimeters of mercury. Participants were an average of 65 years old, and 48 percent were men. Thirty-five percent were white, 32 percent were African-American, 22 percent were Hispanic and 11 percent were Chinese-American. At the beginning of the study, investigators measured their blood pressure and performed a cardiac CT scan to determine coronary artery calcium scores. They also calculated each participant's heart disease risk with the Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Algorithm, which uses traditional risk factors, such as race, age, sex, cholesterol levels and family history of disease. About once a year for 10 years, an interviewer contacted each participant or a family member to determine heart disease diagnosis, hospitalizations or deaths. After about 10 years, the participants had 642 heart disease events, such as heart attack, heart failure, stroke and death.\n\nThe researchers divided the participants by their coronary artery calcium scores into one of three groups: those with a score of zero, those with a score of one to 100 and those with a score greater than 100. Then, they looked at the number of heart disease-related events in each calcium score category broken down by blood pressure range and calculated heart disease risk. Low heart disease risk was classified as a less than 15 percent chance of a heart disease event over the next 10 years, and high risk was 15 percent or greater risk of a heart disease event. To get the event rate, the investigators divided the number of events in each category by the amount of people in the study multiplied by the length of time they spent in the study, known as a person-year.\n\nParticipants with calcium scores of zero with a high calculated risk of heart disease had a relatively low actual event rate after the 10-year study. For example, according to the researchers, those with systolic blood pressures below 140 millimeters of mercury and no calcium had an event rate of 12.7 events per 1,000 person-years, and similar people with systolic blood pressures between 140 and 159 millimeters of mercury had an event rate of 13.6 events per 1,000 person-years.\n\nIn contrast, participants with systolic blood pressure under 140 millimeters of mercury -- below the current cutoff for treatment -- and rated with a low predicted risk of heart disease who had a calcium score over 100 had a high actual event rate of 19.7 events per 1,000 person-years. Thus, even though their calculated heart disease risk is relatively low and their blood pressure is below traditional cutoffs for treatment, the researchers say people in this category with calcium over 100 are high risk and may benefit from more aggressive blood pressure treatment.\n\nParticipants with high systolic blood pressure between 160 and 179 millimeters of mercury had high event rates ranging from 20 to 40 heart disease events per 1,000 person-years regardless of their calcium scores. The researchers say this demonstrates that calcium scores may only be useful in guiding more personalized blood pressure treatment for patients with mild high blood pressure -- the gray zone -- not those with high blood pressure.\n\n\"It may be that if patients are in that blood pressure treatment gray zone with a high risk score but their coronary artery calcium score is zero, then they don't need to be treated aggressively to 120 millimeters of mercury and can be treated to 140 instead,\" says McEvoy. \"But if patients have a high calcium score and are in the gray zone, then it would make sense to go with 120 as a treatment goal.\"\n\nThe researchers caution that results are from an observational study, and a randomized trial would be needed to confirm the recommendations.\n\nCoronary artery calcium scans aren't usually covered by insurance and can range in cost from $100 to $400. The scans use radiation, so there is a very small cancer risk for susceptible individuals.\n\nAbout 70 million adults in the U.S. have high blood pressure -- a systolic blood pressure over 140 millimeters of mercury -- putting them at increased risk for heart attacks, stroke, heart failure and kidney disease, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAdditional authors on the study included Seth Martin, Zeina Dardari, Wendy Post, Khurram Nasir and Michael Blaha of Johns Hopkins; Michael Miedema of the Minneapolis Heart Institute; Veit Sandfort of the National Institutes of Health; Joseph Yeboah of Wake Forest Baptist Health; Matthew Budoff of the University of California, Los Angeles; David Goff of the Colorado School of Public Health; and Bruce Psaty of the University of Washington.\n\nThe study was funded by the P.J.

The drug, talazoparib, works by blocking an enzyme called poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), thus preventing cancer cells from killing healthy ones.\n\nIn a phase 3 trial of 431 women, funded by the drug's maker, those who received talazoparib lived longer without their cancer progressing than women treated with standard chemotherapy by an average of three months, researchers found.\n\n\"For women with metastatic breast cancer and a BRCA mutation, PARP inhibitors may be considered for their treatment,\" said lead researcher Dr. Jennifer Litton, an associate professor of breast medical oncology at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.\n\nWhen it's functioning properly, BRCA actually helps repair damaged DNA and prevents tumors, but when BRCA1 and BRCA2 go awry, they encourage breast cancers.\n\nPARP inhibitors such as talazoparib appear to interfere with the function of mutated BRCA in breast cells, causing them to die rather replicate.\n\nIn addition, several ongoing studies are looking at combinations with PARP inhibitors \"to try to expand who may benefit or lengthen how long they may work,\" Litton said.\n\nThe trial results are preliminary, as talazoparib has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nIn January, the FDA approved the first PARP inhibitor, Lynparza, to treat BRCA-mutated breast cancer.\n\nSimilar drugs have already been used to treat advanced, BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer, according to the agency.\n\nIn the current trial, the women who were randomly selected to receive talazoparib had a higher response rate to treatment than women who received standard chemotherapy: 63 percent versus 27 percent, the researchers found.\n\nThe drug does have side effects. Among women receiving talazoparib, 55 percent had blood disorders, mostly anemia, compared with 38 percent of those receiving standard chemotherapy.\n\nIn addition, 32 percent of the women receiving talazoparib had other side effects, compared with 38 percent of those on standard chemotherapy.\n\nOncologist Dr. Marisa Weiss is the founder and chief medical officer of Breastcancer.org. \"Smart medicines like this PARP inhibitor work better than traditional chemo in women with HER2-negative metastatic disease and a BRCA1/2 genetic mutation,\" she said.\n\nThis targeted form of treatment takes advantage of a weakness in the BRCA gene to further cripple the cancer cell's ability to repair itself, grow and spread, said Weiss, who was not involved with the study.\n\nNormal cells are mostly spared. As a result, more cancer cells are killed with fewer side effects, Weiss said.\n\n\"Most importantly, patients themselves have reported a better experience with less hair loss and improved quality of life,\" she said.\n\nWeiss advises women with advanced breast cancer to have genetic testing.\n\n\"In both my clinical practice and within the online support community, we advise women with metastatic breast cancer to get genetic testing upon diagnosis, in order to get the best care first,\" she said.\n\nThe trial was funded by drug maker Pfizer, and the results were published Aug. 15 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nFor more on breast cancer, visit Breastcancer.org.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The story doesn\u2019t articulate what\u2019s new about this finding \u2014 except the drug used.

Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center have found.\n\nHIF-2 inhibitors, which grew out of research begun more than 20 years ago at UT Southwestern Medical Center, work by interfering with processes that fuel the growth of cells.\n\nInvestigators conducted a pre-clinical trial in mice transplanted with kidney cancer from over 20 patients and showed that the HIF-2 inhibitor PT2399 controlled cancer in half of the tumors, according to a study published in the journal Nature.\n\n\"This is a completely new treatment for kidney cancer. We want to make HIF-2 inhibitors available to patients and are currently carrying out clinical trials,\" said Dr. James Brugarolas, Director of the Kidney Cancer Program, who is leading an $11 million SPORE grant from the National Cancer Institute seeking to translate new discoveries into novel therapies for kidney cancer patients. Part of the SPORE grant, one of just two directly related to kidney cancer in the nation, is focused on further researching HIF-2 inhibitors.\n\nIn a previous report, Dr. Kevin Courtney, Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine and a coauthor of the current study, reported at the American Association of Clinical Oncology annual meeting that HIF-2 inhibitors were safe in patients and had activity even in heavily pretreated patients. In the study in Nature, investigators show that HIF-2 inhibition was able to control metastatic kidney cancer even after 7 lines of prior therapy. See video.\n\nThe findings show that HIF-2 is a promising target to combat kidney cancer, said Dr. Brugarolas, senior author and a Virginia Murchison Linthicum Scholar in Medical Research at UT Southwestern.\n\nNearly 400,000 Americans are now living with a diagnosis of kidney cancer and more than 60,000 people are expected to be diagnosed with kidney cancer this year, according to the National Cancer Institute. Texas has the fifth highest rate of this cancer in the U.S.\n\nHIFs or hypoxia-inducible factors, like HIF-2, allow the body's cells to adjust to low-oxygen environments. HIFs activate programs that promote the development of blood vessels, facilitate oxygen delivery and promote efficient nutrient utilization. Kidney cancer cells hijack the same system to fuel their growth.\n\nHIF-2 inhibitors work by suppressing the effects of HIF-2 which include downregulating an important protein called VEGF that promotes the formation of blood vessels needed for tumors to grow.\n\n\"Unlike existing VEGF inhibitors, the HIF-2 inhibitor blocks VEGF only in the cancer and therefore does not cause cardiac toxicity or hypertension,\" Dr. Brugarolas explained.\n\nIn the Nature study, researchers compared the two drugs head to head and found that the HIF-2 inhibitor was more active than sunitinib and that it was active against tumors progressing on sunitinib.\n\n\"Furthermore, it was also better tolerated. As sometimes happens in patients, mice on sunitinib were sickly and lost weight, whereas mice on the HIF-2 inhibitor gained weight while on the study,\" he said.\n\nResearchers surprisingly found a subset of tumors that do not respond to the drug, but were able to identify biomarkers that, once verified, would help determine which patients are more likely to benefit from HIF-2 therapies.\n\n\"HIF-2 is believed to be the most important driver of kidney cancer. Traditionally, proteins like HIF-2 were disregarded as drug targets because their shape made it nearly impossible to design drugs against them,\" Dr. Brugarolas said. \"The approaches we have taken pave the way for identifying drug candidates for other proteins that have traditionally been considered undruggable.\"\n\nHIF-2 also appears significant in other types of cancer, including deadly brain cancers called glioblastomas and non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type of lung malignancy.\n\nHow HIF-2 came to be\n\nIn 1997, UT Southwestern researchers Dr. Steven McKnight, Chairman of Biochemistry, and molecular geneticist Dr. David Russell, Vice Provost and Dean of Basic Research, led research discovering and describing the protein encoded by the EPAS1 gene, also known as HIF-2\u03b1, the main HIF-2 component. Over the course of a decade, the laboratories of Dr. Richard Bruick, Professor of Biochemistry, holder of the Michael L. Rosenberg Scholar in Biomedical Research, and a coauthor of the current study, and Dr. Kevin Gardner, Adjunct Professor of Biochemistry, solved the structure of HIF-2\u03b1.\n\nBy 2009, researchers had identified a \"sweet spot\" where drugs could bind and shut down HIF-2 activity. Using the Simmons Cancer Center's High-Throughput Screening, scientists tested more than 200,000 chemicals to see which ones could interfere with HIF-2, identifying several potential drug-like compounds. The most promising compounds were licensed to Peloton Therapeutics, Inc., a biotech firm co-founded by Dr. McKnight and based at UT Southwestern's BioCenter campus. In 2014, the first HIF-2 inhibitor, an oral drug known as PT2385, entered clinical trials in patients with advanced or metastatic renal clear cell carcinoma.\n\nHIF-2 inhibitors also are the target of UTSW's recent $11 million SPORE (Specialized Program of Research Excellence) award. Investigators will further biomarkers to identify patients most likely to respond to the HIF-2 inhibitor, as well as to anticipate ways in which the tumor may evade the drug's impact.\n\nUT Southwestern's SPORE program involves four innovative disease and clinical research teams targeting adult and pediatric kidney cancer. Other UTSW SPORE investigators are looking at the function of a gene that identifies a cluster of particularly aggressive tumors, in hopes of identifying vulnerabilities that can be targeted with drugs; examining kidney cancer metabolism to distinguish aggressive from less active tumors, potentially yielding a tailored treatment approach; and evaluating novel subtypes of childhood kidney cancer.\n\nThe Nature research was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health including the SPORE; Peloton Therapeutics, Inc.; and the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas; the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (Center for Translational Medicine); National Natural Science Foundation of China; and philanthropy, including the Tom Green Memorial fund.\n\nMore than 30 researchers contributed to the study, including Dr. Payal Kapur, Associate Professor of Pathology; Dr. Ivan Pedrosa, Associate Professor of Radiology in the Advanced Imaging Research Center who holds the Jack Reynolds, M.D., Chair in Radiology; Dr. Xiankai Sun, Associate Professor of Radiology in the Advanced Imaging Research Center who holds the Dr. Jack Krohmer Professorship in Radiation Physics; Dr. Xian-Jin Xie, Professor of Clinical Sciences; Dr. Yang Xie, Associate Professor of Clinical Sciences; Dr. Tae Hyun Hwang, Assistant Professor of Clinical Sciences; Dr. Guiyang Hao, Assistant Professor of Radiology; Dr. Eugene Frenkel, Professor of Internal Medicine and Radiology who holds the Raymond D. and Patsy R.

That craving is caused by smoking tobacco but is now being increasingly satisfied by e-cigarettes and the trend to \"vape\" instead of smoke.\n\nThe selling point is the clean image e-cigarettes purvey by removing the simultaneous exposure to the tar and thousands of chemicals found in the tobacco smoke of regular cigarettes -- removing the cause of lung diseases as well as other tobacco-related conditions.\n\nTobacco kills almost 6 million people each year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and a growing number of people are now \"vaping\" instead of smoking, resulting in industry worth $2.7 billion worldwide.\n\nSince their introduction in 2006, e-cigarettes have become commonplace among smokers trying to kick their habit, with a third of smokers trying to quit in the United Kingdom turning to e-cigarettes to aid them, according to one study . But some critics argue these electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) are fueling a new addiction to nicotine -- particularly among young people experimenting with them.\n\n\"While ENDS may have the potential to benefit established adult smokers ... [they] should not be used by youth and adult non-tobacco users because of the harmful effects of nicotine and other risk exposures,\" says Tim McAfee, director the Office on Smoking and Health at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"Exposure to nicotine can harm adolescent brain development.\"\n\nStudies conducted by the CDC through its Adult and Youth National Tobacco Surveys found increased experimentation by youth trying out e-cigarettes but not conventional cigarettes. The gadgetry and flavors associated with the devices is suggested as a reason behind this, with fears of them acting as a gateway into real tobacco smoking.\n\nBut others in the field of tobacco control disagree, stating that whilst people -- including youth -- may have tried e-cigarettes, the evidence is lacking for their regular use. \"Kids like new technology and just experiment or use it once or twice,\" says Jean-Francois Etter, professor of Public Health at the University of Geneva.\n\nWhilst Etter says that use among young people should be monitored, he believes the role of e-cigarettes in reducing global tobacco consumption is more important. \"They are a gateway out of smoking,\" says Etter. The number of people using a combination of tobacco and e-cigarettes is on the rise, according to Etter, resulting in smokers switching and consuming less tobacco each day. \"[They have] the same level of nicotine but people are less exposed to toxins ... nicotine is not a health problem,\" he says. However, further evidence on the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes or nicotine is needed.\n\n\"The vast number of people using e-cigarettes are using them to stop smoking; [they're] about 60% more effective than going cold turkey or buying nicotine replacement therapy over the counter.\"\n\nBauld's research hasn't identified a dependence on nicotine with e-cigarettes in the same way as the addiction resulting from regular cigarettes. \"E-cigarettes are not the best nicotine delivery devices,\" she says referring to the fact nicotine is not seen to enter the bloodstream as readily when using e-cigarettes. That's backed up by Etter's research as well as a recent study by researchers at Penn State College of Medicine, in which e-cigarettes were found to be less addictive than tobacco cigarettes.\n\nThey do, however, provide nicotine more effectively than aids such as patches or gums, according to Bauld.\n\n\"Patches and gums are a very small market,\" says Etter about the quitting devices which first came onto the market 40 years ago. He fears too much restriction on e-cigarettes will limit their impact in achieving a world free of tobacco.\n\nBoth Bauld and Etter recognize the need to monitor the consumption of nicotine among teenagers but feel the value of e-cigarettes among adult smokers and their potential to save lives by reducing tobacco consumption should not be underestimated -- a sentiment recognized by the World Health Organization.\n\nThe greatest impact to date in reducing the number of smokers worldwide has been the taxation and legislation restricting tobacco advertising and increasing prices. \"For every 10% increase in tax you have 4% reduction in tobacco consumption,\" says Peruga.\n\nThe growing fear is the increasing domination of big tobacco in the e-cigarette market, which was once seen as a competitor. Their ownerships of popular e-cigarette brands could push out smaller companies in the field, reminiscent of the original tobacco epidemic.\n\n\"The intent of big tobacco is to sell their product,\" concludes Peruga. \"[They may] expand their market to other customers who didn't use cigarettes but might consider nicotine use.\"\n\nBut as it seems e-cigarettes are here to stay, most calls are for informed regulation rather than prohibition. \"The majority of e-cigarettes -- especially when they are well regulated -- are likely to be less toxic than cigarettes -- and that for smokers is an advantage,\" says Peruga.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The story notes that e-cigarettes have been around since 2006, and that there is growing debate as to the balance of benefits and harms surrounding their use.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Aug. 16, 2010 -- A probiotic supplement may be an option for parents trying to soothe a colicky baby, according to a new study.\n\nResearchers from the University of Turin, Italy, found that a few daily drops of Lactobacillus reuteri, a bacterium that can help improve digestion, significantly reduced crying among infants with colic.\n\nThe findings were published online today in Pediatrics.\n\nColic occurs during the first three months of an infant's life in which an otherwise healthy child cries and cannot be comforted for three hours or more every day.

It measures the amount of AMH circulating in a women\u2019s bloodstream. This hormone is released by follicles in the ovaries and predicts the amount of possible eggs a woman has.

Nearly half the pregnancies among American women are unintended \u2014 unwanted now or within the next two years. And among sexually active teenagers and young adults, the rate of unplanned pregnancy is even higher.\n\nFully 43 percent of these pregnancies follow incorrect or inconsistent uses of contraception. Of course, some couples fail to use any contraception, but others rely on contraceptive methods that have significant failure rates even when properly used.\n\nThese facts prompted a committee of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists this month to urge its members to introduce women of all ages to the most effective and underused methods of reversible contraception: IUDs and hormonal implants. Once inserted, these long-acting methods remove the risk of patient error when a sexually active woman wishes to avoid pregnancy. Their effectiveness rivals that of sterilization.\n\nIn a 2012 study of 7,486 women aged 14 to 45, long-acting reversible contraceptives, or LARCs, were shown to be 20 times as effective in preventing pregnancy than the pill, contraceptive patch or vaginal ring. The risk of an unwanted pregnancy with these other methods was especially high among women under 21, whose rate of unintended pregnancy was nearly double that among older women.\n\nYet fewer than 10 percent of sexually active women currently rely on long-acting reversible contraception, and a major reason is doctors\u2019 reluctance to recommend them. Only about half of obstetrician-gynecologists offer the implant, the committee said, and many physicians use \u201coverly restrictive criteria\u201d when deciding whether to recommend an IUD, especially for adolescents and women who have not yet been pregnant.\n\nGreater LARC use can reduce birthrates among adolescents and, for women of all ages, a reliance upon abortion to prevent unwanted births, the experts wrote in the October issue of Obstetrics & Gynecology.\n\nFurthermore, the higher upfront costs of LARC methods are no longer an impediment for women with insurance obtained through the Affordable Care Act. Megan L. Kavanaugh, a senior research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, which studies reproductive health, said in an interview that \u201call new insurance plans obtained through the act\u2019s exchanges fully cover all contraceptive methods without any co-payments or other out-of-pocket costs.\u201d Title X family planning clinics and Planned Parenthood clinics are more likely than other sources to offer LARC methods, she said.\n\nIn a paper published two years ago, European experts predicted that \u201cafter decades of dominance by \u2018the Pill,\u2019 it is likely that in the future, long-acting reversible contraceptives will become the first-line contraceptive option, owing to their superior contraceptive effectiveness in real-life use, cost effectiveness as well as their established safety profile.\u201d\n\nHere is a summary of the advantages of LARCs, listed by the committee:\n\n\u25a0 They are independent of the sex act and do not depend on the user\u2019s motivation and reliability.\n\n\u25a0 Compared with other reversible methods, they are more effective and have higher rates of continued use and user satisfaction.\n\n\u25a0 There is no need to get frequent supplies and no additional costs once they are inserted, making them highly cost effective.\n\n\u25a0 There are few contraindications for their use, and fertility returns quickly after removal.\n\nFurthermore, the committee stated, \u201calmost all women are appropriate candidates\u201d for the LARC methods currently available. They are an implant that slowly releases the hormone etonogestrel over a period of three years, and four IUDs: the copper T that can be used for up to 10 years, and three IUDs containing the hormone levonorgestrel (two approved for use up to three years, and one approved for up to five years).\n\nIn real-world use, these methods are associated with a one-year pregnancy rate of less than one per 100 women. In contrast, women using the pill, patch or vaginal ring face an annual pregnancy risk of 9 percent; the diaphragm is associated with a 12 percent pregnancy rate, and with condoms, cervical caps and sponges, the rate is 18 percent.\n\n\u201cWhile there is no one best contraceptive method for every woman or every couple, women should have access to all methods and should know how effective the LARCs are,\u201d Dr. Kavanaugh said.\n\nThe etonogestrel implant is a small plastic rod resembling a matchstick that is inserted under the skin in the upper arm. The hormone, a form of progesterone, prevents ovulation and thickens the cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to reach and fertilize an egg. Though the implant can remain in place and effective for three years, it can also be removed sooner if, for example, a woman decides she wants to become pregnant. Typically with the implant, menstrual bleeding diminishes, and after a year, one woman in three stops having periods. However, some women develop longer, heavier periods, and some have increased spotting between periods.\n\nLikewise with the hormonal IUDs. Levonorgestrel, also a progesterone, changes the cervical mucus, blocking the transport of sperm and fertilization of an egg. It also suppresses growth of the uterine lining and thus reduces cramping and heavy menstrual bleeding. Women using it report a significant reduction in menstrual blood loss.\n\nThe copper IUD does not contain hormones. Rather, the copper is toxic to sperm, preventing them from fertilizing an egg. Because it also prevents a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus, the copper IUD can serve as emergency contraception for up to five days following unprotected intercourse.\n\nBoth the implant and IUD can be used by women who are breast-feeding, as well as those who cannot take estrogen. There are few contraindications; nearly all women are eligible for an implant or IUD, according to guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Unlike early IUDs no longer in use, \u201cmodern IUDs do not carry an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease after the first 20 days following insertion,\u201d Dr. Brooke Winner and her colleagues wrote in The New England Journal of Medicine. With both implants and IUDs, fertility returns quickly as soon as the devices are removed.\n\nCommon side effects include irregular bleeding during the first few months following the insertion of an implant or IUD. The latter is also associated with some cramping at the time of insertion.\n\u2022 The More We Learn on Nutrition, the More We Ignore\n\u2022 Ask Well: Catching Up on Lost Sleep\n\nFor more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "LARCs are not novel and the story establishes this.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A large new study is challenging the common practice of recommending that older men forgo treatment for early prostate cancer and instead wait to see whether the malignancy progresses.\n\nThe study of more than 44,000 American men ages 65 to 80 found that those who chose to aggressively treat their prostate cancer with surgery or radiation were about 30 percent less likely to die than those who waited, indicating that treatment offered a clear advantage.\n\nThe research, published in today's Journal of the American Medical Association, is the first to directly examine what has become conventional wisdom: that many older men need not treat early prostate cancer because it tends to grow so slowly that they will probably die of something else first.\n\n\"For many years, the thinking has been that observation or 'watchful waiting' was the safest option for elderly patients with early prostate cancer,\" said Yu-Ning Wong of the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, who led the study. \"This suggests there may be a benefit of treatment, even in this age group.\"\n\nThe findings prompted debate among specialists, who said the results could have potentially far-reaching implications because they address one of the central quandaries about prostate cancer and because the disease is so common. It is diagnosed in 235,000 U.S. men each year and kills more than 27,000, making it the most common cancer and second-leading cancer killer, after lung cancer, among men. Most cases are diagnosed after age 65.\n\nSome experts said they hope the findings will encourage more doctors to consider treating elderly men.\n\n\"This debunks the idea that older men do not benefit from treatment,\" said Christopher L. Amling of the University of Alabama in Birmingham. \"This gives support to the idea that active treatment can be beneficial.\"\n\nOther experts expressed skepticism, saying the study's design may have missed another explanation for the lower death rate among men who were treated: They were probably healthier in ways that doctors can tell only by examining them, not by looking at their medical records, which is what the study's authors did.\n\n\"There was probably something about these guys that made them more likely to get treated that also made them more likely to survive,\" said Mark S.

But she said she and her colleagues analyzed the data carefully to account for factors that could have influenced the findings, such as the subjects' ages and whether they had other health problems.\n\n\"We adjusted for as many of those differences as we could,\" Wong said.\n\nThe widespread use of the prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, screening to detect prostate cancer early has led to intense debate about how aggressively to treat the disease. Some doctors fear the cancer is being over-treated, particularly in older men, subjecting them to therapies that leave many impotent and incontinent when their cancer would never bother them if left untreated.

The medication used in the FAME 2 trial consisted of a combination of aspirin, cholesterol-lowering and blood pressure-lowering drugs as required by current treatment guidelines.\n\nPCI is a minimally-invasive procedure where modern stents - small tubular metal scaffolds coated with medication - are inserted into an artery using a small catheter to widen a narrowed blood vessel in the heart. PCI is commonly used to treat sudden blockages of a coronary artery that cause a heart attack. In situations where the heart's arteries narrow less suddenly and do not cause a heart attack but induce chest pain during exercise - a condition known as stable coronary artery disease - it has remained unclear whether PCI in addition to medication was better than medication alone in preventing future heart attacks.\n\n\"Currently, the standard practice in North America is to prescribe medication to patients with stable coronary artery disease and avoid PCI,\" said Dr. Peter J\u00fcni, Director of the Applied Health Research Centre (AHRC) at the Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute of St. Michael's Hospital, who is a senior author on the study. \"Our results pose the question: Would a large portion of patients benefit from early PCI in addition to medication?\"\n\n\"We used pressure measurements inside the heart arteries to find coronary arteries that should be widened,\" said Dr. Bernard De Bruyne, an interventional cardiologist at the Cardiovascular Center Aalst in Belgium and the Principal Investigator of the trial. \"With these measurements we were able to identify patients who would benefit from PCI in addition to medication.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization reports that every year, 17.7 million people die from cardiovascular diseases, which is an estimated 31 per cent of all deaths worldwide. Coronary artery disease is the most common type of heart disease in North America and Europe, and is a serious health problem worldwide. It occurs when the coronary arteries become narrow and hardened due to the build-up of cholesterol rich plaques in the blood vessels. While the FAME 2 trial showed that PCI reduced urgent hospital admissions and revascularizations and likely reduced heart attacks, it did not provide evidence for a difference between PCI and medication alone in the prevention of deaths.\n\nThe trial was initially sponsored by St. Jude Medical, a global medical device company, until the three-year follow-up. The subsequent two years of follow-up have been academically driven, organized the by the academic steering committee of the study. Nineteen sites across Europe and North America participated in the five-year follow-up.\n\n\"Our trial over its entire follow-up shows us that the longer you observe these patients, the more pronounced the benefits of the initial PCI become,\" said Dr. J\u00fcni, who is also a Canada Research Chair and a Professor of Medicine at the University of Toronto.\n\nWhile Drs. J\u00fcni and De Bruyne agree there is more research to be done using modern PCI technology, this five-year follow-up offers evidence that PCI has the potential to provide long-term benefits to patients with stable coronary artery disease.\n\nThe FAME 2 trial was supported by St. Jude Medical.

That group was much more likely to choose to have the healthy breast removed, as well. In that group, 11 percent chose a double mastectomy in 2003, up from 4.2 percent in 1998.

More women are undergoing genetic testing after a diagnosis of breast cancer, and improvements in both mastectomy and breast-reconstruction techniques have made the option of a double reconstruction less daunting.\n\nDoctors and patients\u2019 advocates urged women considering the procedure to go for counseling and take their time before making a decision, noting that other risk-reducing options were available, like tamoxifen therapy for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer and the use of more sensitive magnetic resonance imaging screening for earlier detection.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The increase in double mastectomy as prophylaxis after a cancer diagnosis is a new finding.

They're on the rise in the United States and no one knows why.\n\nSome children are allergic to many foods, and it's impossible to know based on preventive testing whether someone will have a mild or severe reaction. And so far there's no cure.\n\nResearchers at Johns Hopkins University and Duke University are working on a treatment that may one day allow kids with allergies to safely eat the foods that cause them life-threatening reactions. It's still in the early stages, but Dr. Robert Wood of Johns Hopkins, who has been on the forefront of food allergy research, estimates the treatment could be brought to the public within six to eight years.\n\n \n\n In his new study, researchers explored a treatment for children with cow's milk allergies. The strategy is to desensitize the child by giving small amounts of the allergen (milk). Oral immunotherapy, swallowing small amounts of the allergen, has shown to be more effective than sublingual therapy, which involves putting even tinier quantities of milk under the person's tongue.\n\nWood and colleagues found promising results from this small experiment with 30 children ages 6 to 18. These kids were severely allergic to cow's milk. Wood presented the study, published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, at the 2012 Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology this weekend.\n\nThe results suggested that children who went through a year of sublingual therapy followed by one to two years of oral immunotherapy were less likely to have significant allergic reactions when undergoing the oral immunotherapy. Still, it did not eliminate all symptoms.\n\nThis is particularly important, because about 20% of the kids that Wood and colleagues work with have significant reactions during the treatment that make the therapy unfeasible, Wood said.\n\nSome participants have shown they can safely eat milk products up to a year after stopping the therapies, Wood said. But only one-third have longterm protection. Others need regular exposure to milk in order to maintain protection against allergic reactions.\n\n\"With milk that\u2019s not too hard,\" Wood says, because one could \"eat pizza a couple of times a week.\"\n\nIt's not known yet whether children respond better to this kind of treatment than adults, since there have been so few participants in this research. The big barrier to broadening the scope of the research is funding, Wood said.\n\nThis is the first time the sublingual therapy has been studied in terms of its benefit as a precursor to the oral immunotherapy, Wood said.\n\nOther research has shown that immunotherapy techniques may similarly work for children with peanut allergies. But tree nuts may be harder to treat, Wood said, because tree-nut allergic individuals often have multiple kinds of nuts they can't eat.\n\nResearchers are separately looking at a drug called omalizumab (Xolair), approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of severe asthma, to see if it could help people with food allergies, too.\n\nDo not try the immunotherapy technique at home; these experiments are conducted under medical supervision.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The story noted other immunotherapy research that\u2019s been done, but stated \u201cThis is the first time the sublingual therapy has been studied in terms of its benefit as a precursor to the oral immunotherapy.\u201d", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A study released this week by medical technology firm Covidien could lead to wider use of its tools that cut through blockages in leg arteries.\n\nThe results showed that atherectomy, the practice of trimming away the plaque that causes peripheral artery disease (PAD), is just as effective at restoring blood flow as traditional angioplasty and stents.

However, some researchers said, there are some complicating factors, both in the trial data and in other studies, that would favor Lucentis.\n\n\u201cThe data is going to be interpreted many different ways,\u2019\u2019 said one investigator in the trial, who spoke under condition of anonymity but would not provide any trial results. Revealing trial results before they are published or presented at a conference is considered a violation of scientific protocol.\n\nGenentech developed Lucentis to treat the wet form of age-related macular degeneration, the most common cause of severe vision loss in the elderly. While Avastin, which is a cancer drug, has not been approved for use in treating macular degeneration, it has the same mechanism of action as Lucentis. And Avastin costs only about $50 per injection into the eye, compared to roughly $2,000 for Lucentis.\n\nMany eye doctors already are using Avastin off-label to treat macular degeneration, and many say it appears to work just as well as Lucentis. But there has never been a definitive trial to compare the two drugs.\n\nSo the National Eye Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, sponsored a randomized trial involving 1,200 patients. Results are scheduled to be presented Sunday at the annual meeting of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. The results will also be published in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nSome 1.6 million Americans have advanced forms of age-related macular degeneration and the number is expected to increase as baby boomers age. In 2008, Medicare paid for 480,000 injections of Avastin to treat macular degeneration and 337,000 injections of Lucentis, according to a study led by Dr. Philip Rosenfeld of the University of Miami. Yet Medicare paid only $20 million for the Avastin compared to $537 million for the smaller number of Lucentis injections.\n\nInvestigators in the National Eye Institute trial had a day-long meeting on Tuesday in Chicago to learn the results. But they were sworn to secrecy.\n\nBut two people familiar with the data, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that injections of Lucentis and Avastin every four weeks resulted in vision changes after one year that were essentially the same.\n\nThe result was largely expected. Under the rules of the trial, patients treated with Avastin could read on average of up to five fewer letters on an eye chart than those treated with Lucentis and Avastin would still be considered \u201cnon-inferior.\u201d It is believed the results were closer than five letters, however.\n\n Still, doctors will be looking closely at details of the data. One person said Avastin was less effective than Lucentis in decreasing the thickness of the retina, suggesting that Avastin might not prove as effective in preserving vision over a period beyond one year. Patients in the trial are being followed for a second year.\n\nSafety of the two drugs will also be closely watched. However, experts say that with only 1,200 patients, the trial will be able to detect only major differences in safety.\n\nAnother part of the trial compared injecting the drugs as needed, depending on the course of the patient\u2019s disease, rather than on a strict monthly schedule. One source said Avastin was slightly inferior to Lucentis, but the other said the results of the two drugs were the same.\n\nThe trial comparing the two drugs is of the type known as a comparative effectiveness study.

So it\u2019s difficult to think about how a single shot might work against all the different HIV subtypes circulating around the world.\n\nBut scientists may be inching toward a vaccine that could tackle HIV\u2019s genetic diversity and prevent the virus from taking hold in people.\n\nResearchers from the National Institutes of Health and Johnson & Johnson at the International AIDS Society conference in Paris Monday morning presented data on a clinical trial of what\u2019s called the \u201cAd26-env mosaic vaccine.\u201d\n\nThe mosaic vaccine was developed using a computer algorithm to analyze HIV data from around the world and select a range of HIV sequences to include in a shot. It\u2019s called a \u201cmosaic\u201d because it involves taking pieces of different viruses and sticking them together to generate immune responses that can cover a broad range of HIV subtypes.\n\n\u201cOne of the great challenges for development of HIV vaccine is viral diversity,\u201d said Dan Barouch, a lead researcher on the vaccine and director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. \u201cThe mosaic strategy is one way to attempt to deal with the global virus diversity.\u201d\n\nA word of caution, though: We\u2019re only in the early phase of human testing, and the vaccine could ultimately fail to prevent the virus from spreading among people. But so far, the HIV community is carefully watching the Ad26 vaccine research because the approach seems quite promising.\n\nThe mosaic approach seems promising in very early clinical research\n\nIn the 35 years of the HIV epidemic, only four HIV vaccine concepts have been tested in humans. The mosaic strategy is the fifth concept, and one of only two HIV vaccines that\u2019s currently part of clinical trials of efficacy in humans. (The other is the HVTN 702 HIV vaccine candidate, now underway in Thailand.)\n\nIn the study of the Ad26 mosaic vaccine, called the APPROACH trial, 393 volunteers in the United States, Rwanda, Uganda, South Africa, and Thailand were randomly assigned to receive one of seven experimental vaccines or a placebo. The mosaic vaccine was the best tolerated and also capable of generating anti-HIV immune responses in all the people who received the shots.\n\nBefore this, studies of the mosaic vaccine in rhesus monkeys showed a 66 percent efficacy rate, meaning 66 percent of monkeys that got the shot were protected from the virus. (With HIV, 50 to 60 percent is about the efficacy range researchers hope for.) Interestingly, in the early human study, the immune response was comparable to the rhesus monkey one, which gave the researchers hope that the vaccine might be similarly effective in people.\n\nWe need more human studies of this HIV vaccine\n\nBut we still don\u2019t know if the vaccine will protect humans from the virus, since the studies so far have only looked at safety and immune responses, not efficacy. And many medicines that look promising in animals, and safe in humans, don\u2019t pan out in clinical trials focused on efficacy.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t use the word excited too much,\u201d said Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH\u2019s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \u201cIt\u2019s a step forward toward getting another candidate into trial that could have some promise.\u201d It\u2019s too soon to say if and when the mosaic vaccine might work to prevent the virus from spreading in humans, he added.\n\nAs for next steps, if the researchers continue to see promising data on the mosaic vaccine from another ongoing study, a larger human efficacy trial will move forward toward the end of the year in southern Africa, involving some 2,600 healthy, HIV-negative women.\n\nDeaths from AIDS have halved since 2005 \u2014 but there\u2019s still a ton of work to be done\n\nWe\u2019ve made remarkable progress against HIV around the world. In 1996, as HIV prevalence was peaking around the world, the United Nations established UNAIDS, the first global health body focused on a single disease. In 2000, the UN Security Council convened an unprecedented meeting to address the out-of-control AIDS crisis. This led to a massive concentration of resources into HIV/AIDS research, and triggered global and coordinated efforts to stem the disease.\n\nResearchers and doctors figured out how to get people tested and diagnosed quickly, and uncovered effective treatments that allowed those with HIV to live long, relatively healthy lives. Public health officials also waged awareness campaigns about prevention, reminding people to practice safe sex with condoms and get tested, and that early HIV treatment can save lives. Recently, researchers even discovered a pill to prevent HIV.\n\nDeaths from AIDS have halved to 1 million since 2005, and UNAIDS estimates almost 20 million people now have access to treatment. (Some of that access is now in jeopardy, however, given that President Donald Trump has proposed cutting $800 million from a key US government AIDS program called PEPFAR in the 2018 budget.)\n\nAn HIV vaccine has long been elusive. The other HIV vaccine in human testing, the HVTN 702 candidate, is a newer version of the only other HIV vaccine to show any efficacy in humans, called RV144. In a trial on the RV144, 31 percent of people who got the vaccine did not develop HIV \u2014 too small a number to be useful. But with the new HVTN trial, researchers hope some tweaks to the vaccine might boost the efficacy rate.\n\n\u201cA safe and effective HIV vaccine would be a powerful tool to reduce new HIV infections worldwide and help bring about a durable end to the HIV/AIDS pandemic,\u201d Fauci said in a statement. \u201cBy exploring multiple promising avenues of vaccine development research, we expand our opportunities to achieve these goals.\u201d", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "What is \u201cnovel\u201d here is the type of vaccine under development, since it attempts to encompass the diversity in HIV found around the globe.

This morning, she'll be getting two of them drilled the old-fashioned way. But the third is a decay that is not so advanced, and Dr. Jin-Ho Phark, her dentist, is going to use a treatment he's testing that involves no drilling -- \"which is nice because many patients don't like the sound of the drill, and the feeling or the pain that might be associated with it,\" Phark says.\n\nThat cringe-worthy sound may be on the way out. A new procedure used by Phark and other doctors claims to stop the progress of cavities without drills or Novocain.\n\nThe treatment, called Icon, is one of several new cavity treatments that avoid drilling. Icon was developed in Germany and has been available in the U.S. for just over a year. It's intended for patients whose decay has not gone beyond the tooth enamel.\n\nTo Drill Or Not To Drill\n\nPhark says that when decay is caught very early or very late, dentists have a clear course of action: Early problems can often be reversed with better brushing, fluoride or calcium-containing toothpastes -- and late-stage cavities need to be filled. But at the intermediate stages, dentists don't have many options.\n\n\"In many of those cases we decide, 'OK, this lesion is too small to be treated with a filling.' So, we are actually waiting until the lesion grows bigger and bigger and becomes deep enough and worthy to be drilled out and be filled,\" Phark says.\n\nGerman researcher Sebastian Paris is a dentist and one of the drill-less cavity treatment's developers.\n\n\"We aim to treat these intermediate lesions -- not the very early ones, but the intermediate ones -- where usually, as a dentist, you are not sure whether you should make a filling or not,\" Paris says.\n\nWhen tooth decay begins, minerals, like calcium, are leached out of the tooth enamel, leaving behind sponge-like pores in the enamel. If the decay process is allowed to continue, the pores grow and form a hole, known as a cavity.\n\nThe new treatment uses a coating of mild acid that is applied to the decay to open up a route to the pores and clear out decayed enamel. Then the open pores are filled with a clear resin.\n\nParis says the key to getting the treatment to work was finding a filling material that wasn't thick and goopy so the porous enamel would immediately suck it up like a sponge.\n\n\"When you take a sugar cube and you put it into your coffee, you will see that it is soaked up with the coffee,\" Paris says. \"But if you put your sugar cube into honey, you can imagine that it will take ages to soak into the sugar cube.\"\n\nAvoiding the drill has the advantage of preserving and extending the life of the natural tooth. However, some dentists argue that any time before a cavity actually forms, tooth decay can be stopped -- and even reversed -- by the patients themselves, using, for example, fluoride toothpaste.\n\n\"An alternative could simply be brushing better in a certain location and not drinking Coca-Cola all day long,\" says Mark Wolff, a professor of dentistry at New York University who specializes in cariology, or the study of tooth decay.\n\nWolff says that while the no-drill approach to treating this type of tooth decay has promise, fluoride treatments and other patient-applied methods are still more inexpensive, less invasive and have a much longer track record of success.\n\n\"Might this be a good application to help that person recover or prevent this decay from advancing? Absolutely. I think the jury is still out on the product a little bit. Hopefully it works. It's just still in its earliest stages,\" Wolff says.\n\nBecause it's so new, it's still unclear how the Icon resin filling holds up over time. And clinical studies have shown that the treatment fails to stop decay from advancing up to 15 percent of the time.\n\nBut Wolff says that for patients who aren't able or willing to change their dental hygiene habits, or who are predisposed to tooth decay, this may be a good solution for keeping the dentist's drill at bay.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "\n\n\n\n \nThis story fails spectacularly on this criterion.

It is the first CDK4/6 inhibitor to be approved for the treatment of breast cancer.\n\n\"All living cells undergo cell division and palbociclib's unique capacity to halt the cell division process (also known as the 'cell cycle') therefore has potentially broad applicability,\" said the study's lead author Amy S.

Although, median progression-free survival was four months, five patients had progression-free survival greater than one year. Another phase 2 trial with 29 sarcoma patients treated with palbociclib showed a progression-free survival of 66 percent at 12 weeks.\n\nAlso, combining palbociclib with other anti-cancer agents is feasible, and early results in myeloma and some solid tumors have led to more definitive studies.\n\nIn both breast and other cancer trials, palbociclib has been shown to be safe with once-daily dosing, and its main adverse effect is reversible neutropenia, an abnormally low count of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that helps fight infections. The lower their neutrophil count, the more vulnerable patients are to infectious diseases. In such cases the drug is temporarily discontinued and reintroduced at a lower dose. Other side effects included fatigue (33 percent), nausea (30 percent), diarrhea (18 percent), constipation (12 percent), and rash (12 percent).\n\nAt the recommended doses, evidence of the desired drug effect in tumors has been obtained using novel PET imaging at Penn.

With Lomaira, we're giving physicians and patients access to a low-cost, low-dose version of a weight-reduction medicine, phentermine, that has been prescribed by physicians for over 50 years. Appropriate patients can take Lomaira up to three times a day, before meals \u2013 not just in the morning as with the higher dose formulations of phentermine,\" said Anthony Tabasso, President and Chief Executive Officer of KVK Tech. \"We developed Lomaira with this dosing flexibility and affordability in mind.\"\n\nPhentermine hydrochloride, an appetite suppressant, is the most commonly prescribed drug for weight loss. Over 7 million prescriptions are written for phentermine yearly by a wide range of healthcare professionals (HCPs), including obesity medicine specialists, family practitioners, endocrinologists, internists and cardiologists. 1\n\nPhentermine hydrochloride is typically prescribed in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg and taken before or within a few hours of breakfast. The usual adult dose of Lomaira is one tablet three times a day 1/2 hour before meals. The butterfly-shaped tablet is scored to facilitate administering one half of the usual dosage for patients not requiring the full dose, enabling doctors and patients to work together to customize a weight-loss treatment plan to best meet each patient's needs. Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. Phentermine is not recommended for use in pediatric patients 16 years of age or younger. Late evening medication should be avoided because of the possibility of resulting insomnia.\n\nLomaira is reasonably priced to ensure that cost does not create a hurdle, despite the fact that two-thirds of Americans pay out-of-pocket for their weight-loss prescription medications. Through KVK Tech's , eligible patients will pay no more than 50\u00a2 per tablet for the duration of treatment.\n\n\"Obesity is a chronic metabolic disease that must be managed appropriately to reduce the risk of serious health conditions. Many physicians have used phentermine to help patients as part of a comprehensive weight-management plan. Now, the flexibility in dosing with Lomaira allows doctors to personalize dosing. They can prescribe a lower dose, a good option for some patients. They can also prescribe up to three times a day, which is particularly helpful when patients struggle to control their appetite in the afternoon,\" said Donna Ryan, MD. \"Regrettably, many patients are still not covered by insurance for weight-loss medications and the low cost for Lomaira makes it an affordable treatment option.\"\n\nIn relatively short-term clinical trials, adults with obesity who were instructed in dietary management and treated with \"anorectic\" drugs (appetite suppressants) lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 2\n\n\"Even modest weight loss can dramatically improve risk and health,\" continued Dr. Ryan. \"It is not necessary to lose a lot of weight to get a lot of benefit.\" Losing five to 10 percent of total body weight is likely to produce health benefits, such as improvements in blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood sugars.3\n\nSome side effects of phentermine that have been reported include pulmonary hypertension, valvular heart disease, palpitations, increased heart rate or blood pressure, insomnia, restlessness, dry mouth, diarrhea, constipation and changes in sexual drive.

Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH), a rare fatal lung disease, has been reported in patients who had taken a combination of phentermine and fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible association between phentermine use alone and PPH cannot be ruled out. Patients should report immediately if they experience any decrease in the amount of exercise that they can normally tolerate, shortness of breath, chest or heart pain, fainting or swelling in the lower legs.\n\nSerious heart valve problems or disease have been reported in patients taking a combination of phentermine and fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine has not been established, therefore the possibility of an association between heart valve disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out.\n\nIf your body becomes adjusted to the maximum dose of phentermine so that its effects are experienced less strongly, the maximum dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect.\n\nCaution is advised while engaging in potentially hazardous activity such as driving or operating machinery while taking phentermine. Phentermine has the potential to be abused. Keep Lomaira in a safe place to prevent theft, accidental overdose, misuse or abuse. Using alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction.\n\nPhentermine can cause an increase in blood pressure. Tell your doctor if you have high blood pressure, even if it's mild. If you are taking medicines for type 2 diabetes, your doctor may have to adjust these medicines while taking phentermine.\n\nSome side effects of phentermine that have been reported include pulmonary hypertension, valvular heart disease, palpitations, increased heart rate or blood pressure, insomnia, restlessness, dry mouth, diarrhea, constipation and changes in sexual drive.

Many are pushing for cannabis as a treatment for the abuse of opioids and illegal narcotics such as heroin, and as an alternative to painkillers.\n\nIt's a tempting sell in New England, hard hit by the painkiller and heroin crisis. But there's a problem: There is very little research showing marijuana works as a treatment for such addictions.\n\nAdvocates argue a growing body of scientific literature supports the idea, pointing to a study in the Journal of Pain this year that found that chronic pain sufferers significantly reduced their opioid use when taking medical cannabis. Another study, published last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found cannabis can be effective in treating chronic pain and other ailments.\n\nThe research falls short of concluding marijuana helps wean people off opioids - Vicodin, Oxycontin and related painkillers - and heroin, though. Many medical professionals say there's not enough evidence for them to confidently prescribe it.\n\nIn Maine, which is considering adding opioid and heroin addiction to the list of conditions that qualify for medical marijuana, Michelle Ham said marijuana helped her end a years-long addiction to painkillers prescribed for a bad back and neck. Tired of feeling \"like a zombie,\" the 37-year-old mother of two decided to quit cold turkey, which she said brought on convulsions and other withdrawal symptoms. Then, a friend mentioned marijuana, which Maine had legalized in 1999 for chronic pain and scores of other medical conditions. Ham gave it a try in 2013 and said the pain is under control and she hasn't gone back on the opioids.\n\n\"Before, I couldn't even function. I couldn't get anything done,\" Ham said. \"Now, I actually organize volunteers, and we have a donations center to help the needy.\"\n\nBolstered by stories like Ham's, doctors are experimenting with marijuana as an addiction treatment in Massachusetts and California. Supporters in Maine are pushing for its inclusion in qualifying conditions for medical marijuana. Vermonters are making the case for addiction treatment in their push to legalize pot.\n\nAuthorities are also desperate to curb a sharp rise in overdoses; Maine saw a 31 percent increase last year, and drug-related deaths in Vermont have jumped 44 percent since 2010. Vermont officials also blame opioid abuse for a 40 percent increase over the past two years of children in state custody.\n\n\"I don't think it's a cure for everybody,\" said Maine Rep. Diane Russell, a Portland Democrat and a leader in the state effort to legalize marijuana. \"But why take a solution off the table when people are telling us and physicians are telling us that it's working?\"\n\nMost states with medical marijuana allow it for a list of qualifying conditions. Getting on that list is crucial and has resulted in a tug of war in many states, including several in which veterans have been unsuccessful in getting post-traumatic stress disorder approved for marijuana treatment.\n\nThis month, Pennsylvania became the 24th state to legalize medical marijuana. Sen. Mike Vereb, a Republican, called on lawmakers to take on what he called \"the number-one killer in Pennsylvania\" - opioid abuse.\n\n\"Opioid abuse has no party, has no color, has no religion,\" Vereb said. \"Let's face it, that's the killer. What we're doing today is the healer.\"\n\n\"It's hard to argue against anecdotal evidence when you are in the middle of a crisis,\" said Patricia Hymanson, a York, Maine, neurologist who has taken a leave of absence to serve in the state House. \"But if you do too many things too fast, you are sometimes left with problems on the other end.\"\n\nIn New Hampshire, where drug deaths more than doubled last year from 2011 levels, the Senate last week rejected efforts to decriminalize marijuana.\n\nThere are some promising findings involving rats and one 2014 JAMA study showing that states with medical marijuana laws had nearly 25 percent fewer opioid-related overdose deaths than those without, but even a co-author on that study said it would be wrong to use the findings to make the case for cannabis as a treatment option.\n\n\"We are in the midst of a serious problem. People are dying and, as a result, we ought to use things that are proven to be effective,\" said Dr. Richard Saitz, chair of the Department of Community Health Sciences at the Boston University School of Public Health.\n\nCannabis could have limited benefits as a treatment alternative, said Harvard Medical School's Dr. Kevin Hill, who last year authored the JAMA study that found benefits in using medical marijuana to treat chronic pain, neuropathic pain and spasticity related to multiple sclerosis. But he urged caution.\n\n\"If you are thinking about using cannabis as opposed to using opioids for chronic pain, then I do think the evidence does support it,\" he said. \"However, I think one place where sometimes cannabis advocates go too far is when they talk about using cannabis to treat opioid addiction.\"\n\nThe findings in the Journal of Pain study that found chronic pain sufferers reduced their opioid use when using medical pot were limited because participants self-reported the data.\n\nSubstance abuse experts argue there are already approved medications. It would also be wrong to portray marijuana as completely safe, they say, because it can also be addictive. But supporters point to doctors like Dr. Gary Witman, of Canna Care Docs, who has treated addicts with cannabis at his offices in Fall River, Stoughton and Worcester, Massachusetts. Since introducing the treatment in September, Witman said 15 patients have successfully weaned themselves off opioids. None have relapsed.\n\n\"When I see them in a six-month follow up, they are much more focused,\" Witman said. \"They have greater respect. They feel better about themselves.

It\u2019s not the first study to show a potential anticancer effect of aspirin and other similar painkillers \u2014 a class of medications known and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. Previous studies have found that aspirin users enjoyed a lower risk of colon cancer; a trial published earlier this year concluded that people who take a daily aspirin have as much as a 46% lower risk of colon, lung and prostate cancers, compared with non-users.\n\nIn the current trial, researchers looked at all cancer cases in the Danish Cancer Registry from 1991 to 2009 and compared this data against that of a prescription-drug database that recorded patients\u2019 histories of using aspirin, NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors, drugs that all work in similar ways to reduce inflammation and dull pain.\n\nOverall, 18,532 cases of skin cancer were included in the study. Each case was compared to 10 matched controls who did not develop the disease. Over the study period, people who filled more than two prescriptions for aspirin, NSAIDS or COX-2 inhibitors had a 13% lower risk of melanoma and a 15% lower risk of squamous cell carcinoma than those who filled fewer prescriptions, the researchers found.\n\nThe longer people took the drugs, and the higher the dose, the greater the anticancer benefit. Longer, higher-intensity use, for example, led to a 46% lower risk of melanoma, a 35% lower risk of squamous cell carcinoma and a 17% lower risk of basal cell carcinoma, the most common form of skin cancer in the U.S. The relationship held even after the researchers adjusted for potential confounders that could affect the risk of skin cancer, such as use of other medications. However, the researchers didn\u2019t have information on other key skin cancer risk factors like exposure to UV radiation.\n\nThe drugs are thought to counter cancer growth by suppressing inflammatory pathways and stimulating tumors\u2019 ability to expand and develop blood supplies.\n\n\u201cGiven the high skin cancer incidence and the widespread and frequent use of NSAIDs, a preventive effect of these agents may have important public health implications,\u201d the authors, led by Sigrun Alba Johannesdottir from Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark, wrote.\n\nIn the U.S., skin cancer is the most common form of cancer diagnosed, affecting more than 2 million people each year. But taking aspirin and aspirin-like drugs isn\u2019t without consequences: they may have harmful side effects on the stomach and digestive tract, causing bleeding and dangerous ulcers. (One COX-2 inhibitor, Vioxx, was voluntarily pulled from the market by its maker in 2004 after it was linked to an increased risk of heart disease.)\n\nBut given the growing body of data linking aspirin use to lower cancer risk, the researchers say it may be worth factoring in the drugs\u2019 anticancer effects when patients and doctors discuss options for pain relievers. \u201cWe hope that the potential cancer-protective effect of NSAIDs will inspire more research on skin cancer prevention,\u201d Johannesdottir said in a statement. \u201cAlso, this potential cancer-protective effect should be taken into account when discussing benefits and harms of NSAID use.\u201d\n\nAlice Park is a writer at TIME.

They also reported paying less attention to pain.\n\nIn general, they also had less disability, a reduced fear of moving, and improvement in mental and physical outlook, according to the study authors.\n\n\"These positive effects were found until the last follow-up measurement at one year after treatment,\" Malfliet said.\n\nThe program involves \"pain neuroscience education with cognition-targeted motor control training,\" she said.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nPain neuroscience education aims to change patients' beliefs about pain, to increase their knowledge of pain and to decrease its threat, Malfliet said.\n\nBesides focusing on the makeup of the spine, the program stressed lifting techniques and stretching.

Some experts in cancer screening and statistics said its novel approach was \u201con shaky ground\u201d and used a \u201ccompletely unverifiable\u201d methodology that they had \u201cnever seen before,\u201d but others praised its \u201cintriguing and innovative approach.\u201d There was one area of agreement, however: \u201cI imagine it\u2019s going to generate some buzz,\u201d said biostatistician Ted Karrison of the University of Chicago.\n\nIf the new analysis is correct, one of the influential PSA studies, called PLCO, reduced deaths from prostate cancer by 27 percent to 32 percent, not the zero percent that PLCO researchers themselves found. For a man in the U.S., the risk of dying of prostate cancer is about 2.5 percent. A mortality reduction of 30 percent would lower the death rate to 1.75 percent, said epidemiologist Ruth Etzioni of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the study\u2019s senior author.\n\n\u201cIf a screening test reduces cancer mortality by 20 percent, it\u2019s considered a successful test,\u201d Etzioni said. \u201cI think the [prostate-cancer] mortality reduction we calculate is a significant benefit. This is a screening test that saves lives.\u201d\n\nThose gains come at some cost to health, though: For every life saved, she estimated, five men will be told they have cancer when in fact their abnormal cells would never grow, spread, or harm them. In other estimates, such \u201coverdiagnoses\u201d outnumber lives saved by 50-to-1.\n\nThe new study lands amid another shift in how experts view PSA screening, which measures blood levels of a molecule sometimes associated with prostate cancer. In 2012 the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, whose recommendations help determine that procedures insurance should cover, recommended against routine PSA tests because of their many risks and tiny benefits. Among other drawbacks, the tests lead to overdiagnosis (meaning a biopsy finds malignant cells but they are so innocuous they would never harm, let alone kill, the man) as well as incontinence and impotence from treatment (including of harmless cancers).\n\nIn April, however, the task force proposed instead that men aged 55 to 69 discuss PSA\u2019s pros and cons with their doctor and then decide what to do, factoring in that if 1,000 men get regular PSA screening for a decade it will save about one life. (Older and younger men are still advised not to have routine screening.)\n\nThe rationale for the re-analysis led by Etzioni is that the PLCO study was a bit of a mess. It assigned half of its nearly 77,000 participants, men ages 55 to 74, to have yearly PSA tests and the other half to not do so. But 46 percent of the men in the no-PSA group had yearly PSAs anyway. As a result, when researchers counted deaths in each group, it wasn\u2019t a clean comparison: Rather than comparing screened to unscreened men, they were comparing assigned-to-screening men to not-assigned-to-screening men.\n\nThe finding that assigned-to-screening men were no more likely to avoid death from prostate cancer might therefore have been because their screening behavior wasn\u2019t different enough from the \u201cunscreened\u201d (but in fact partly screened) men\u2019s, not because PSA screening doesn\u2019t save lives.\n\nIn an effort to untangle that possibility, Etzioni and 21 co-authors from 10 countries created multiple mathematical models. They all rely on estimates of \u201clead time,\u201d or how much sooner a cancer is detected because of PSA instead of because symptoms are detected. The models incorporated the records of all the PLCO men and ignored which group they\u2019d been assigned to.\n\nBottom line: Screened men\u2019s cancers were detected earlier than unscreened men\u2019s, and more frequent screening advanced detection more. That moved some prostate cancers from too-advanced-to-treat to treatable, reducing prostate cancer mortality by 27 percent to 32 percent over 11 years, Etzioni and her colleagues conclude.\n\nResearchers not involved in the study weren\u2019t convinced. \u201cThe concern is that men in the no-screening group but who chose to get screened anyway might differ in important ways from men who stayed with no-screening,\u201d Karrison said. They might be more health conscious or conscientious, or have other traits associated with longevity. If so, then those traits, not screening, might be responsible for their lower risk of dying from prostate cancer. Two prominent experts in cancer prevention and statistics agreed, but said they did not want to be publicly identified as criticizing the new analysis because some of its authors are colleagues of theirs.\n\nDr. Kenneth Lin of Georgetown University Medical Center, a former staffer at the USPSTF, said crediting PSA tests with reducing prostate cancer mortality by around 30 percent was probably an overstatement, especially since mathematical models are only models. An earlier one for the PLCO study concluded that more men died in its screening group than in the don\u2019t-get-screened group. \u201cModels are models,\u201d Lin said. \u201cNo matter how sophisticated, they shouldn\u2019t trump data from real people who participated in the randomized trials\u201d \u2014 which in PLCO found zero lives saved from PSA screening.\n\nA researcher associated with the Preventive Services Task Force, but who was not permitted to speak to reporters while the group is finalizing its PSA recommendation, said the panel would incorporate the new paper in its analysis. \u201cBut honestly,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know that this adds a great deal to our understanding.\u201d", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The report of this study establishes, correctly, how it might expand our view of the value of PSA testing and reminds us that what is \u201cnovel\u201d here is the interpretation of previous research.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Compared with the 16% of people who didn't drink coffee at all, those who downed two or more cups each day were about 18% less likely to have died during the study period.

Women on the placebo also improved over time, however.\n\nThe findings come from the same clinical trial that, last year, showed Lexapro halved the number of hot flashes women had each day. (See Reuters story of January 18, 2011.)\n\nA separate study a few months later showed no such benefit, however. In two trials of 36 women, researchers found that Lexapro did not cut the number or severity of hot flashes over eight weeks. (See Reuters Health story of May 26, 2011.)\n\nAnd the lead researcher on that study said these latest findings are \u201cnothing to write home about.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe differences between the treatment and placebo groups are very small,\u201d said Robert Freedman, a professor of psychiatry at Wayne State University in Detroit.\n\nIn general, studies of hot-flash remedies over the years have \u201cvirtually always found a large placebo effect,\u201d Freedman noted in an interview.\n\nThat could mean that study participants\u2019 hot flashes are just getting better over time, which they sometimes do.\n\n\u201cBut my feeling is that it\u2019s the placebo effect,\u201d Freedman said, referring to the phenomenon of study participants on placebos improving because they believe they are getting a real treatment.\n\nHot flashes, which mostly affect women transitioning to menopause and already in that phase of life, involve a sudden sensation of heat, sometimes accompanied by sweating or visible reddening of the skin.\n\nTheir exact cause is unknown, but hormonal regulation of body temperature is thought to be involved.\n\nBouts of hot flashes can happen many times a day and past research has found they can continue for anywhere from a few months to up to 10 years.\n\nSo far, Freedman noted, the only hot-flash treatment that has consistently worked in studies is hormone replacement therapy (HRT).\n\nAnd right now, HRT is the only treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for cooling hot flashes.\n\nBut women and doctors are wary of HRT these days \u2014 since a 2002 clinical trial linked the hormones to increased risks of heart attack, stroke, breast cancer and blood clots.\n\nSo researchers have been looking for alternatives. And studies have suggested that a few antidepressants, used at low doses, can be helpful for some women \u2014 including paroxetine (Paxil), fluoxetine (Prozac) and venlafaxine (Effexor).\n\nThis latest study, reported in the journal Fertility & Sterility, focused on hot flash \u201cinterference\u201d \u2014 the degree to which women feel hot flashes disrupt their lives.\n\nThat\u2019s important because it gets at quality of life, according to the researchers, led by Janet S. Carpenter of Indiana University in Indianapolis.\n\nThe trial included 205 women who were having at least 28 bouts of hot flashes or \u201cnight sweats\u201d a week. Carpenter\u2019s team randomly assigned half to use Lexapro for eight weeks, while the other half were given placebo pills.\n\nThe women kept diaries to record their hot flash symptoms. And every four weeks, they filled out a questionnaire on hot-flash interference.\n\nAfter four weeks, the study found, women on the antidepressant saw their score on the interference scale fall by half, on average. It remained there at week eight.\n\nBut women in the placebo group also improved, albeit more slowly and to a somewhat lesser degree.\n\nIn a separate analysis of the same study group, Carpenter\u2019s team found that women on Lexapro also reported bigger improvements in sleep problems: half saw their insomnia symptoms drop by at least 50 percent, versus 35 percent of placebo users.\n\nThose findings appear in a separate report in the journal Menopause.\n\nFreedman said that the overall research on antidepressants and hot flashes is still inconsistent. \u201cOverall, the picture is not optimistic.\u201d\n\nIn his own study last year, Freedman used a different approach to measuring hot flashes: instead of asking women to record their symptoms in a diary, the researchers had them wear a \u201cdetector\u201d to monitor objective measures of hot flashes.\n\nIt is possible for women\u2019s hot flashes to remain unchanged objectively, but have their subjective experience of them change. \u201cBut that raises the question of why,\u201d Freedman said.\n\nAnd for now, he noted, it\u2019s also not clear why antidepressants would have effects on hot flashes.\n\nLexapro, which costs about $125 a month, belongs to the group of antidepressants called selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). They increase levels of the brain chemical serotonin, which may have a role in regulating body heat.\n\nBut no one knows if altering serotonin levels actually does affect women\u2019s hot flashes. In fact, Freedman said, there\u2019s some evidence that lowering serotonin levels does not worsen hot flashes \u2014 which would be expected if the \u201cserotonin theory\u201d is correct.\n\nAntidepressants can also have side effects, like nausea, drowsiness, headache, constipation and dry mouth.\n\nRight now, no antidepressant is specifically approved to treat hot flashes. But in the U.S., doctors are allowed to prescribe drugs \u201coff-label\u201d for conditions other than their approved uses.\n\nBesides antidepressants, doctors sometimes prescribe certain blood pressure medications or the anti-seizure drug gabapentin, which some studies suggest may be helpful.\n\nHot flashes often need no drug treatment at all, though.\n\nIf they are not severe, experts say simple steps can be enough \u2014 like avoiding hot and spicy foods, turning down the thermostat, or trying relaxation techniques, such as yoga or meditation.\n\nThere are several herbal or \u201cnatural\u201d products marketed for easing menopause symptoms, including black cohosh, soy, red clover and dong quai. But there is little evidence that they work, according to the North American Menopause Society.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The article did state that antidepressants are not FDA approved to be used to treat hot flashes and that doctors prescribing this are doing so off-label.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Editor's note: Tune in as Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores the signs, tests and lifestyle changes that could make cardiac problems a thing of the past on \"The Last Heart Attack,\" Saturday, August 27, 8 and 11 p.m. ET on CNN.\n\nResearchers in Canada have shown that a special cholesterol-lowering diet works well \u2013 even with only two nutritional counseling sessions over six months.\n\nMaking dietary changes like eating oat bran for breakfast, drinking soy milk instead of dairy, soy burgers in place of hamburgers, and fruit and nuts instead of a full lunch prompted a double-digit drop in both total cholesterol and LDL or \"bad\" cholesterol.\n\nThe study was published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nLead author Dr. David Jenkins, Canada research chair in nutrition and metabolism at the University of Toronto and St. Michael's Hospital, had previously shown the effectiveness of a cholesterol-lowering diet when all the meals were provided to participants.\n\n\"The question one had to address was how does this play out with people in the real world,\" Jenkins said in a telephone interview.\n\nTo put the diet to the real-world test, participants received a one-hour counseling session with a dietitian and an illustrated study booklet at the outset and, later, received a 30-40 minute follow up session.\n\n\"It was just advice,\" Jenkins said.

The first two drugs raise dopamine levels in the body, and the last two drugs reduce the amount of calcium reaching brain cells and trigger the production of other chemicals that help reduce pain. Dopamine is a brain chemical that regulates movement and mood.\n\n\"Physicians and patients now have better information on the effectiveness and harms of two types of drug treatments for patients with at least moderately severe restless legs symptoms in which to guide treatment choices,\" said review author Dr. Timothy Wilt, core investigator at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System.\n\nRestless legs syndrome causes a person to feel a powerful urge to move his or her legs. The legs become uncomfortable when lying down or sitting, and the condition can disrupt sleep and take a toll on the quality of life, the researchers said.\n\nOne expert, Dr. Martin Niethammer, a neurologist at the Movement Disorders Center of North Shore-LIJ's Cushing Neuroscience Institute in Manhasset, N.Y., said this study is merely a review of the current treatments for restless legs syndrome.\n\n\"There is nothing new here at all,\" he said. \"It doesn't add anything to the field.\"\n\nThis is just a compilation of evidence that follows guidelines that have been long established in both Europe and the United States, Niethammer said.\n\n\"These are the only treatments approved by the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration],\" he added.\n\nThe report was published in the March 4 online issue of JAMA Internal Medicine.\n\nFor the analysis, Wilt's team reviewed 29 clinical trials. The researchers found that 61 percent of those taking dopamine agonists showed at least a 50 percent improvement in their symptoms, compared with 41 percent of those taking an inactive placebo.\n\nIn addition, those taking dopamine agonists slept better and scored higher on measures of quality of life. Dopamine agonists were originally developed to treat Parkinson's disease.\n\nSide effects of dopamine agonists can include euphoria, hallucinations, weight loss, nausea, insomnia, tiredness or weakness, dizziness and drowsiness.\n\nThere are generic versions of Requip that cost far less, running between $11 and $22 a month. Insurance covers the treatment in most cases, so actual out-of-pocket costs will vary by insurance plan. The same is true for levodopa, Wilt said.\n\nNeurontin and Lyrica also helped relieve symptoms in 61 percent of patients, compared with 37 percent of those taking a placebo, the researchers found.\n\nThe most common side effects of these drugs include fatigue, swelling in the legs, dizziness and weight gain.\n\nWithout insurance, Lyrica costs can run more than $100 a month, but again co-pays will vary by plan, Wilt said. The same is true for Neurontin, which can cost $117 to $135 a month without insurance.\n\nWilt noted there is no information on the effectiveness of treatments in pregnant women, young or old patients, those with milder symptoms or those with other serious medical conditions. \"We urge caution in extending our conclusions to these individuals,\" he noted.\n\n\"Treatments for restless legs syndrome is now frequently advertised direct-to-consumer, and thus while this may enhance awareness it may result in patients seeking treatment for milder or other conditions not well-studied,\" he explained.\n\nThe harms of medications may outweigh benefits for these individuals, Wilt said. \"Up to 25 to 50 percent with even moderate to severe and longstanding symptoms stop taking these medications after more than a year due to either side effects or lack of benefit,\" he noted.\n\nNonetheless, for people with moderate to severe restless legs syndrome symptoms, these medications provided important benefits, at least in the short term, Wilt said.\n\nPatients should tell their doctors if they have bothersome sensations in their legs that include distressing, irresistible urge to move them that is relieved by rest, Wilt said.\n\n\"This may be due to restless legs syndrome or other conditions.

IsoPSA proved significantly superior to PSA in two key indications: discriminating between prostate cancer and benign conditions; and identifying patients with high-grade disease. The former indication is potentially useful for using IsoPSA for screening by primary care physicians, while the second is helpful for urologists in identifying patients who would benefit from curative intent therapy and other applications.\n\nThe results show that if validated and adopted clinically, IsoPSA could significantly reduce the rate of unnecessary biopsies by almost 50 percent. \"The methodology used in the IsoPSA assay represents a significant departure from conventional ways to define biomarkers in blood, and may be applicable to improving other cancer biomarkers,\" said Dr. Klein.\n\n\"Due to its inherent simplicity, requiring only a blood draw and presenting information to the physician in familiar context using a single number - just like PSA itself - we are quite hopeful in IsoPSA's future utility after further validation studies,\" said Mark Stovsky, M.D., co-author and staff member, Cleveland Clinic Glickman Urological & Kidney Institute.\n\nThe IsoPSA test was developed by Cleveland Diagnostics, a company co-founded by Cleveland Clinic, in which it has financial interest.

Yet Dr. Bertin has recently changed the way he talks about medication, offering parents a powerful argument. Recent research, he says, suggests the pills may \u201cnormalize\u201d the child\u2019s brain over time, rewiring neural connections so that a child would feel more focused and in control, long after the last pill was taken.\n\n\u201cThere might be quite a profound neurological benefit,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nA growing number of doctors who treat the estimated 6.4 million American children diagnosed with A.D.H.D. are hearing that stimulant medications not only help treat the disorder but may actually be good for their patients\u2019 brains. In an interview last spring with Psych Congress Network, an Internet news site for mental health professionals, Dr. Timothy Wilens, chief of child and adolescent psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital, said \u201cwe have enough data to say they\u2019re actually neuroprotective.\u201d The pills, he said, help \u201cnormalize\u201d the function and structure of brains in children with A.D.H.D., so that, \u201cover years, they turn out to look more like non-A.D.H.D. kids.\u201d\n\nMedication is already by far the most common treatment for A.D.H.D., with roughly 4 million American children taking the pills \u2014 mostly stimulants, such as amphetamines and methylphenidate. Yet the decision can be anguishing for parents who worry about both short-term and long-term side effects. If the pills can truly produce long-lasting benefits, more parents might be encouraged to start their children on these medications early and continue them for longer.\n\nLeading A.D.H.D. experts, however, warn the jury is still out.\n\n\u201cSometimes wishful thinking gives us hope that the impressive short-term relative benefits of medication over other treatments will persist beyond childhood, but I haven\u2019t seen it,\u201d said James Swanson, director of the Child Development Center at the University of California at Irvine. Dr. Swanson, a co-author of a landmark federally funded study, the Multimodal Treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, said that follow-up research found overall improvement but no greater long-term benefits after three years for children who were treated with medication compared to those who weren\u2019t. One possible reason, as the report noted, was that many children refuse to continue taking medication after a year or so, something most parentsof such children well know.\n\nResearch has shown that the brains of people with A.D.H.D. on average look and function differently than those who don\u2019t have the disorder, particularly when it comes to processing two important neurotransmitters: dopamine and norepinephrine. For most people with A.D.H.D., stimulants can temporarily boost focus, motivation and self-control by increasing the availability of these chemical messengers. The question is whether these effects can last once the drugs have left the bloodstream.\n\nIn arguing for \u201cnormalization,\u201d Dr. Wilens cited a major review in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry in late 2013, which looked at 29 brain-scan studies. Although the studies had different methods and goals, the authors said that, together, they suggested that stimulants \u201care associated with attenuation of abnormalities in brain structure, function, and biochemistry in subjects with A.D.H.D.\u201d\n\nBut other A.D.H.D. experts challenge this conclusion. Dr. F. Xavier Castellanos, director of research at the New York University Child Study Center, called assertions that stimulants are neuroprotective \u201cexaggerated,\u201d adding: \u201cThe best inference is that there is no evidence of harm from medications \u2013 normalization is a possibility, but far from demonstrated.\u201d\n\nA.D.H.D. is an exceptionally controversial diagnosis, with particular controversy zeroing in on researchers, including Dr. Wilens himself and some of the authors of the 2013 report he cited who have received financial support from pharmaceutical firms. In an email, Dr. Wilens said he had not received \u201cany personal income\u201d from the pharmaceutical industry since 2009.\n\nAs several experts noted, a major impediment to determining the long-term impacts of A.D.H.D. medication is that a \u201cgold-standard\u201d study would require researchers to assign children randomly to groups that either received medication or didn\u2019t. Such a practice has been deemed unethical due to the widespread belief that the medication can help struggling children, at least in the short-term.\n\nAnd other research has raised new concerns. One peer-reviewed 2013 study co-authored by Dr. Swanson suggested that the stimulants may change the brain over time so as to undermine the long-term response to the medication and even exacerbate symptoms when people aren\u2019t taking them.\n\nDr. Peter Jensen, the former associate director of child and adolescent research at the National Institute of Mental Health, cautioned that parents should not try to force children with A.D.H.D. to take medication when they don\u2019t want to, adding that \u201cmost kids don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\nDr. Jensen, who now heads the REACH Institute, a national nonprofit organization concerned with children\u2019s mental health, once surveyed 100 parents of sons and daughters in their 20s who had been diagnosed with A.D.H.D., asking what made the most difference.\n\n\u201cEighty percent of them said \u2018Love your child.

That protein is known as an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase.\n\nThe scientists say non-small cell lung cancers that had become invulnerable to the chemotherapy drugs Iressa and Tarceva were stymied in a study by a compound designed and formulated in the Dana-Farber laboratory.\n\nThe researchers say their new compound shows how fast lung cancer research and development are moving forward.\n\nThe Dana-Farber scientists say current [EGFR] inhibitors Iressa and Tarceva prevent EGFR from sending signals that are essential to keep tumor cells growing, the researchers say.\n\nHowever, over time, the tumor cells develop additional mutations, enabling them to grow again, even in the presence of the drugs Iressa or Tarceva.\n\nThe scientists say in the news release that not only did they find that a compound called WZ4002 can slow tumor growth, but that it is possible to \"selectively target the drug-resistant mutant EGFR in tumors, with relatively less effect on the normal EGFR in health tissues.\"\n\nMuch work lies ahead in determining whether the compound and related ones will prove to be effective therapies, but the researchers say their discovery demonstrates the power of screening specially designed compounds against cancers \"with certain genetic quirks.\"\n\nIt's early to discuss the use of such compounds in patients, the scientists say, but one of the researchers, Michael J.

She had also been taking the corticosteroid prednisone for two decades.\n\nExperts have already noticed an uptick in the incidence of this rare but devastating condition in patients using bisphosphonates.\n\nAccording to an editorial accompanying the study, this complication occurs in about 5 percent of cancer patients who are taking a high-dose bisphosphonate (Zometa or Aredia) to control or prevent spread of malignancy to the bone. It is much rarer in people who take a lower-dose bisphosphonate (such as Actonel, Boniva or Fosamax) for osteoporosis.\n\nThe 88-year-old woman described in the journal report had been experiencing pain in her jaw for a year and was subsequently diagnosed with osteonecrosis, a debilitating \"death\" of bone due to loss of blood flow.\n\nAfter eight weeks of treatment with Forteo, though, the pain went away and the osteonecrosis resolved, reported the authors, from Austin Health in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nThe editorial pointed out, however, that Forteo should not be used in patients whose cancer has already spread to the bone, as it might prompt even more spread.\n\nIt's also possible that the corticosteroid therapy she was taking could have contributed to the woman's bone loss, the authors stated.\n\nThe second paper involved 40 patients with severe gum disease that had affected their jaws, all of whom first underwent surgery on their jaw. They were then randomized to receive either Forteo or a placebo. All participants took calcium and vitamin D as well.\n\n\"These were patients with severe periodontal disease but who were otherwise systemically healthy,\" said study senior author Dr. Laurie K. McCauley, chair of the department of periodontic and oral medicine at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\n\nAfter six weeks of therapy, patients in the Forteo arm saw greater healing of their jawbone and this continued throughout one year of follow-up.\n\n\"There was a significant improvement in clinical measures of gum and bone,\" McCauley stated.\n\nBut, she pointed out, Forteo is not yet approved for this indication, so \"we can't recommend it next week.\"\n\nRight now, a bone graft is probably the most common type of therapy for this type of bone loss, she said.\n\n\"I think that it's really an important important proof-of-concept that you can inject locally and get a response,\" said Dr. Rena D'Souza, chair of biomedical sciences at Texas A&M Health Science Center Baylor College of Dentistry in Dallas. \"We could not only use this approach for the treatment of periodontal disease where the disease enters the bone and gum. but also other forms of periodontal disease.\"\n\n\"Bisphosphonates cut back on blood flow and blood vessels so that cancer doesn't have a chance,\" she said. \"That is why it's used very effectively for cancer but if you happen to injure the bone or take out a tooth you really need the blood vessels.

All of the trials reviewed had \"major limitations,\" such as having too few patients, relying on parental reports of symptoms, or the study design (such as not being double-blinded).\n\n\"The notion that any form of complementary and alternative medicine is effective for infantile colic currently is not supported from the evidence from the included randomized clinical trials,\" the researchers from the United Kingdom wrote. \"Additional replications are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.\"\n\nBut because fennel extract, certain herbal teas and sugar water are generally safe, and because the research does suggest babies may benefit, pediatricians said they would feel comfortable recommending them to parents.\n\n\"It's reasonable for parents to consider those kinds of interventions for which there is some suggestion of benefit but no known risks,\" said Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York.\n\nThe study, published in the April print issue of Pediatrics, appears online March 28.\n\nColic usually starts when a baby is about three weeks old, said Dr. Ari Brown, a pediatrician in Austin, Texas, and author of the Expecting 411 book series. Colic is usually defined as excessive and inconsolable crying for at least three hours a day for more than three days a week over more than three weeks.\n\n\"It's miserable for both baby and the parents,\" Brown said. \"And although we've been studying it for years, no one has figured out what the cause is, which makes it all the more difficult to treat.\"\n\nIn the United States, between 5 and 19 percent of infants are estimated to have colic, according to background information in the article.\n\nBecause pediatricians can't offer parents much help with it -- for the most part, babies grow out of colic in time -- desperate parents often turn to alternative or complementary treatments, according to the study.\n\nIn the review, the study authors searched various databases of medical research and chose 15 randomized clinical trials involving alternative treatments for colic. The studies were published between 1991 and 2008, came from 10 different countries and included a total of 944 children.\n\nSeveral studies looked at spinal manipulation by a chiropractor. In three of those studies, parents reported their children cried significantly less afterwards. But those studies were small and flawed, so no conclusions can be made about the technique, according to the new review.\n\nThree studies looked at herbal supplements. One found improvement in infants given fennel extract compared to infants given a placebo; another found that infants given a tea containing chamomile, vervain, licorice, fennel and balm-mint seemed to work; while a third found infants given a tea containing fennel, lemon balm and chamomile cried less than infants given a placebo.\n\nFennel, an intestinal \"antispasmodic,\" may increase the speed at which food moves through the intestine, Brown said. This may help if the underlying cause of colic is cramping or discomfort due to an immature digestive tract, although that is just a theory, Brown added.\n\nTwo studies looked at giving babies solutions of sugar water, which some researchers believe has pain-killing properties. The parents of babies given sugar water reported significantly less crying. (If parents want to try it, they could deliver sugar water in a dropper, or put a small amount in a bottle, Adesman said.)\n\nA study of probiotics, which are reputed to help digestion, found that 95 percent of infants given L. reuteria probiotics seemed to reduce their average crying time compared to 7 percent of babies given simethicone, which is marketed to relieve gas under the brand names Mylicon and PediaCare Infants' Gas Relief.\n\n\"This is pertinent given that simethicone is considered the best available and most commonly prescribed treatment for colic, although it previously has been shown to be no more effective than the placebo,\" according to the authors.\n\nBrown said the strength of that finding suggests L. reuteria is worth further study.\n\nOne study found no difference in improvement of symptoms between infants whose parents were taught to do infant massage compared to infants put in a crib that vibrated. Nor did soy-enriched formula seem to help.\n\nA small study of babies given reflexology showed some improvement, but there was no difference in whether the reflexology targeted the feet, which are considered to be therapeutic for colic, or other parts of the body.\n\nThis implies the improvement may \"have more to do with the therapeutic effect of touch than the actual therapy itself,\" Dr. Edzard Ernst, of the department of complementary medicine at Peninsula Medical School, Universities of Exeter and Plymouth, in the United Kingdom, and colleagues wrote in the report.\n\nThe Nemours Foundation has more on colic.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The story shows that these treatments are not novel and, for the most part, not very effective.

Published early online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society, the findings may help resolve controversies over soy's potential link to breast cancer outcomes.\n\nSoy foods are considered among the healthiest for human consumption, but their estrogen-like properties have raised concerns of a potential increased risk of breast cancer. This is because in hormone receptor-positive cancer, the most common form of the disease, there are some concerns that high estrogen levels help cancer cells grow and spread, though this remains controversial.\n\n\"Isoflavones--the component of soy that has estrogen-like properties--have been shown to slow the growth of breast cancer cells in laboratory studies, and epidemiological analyses in East Asian women with breast cancer found links between higher isoflavone intake and reduced mortality; however, other research has suggested that the estrogen-like effects of isoflavones may reduce the effectiveness of hormone therapies used to treat breast cancer,\" explained Fang Fang Zhang, MD, PhD, of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. \"Because of this disparity, it remains unknown whether isoflavone consumption should be encouraged or avoided for breast cancer patients.\"\n\nTo provide some clarity, Dr. Zhang and her colleagues looked at the relationship between dietary intake of isoflavones and death from any cause in 6235 American and Canadian women diagnosed with breast cancer. Over a median follow-up of nine years, women with breast cancer who consumed high amounts of isoflavones had a 21 percent lower risk of dying than women who consumed low amounts. This decrease was largely confined to women with hormone receptor-negative tumors and women who were not treated with anti-estrogen therapy such as tamoxifen (which blocks the effects of estrogen). In contrast to some previous research, high levels of isoflavone intake were not associated with greater mortality among women receiving hormonal therapy.\n\n\"Based on our results, we do not see a detrimental effect of soy food intake among women who were treated with endocrine therapy,\" said Dr. Zhang. \"For women with hormone receptor-negative breast cancer, soy food products may potentially have a protective effect. Women who did not receive endocrine therapy as a treatment for their breast cancer had a weaker, but still statistically significant, association.\"\n\nMore than 20 percent of all new breast cancer cases with known estrogen and progesterone receptor status are receptor-negative, and they have poorer survival rates than hormone receptor-positive cases. \"Whether lifestyle factors can improve survival after diagnosis is an important question for women diagnosed with this more aggressive type of breast cancer. Our findings suggest that survival may be better in patients with a higher consumption of isoflavones,\" said senior author Esther John, PhD, of the Cancer Prevention Institute of California. The investigators noted that they examined only naturally occurring dietary isoflavones, not isoflavones from supplements.\n\nHow isoflavones from foods interact with breast cancer cells is unclear, but research has shown that they have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, and other effects that could influence tumor survival and growth.\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, Omer Kucuk, MD, of the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, noted that the United States is the number 1 soy producer in the world and is in a great position to initiate changes in health policy encouraging soy intake. \"We now have evidence that soy foods not only prevent breast cancer but also benefit women who have breast cancer. Therefore, we can recommend women to consume soy foods because of soy's many health benefits,\" he wrote.\n\nNOTE: The information contained in this release is protected by copyright.

Studies have shown that people in parts of the world who eat more fish have lower rates of heart disease, and fewer heart attacks (though the same can\u2019t necessarily be true of those who take supplements\u2014see this piece \u201cFish Oil Is Hugely Popular\u2014But Should You Take It? for more on that).\n\nOne thing that has been less clear is what role fish oil plays in people who have already had a heart attack. Can omega-3 fat provide similar benefit? Researchers led by Dr. Raymond Kwong at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital wanted to find out, so they took advantage of more sophisticated imaging techniques that can provide detailed pictures of the heart and how it\u2019s changing in the days and weeks after a heart attack.\n\nFor the study, published in the journal , they studied nearly 360 people who recently had a heart attack, who were randomly assigned to take 4g of omega-3 fatty acids or a placebo pill for six months. (That\u2019s a high dose; a 3 oz. portion of salmon contains anywhere from half a gram to 1g of omega-3.) Every two months, the volunteers came in for an MRI of their heart to track how much the muscle was changing.\n\nNormally after a heart attack, part of the heart is starved of oxygen, and that portion never recovers. The remaining healthy tissue starts to compensate for the compromised tissue, but has to work harder to maintain the heart\u2019s normal pumping function. Over time, this overworking can lead to scar tissue and start to restrict even the healthy tissue\u2019s ability to do its job.\n\nKwong and his team found that people taking the high dose of omega-3 fats showed 6% less of this decline in heart function than those taking placebo. What\u2019s more, the people who showed the highest blood levels of the omega-3 fats (people absorb it at different rates) showed the greatest reduction in scarring \u2014 13% \u2014 compared to those with the lowest levels. The effects remained strong even after the researchers accounted for the fact that all of the people were taking standard heart disease treatment drugs, including cholesterol-lowering statins and blood pressure medications.\n\n\u201cThe omega-3 fatty acids seem to be preventing scarring of the otherwise healthy muscle that now has to overwork because of the heart attack,\u201d says Kwong.\n\nBased on analysis of their blood samples, the people taking omega-3 supplements also showed lower levels of inflammatory markers, which suggests that the fish oil may be working by reducing inflammation following a heart attack.\n\nIt\u2019s the first encouraging strategy for protecting the heart a heart attack; the more remaining healthy tissue that can be saved, the stronger the heart will be.\n\nKwong says that the findings are only the first step toward considering whether omega-3 fatty acid supplements should be part of every emergency heart attack response. The 4g is a high dose; previous studies in which people were given 1g of fish oil were more inconsistent. Most of the people also started taking the supplements two to four weeks after their heart attack. Might they have benefit more if they had started taking the supplements sooner? How much omega-3 is needed to start remodeling the heart in a beneficial way?\n\nThese are questions Kwong and others hope to answer with more studies. Kwong collected blood samples from the volunteers and will be studying them for hints about how omega-3 fatty acids are working in the body after a heart attack. \u201cTo say every [heart attack] patient should be taking omega-3 fatty acids right away is a bit premature,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I do think it\u2019s logical that our results hold promise, and may reduce bad outcomes in patients after a heart attack.\u201d", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The article demonstrates a good understanding that the novelty of the study lies in examining the protective benefits of fish oil right after a heart attack.

This is why the promise of a vaccine would be extremely beneficial, says David Bulir, co-author of the study.\n\n\"Vaccine development efforts in the past three decades have been unproductive and there is no vaccine approved for use in humans,\" said Bulir, who just finished his PhD in medical sciences at McMaster.\n\n\"Vaccination would be the best way to way to prevent a chlamydia infection, and this study has identified important new antigens which could be used as part of a vaccine to prevent or eliminate the damaging reproductive consequences of untreated infections.\"\n\nIn the research team's study, BD584 was able to reduce chlamydial shedding - a symptom of C. trachomatis - by 95 per cent. The antigen also decreased hydrosalpinx, another C. trachomatis symptom which involves fallopian tubes being blocked with serous fluids, by 87.5 per cent.\n\nThe results look very promising, said senior author James Mahony, a professor of Pathology and Molecular Medicine for McMaster's Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine and a researcher at St. Joseph Healthcare Hamilton's Research Institute where the work was performed.\n\nCo-author and McMaster PhD student, Steven Liang, explains, \"not only is the vaccine effective, it also has the potential to be widely protective against all C. trachomatis strains, including those that cause trachoma.\"\n\nTrachoma is an eye infection caused by chlamydia and is the leading cause of preventable blindness affecting millions of people in many resource-poor regions of the world.\n\n\"The vaccine would be administered through the nose.

Statins include widely used medications such as Crestor, Lipitor and Zocor.\n\n\"For high-risk people, those with heart disease or [who] have had a stroke who are taking a standard dose of a statin, further reduction in LDL cholesterol will give them extra benefit,\" said Dr. Colin Baigent of the Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit at University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, who was involved in both studies. This applied even if the patients already had low levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or \"bad\") cholesterol, he noted.\n\nThe reports are published in the Nov. 9 online edition of The Lancet.\n\nIn the first study, researchers at Oxford and the University of Sydney in Australia collected data from studies on 170,000 patients who took part in 26 trials. This type of review, called a meta-analysis, gathers data from various studies to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nAmong these trials, five compared high doses of statins with regular doses and the other 21 studies compared people taking statins with people not taking the drugs.\n\nThe researchers found that in trials comparing statin doses, taking high-dose statins reduced the odds of having a stroke by an additional 15 percent, compared to the usual doses of statins.\n\nSpecifically, there was a 13 percent reduction in heart-related death or heart attack, a 19 percent reduction in the need for a new heart operation and a 16 percent reduction in stroke, the researchers found.\n\nWhen they did an updated analysis of the 21 trials, first major cardiovascular events (such as heart attack and stroke) were lowered by a \"highly significant\" 22 percent for a 1.07 millimole per liter (mmol/L) reduction of LDL cholesterol.\n\nTaking all 26 trials together, deaths were reduced by 10 percent for 1 mmol/L in reduction of LDL cholesterol, with no significant effect on deaths from stroke or other vascular causes.\n\nIn addition, there were no significant effects of statins on deaths due to cancer or other non-vascular causes, and no excess risk of cancer, even at low LDL cholesterol concentrations.\n\nThe second study is a randomized trial called the Study of the Effectiveness of Additional Reductions in Cholesterol and Homocysteine (SEARCH), led by professor Jane Armitage, also a scientist at the CTSU in Oxford.\n\nThis trial looked at the benefits of statin therapy with 80 milligrams (mg) versus 20 mg simvastatin (Zocor) among 12,000 heart attack survivors.\n\nThe study was supported by a grant from Merck (manufacturer of the simvastatin).\n\nOver almost seven years of follow-up, those taking the higher dose statin had greater reductions in LDL cholesterol compared with those taking the lower dose.\n\nThe reduction in LDL cholesterol from the higher dose ended up decreasing the risk of a major cardiac event by 6 percent, the researchers found, although the statistic in itself was not clinically significant.\n\nThe researchers noted that the higher dose of Zocor (simvastatin) did result in a risk of a muscle disease 10 times higher than that associated with the lower dose. The muscle disease, known as myopathy, can cause pain, weakness, and in its rare but most severe form, destruction of the muscle tissue leading to kidney failure. Researchers found that two cases of myopathy occurred with the low dose and 53 cases with the higher dose.\n\nResearchers also found that rhabdomyolysis -- the most severe form of the muscle disease associated with statins -- was diagnosed in seven participants given 80 mg of Zocor (simvastatin), compared to none who were given 20 mg of simvastatin. Two died within a few weeks of developing the disorder, with one cause of death mentioning the muscle disorder as a contributing factor.\n\nResearchers also found that seven participants had creatine kinase levels higher than 40 times the upper limit of normal -- a possible indicator of kidney damage. For this reason, they noted that the incidence of severe muscle disease on 80 mg of Zocor might be an \"underestimate.\"\n\nBaigent noted this side effect is one associated with Zocor, but taking lower doses of other, more powerful statins may alleviate the problem. \"There are newer ways of increasing LDL cholesterol reduction by using the newer, more potent statins such a Lipitor or Crestor,\" he said. (All statins carry the risk of myopathy, but lower dosages are associated with a reduced risk.)\n\nBernard M.Y. Cheung, from the University of Hong Kong and coauthor of an accompanying journal editorial, said that \"people who are at risk from heart attacks and strokes should have their LDL-cholesterol lowered intensively.\"\n\nTheir doctors should consider prescribing a statin, either at a high dose or using a more powerful statin, he said.\n\n\"If you are at risk from a heart attack or stroke, either because you have had these conditions before or because you have the risk factors for them, you should be considered for intensive treatment to lower the LDL cholesterol,\" Cheung said.\n\n\"If your blood cholesterol is raised but you do not have other risk factors for heart disease and stroke, then your doctor may well decide that you do not need to take any drugs to lower cholesterol,\" he said. \"But if you are at risk from those diseases, you would need intensive treatment to lower LDL cholesterol, even if your LDL cholesterol level is not very high,\" he added.\n\nCommenting on the studies, Dr. Gregg Fonarow, American Heart Association spokesman and professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that \"despite the proven benefits of LDL cholesterol-lowering with statin therapy, many physicians have been reluctant to prescribe and patients reluctant to take higher doses of more potent statin medications due to concerns about side effects or safety.\"\n\nLowering LDL cholesterol by 50 to 60 percent with potent statins such as atorvastatin at 80 mg or rosuvastatin at 20 to 40 mg lowers the risk of major cardiovascular events by 50 to 60 percent, he said.\n\n\"Most patients tolerate higher doses of more potent statins equally well as lower doses of less potent statins,\" Fonarow said. \"Millions of patients with or at high risk of cardiovascular disease, who would derive additional cardiovascular protection from higher doses of more potent statins, are not currently treated with these agents.

While the researchers saw improvements in all participants who added some physical activity to their routine, those who got more exercise saw greater changes. The work is part of the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study.\n\n\"These are people who want to live healthy, independent lives and are at risk for losing that. Maintaining functional independence for older adults is an important public health issue. In our first LIFE study, we confirmed that regular exercise can help improve physical function and prevent mobility loss. Now we see that small increases can have big impacts,\" said first and corresponding author Roger A. Fielding, senior scientist and director of the Nutrition, Exercise Physiology, and Sarcopenia Laboratory at the USDA HNRCA.\n\nFor the LIFE study, the researchers analyzed data from 1,635 men and women age 70-89 over an average of 2.6 years. Half were randomly assigned to a program of walking and walking-based strength, flexibility and balance training; half participated in health education workshops. All had low levels of physical functioning at the start and reported fewer than 20 minutes per week of regular physical activity in the month prior to starting the study. Participants were evaluated at baseline, six, 12, and 24 months. The researchers relied on movement monitors and self-reporting to measure physical activity outside study sessions.\n\nChanges in activity were significantly greater in the physical activity intervention group than the health education group from baseline through 24 months. There was a continuous, graded effect with the greatest benefits seen in the participants who engaged in at least 48 minutes of physical activity per week. The greater differences were also associated with prevention of major mobility loss.\n\n\"Our goal was to have participants walking up to 150 minutes per week. To see benefits at 48 minutes is encouraging. We wanted the physical activity sessions to include exercise that participants could do outside of the study, and we hope that learning of these results might motivate others to try to make safe, incremental changes to their activity levels. Reducing muscle loss, functional decline, and loss of independence are important to anyone, at any age, and at any physical ability,\" said Fielding.\n\nThe researchers acknowledge limitations of this study, including examining the different quantities of exercise participation achieved in the LIFE study participants and not specifically prescribing different amounts of exercise to different study groups. In addition, there were differences in the measured absolute amounts of exercise performed when comparing objective activity monitoring using a wearable \"device\" and self-report of physical activity.\n\nAdditional authors on this study are Jack M.

Tufts research scientists work with federal agencies to establish the Dietary Guidelines, the Dietary Reference Intakes, and other significant public policies. The Gerald J. and Dorothy R. Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University is the only independent school of nutrition in the United States. The school's eight degree programs,\u00ac which focus on questions relating to nutrition and chronic diseases, molecular nutrition, agriculture and sustainability, food security, humanitarian assistance, public health nutrition, and food policy and economics\u00ac are renowned for applying scientific research to national and international policy.", "question": "Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The release noted what was novel about the research\u2019s endpoint/conclusion: the \u201cdose\u201d response and the search for a \u201cminimum\u201d level of activity that would confer benefit.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Evidence suggests it may not only be good for mind and body, but also for a long life\n\nThe consensus--one of the first of its kind--comes on the eve of the Ryder Cup, the biennial golf tournament between Europe and the US.\n\nAmid a growing body of evidence on the health impacts of the sport, the consensus aims to help current and would-be players maximise the health pros and minimise the health cons of golf, and to guide policy-makers and industry leaders on how best to make golf more inclusive and accessible and so encourage more people from all walks of life to take up the sport.\n\nThe statement draws on a systematic review of the available published evidence (342 eligible studies) and discussions among an international working group of 25 experts in public health and health policy, and industry leaders.\n\nAgreement was reached on 79 statements in three areas. These set out what is currently known about golf's associations with health; the factors that may help or hinder take-up of the sport; and a series of recommendations for golfers, industry leaders, and policy makers on how best to maximise its health benefits, promote sustainability, and widen participation.\n\nThe evidence shows that playing golf regularly is associated with longevity and reducing the risk factors for heart disease/stroke. And it can boost older people's strength and balance.\n\nThe sport is also associated with good mental health and improving the overall health of those with disabilities.\n\nCompared with other sports, the risk of injury is moderate, but as it's an outdoor activity, golfers may be more at risk of skin cancer.\n\nGolf is sociable, and gets people outdoors, connecting with nature. It can provide moderate intensity aerobic physical activity, and its health benefits are greatest for players (and spectators) who walk round the course rather than opt for a golf cart.\n\nWhile around 60 million people play golf at least twice every year, the participant profile is quite narrow: players tend to be middle aged to older, male, of white European heritage, relatively well off, and living in North America, Europe, and Australasia.\n\nAnd the sport is often perceived as expensive, male dominated, difficult to learn, and not a game for the young or those on the lower rungs of the social ladder.\n\nThis can put people off, says the statement. The sport needs to be more inclusive and welcoming of people from all walks of life and ethnic backgrounds, and any such initiatives should be supported, it says.\n\nMore people might be keen to take it up if golf were promoted as an enjoyable, lifelong outdoors activity that affords a sense of community and competitive challenge while providing some 'me time' as well as helping to fulfil recommended exercise quotas, says the statement.\n\nAnd the sport can do its bit for sustainability by \"practices that prioritise diversity, healthy societies, connection with, and care of, the environment, environmental integrity and health and wellbeing,\" the statement suggests.\n\nAmong its raft of recommendations, the consensus statement says that:\n\u2022 Should aim to play for 150 minutes/week, or do less, but couple golf with other physical activity, and walk the course rather than ride a golf cart\n\u2022 Do warm-up/strengthening exercises to cut the risk of injury and use sun-cream and wear collared shirts/blouses to minimise the risk of skin cancer\n\u2022 Build on existing initiatives to promote inclusivity and develop environments and price structures that will be attractive to everyone\n\u2022 Develop a culture that will inspire more women and girls to play golf\n\u2022 Make every effort to promote equality and diversity, and boost accessibility\n\u2022 Promote sustainability through wildlife conservation and by restricting the use of water, energy, and pesticides\n\u2022 Provide additional facilities at clubs, such as a gym, walking routes, cr\u00e8ches and improve the focus on health and safety, with the provision of healthy foods, defibrillators, and speed limiters on golf carts, for example\n\u2022 Promote the benefits of regular physical activity, including golf, for people of all ages, genders, and income brackets\n\u2022 Work with industry and national associations to boost take up of the sport, particularly in groups where physical activity levels are low\n\u2022 Work with industry and regulatory bodies to get golf included in the Paralympics\n\n\"These outputs, if widely shared and adopted, will contribute to an improved understanding of golf and health, and aid these groups in making evidence-informed decisions and to improve health and wellbeing,\" the consensus statement concludes.", "question": "Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "This news release does not present golf as a novel form of exercise.

This independent, multicenter, blinded study is one of the first studies to validate that a liquid biopsy test can predict therapeutic response and demonstrate a survival benefit. The blood test called, Oncotype DX\u00ae AR-V7 Nucleus Detect\u2122 is commercially available in the U.S. through Epic Science's partnership with Genomic Health, Inc. (NASDAQ: GHDX). The research was published online today in JAMA Oncology.\n\n\"This liquid biopsy test addresses a critical unmet need at a decision point in management to predict and select the therapy that is most likely to extend a patient's life,\" said Howard Scher, M.D., who led the study and is the co-chair, Center for Mechanism Based Therapy and Head of the Biomarker Development Initiative at MSK. \"During the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer, physicians will now be able to use AR-V7 status to determine when a patient's cancer has become resistant to androgen receptor directed therapy and will respond better to chemotherapy, enabling the patient to live longer.\"\n\nThis blinded four-year study followed 142 mCRPC patients who were treated at MSK, The Royal Marsden, or the London Health Sciences Centre. Blood samples were obtained prior to treatment with ARSi therapy or chemotherapy and tested with a validated assay for the nuclear-localized androgen receptor splice variant (AR-V7) protein in circulating tumor cells. The results were that patients positive for AR-V7 who were treated with taxane-based chemotherapy had superior overall survival (OS) relative to those treated with ARSI therapy (median OS, 14.3 vs. 7.3 months). Importantly, patients negative for AR-V7 who were treated with ARSi therapy had superior OS relative to those treated with taxanes (media OS, 19.8 vs. 12.8 months). Additionally, the authors validated the test within a prognostic risk group, to ensure that the biomarker effect was due to the biomarker rather than other clinical variables.\n\n\"We developed this test specifically to address a significant clinical question in metastatic prostate cancer that previously had no clear answer: which treatment should be pursued next? This question weighs heavily on doctors and patients, but now, with the Oncotype DX AR-V7 test, we can provide them the confidence to know whether continuing with hormonal therapy or switching to chemotherapy will result in better survival outcomes,\" said Ryan Dittamore, chief of medical innovation at Epic Sciences and a co-author on the study. \"In addition, the survival benefit gained through the utilization of our AR-V7 test could make the test as valuable to a patient's outcome as a blockbuster cancer drug.\"\n\nThis is the second blinded, multi-center clinical utility validation study utilizing the nuclear-localized AR-V7 test. Earlier this month, Dr. Andrew Armstrong of Duke Cancer Institute presented data validating the test in the PROPHECY clinical trial at the ASCO 2018 Annual Meeting. The PROPHECY study investigated the AR-V7 test in patients receiving ARSi therapy and demonstrated that patients who tested positive had worse survival by all measures and had no clinical benefit from ARSi therapy.\n\nIn March of this year, based upon earlier studies utilizing the test, Palmetto GBA, a Medicare Administrative Contractor that assesses molecular diagnostic technologies, issued a draft local coverage determination (LCD) for the Oncotype DX\u00ae AR-V7 Nucleus Detect\u2122 test. A full LCD for the test is expected in the upcoming months and would support Medicare reimbursement for applicable patients considering ARSI or taxane therapies. It is estimated that 50,000 patients a year may be eligible for and benefit from the Oncotype DX\u00ae AR-V7 Nucleus Detect\u2122 test.\n\nThe paper is entitled, \"Assessment of the Validity of Nuclear-Localized Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 in Circulating Tumor Cells as a Predictive Biomarker for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.\"\n\nAbout the Oncotype DX\u00ae AR-V7 Nucleus Detect\u2122 Test\n\nDesigned by Epic Sciences and based on results from multiple studies led by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the Oncotype DX\u00ae AR-V7 Nucleus Detect\u2122 test is the first and only liquid biopsy test of its kind that can potentially prolong the lives of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) by helping their physician identify the most effective treatment. Through a blood draw, the test detects AR-V7 protein in the nucleus of circulating tumor cells utilizing Epic Sciences' No Cell Left Behind\u00ae platform to accurately identify patients who are resistant to androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapies and who should instead switch to chemotherapy.

Not so in the United States, however, where officially it can be sold only for research purposes.\n\nPiracetam is well studied and is credited by its users with boosting their memory, sharpening their focus, heightening their immune system, even bettering their personalities.

All are available online, where their efficacy and safety are debated and reviewed on message boards and in podcasts.\n\nA number of companies now market nootropic \u201cstacks,\u201d or formulas, some of which include piracetam, herbal remedies, amino acids and citicoline, a naturally occurring brain chemical that can be taken orally as a supplement, intravenously or as a shot.\n\nBecause they are sold as nutritional supplements and natural products that refrain from making health claims, they avoid close government scrutiny.\n\nWhen Burke began ordering piracetam online five years ago, it arrived in baggies filled with white powder. \u201cIt was as if I was buying coke off the street,\u201d he recalls. These days, he buys his stack from Nootroo, a San Francisco company.\n\nBut self-experimenters such as Burke often don\u2019t restrict themselves to medication alone. Dedicated brain hackers, as they call themselves, are willing to exploit their own biology to try to sharpen their mind. Their methods include meditation, cold-water plunges, periodic fasting and high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets.\n\n\u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to maximize their cognitive ability? Who doesn\u2019t want to maximize their muscle mass?\u201d asks Murali Doraiswamy, who has led several trials of cognitive enhancers at Duke University Health System and has been an adviser to pharmaceutical and supplement manufacturers as well as the Food and Drug Administration. He attributes the demand to an increasingly knowledge-based society that values mental quickness and agility above all else.\n\nBut while some studies have found short-term benefits, Doraiswamy says there is no evidence that what are commonly known as smart drugs \u2014 of any type \u2014 improve thinking or productivity over the long run. \u201cThere\u2019s a sizable demand, but the hype around efficacy far exceeds available evidence,\u201d notes Doraiswamy, adding that, for healthy young people such as Silicon Valley go-getters, \u201cit\u2019s a zero-sum game. That\u2019s because when you up one circuit in the brain, you\u2019re probably impairing another system.\u201d\n\nEarly studies attributed a lot of short-term benefits to nootropics \u2014 so much so that in 1983, Russian scientists turned to phenylpiracetam to boost the physical and mental performance of cosmonauts during space flight.\n\nA 1999 study found that piracetam had beneficial effects on the hippocampal membranes of patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The hippocampus, an area of the brain that plays a key role in the formation of new memories, typically shows severe shrinkage with Alzheimer\u2019s. The idea that piracetam might reverse that effect was exciting.\n\nAlthough piracetam has a history of \u201crelatively few side effects,\u201d it has fallen far short of its initial promise for treating any of the illnesses associated with cognitive decline, according to Lon Schneider, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California. \u201cWe don\u2019t use it at all and never have.\u201d\n\nAs for newer nootropic drugs, there are unknown risks. \u201cPiracetam has been studied for decades,\u201d says cognitive neuroscientist Andrew Hill, the founder of a neurofeedback company in Los Angeles called Peak Brain Institute. But \u201csome of [the newer] compounds are things that some random editor found in a scientific article, copied the formula down and sent it to China and had a bulk powder developed three months later that they\u2019re selling. Please don\u2019t take it, people!\u201d\n\nFor Burke and other brain hackers, the evidence for nootropics is strong enough.\n\nBurke, who begins each morning with a Bulletproof coffee \u2014 a rich brew of caffeine with dollops of butter and coconut oil \u2014 has created a San Francisco meetup group called Peak Performance \u201cto teach all my friends in the tech space about life hacks so they can kick a--better every day.\u201d\n\nLast spring, 100 people showed up at a Peak Performance event where psychedelic psychologist James Fadiman said the key to unleashing the cognition-enhancing effects of LSD \u2014 which he listed as less anxiety, better focus, improved sleep, greater creativity \u2014 was all in the dosage. He recommended a tenth of a \u201cparty dose\u201d \u2014 enough to give you \u201cthe glow\u201d and enhance your cognitive powers without \u201cthe trip.\u201d\n\nBurke says he definitely got the glow. \u201cThe first time I took it, I was working on a business plan. I had to juggle multiple contingencies in my head, and for some reason a tree with branches jumped into my head. I was able to place each contingency on a branch, retract and go back to the trunk, and in this visual way I was able to juggle more information.\u201d\n\nNot all brain hacking involves taking a pill, though.\n\nNootrobox, a San Francisco company that markets a nootropic mix of vitamins, minerals and amino acids, promotes fasting as a way to energize brain and body.\n\n\u201cWe stumbled upon fasting as a way to optimize cognition and make yourself into a more efficient human being,\u201d says Manuel Lam, an internal medicine physician who advises Nootrobox on clinical issues. He and members of the company\u2019s executive team have implanted glucose monitors in their arms \u2014 not because they fear diabetes but because they wish to track the real-time effect of the foods they eat.\n\n\u201cFasting forces your body to deplete its glucose storage and trains it to look inside for fuel,\u201d Lam enthuses. \u201cIt\u2019s like being strapped to a solar panel. The sun is always shining on you.\u201d\n\nNootrobox employees are encouraged to fast every Tuesday, then meet for breakfast on Wednesday at a local diner. Founded by two Stanford University computer graduates, the company has initiated an international fasting group on Facebook; at last count, there were 3,500 members.\n\nResearch on animals has shown that intermittent fasting \u2014 limiting caloric intake at least two days a week \u2014 can help improve neural connections in the hippocampus and protect against the accumulation of plaque, a protein prevalent in the brains of people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Research has also shown that intermittent fasting helped reduce anxiety in mice.\n\nMark Mattson, chief of the Laboratory of Neurosciences at the National Institute on Aging, has overseen a lot of the animal studies on fasting and is impressed with the evidence \u2014 so much so that he has personally adopted a regimen of intermittent fasting.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s pretty conclusive evidence from animal studies that intermittent fasting is beneficial for brain function and resistance to aging from neurogenerative diseases,\u201d he says.\n\nFasting has been deployed since the ancient Greeks to fast-track learning. As Plato is said to have stated, \u201cI fast for greater physical and mental efficiency.\u201d The philosopher Pythagoras reportedly demanded that his students fast 40 days before attending his lectures.\n\nFar easier to take a pill.\n\nLooking for an edge\n\nVinh Ngo, a San Francisco family practice doctor who specializes in hormone therapy, has become familiar with piracetam and other nootropics through a changing patient base. His office is located in the heart of the city\u2019s tech boom and he is increasingly sought out by young, male tech workers who tell him they are interested in cognitive enhancement.\n\nNgo has experimented with piracetam himself (\u201cThe first time I tried it, I thought, \u2018Wow, this is pretty strong for a supplement.\u2019 I had a little bit of reflux, heartburn, but in general it was a cognitive enhancer. . . . I found it helpful\u201d) and the neurotransmitter DMEA (\u201cYou have an idea, it helps you finish the thought. It\u2019s for when people have difficulty finishing that last connection in the brain\u201d).\n\nBut he has also seen patients whose propensity for self-experimentation to improve cognition got out of hand. One chief executive he treated, Ngo said, developed an unhealthy predilection for albuterol, because he felt the asthma inhaler medicine kept him alert and productive long after others had quit working. Unfortunately, the drug ended up severely imbalancing his electrolytes, which can lead to dehydration, headaches, vision and cardiac problems, muscle contractions and, in extreme cases, seizures.\n\n\u201cThere is that culture here [in Silicon Valley] that relies on being smarter than your own self,\u201d Ngo says. \u201cPeople want to find an edge over their competitor \u2014 that\u2019s how they got their position in the first place. I\u2019m trying to give them a little more wiggle room \u2014 but in a safe way.\u201d\n\nHe says he screens his patients for addiction and cardiovascular problems and creates individual treatment plans based on their health histories and blood tests.\n\nThere\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach. \u201cI don\u2019t have a rubber stamp for everyone, and not everyone is a candidate\u201d for cognitive enhancement, says Ngo, who requires that his patients sign waivers acknowledging possible health risks in taking nootropics.\n\nIf, for example, someone decides to go on medication \u2014 be it Adderall, albuterol or piracetam \u2014 the patient must understand that there is a risk for high blood pressure and heart problems.\n\n\u201cI want to empower them,\u201d Ngo says, but \u201cthere\u2019s a fine line between empowering them to make their own health decisions and staying healthy.\u201d\n\nSmart drugs are here.

While some people improve with customized diets that avoid certain foods that trigger symptoms, this approach doesn\u2019t help everyone and some emerging research suggests that the condition may also be influenced by processes in the brain.\n\nFor the current analysis, researchers examined data from 53 trials that compared the effects of antidepressants or psychotherapy, either alone or in combination, versus placebo treatments or \u201cusual management\u201d in people with IBS.\n\nRates of \u201cno relief\u201d were highest with placebo treatments. People were 34 percent less likely to have no relief from antidepressants and 31 percent less likely to get no relief from psychotherapy, the study found.\n\n\u201cOne component of IBS is increased sensitivity to the functions of the bowels; simply summarized, this means either the nerves taking messages from the bowel to the brain are more sensitive or that the brain is more attentive or reacts in a more emotional manner to the normal messages arising in the bowel, or both,\u201d said Dr. Michael Camilleri, a researcher at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science in Rochester, Minnesota, who wasn\u2019t involved in the current study.\n\n\u201cSince there are really no medications to reduce the nerve sensitivity, some doctors give medications that modulate the function of the brain in the hope that this approach will reduce the ability to sense or emotionally react to the signals or messages arriving from the bowels,\u201d Camilleri said by email.\n\nPsychiatric conditions including depression, anxiety, and somatisation - physical symptoms thought to have psychological origins - are common among people with IBS, researchers note in the American Journal of Gastroenterology.\n\nAlthough the use of antidepressants is common among IBS patients, psychotherapy is not, the study authors note.\n\nOne limitation of the current study is that the smaller studies used in the analysis had a wide variety of designs and methods for testing the success of treatment, researchers note. Another drawback is that these studies weren\u2019t designed to prove how antidepressants or psychotherapy might directly improve IBS symptoms.\n\nStill, a psychological evaluation may make sense for IBS patients because it\u2019s possible their symptoms might be a byproduct of untreated depression, said Dr. Agnieszka Kulak-Bejda, a psychiatry researcher at the Medical University of Bia\u0142ystok in Poland who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\nAntidepressants may work better for certain types of IBS, and the study findings also suggest that the type of medication may matter, Kulak-Bejda said by email.\n\nA family of medicines known as tricyclic antidepressants were more effective at relieving global symptoms of IBS, the analysis found.

He was not involved in the study.\n\nMost current clinical approaches are focused on managing problems, not addressing the root of the damage, he said.\n\n\"Many patients who have a heart attack will go on to suffer heart failure,\" he said. \"It's imperative to try and fix the root of the problem as quickly as possible.\"\n\nThe research, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, were part of a phase I study that set out to show safety. The trial has moved on to phase II, which is taking place in 50 hospitals in the United States, said Dr. Joshua Hare, director of the Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Institute at the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine and lead author of the study.\n\n\"We're looking on the time frame here of five years, in the best-case scenario, to have approved cardiac stem cell therapies,\" Hare said.\n\nCoronary heart disease, which causes heart attacks and angina -- chest pain resulting from the heart not getting enough blood -- is the leading cause of death in the United States, with nearly 450,000 in 2005, according to the American Heart Association. About 1.1 million people have attacks occur in the United States each year, according to the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute.\n\nThe particular kind of cells used in this research are called mesenchymal stem cells, and come from adults, not embryos.\n\nThe researchers are using a mesenchymal stem cell therapy that is marketed by Osiris Therapeutics Inc. under the name Prochymal. The drug, which consists of stem cells from donor bone marrow, gets injected into the vein. The cells then travel through the bloodstream and take up residence in the heart.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells have some natural homing capability, and injury serves as a homing beacon for them, Karp said.\n\nThe stem cells reduce the amount of scar tissue and increase the pumping strength of the heart in heart attack patients, Hare said. To a limited extent, they also grow new heart muscle.\n\nThe phase I results from 53 patients are not definitive proof that the treatment is effective, but do suggest so, Hare said. In accordance with clinical trial regulations set by the Food and Drug Administration, phase I is meant to show safety, while phase II and phase III trials are done on a larger group of subjects and evaluate how well the drug works.\n\nIn this trial, patients' doses ranged from 35 million cells to 350 million cells. There was no change or increase in side effects in treatments getting higher doses of cells, but it seemed that the treatment was more effective -- at least in terms of reducing electrical problems -- in the high dose group, he said.\n\nIn separate trials, researchers are looking at how the technique works in patients who have had heart attacks many month or years in the past, Hare said.\n\nThe study shows the results of a six-month follow-up with patients in 2007, and researchers are presently working with data from the two-year follow-up.\n\nMore broadly, besides bone marrow transplantations, there have not been any major successes in the stem cell field in terms of helping large numbers of patients, Karp said.\n\n\"Mesenchymal stem cells are poised to really be the next major success in cell therapy that could be used to treat tens of thousands of patients,\" he said.\n\nThere are several advantages to using mesenchymal stem cells for heart therapy. First, they are adult stem cells, so there are no ethical issues that surround research on embryonic stem cells. Secondly, at least from a safety perspective, mesenchymal stem cells do not require matching -- any donor can give cells to any other donor, and no immunosuppresant drugs are necessary, he said.\n\nStill, millions of cells are required in order for enough stem cells to reach the heart and have a therapeutic benefit, and it's costly to get the required numbers of cells for each patient, Karp said. An area of improvement would be making the stem cell treatment more efficient, he said.\n\n\"If we could increase the number of cells that could reach the heart, that would have significant advantages to this approach,\" Karp said.\n\nThis method of intravenous injection means that the procedure theoretically could be performed in a doctor's office or clinic, increasing the accesibility to patients, Karp said.\n\nA more invasive stem cell delivery technique has been showing positive results in other clinical trials, involving injecting patients' own stem cells directly into heart muscle.\n\nThe largest national stem cell study for heart disease, sponsored by Baxter Inc., uses this surgical method, and recently announced success in a 12-month phase II trial for patients with severe angina. Researchers found that participants had less pain and an improved ability to walk.\n\nBecause stem cells are delivered through a catheter in this method, there is a risk of perforation of about 1 percent, Dr. Douglas Losordo, cardiologist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, told CNN earlier this year. The drug, GCSF, which mobilizes stem cells, also carries a small risk of blood clotting.\n\nFor the Osiris trials, further research is ongoing determine whether patients would benefit more from more infusions of the stem cells, or if it's better for the stem cells to come from their own bodies instead of from a donor, Hare said.\n\nWhile there's less chance of a person's body rejecting his or her own stem cells than from a donor, there is a time delay, he said. Taking bone marrow and amplifying the stem cells in it could take up to five weeks, whereas donor cells could be made readily available, he said. On the other hand, it is unclear whether a donor could potentially transmit a disease to the recipient in the process.\n\nIf you are interested in enrolling in a clinical trial, you can find one at clinicaltrials.gov.

In this context, Sylentis has participated at this event presenting the pre-clinical and clinical results of various compounds that are being developed for the treatment of ocular disorders. Among these, the abstract \"Tivanisiran a new treatment for Dry Eye Disease, that improved signs and symptoms in clinical trials\" (Posterboard number: 925 - B0103) is highlighted, the compound improving the ocular inflammatory parameters, tear quality and a reduction in ocular pain associated with dry eye disease is also underlined1.\n\nThe novel mechanism of action of tivanisiran, based on genetic silencing through RNA interference (RNAi), is targeted at the treatment of the signs and symptoms of this pathology, making it a firm candidate for the treatment of dry eye disease.\n\nAccording to Ana Isabel Jim\u00e9nez, Director of R&D at Sylentis, \"we trust in our technology, innovative in this field, and we hope that tivanisiran will soon become a real alternative for the treatment of millions of people that suffer dry eye disease around the world.\"\n\nIn this respect, Jim\u00e9nez points out that \"this is a significant step forward in the development of innovative drugs in different therapeutic areas through a novel technology of genetic silencing based on the RNA.\"\n\nSylentis is a pioneer in RNAi research, and is one of the few in Europe that applies this technology to the field of ophthalmology. It also continues with its research on new therapies for ophthalmological and inflammatory illnesses.\n\nIt must be empathized that this pathology affects more than 5 million in Spain, between 10% and 20% of the population, mostly women, and almost 100% of these being elderly , . In this context, the phase III \"Helix\" study is being carried out in more than 30 hospitals in Spain, Germany, Estonia, Portugal, Slovakia and Italy, in 300 patients to evaluate the efficacy of this compound in the treatment of the sign and symptoms of dry eye syndrome.\n\nTivanisiran is a drug based on RNAi that is administered as preservative-free eye drops; it selectively inhibits production of the transient receptor potential cation channel (TRPV1). These receptors are ion channels that mediate the transmission of ocular pain. Tivanisiran is a small synthetic double-stranded RNA oligonucleotide (siRNA) with a novel and highly selective mechanism of action. Non-clinical studies conducted by Sylentis with SYL1001 have demonstrated it has high ability to inhibit this specific target and block the perception of ocular pain in animals3.\n\nTivanisiran is a product under development for the treatment of signs and symptoms related to dry eye syndrome and has the potential to be developed for other pathologies that cause ocular pain (corneal lesions, refractive surgery, etc.) , , .\n\nRNA interference (RNAi) is a natural cellular process that regulates the expression of certain genes, providing a role in innate defense and development in animals and plants. This process is used to specifically silence genetic transcripts that encode protein-causing diseases. The therapeutic application of targeted siRNAs is booming given the specificity of gene silencing for a particular protein in a given tissue and the lack of side effects. This new approach to drug discovery is a promising technology that is rapidly moving in the translational research space , .\n\nDry eye syndrome is a multifactorial disease of the tear film and ocular surface that produces symptoms of ocular discomfort, eyesight disorders, and tear film instability with potential damage to the ocular surface. Dry eye syndrome is accompanied by such symptoms as ocular pain, itching, stinging, and irritation of the eye tissues. It is a characteristic disease of developed countries, associated with pollution, air conditioning, the use of contact lenses, refractive surgery and continued use of computers. Moreover, the amount and quality of tears decrease with age. Prevalence is between 10% and 20% among people aged 50 or over, and it is more frequent in womeni,ii.\n\nDry eye can be treated with cyclosporin drops or autologous serum, but there is as yet no specific product for chronic treatment of the ocular pain related to dry eye syndrome; oral analgesics or anaesthetics are used in general. However, the main treatment consists of artificial tears, in the form of drops, gel or creams. Preservative-free eye drops have generally been found to offer the best long-term response.\n\nSylentis, a company of PharmaMar (MSE:PHM), is a biotechnology company fully owned that develops innovative therapies harnessing the technology of post-transcriptional gene silencing or RNA interference (RNAi). Sylentis has developed an approach to efficiently design RNAi-based therapeutics that can be used to silence numerous disease-causing genes. We currently have a robust therapeutic program in ophthalmology with two candidates under development in Phase II and III studies for glaucoma (bamosiran) and ocular pain (SYL1001) , respectively.

But many sufferers ultimately go blind.\n\nIn 2013, the FDA approved an artificial retina that could help restore limited vision to people with degenerative eye diseases. But the device relied on a sunglass-mounted external camera and a transmitter that relayed sight information to the retinal implant.\n\nNow researchers at the Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa and the University of California, San Diego have crafted artificial retinas that can be implanted entirely inside the eye, which offer hope to those with macular degeneration.\n\nThe devices are only experimental prototypes with many years of additional research and development likely before they might be ready for commercial use. But Dr. Grazia Pertile, director of ophthalmology at the Sacred Heart Don Calabria in Negrar, Italy and one of the Italian researchers, said in a written statement that her team's device could be \u201ca turning point in the treatment of extremely debilitating retinal diseases.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s not alone in that assessment.\n\n\u201cThis is definitely a game changer,\u201d Dr. Kapil Bharti, an investigator at the National Eye Institute in Bethesda, Maryland who is not involved with the research, says. \u201cPrevious versions of these work in a very, very low-resolution range. Patients were practically still blind and incapacitated as far as everyday tasks were concerned. These promise that patients could become more independent.\u201d\n\nWhen healthy, retinal cells transmit visual information to the brain. As these cells die off, AMD sufferers lose their central vision. The new prosthesis is designed to be implanted onto the back wall of the eye, where it absorbs light and transforms it into an electrical signal that stimulates the still-active retinal cells to restore vision.\n\nRelated: This Revolutionary Gene-Editing Tool Could Change the World\n\nWhen the prosthesis was tested in rats, the animals' pupils constricted in response to exposure to light. The researchers were unable to determine how well the rats were able to see, if at all, but they noted that the animals\u2019 eyes continued to react to light more than six months after the implant was installed.\n\n\"We hope to replicate in humans the excellent results obtained in animal models,\" Pertile said. The team will conduct human trials later this year.\n\nThe findings were published in the journal Nature Materials.\n\nThe researchers in San Diego have taken a different approach to solving AMD that they think can restore vision to resolutions as sharp as a healthy eye.\n\nThere, engineers have partnered with Nanovision Biosciences Inc. to create a retinal implant that uses silicon nanowires smaller than the width of a cell to sense light entering the eye and stimulate retinal neurons. Powered by a small wireless device, this circular array of nanowires mimics densely packed retinal cells to help achieve \"functional vision,\" says Gabriel A. Silva, professor of bioengineering and ophthalmology at UC San Diego.\n\n\u201cWe want to create a new class of devices with drastically improved capabilities to help people with impaired vision,\u201d Silva said.\n\nThe findings were reported in the Journal of Neural Engineering.\n\nNeither of the implants is able to restore color to vision yet, and Bharti has questions about the durability of organic eye implants.

Pestikas struggled with depression and anxiety and made several suicide attempts before starting ketamine treatments earlier in the year. (AP Photo/Teresa Crawford)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 It was launched decades ago as an anesthetic for animals and people, became a potent battlefield pain reliever in Vietnam and morphed into the trippy club drug Special K.\n\nNow the chameleon drug ketamine is finding new life as an unapproved treatment for depression and suicidal behavior. Clinics have opened around the United States promising instant relief with their \u201cunique\u201d doses of ketamine in IVs, sprays or pills. And desperate patients are shelling out thousands of dollars for treatment often not covered by health insurance, with scant evidence on long-term benefits and risks.\n\nChicago preschool teacher Lauren Pestikas long struggled with depression and anxiety and made several suicide attempts before trying ketamine earlier this year.\n\nThe price tag so far is about $3,000, but \u201cit\u2019s worth every dime and penny,\u201d said the 36-year-old.\n\nPestikas said she feels much better for a few weeks after each treatment, but the effects wear off and she scrambles to find a way to pay for another one.\n\nFor now, ketamine has not received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating depression, though doctors can use it for that purpose.\n\nKetamine has been around since the 1960s and is widely used as an anesthesia drug during surgery because it doesn\u2019t suppress breathing. Compared to opioids such as morphine, ketamine isn\u2019t as addictive and doesn\u2019t cause breathing problems. And some studies have shown that ketamine can ease symptoms within hours for the toughest cases.\n\nIts potential effects on depression were discovered in animal experiments in the late 1980s and early 1990s showing that glutamate, a brain chemical messenger, might play a role in depression, and that drugs including ketamine that target the glutamate pathway might work as antidepressants.\n\nConventional antidepressants like Prozac target serotonin, a different chemical messenger, and typically take weeks to months to kick in \u2014 a lag that can cause severely depressed patients to sink deeper into despair.\n\nKetamine\u2019s potential for almost immediate if temporary relief is what makes it so exciting, said Dr. Jennifer Vande Voort, a Mayo Clinic psychiatrist who has used ketamine to treat depression patients since February.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of things that provide that kind of effect. What I worry about is that it gets so hyped up,\u201d she said.\n\nThe strongest studies suggest it\u2019s most useful and generally safe in providing short-term help for patients who have not benefited from antidepressants. That amounts to about one-third of the roughly 300 million people with depression worldwide.\n\n\u201cIt truly has revolutionized the field,\u201d changing scientists\u2019 views on how depression affects the brain and showing that rapid relief is possible, said Yale University psychiatrist Dr. Gerard Sanacora, who has done research for or consulted with companies seeking to develop ketamine-based drugs.\n\nBut to become standard depression treatment, he said, much more needs to be known.\n\nLast year, Sanacora co-authored an American Psychiatric Association task force review of ketamine treatment for mood disorders that noted the benefits but said \u201cmajor gaps\u201d remain in knowledge about long-term effectiveness and safety. Most studies have been small, done in research settings and not in the real world.\n\nWhen delivered through an IV, ketamine can cause a rapid increase in heart rate and blood pressure that could be dangerous for some patients. Ketamine also can cause hallucinations that some patients find scary.\n\n\u201cThere are some very real concerns,\u201d Sanacora said. \u201cWe do know this drug can be abused, so we have to be very careful about how this is developed.\u201d\n\nDr. Rahul Khare, an emergency medicine specialist in Chicago, first learned about ketamine\u2019s other potential benefits a decade ago from a depressed and anxious patient he was preparing to sedate to fix a repeat dislocated shoulder.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Doc, give me what I got last time. For about three weeks after I got it I felt so much better,\u2019\u201d Khare recalled.\n\nKhare became intrigued and earlier this year began offering ketamine for severe depression at an outpatient clinic he opened a few years ago. He also joined the American Society for Ketamine Physicians, formed a year ago representing about 140 U.S. doctors, nurses, psychologists and others using ketamine for depression or other nonapproved uses.\n\nThere are about 150 U.S. ketamine clinics, compared with about 20 three years ago, said society co-founder Dr. Megan Oxley.\n\nKhare said the burgeoning field \u201cis like a new frontier\u201d where doctors gather at meetings and compare notes. He has treated about 50 patients with depression including Pestikas. They\u2019re typically desperate for relief after failing to respond to other antidepressants. Some have lost jobs and relationships because of severe depression, and most find that ketamine allows them to function, Khare said.\n\nTypical treatment at his clinic involves six 45-minute sessions over about two weeks, costing $550 each. Some insurers will pay about half of that, covering Khare\u2019s office visit cost. Patients can receive \u201cbooster\u201d treatments. They must sign a four-page consent form that says benefits may not be long-lasting, lists potential side effects, and in bold letters states that the treatment is not government-approved.\n\nAt a recent session, Pestikas\u2019s seventh, she leaned back on a reclining white examining-room chair as a nurse hooked her up to a heart and blood pressure monitor. She grimaced as a needle was slipped into the top of her left palm. Khare reached up with a syringe to inject a small dose of ketamine into an IV bag hanging above the chair, then dimmed the lights, pulled the window curtains and asked if she had questions and was feeling OK.\n\nPestikas listened to music on her iPhone and watched psychedelic videos. She said it was like \u201ca controlled acid trip\u201d with pleasant hallucinations. The trip ends soon after the IV is removed, but Pestikas said she feels calm and relaxed the rest of the day, and that the mood boost can last weeks.\n\nStudies suggest that a single IV dose of ketamine far smaller than used for sedation or partying can help many patients gain relief within about four hours and lasting nearly a week or so.\n\nExactly how ketamine works is unclear, but one idea is that by elevating glutamate levels, ketamine helps nerve cells re-establish connections that were disabled by depression, said ketamine expert Dr. Carlos Zarate, chief of experimental therapies at the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\nA small Stanford University study published in August suggested that ketamine may help relieve depression by activating the brain\u2019s opioid receptors.\n\nJanssen Pharmaceuticals and Allergan are among drug companies developing ketamine-like drugs for depression. Janssen leads the effort with its nasal spray esketamine. The company filed a new drug application in September.\n\nMeanwhile, dozens of studies are underway seeking to answer some of the unknowns about ketamine including whether repeat IV treatments work better for depression and if there\u2019s a way to zero in on which patients are most likely to benefit.\n\nUntil there are answers, Zarate of the mental health institute said ketamine should be a last-resort treatment for depression after other methods have failed.\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

In a recent research paper, published in the open access journal BioDiscovery, Dr. Madalene Heng, Clinical Professor of Dermatology at the David Geffen School of Medicine, stresses that use of topical curcumin gel for treating skin problems, like burns and scalds, is very different, and appears to work more effectively, when compared to taking curcumin tablets by mouth for other conditions.\n\n\"Curcumin gel appears to work much better when used on the skin because the gel preparation allows curcumin to penetrate the skin, inhibit phosphorylase kinase and reduce inflammation,\" explains Dr Heng.\n\nIn this report, use of curcumin after burns and scalds were found to reduce the severity of the injury, lessen pain and inflammation, and improve healing with less than expected scarring, or even no scarring, of the affected skin. Dr. Heng reports her experience using curcumin gel on such injuries using three examples of patients treated after burns and scalds, and provides a detailed explanation why topical curcumin may work on such injuries.\n\nCurcumin is an ingredient found in the common spice turmeric. Turmeric has been used as a spice for centuries in many Eastern countries and gives well known dishes, such as curry, their typical yellow-gold color. The spice has also been used for cosmetic and medical purposes for just as long in these countries.\n\nIn recent years, the medicinal value of curcumin has been the subject of intense scientific studies, with publication numbering in the thousands, looking into the possible beneficial effects of this natural product on many kinds of affliction in humans.\n\nThis study published reports that topical curcumin gel applied soon after mild to moderate burns and scalds appears to be remarkably effective in relieving symptoms and improved healing of the affected skin.\n\n\"When taken by mouth, curcumin is very poorly absorbed into the body, and may not work as well,\" notes Dr. Heng. \"Nonetheless, our tests have shown that when the substance is used in a topical gel, the effect is notable.\"\n\nThe author of the study believes that the effectiveness of curcumin gel on the skin - or topical curcumin - is related to its potent anti-inflammatory activity. Based on studies that she has done both in the laboratory and in patients over 25 years, the key to curcumin's effectiveness on burns and scalds is that it is a natural inhibitor of an enzyme called phosphorylase kinase.\n\nThis enzyme in humans has many important functions, including its involvement in wound healing. Wound healing is the vital process that enables healing of tissues after injury. The process goes through a sequence of acute and chronic inflammatory events, during which there is redness, swelling, pain and then healing, often with scarring in the case of burns and scalds of the skin. The sequence is started by the release of phosphorylase kinase about 5 mins after injury, which activates over 200 genes that are involved in wound healing.\n\nDr. Heng uses curcumin gel for burns, scalds and other skin conditions as complementary treatment, in addition to standard treatment usually recommended for such conditions.", "question": "Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "It\u2019s unclear from the news release how exactly this research is novel.

This book contains numerous before and after photographs \u2014 some of which were re-published in the recent BioDiscovery article.

On two separate occasions, 12 of the people took a dose of MDMA and then spoke for several hours with a pair of trained therapists. The others took a placebo but received the same therapy. (All of the participants received additional therapy sessions that did not involve the drug.)\n\nTwo months later, 10 of the 12 people who took MDMA had improved to the point where they no longer met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, and three participants whose condition had prevented them from holding down a job were able to return to work.\n\nBy contrast, just two of the eight people in the placebo group experienced a substantial improvement in their symptoms.\n\nMDMA is believed to raise levels of the feel-good brain chemical serotonin and the so-called \"bonding hormone,\" oxytocin. The resulting sense of euphoria and emotional warmth seems to help patients connect with their therapists, says Michael Mithoefer, M.D., the lead author of the study and a Mount Pleasant, South Carolina-based psychiatrist who specializes in PTSD.\n\n\"A lot of the time, people have quite painful and challenging experiences revisiting the trauma, and [MDMA] can help them do it without being overwhelmed or numbed out,\" he says.\n\nDon't try this experiment at home.

But for others, doctors may prescribe a more invasive treatment that involves injecting hyaluronic acid in to the knee, called viscosupplementation.\n\nNow, a new report questions the efficacy of this treatment for osteoarthritis in the knee.\n\nHyaluronic acid is a lubricating fluid that is naturally found in the knee, but degenerates over time in people with osteoarthritis. The effect of the injection used in viscosupplementation is to stimulate cells in the knee to increase production of hyaluronic acid.\n\n \n\n In a meta-analysis of 177 reports that included data on more than 12,000 patients with osteoarthritis in the knee, researchers at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine at the University of Bern in Switzerland concluded that the treatment \"has minimal benefits and potential for harm.\"\n\nThey write that \"because of increased risks for serious adverse events and local adverse events, the administration of these preparations should be discouraged.\"\n\nDr. John Richmond disagrees.

The researchers in Switzerland reviewed the existing studies and concluded that viscosupplementation was associated with an increase in these and other adverse events.\n\nDr. Richmond, who has independently reviewed the same research when the AAOS was drafting their recommendations to treat osteoarthritis of the knee, argues that despite infrequent instances of those side-effects, viscosupplementation remains a solid treatment choice for some patients.\n\n\"This is most effective in relatively younger patients, 40 to 50 to 60 year olds, and...in people with mild to moderate forms of the disease,\" says Richmond. \"This is not a first line treatment, but it's a reasonable treatment in those people who have been appropriately screened.\"\n\nThe authors of the study discourage patients from getting this treatment.

Longo tested the impact of fasting for five consecutive days every month, believing that when the body thinks it's in a state of fasting, it shuts down and goes into standby mode.\n\n\"As cells are killed and the body goes into standby, your stem cells switch on,\" says Longo. Once switched on, the stem cells can regenerate the lost cells and organ mass -- leaving you shiny and new.\n\nWhen cells in the body age, their ratios change and Longo believes the body's reaction -- and repair methods -- to fasting help restore them to when you were younger. \"You're killing the bad cells and regenerating with cells that are more functional.\"\n\nPeople consumed approximately 1000 calories on day one and 725 calories for the remaining four days, but these numbers alone didn't determine the benefit.\n\n\"It's not just about reducing calories\", says Longo. His diet is designed to include specific percentages of protein, fat and carbohydrates, for maximum effect. The food items used, however, were specific to the trial and if translated to the public would involve designing meals made up of the right combination of nutrients.\n\nAfter three months, the benefits were a reduction in body weight as well as certain risk factors for cardiovascular disease. There was also an increase in certain stem cells in the body.\n\n\"The diet is turning on the body's ability to renew itself,\" says Longo.\n\nThe team have since calculated that following the diet every three months could provide enough of an impact as effects are thought to last up to six months.\n\nHow does it work?\n\n\"When you fast, you lower protein and certain amino acids and you control pathways [in the body],\" says Longo. The pathways he refers to are known as TOR, PKA and IGF pathways, which when controlled can switch on certain reactions inside the body causing immune cells to die and organs to shrink.\n\nThis activation, or reduction, of pathways is why the components of the diet, such a proteins, must also be controlled. \"You won't activate the correct pathways,\" says Longo.\n\n\"When you make IGF less active, it reduces risk factors linked to diabetes and cardiovascular disease,\" says Miguel Toribio-Mateas, Chairman of the British Association for Applied Nutrition and Nutritional Therapy.\n\nAccording to Toribio-Mateas, the results confirm earlier theories that \"some hormone-like growth factors that are required during development to grow, then become promoting agents of aging after development and sexual maturity have been reached\". He also believes the benefits are down to improved efficiency on a cellular level.\n\n\"Cells have a list of things to do every day,...like getting rid of toxins\" says Toribio-Mateas. If their workload is then disrupted by the need to store excess calories, certain products can accumulate. \"Regulating calories can have a very positive effect,\" he says. To him, diet underpins longevity.\n\nUnlike the 5-2 diet, which requires two days of low calories at any point in the week, Longo's diet involves fasting for five consecutive days, which requires much more willpower.\n\n\"Five days is safe: going on for longer is difficult to do outside of a clinic,\" says Longo.\n\nMore work needs to be done to fine tune the diet and determine meals that meet the criteria. Longo has since founded his own nutrition company. L-Nutra, to sell products that serve this purpose, which may be seen as a conflict of interest. He states that profits are going back into funding further research by his team.\n\n\"The results of the study are encouraging and warrant more research in this area,\" says Toribio-Mateas.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The story makes a reference to something called the \u201c5-2\u201d fasting diet but is short on details.

Called ipilimumab, it unleashes an all-out immune system attack on cancer cells. At first, the injections caused only side-effects: widespread itching, fatigue, and diarrhea. Worse, Anderson says, \"I could feel the tumors getting bigger. They felt hot to me.\"\n\nThen after several months the tumors began to shrink. After one year, the once palpable tumors were no longer detectable in diagnostic scans.

The antibodies bind to a specific protein studding the surface of T cells, immune system cells that seek and destroy virus-infected and cancerous cells. The surface protein works like a switch, inactivating T cells after a few days to prevent the immune system from running amok and destroying healthy tissue. The antibodies temporarily jam the switch, allowing T cells to continue attacking cancer tissue for weeks or months \u2013 for as long as patients continue to receive injections of the engineered antibody.\n\nMore than 600 melanoma patients took part in the ipilimumab clinical trial at 125 cancer centers in 13 countries. All patients had inoperable cancers with widespread tumors after conventional treatment. Some patients received ipilimumab alone, others it combined with a cancer vaccine called gp100, and a third group received only the cancer vaccine.\n\nIpilimumab appeared to double survival compared with the gp100 vaccine alone. After one year, nearly half of patients given ipilimumab alone or in combination remained alive, compared with one quarter of patients given only the vaccine. After two years, 24 percent of patients treated with ipilimumab were alive, 22 percent of patients treated with the combination, while survival dropped to 14 percent among patients treated with the vaccine alone.\n\n\"Some of the people are now out 44 months and still remain free of disease,\" Urba says.\n\nSerious side effects also became clear. Nearly two-thirds of patients on ipilimumab experienced side effects caused by over-active immunity, such as severe itching, intestinal irritation and diarrhea. Researchers linked 14 deaths to the study drugs, half caused by immune-system reactions.\n\nStill, the study stands as \"a major landmark in cancer immunotherapy,\" says Dr. Bernard Fox, president of the International Society for Biological Therapy of Cancer. He says the results highlight the potential for using the same approach to treat other cancers. Already, early studies in patients with lung cancer and prostate cancer have produced positive, though inconclusive results.\n\n\"There is no reason it can't be applied to any of the common tumor types,\" Urba says. \"They all have antigens on their surface that T cells can recognize.\" Ongoing trials are testing ipilimumab with other cancer drugs, in different doses and against different cancers.\n\nDrug company Bristol-Myers Squibb told investors the drug could gain regulatory approval as early as next year and become available to cancer patients in 2012. Ipilimumab was developed by Medarex, a New Jersey company owned by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Other drug companies are at work on competing versions of the immune-enhancing antibody therapy.\n\nFor now, federal regulators have authorized\n\nto people who have serious or immediately life-threatening, inoperable melanoma that has spread, who have no alternative treatment options, and whose physicians believe the drug is appropriate.

Recommendations included cutting 500 calories a day, eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains by following the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet approach, and exercising at least three hours a week.\n\nIn addition, the researchers asked the participants questions about sleep time, depression, insomnia, screen time and stress.\n\nDuring this part of the trial, the participants lost an average of almost 14 pounds. The 60 percent of the participants who lost at least 10 pounds went on to take part in the next phase of the trial. Those in the second phase of the trial continued their diet and exercise program.\n\nElder's team found the right amount of sleep and stress reduction at the start of the trial predicted successful weight loss. Lower stress by itself predicted more weight loss during the first phase of the trial, they added.\n\nDeclines in stress and depression were also important in continuing to lose weight during both phases of the trial, as were exercise minutes and keeping food diaries, Elder's group found.\n\nDr. David L. Katz, director of the Prevention Research Center at Yale University School of Medicine, said that \"while we often tend to look at health one condition at a time, the reality is that health is best viewed holistically.\"\n\n\"People who are healthy and vital tend to be healthy and vital not because of any one factor, but because of many. And the factors that promote health -- eating well, being active, not smoking, sleeping enough, controlling stress, to name a few --promote all aspects of health,\" he added.\n\nThis study shows that people are more likely to lose weight when not impeded by sleep deprivation, stress or depression, he said.\n\n\"Anyone who has ever tried to lose weight probably could have said much the same from personal experience. Similarly, weight loss reduced stress and depression. This, too, is suggested by sense and common experience, as it is affirmed by the science reported here,\" Katz said.\n\nThe important message is that weight loss should not be looked at with tunnel vision, Katz said.\n\n\"Improving sleep may be as important to lasting weight control efforts as modifying diet or exercise. Managing stress is about physical health, as well as mental health. This study encourages weight loss in a more holistic context,\" he said.\n\nAnother study presented earlier this month at the American Heart Association scientific sessions held in Atlanta found that people of normal weight eat more when they sleep less.\n\nColumbia University researchers discovered that sleep-deprived adults ate almost 300 calories more a day on average than those who got enough sleep. And the extra calories mostly came from saturated fat, which can spell trouble for waistlines.\n\nThe researchers came to their conclusions -- which should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal -- after following 13 men and 13 women of normal weight. They monitored the eating habits of the participants as they spent six days sleeping four hours a night and then six days sleeping nine hours a night (or the reverse).\n\n\"If sustained, the dietary choices made by people undergoing short sleep could predispose them to obesity and increased risk of cardiovascular disease,\" the researchers wrote in an American Heart Association news release.\n\nFor more information on obesity, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The story was framed as taking a broader perspective when contemplating weight loss and including other lifestyle factors which can affect food intake and exercise.\u00a0 Better than its LA Times competition, at least this story nodded in the direction of one other recent study on sleep and weight, thereby conveying that the newer study is not the only research on this topic.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "WEDNESDAY, April 5, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Scientists report another step in the use of stem cells to help treat people with debilitating heart failure.\n\nIn an early study of 27 patients, Japanese researchers used patients' own muscle stem cells to create a \"patch\" that was placed on the heart.\n\nOver the next year, the patients generally showed small improvements in their symptoms -- including the ability to walk without becoming breathless and fatigued.\n\nHowever, experts cautioned that while the results are encouraging, there's a lot of work left ahead before stem cells can be used to treat heart failure.\n\n\"They've shown that this approach is feasible,\" said Dr. Eiran Gorodeski, a heart failure specialist at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.\n\nBut it's not clear whether the stem-cell tactic was actually effective, said Gorodeski, who was not involved in the study.\n\nThat's because the study didn't include a comparison group that did not receive stem cells.\n\nSo it's possible, Gorodeski explained, that the \"modest\" symptom improvements would have happened anyway. All of the patients were on standard medications, and some had heart devices implanted.\n\nStem cells are primitive cells that mature into the various cells that make up the body's tissues. In the past 15 years or so, scientists have tried to use the cells to help repair some of the damage seen in heart failure.\n\nHeart failure is a progressive disease where the heart muscle is too damaged to efficiently pump blood throughout the body. It often arises after a heart attack.\n\nSymptoms of heart failure include fatigue, breathlessness and swelling in the limbs. The condition cannot be cured, although medications and implantable devices can treat the symptoms.\n\nIn the new study, the researchers used stem cells from the patients' own thigh muscle to create a patch they placed on the heart.\n\nThat's in contrast to many past studies, where researchers have injected stem cells -- often from patients' bone marrow -- into the heart.\n\nThe patch tactic could have some advantages, said senior researcher Dr. Yoshiki Sawa, of Osaka University.\n\nHe said animal research suggests that cells in sheet form survive for a longer period, compared to injections.\n\nTo test the safety of the approach, Sawa's team recruited 27 patients who had debilitating symptoms despite standard heart failure therapies. The scientists extracted stem cells from each patient's thigh muscle, then cultured the cells so that they formed a sheet.\n\nThe sheet was placed on each patient's heart.\n\nThe tactic appeared safe, the researchers said, and there were signs of symptom improvements over the next six months to a year.\n\nWhy would stem cells from the thigh muscle affect the heart? It's not clear, Sawa acknowledged.\n\nThe stem cells don't grow into new heart muscle cells. Instead, Sawa explained, they seem to produce chemicals called cytokines that can promote new blood vessel growth in damaged areas of the heart. The theory, he said, is that \"hibernating\" cells in the heart muscle can then function better.\n\nStill, it's too soon to know what the new findings mean, said Gorodeski.\n\nThis type of trial, called phase 1, is designed to look at the safety and feasibility of a therapy, Gorodeski said. It takes later-phase trials -- where some patients receive the treatment, and others do not -- to prove that a therapy actually works.\n\nThose trials are underway, Sawa said.\n\nOther studies are further along. Last year, researchers reported on a trial testing infusions of stem cells taken from the bone marrow of patients with severe heart failure.\n\nPatients who received the therapy were less likely to die or be hospitalized over the next year, versus those given standard treatment only. But the study was small, and the stem cells had only a minor impact on patients' heart function.\n\nSo it's not clear why the stem-cell patients fared better, Gorodeski said.\n\nFor now, he stressed, all stem-cell therapies for heart failure remain experimental.\n\n\"There's no cell therapy that we can offer patients right now,\" Gorodeski said.\n\nThe message for patients, he added, is that heart failure can be treated, and researchers are looking for \"innovative\" ways to improve that treatment.\n\nThe study was published April 5 in the Journal of the American Heart Association.\n\nThe American Heart Association has more on heart failure.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The story is very clear on this, explaining that previous heart failure treatments involving stem cells relied on injecting stem cells into the heart, whereas this study involved the creation of the stem cell patch and placing it on the heart.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "TUESDAY, Aug. 11, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Colonoscopy can save lives, but experts agree that testing rates remain too low. Now, researchers say a special scoring system might point to those people at highest risk for colon cancer, who may need the test the most.\n\nThe system might also make colon cancer screening more efficient and boost the number of people who get checked for the disease, said a team led by Dr. Thomas Imperiale of Indiana University Medical Center, in Indianapolis.\n\nOne expert said more efforts are needed to get people to undergo colonoscopy, which is currently recommended once every 10 years beginning at age 50.\n\n\"Five percent of the U.S. population will be diagnosed with colon cancer within their lifetimes,\" said Dr. Arun Swaminath, director of the inflammatory bowel disease program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He was not involved in the new research.\n\nSwaminath noted that one study published in 2012 found that \"colonoscopy reduced the risk of death from colon cancer by 53 percent, by removing polyps. No other procedure is available to remove polyps from anywhere in the colon.\"\n\nAnd while some areas of the United States have rates of compliance with colonoscopy guidelines of 75 percent or more, \"many areas have poor colon cancer screening rates,\" he added.\n\nImperiale's team noted that not all people deemed to be at \"average risk\" for colon cancer face the same risk of the disease, and so some might benefit more from invasive colonoscopy than others.\n\nIn the new study, the Indiana researchers looked at more than 4,400 Americans who were scheduled to undergo their first screening colonoscopy. They calculated a clinical \"score\" for each of these patients, based on their health information, and the five most common risk factors for colon cancer: age, sex, waist size, smoking and family history.\n\nThen they looked at the results of each patient's colonoscopy. The study found that patients classified under the scoring system as low-risk did, in fact, have far fewer advanced abnormal growths that might develop into cancer, compared to patients classified as high-risk.\n\nSo, patients scoring at the lower end of risk for colon cancer might be able to have less invasive screening tests (such as the fecal occult blood test), while those at higher risk would require a colonoscopy, Imperiale's team concluded.\n\nHowever, Swaminath wasn't fully sold on the notion.\n\nHe believes that the scoring system \"was only modestly able to separate people within the risk groups.\" Swaminath pointed out that even the new study found that \"low- to intermediate-risk patients still have a risk between of between 1.9 percent to 9.9 percent of harboring a polyp that can develop into cancer.\"\n\nFor now, he said, the data from this study is not strong enough to spur any changes in current screening recommendations.\n\nDr. Jules Garbus is co-chief of colon and rectal surgery at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, N.Y. He seemed more supportive of the new scoring system.\n\n\"A risk stratification tool is critical in helping physicians make appropriate screening recommendations for patients,\" Garbus said. \"While high-risk patients may ultimately require a screening colonoscopy, many average- and low-risk patients could undergo less invasive screening procedures.

The fact that it\u2019s not licensed for this has definitely kept doctors away.\u201d\n\nFor example, on Solvay Pharmaceutical\u2019s Web site for Omacor, www.solvay-omacor.com, the first question a user sees is, \u201cAre you a U.S. citizen?\u201d\n\nIf the answer is yes, the user is sent to a page where heart attacks are not mentioned. (In the United States, Omacor is licensed only to treat the small number of people with extremely high blood triglyceride levels.)\n\nSo community doctors do not learn how to use the drug. Lack of F.D.A. approval also means that insurers will not pay for treatment with Omacor. Approval from the agency for the use of the drug in heart disease is not expected soon.\n\nA study published last month in The Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine found that only 17 percent of family doctors were likely to prescribe fish oil to their patients, including patients who had suffered a heart attack. There was a great need, the authors concluded, to \u201cimprove awareness of this important advice.\u201d\n\nThe fact that fish oil is also sold as a nutritional supplement has made it harder for some doctors to regard it as a powerful drug, experts said.\n\n\u201cUsing this medicine is very popular here in Italy, I think partly because so many cardiologists in this country participated in the studies and were aware of the results,\u201d said Dr. Maria Franzosi, a researcher at the Mario Negri Institute in Milan. \u201cIn other countries, uptake may be harder because doctors think of it as just a dietary intervention.\u201d\n\nIn the largest study of fish oil \u2014 conducted more than a decade ago \u2014 Italian researchers from the Gissi Group (Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell\u2019Infarto), gave 11,000 patients one gram of prescription fish oil a day after heart attacks. After three years, the study found that the number of deaths was reduced by 20 percent and that the number of sudden deaths by 40 percent, compared with a control group.\n\nLater studies have continued to yield positive results, although some scientists say there are still gaps in knowledge.\n\nThis summer, a critical review of existing research in BMJ, The British Medical Journal, \u201ccast doubt over the size of the effect of these medications\u201d for the general population, said Dr. Roger Harrison, an author of the paper, \u201cbut still suggested that they might benefit some people as a treatment.\u201d\n\nDr. Harrison said he believed that people should generally increase their intake of omega-3 acids, best done by eating more fish.\n\nStill, he acknowledged that it was difficult to eat foods containing a gram of omega-3 acids each day. \u201cIf you ask me do I take omega-3 supplements every day, then, embarrassingly, the answer is yes,\u201d said Dr. Harrison, a professor at Bolton Primary Care Trust of the University of Manchester in England.\n\n\u201cI, too, am caught up in this hectic world where I have little time to shop and prepare the healthy foods I know I should be eating,\u201d he said.\n\nIt seems natural for Italy to be at the forefront of the fish oil trend and home to the largest clinical trials. Scientists have long noted that Mediterranean diets are salubrious for the heart and theorized that the high content of broiled and baked fish might be partly responsible.\n\nBut the landmark Gissi-Prevenzione trial of fish oil had methodological weaknesses: the patients treated with prescription fish oil pills were compared with untreated patients, rather than with patients given a dummy pill. This meant that, despite impressive results, the trial did not meet the F.D.A.\u2019s standards for approval. Yet by 2004, regulators in almost all European countries, including Spain, France and Britain, had approved Omacor for use in heart attack patients.\n\nMarylou Rowe, a spokeswoman for Reliant Pharmaceuticals, which owns the license for the drug in the United States, said that further trials of Omacor would be needed for it to be licensed for heart attack patients in the United States. But she refused to discuss a timetable.\n\nThe American College of Cardiology now advises patients with coronary artery disease to increase their consumption of omega-3 acids to one gram a day, but it does not specify if this should be achieved by eating fish or by taking capsules. But over-the-counter preparations of fish oil have much less rigorous quality control and are often blends of the two fish oils know to be beneficial in heart disease with other less useful fatty acids.\n\nFor that reason, Dr. Jacobson of Emory gives the prescription drug, \u201coff label,\u201d to cardiac patients, even though the F.D.A. has not approved it for that use. \u201cThen I know exactly what they\u2019re getting, and there is no mercury,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he tells patients who cannot afford the prescription version that they can take the over-the-counter supplements, although there is uncertainty about the dose and they probably need three to four pills a day.\n\nIn Europe, meanwhile, research on prescription fish oil, which is now thought to act by stabilizing cell membranes, has gained momentum.

This caused international interest, but the study was very short as it was only eight weeks and the question remained whether the diabetes would stay away.\n\nIn this new study, 30 volunteers with Type 2 diabetes embarked on the same diet of 600 to 700 calories a day. Participants lost on average 14 kilograms - just over 2 stone. Over the next 6 months they did not regain any weight.\n\nThe group included many people with longer duration diabetes, defined as more than 8 years and ranging up to 23 years.\n\nOverall, 12 patients who had had diabetes for less than 10 years reversed their condition. 6 months later they remained diabetes free. In fact, after 6 months a thirteenth patient had reversed their diabetes.\n\nThough the volunteers lost weight they remained overweight or obese but they had lost enough weight to remove the fat out of the pancreas and allow normal insulin production.\n\nProfessor Roy Taylor said: \"What we have shown is that it is possible to reverse your diabetes, even if you have had the condition for a long time, up to around 10 years. If you have had the diagnosis for longer than that, then don't give up hope - major improvement in blood sugar control is possible.\n\n\"The study also answered the question that people often ask me - if I lose the weight and keep the weight off, will I stay free of diabetes? The simple answer is yes!\n\n\"Interestingly, even though all our volunteers remained obese or overweight, the fat did not drift back to clog up the pancreas.\n\n\"This supports our theory of a Personal Fat Threshold. If a person gains more weight than they personally can tolerate, then diabetes is triggered, but if they then lose that amount of weight then they go back to normal.\n\n\"Individuals vary in how much weight they can carry without it seeming to affect their metabolism - don't forget that 70% of severely obese people do not have diabetes.\n\n\"The bottom line is that if a person really wants to get rid of their Type 2 diabetes, they can lose weight, keep it off and return to normal.\n\n\"This is good news for people who are very motivated to get rid of their diabetes. But it is too early to regard this as suitable for everyone. That is a separate question and a major study is underway to answer this.\"\n\nParticipants in this study had Type 2 diabetes for between six months and 23 years. The team showed that Type 2 diabetes could be reversed even in people who had the condition for 10 years.\n\nThe team were able to identify in advance participants who would not respond to adequate weight loss by reversing their diabetes as at the start they had almost absent insulin production from the pancreas.\n\nThe study was funded by a National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre (NIHR BRC) grant.\n\nA larger trial involving 280 patients is already underway. This will examine how successfully people can reverse their diabetes through weight loss simply under the care of their family doctor and nurse.

The flu shot is designed to protect people against three or four strains of the A and B viruses that researchers believe will be most common that year, leading to the nasty fevers, headaches, coughs, and runny noses that make many people miserable in the fall and winter.\n\nThe challenge, however, is that the flu virus is highly unstable, mutating all the time. So this means drug companies can't just make one kind of vaccine that'll last a lifetime. Every year, public health agencies essentially make educated guesses on what strains and mutations will make the rounds. And that's not easy. In February, the World Health Organization offers a prediction \u2014 based on surveillance and laboratory and clinical studies \u2014 and then each country uses that prediction to approve vaccines in its jurisdiction. (In the US, the Food and Drug Administration makes that final call.) The potential for error here can dramatically alter the effectiveness of the flu shot in a given season. If vaccine makers prepare for one combination of viruses and different ones end up circulating widely, the vaccine won't work that well.\n\nThis may help explain why the evidence on the effectiveness of flu shots is relatively mixed. The Cochrane Collaboration, an independent nonprofit that reviews the evidence on medical questions, has conducted two major meta-analyses (looking at the results of lots of individual studies) on whether the shot prevents flu in healthy children and adults.\n\nIn kids, the highest-quality evidence \u2014 a randomized controlled trial \u2014 suggests the vaccine works well enough: On average, if you give six kids under the age of 6 a flu shot, you can expect to prevent one case of the flu. For children under age 2, the benefits are less clear; the evidence, the researchers found, was scant, and of the research that was available, it seemed the efficacy of the shot was similar to placebo.\n\nIn adults, however, the vaccine's effects are more modest. \"Depending on the season,\" explained Tom Jefferson, an author on these Cochrane reviews, \"you need to vaccinate anywhere between 33 and 100 people to avoid one set of symptoms.\" In a good year, when the WHO guesses correctly and the flu shot matches the strains in circulation, you need to give 33 adults flu shots, on average, to prevent one case of illness. In a year when the WHO guesses badly, you need to vaccinate 100 people to prevent one flu case.\n\nJefferson pointed out that his Cochrane review on adults also found that flu vaccination rates have barely any effect on the number of sick days taken and no major impact on rates of hospitalization. So, yes, the flu vaccine can prevent illness, but it's hard to detect major effects on public health in the data.\n\nOn the other hand, the evidence suggests that there's no harm in getting a flu shot, either. The meta-analyses found no evidence of serious side effects beyond the odd case of soreness at the injection site.\n\nThat seems to be the same conclusion that other studies have drawn \u2014 the flu vaccine is modestly helpful, and doesn't hurt. In 2012 researchers analyzed 15 meta-analyses on the flu shot and concluded, \"Most influenza vaccines have been shown to confer some protection against naturally acquired infection and no evidence for major harms has emerged.\"\n\nOne key caveat here is that the evidence, overall, is pretty poor quality. Most of these analyses rely overwhelmingly on observational studies, where researchers observe and gather data on people who take the flu shot compared with those who don't. Because these aren't experiments \u2014 ideally we'd have randomized controlled trials \u2014 they're more prone to bias and therefore less reliable.\n\nIn the case of the elderly, the situation is particularly troublesome. As this Lancet study points out, because annual flu shots were recommended for the elderly since the 1960s, it has been unethical to conduct high-quality randomized controlled trials where you give only one group the shot in order to compare it with another group that didn't get the vaccine. So, as this Cochrane review notes, it's impossible to draw firm conclusions on the effectiveness of the flu vaccine for those over 65 because the data is so biased and poor.\n\nAgain, though, this doesn't mean we should throw away the vaccine. Stanford researcher John Ioannidis told me how he makes sense of this issue after reviewing the evidence: \"Overall the flu vaccine is effective, and it does save lives. I cannot put an exact figure to how many, but it may well be millions of lives. Generally it is safe and rather cheap, so even if the effectiveness is less than optimal sometimes, overall it is a good deal.\"\n\nWhy people still bother to get the shot\n\nDespite the limited evidence of effectiveness, there are still good reasons why public health experts recommend the shot.\n\nFor one, in those years when the WHO guesses correctly which strains will circulate, the shot tends to be a lot more helpful than some of these averages suggest. And the vaccine is overwhelmingly safe. There's also little by way of alternatives. Beyond public health measures (making sure you have good hand hygiene and avoiding the office when you're sick), the flu shot is the best medical intervention we have for preventing infection. So there's little downside with at least some potential benefit. I personally continue to get the flu shot for this reason.\n\nAs Roger Baxter, the co-director of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center, told me, \"Flu vaccines are not a panacea, and do not prevent all cases of flu, even in the best years, when there are no manufacturing problems and the match is perfect.\" He continued: \"However, the vaccines provide moderate protection, and can prevent huge numbers of cases of this serious illness. Many studies have shown that the vaccines are very safe, so the benefit-to-risk ratio is high and the cost is relatively low.\"\n\nWelcome to Dear Julia, a column where readers can submit everyday health questions.

But such removal is painful, makes recovery more difficult and leaves women susceptible to complications, including infections and a chronic, sometimes disabling swelling in their arms known as lymphodema.\n\nIn the new study, Armando Giuliano of the John Wayne Cancer Institute at Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., and colleagues analyzed data collected from 445 women who had their nodes removed and 446 who did not, along with radiation and chemotherapy. They found no significant difference in the patients' chances of surviving five years after their diagnosis. The five-year \"disease-free\" survival rate was 83.9 percent in those who did not have the more aggressive surgery compared with 82.2 in those who did, the researchers reported.\n\nBased on the findings, the researchers said, women who fit the criteria of those in the study probably do not need to undergo the additional surgery. The researchers noted that the study was limited to women with tumors known as T1 or T2, meaning they were relatively small, had no enlarged nodes that could be felt, and the cancer had not spread elsewhere.\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, Grant Walter Carlson and William Wood of Emory University in Atlanta called the study an \"important contribution\" that represents the latest development in breast cancer treatment, which has steadily been moving toward less-aggressive options, sparing women from unnecessary surgery and follow-up therapy. The study provides \"strong evidence\" that many women can safely forgo lymph node removal, they wrote.\n\nIn a telephone interview, Gary Lyman of the American Society of Clinical Oncology said the findings will probably prompt the group to revise its recommendations for breast cancer patients accordingly. The panel that issues those guidelines is currently reviewing its recommendations, he said.\n\n\"I think this will be practice-changing,\" he said.\n\nAbout 60 to 70 percent of women with cancer diagnosed in lymph nodes may now opt not to have more nodes removed based on this study, meaning thousands of women would avoid the additional surgery, he said.\n\n\"This is good news.

When consumed by women before and during early pregnancy, this B vitamin plays a critical role in preventing severe brain and spinal cord defects. Thanks to mandatory fortification, the number of babies born in the U.S. with neural tube defects has dropped by roughly 35 percent \u2014 or about 1,300 babies a year \u2014 since the 1990s.\n\n\"The story of folic acid is one of the great public health stories of \u2014 ever,\" says Dr. R.J. Berry, who works with the Division of Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.\n\nBut there's one notable exception to this success story \u2014 Hispanic women \u2014 and researchers think the reason may lie in a staple of their diet: tortillas.\n\nUnder current FDA rules, tortillas, corn chips and other foods made with corn masa flour can't be fortified with folic acid. So a coalition of groups including the March of Dimes Foundation and the National Council of La Raza has petitioned the FDA to change its stance and allow corn masa flour to be fortified with folic acid.\n\nAccording to the March of Dimes, about 3,000 pregnancies in the U.S. are affected by neural tube defects each year. The rates are highest among Hispanics: Latina women are roughly 20 percent more likely to have a baby with a neural tube defect compared to non-Latina white women.\n\nThe exact cause of this discrepancy isn't known. Researchers say there may be genetic factors that predispose the children of some Hispanic women to neural tube defects. But they suspect diet is also a factor: \"Part of the reason was that these groups just weren't consuming the same level of wheat flour products. Instead, they were consuming corn masa flour products, because that was the staple grain in that diet,\" says Cynthia Pellegrini, senior vice president of public policy and government affairs at the March of Dimes.\n\nResearch has shown that women who consume at least 400 micrograms of folic acid daily have a significantly reduced risk of having a pregnancy affected by neural tube defects \u2014 including spina bifida, which can involve paralysis, and anencephaly, in which large parts of the brain are missing. The catch: Folic acid is only protective if consumed in the earliest weeks of pregnancy.\n\n\"Most women, by the time they know they're pregnant, they've already passed that critical window,\" says Dean Appling, a biochemistry professor at the University of Texas at Austin. \"If they had a problem with folic acid, it would be too late at that point to prevent the birth defect.\"\n\nMandating fortification helps ensure that women are getting enough folic acid even before they know they need it. And studies suggest that fortifying corn masa with folic acid could prevent an additional 40 to 120 cases of neural tube defects among babies born to Hispanic mothers each year.\n\nSo why does the FDA currently ban dosing corn masa flour with folic acid? It all has to do with nixtamalization, the process by which tough corn kernels are softened by soaking in an alkaline solution, usually of slaked lime. The process, which hails from ancient Mesoamerica \u2014 what's now Mexico and Central America \u2014 dates back thousands of years. It renders the corn more pliable for grinding into masa flour and gives the masa its distinctive aroma and flavor.\n\nBut the FDA worries that this alkaline treatment could also \"affect the stability of added folic acid,\" the agency told The Salt in a statement. \"The FDA is concerned that the breakdown of folic acid in corn masa flour could yield a substance that raises concerns about safety.\"\n\nThe March of Dimes and others first petitioned the FDA to allow added folic acid in corn flour masa in 2012. As part of its review, the FDA asked the petitioning groups to study whether folic acid would stay stable in corn masa flour.\n\nThe petitioners filed the results of that study in October. Michael Dunn, the Brigham Young University food scientist who led the study, cannot comment on the test results while they're under FDA review, but he has previously called them encouraging. As The Seattle Times has reported, Dunn's early results suggested no loss of folic acid in fortified masa after three months of storage.\n\nThe March of Dimes' Pellegrini says she believes the FDA will respond to the results of Dunn's study later this month. But the FDA might have more questions related to the study before making a final ruling.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "There is nothing novel about the suggestion (made in 2012) that folic acid be added to corn flour, and the story explains why this issue is newsworthy now.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "LONDON -- AstraZeneca PLC said Monday its experimental heart pill Brilinta was more effective at preventing heart attacks and strokes in a large clinical trial than the blockbuster pill Plavix, boosting commercial prospects for the U.K. drug maker's still unmarketed treatment.\n\nPlavix, which is marketed by Sanofi-Aventis SA and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., was the second-biggest-selling drug in the world last year, with global revenue of $8.6 billion, according to IMS Health.

But in the real world, the tumor DNA must be detected in stool samples, even though almost all the DNA comes from the bacteria of the gut.

Epigenomics said its test had a sensitivity of 86 percent and a specificity of 93 percent.\n\nProponents of each test note possible weaknesses of the other. Dr. Achim Plum, a vice president for Epigenomics, said that 30 to 40 percent of people have small polyps, but less than 10 percent of these ever become cancerous. The colon-based test may pick up too many of these, sending far too many people in for colonoscopy.\n\n\u201cThe health economics of such a test make no sense,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the blood-based test may have a similar problem, since a positive signal could come from cancers anywhere in the body. If the patient is advised to take a whole body imaging scan, more false positives could be generated \u201cso you end up doing more harm than good,\u201d Dr. Vogelstein said.\n\nDr. Plum said that Epigenomics did not see its test as being necessarily in competition with the Exact Sciences test, because the blood-based test would be good alternative for people put off by stool testing.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "Although the story doesn\u2019t discuss existing stool tests like fecal immunochemical testing or other fecal occult blood testing, on the issue of relative novelty, the story scores points for being the only we reviewed that mentioned that the Exact Sciences DNA test is only one of two leading technologies being developed right now.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "American veterans coping with PTSD are traveling to lodges in the Amazon that offer ayahuasca, a hallucinogenic brew.

The unusual fractures that may be associated with certain osteoporosis drugs called bisphosphonates occur lower on the bone. Ironically, that's where the femur, the longest bone in the body, is usually strongest.\n\nThese unusual fractures can occur suddenly without any trauma, such as a fall. And they can be complex breaks that are difficult to fix and slow to heal.\n\nIn the study, published in current issue of JAMA, researchers looked at 716 of these fractures in more than 200,000 Ontario women who had taken bisphosphonates.\n\nWomen who had taken the drugs for five years or longer had nearly a three times higher risk of suffering atypical fractures compared with women who had only transient exposure to such drugs.\n\nThat's called the relative risk, and it seems alarming. But the \"absolute risk\" of these unusual fractures is still pretty low \u2014 13 fractures per year for every 10,000 people taking bisphosphonates for five years or longer. That is, long-term users have a risk of about a tenth of 1 percent.\n\nMoreover, the study verified that long-term use of bisphosphonate drugs reduces the risk of typical osteoporosis fractures by 24 percent. That's obviously a lot more benefit than risk.\n\n\"The big message really is the number of typical hip fractures is much, much larger than the number of unusual thigh fractures,\" says Dr. Gillian Hawker of St. Michael's Hospital in Ontario, an osteoporosis specialist and study author. \"So although we believe there is an increased risk of these unusual fractures, it doesn't outweigh the benefit\" of taking osteoporosis drugs.\n\nMerck, which makes Fosamax, the original and leading bisphosphonate drug, criticizes the new study. The company said in a statement to Shots that women who had atypical fractures were different from those who didn't. For instance, they started out with a history of more fractures, so the comparison isn't valid.\n\n\"Merck believes that the results must be interpreted with caution and should not be overstated,\" says the company's statement.\n\nStill, the accumulating evidence that there is a risk of these serious, unusual fractures associated with bisphosphonates is getting a lot of attention in the medical community.\n\nLast fall the Food and Drug Administration issued a \"safety update\" urging doctors and patients to be on the lookout for the problem. Often, the FDA says, an atypical fracture is preceded by pain in the thigh, apparently from a small stress fracture that signals bone weakness. \"Although it is not clear if bisphosphonates are the cause, these unusual femur fractures have been predominantly reported in patients taking bisphosphonates,\" the FDA says.\n\nThe concern is heightened by another, even rarer possible side effect \u2013 osteonecrosis of the jaw. Basically, it means that part of the jawbone dies.\n\nSome reports \u2013 including one published earlier this month in the Journal of Dental Research \u2014 have found a higher risk of the jaw problem in dental patients taking bisphosphonates.\n\nAgain, Merck disputes the connection. Earlier this month it convinced a New Jersey jury that Fosamax did not cause one woman's jaw problems.\n\nAmid all the debate, many specialists are wondering if women on bisphosphonates should take a \"holiday\" from the drug from time to time. The idea is that perhaps they'd get the osteoporosis benefit without the risks of osteonecrosis and unusual fractures. \"You could do five years on, five years off,\" Dr. Clifford Rosen, a bone specialist at Maine Medical Center, tells Shots. \"Some people are doing three on and three off.\"\n\nBut at some point, should these patients start taking the drug again? \"I don't think anybody knows,\" Rosen says. \"The thought is you would have to put them back on at some time.\"", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The drugs are not novel, and the story says so.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "For men with advanced prostate cancer, the news for decades has been mostly bleak.

Olive oil is a key ingredient in the so-called Mediterranean diet. And some clinical trials have suggested that the diet helps control risk factors for heart disease, like high blood pressure, abdominal obesity and elevated levels of \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol.\n\nHigh olive oil intake is also linked to a lower risk of heart attack, and a longer lifespan among heart attack survivors. These latest findings support the general advice that people replace dubious dietary fats \u2014 namely, saturated fats and \u201ctrans\u201d fats \u2014 with olive oil and other unsaturated fats, according to an expert not involved in the study. But he also stressed that the study does not prove that olive oil, per se, helps prevent strokes.\n\n\u201cWe need to remember that this is an observational study,\u201d said Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, a neurologist at Columbia University Medical Center in New York who wrote an editorial published with the study.\n\nThe study found a correlation between people\u2019s olive oil use and their stroke risk, he told Reuters Health \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into cause-and-effect.\n\n\u201cPeople who use a lot of olive oil may be very different from people who don\u2019t,\u201d Scarmeas said.\n\nOlive oil users may, for example, have higher incomes, eat better overall or exercise more often than people who never use the oil. The researchers on the new study, led by C\u00e9cilia Samieri of the French national research institute INSERM, tried to account for those differences. And after they did, olive oil was still linked to a lower stroke risk.\n\nBut it\u2019s impossible to fully account for all those variables, Scarmeas noted. What\u2019s needed, he said, are clinical trials where people are randomly assigned to use olive oil or not, then followed over time to see who suffers a stroke. Such clinical trials are considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d of medical evidence.\n\nThe current study included 7,625 French adults age 65 and older who reported on their diets and other lifestyle factors. People who said they used olive oil for both cooking and as a dressing were considered \u201cintensive users.\u201d\n\nOver the next five to six years, those intensive users suffered strokes at a rate of 0.3 percent per year. That compared with just over 0.5 percent among non-users, and 0.4 percent among moderate users.\n\nWhen the researchers factored in other diet habits, exercise levels and major risk factors for stroke \u2014 like high blood pressure and diabetes \u2014 heavy olive oil use was tied to 41 percent reduction in the odds of stroke.\n\nSamieri\u2019s team also took blood samples from another 1,245 older adults, measuring their levels of oleic acid \u2014 a monounsaturated fat that accounts for most of the fatty acids in olive oil. The one-third of participants with the highest oleic acid levels were 73 percent less likely to suffer a stroke than the one-third with the lowest levels.\n\nThe findings, according to Scarmeas, argue for more research into olive oil\u2019s potential benefits against not only heart disease, but stroke and other neurological diseases as well.\n\nFor now, he suggested that people choose olive oil and other unsaturated fats over saturated fats (found largely in meat and dairy) and trans fats (found in some processed foods, like crackers, cookies and chips).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to rely on this type of fat for your overall health,\u201d Scarmeas said.\n\nThat said, no single food is consumed in isolation, he points out in his editorial.

But doctors do not always want to run the risks that can be associated with that technique, and the leading candidates for less invasive assessment are CT and MRI.\n\nCT is a scanning technique using X-rays that produce a set of slice-by-slice heart images, up to 16 slices, depending on the power of the machine. MRI uses a powerful magnetic field and pulses of radiowave energy to create images.\n\nThe German researchers looked at results of 109 published studies of noninvasive heart artery imaging, including 89 that used CT and 20 that used MRI and involving 8,505 people. In the studies of people with suspected coronary artery disease, CT proved to be 97 percent sensitive, compared with 87 percent sensitivity for MRI exams, the analysis found. Sensitivity rates the ability of a test to correctly identify people who have a particular disease.\n\n\"This article holds no surprises whatever,\" said Dr. Uwe Joseph Schoepf, a professor of radiology and cardiology at the Medical University of South Carolina. \"This is really something that is sort of common trade knowledge.\"\n\nIndeed, CT and MRI are not contenders in clinical practice but are used for different reasons to make different assessments, Schoepf said. \"It is a question of what specific question you are looking to answer,\" he said.\n\nCT is the preferred noninvasive technology for assessing the condition of heart arteries, whether there is narrowing that might end with the total blockage that causes a heart attack, Schoepf said. \"MRI is not in current use to look at coronary artery disease,\" he said. \"We use MRI angiography if we are interested in heart muscle, as when there are congenital heart abnormalities in children. The strength of MRI is that it shows tissue configuration.\"\n\nThat difference helps explain why there are so few studies doing head-to-head comparison of CT versus MRI, he said.

One hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease is reduced metabolism in the brain, which shows up on scans as less use of glucose, the fuel for brain cells. In this assessment, those getting insulin used more glucose in their brains; those taking placebos used less.\n\nFor years, the study\u2019s principal investigator, Suzanne Craft, has studied insulin\u2019s effects in Alzheimer\u2019s.

In both test groups, only about 3 percent of the people had heart attacks, suffered \"major\" complications, needed hospitalization for chest pain or died during two years of tracking, researchers found.\n\nWhich prompts a big question: Could the use of stress tests or expensive scans become less frequent for heart patients, replaced by more watchful waiting?\n\n\"We were very pleasantly surprised,\" said Dr. Pamela Douglas, Ursula Geller professor of research in cardiovascular diseases at Duke University, and the study\u2019s lead author.\n\nResults of the federally funded trial \u2014 Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain (PROMISE) \u2014 were presented at the American College of Cardiology\u2019s 64th Annual Scientific Session in San Diego. Findings also were published the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\n\"Knowing how well the patients did in spite having a very high cardiovascular-risk burden opens up the door to thinking differently about how we might manage those patients. And, certainly, one option is watchful waiting,\" Douglas said in an interview. \"We now have the data to support that as a reasonable way to go for a lot of patients. We didn\u2019t before.\"\n\nThe 10,000-plus patients, who visited 193 health centers in the U.S. and Canada, had no prior diagnosis of coronary artery disease. But they had new symptoms that caused physicians to suspect heart disease \u2014 and nearly all had at least one risk factor like high blood pressure, diabetes or a history of smoking.\n\nHalf were randomly selected to get a computed tomographic angiography (CTA), which creates a 3-D image of the heart's arteries, allowing physicians to spot narrowing. The rest took stress tests \u2014 either an exercise electrocardiogram, a stress echocardiography or a nuclear stress test, which uses radioactive dye. Stress tests measure the heart's response to exertion, letting doctors see or hear any disease.\n\n\"The remarkable thing about the study is ... these were quite high-risk patients, but the actual [bad] event rate was very low ... It is a real testament to how far we\u2019ve come in the treatment of patients with suspected coronary disease,\" said Dr. Steven Nissen, department chair of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. He was not part of the study.\n\nPrevention tactics do seem to be working: Lowering cholesterol through diet and medicine, keeping blood pressure in check, and helping people to stop smoking.\n\n\"Traditionally, when you come in with chest pain, some sort of stress test or CT angiogram will be performed,\" Nissen said. \"And I wonder if it's worth doing those tests when rates of cardiac events are so low.\"\n\nUntil this study, doctors have been \"guessing\" which form of those two diagnostic tests is best, Douglas said.\n\nAnd while there's often no wrong choice between CTAs and stress tests, the new findings underscore a vital nuance, she added.\n\nCTAs, the study found, result in fewer instances of patients with suspected heart issues undergoing unneeded catheterization procedures \u2014 only to later learn they had no artery problems.\n\n\"If you have chest pains and you needed a test,\" Douglas said, \"and if I said to you: 'Either one of these two tests will be equally effective in preventing heart attack or death, but this one will have less chance of going to the cath lab if you don\u2019t have blockages,' which one would you pick?\"\n\nEach year, about 4 million Americans report heart symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath.\n\nBut one Cleveland Clinic patient epitomizes a difference between CTAs and stress tests \u2014 and he does so just by being alive.\n\nAt age 48, David, an electrical engineer, was in great condition, biking 50 miles on a weekend. Be he'd been feeling vague sensations for a year, including chest tightness and heart palpitations. (He did not want his last name published). He easily passed several stress tests on treadmills.\n\nBut \u2014 partly because his mother had died of coronary artery disease at age 49 \u2014 David remained unconvinced by those results. He underwent a CTA at Cleveland Clinic, and it showed severely blocked arteries. He soon underwent a bypass surgery. He is healthy today, now 50.\n\nAs a result, however, David's two brothers, both close to his age, were convinced to undergo CTAs. Both were found to have blocked arteries, also requiring immediate surgeries.\n\n\"None of us had any indications,\" David said. \"Just because I had a CTA, that had a domino effect to my brothers getting it, and it very well saved all three of our lives.\"", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The story heralds this comparison as the first of its kind in terms of examining clinical outcomes of folks getting these diagnostic exams.\u00a0 It appears that is true.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The delivery virus, carrying a good version of the human gene for the clotting agent known as Factor IX, was prepared by researchers at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital in Memphis. The patients had been recruited and treated with the virus in England by a team led by Dr. Amit C. Nathwani of University College London; researchers at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia monitored their immune reactions.\n\nHemophilia B is caused by a defect in the gene for Factor IX. Fatal if untreated, the disease occurs almost only in men because the Factor IX gene lies on the X chromosome, of which men have only a single copy.\n\nWomen who carry a defective gene on one X chromosome can compensate with the good copy on their other X chromosome, but they bequeath the defective copy to half their children. About one in 30,000 of newborn boys have the disease, with about 3,000 patients in the United States.\n\nDr. Nathwani and his team reported that they treated the patients by infusing the delivery virus into their veins. The virus homes in on the cells of the liver, and the gene it carries then churns out correct copies of Factor IX. A single injection enabled the patients to produce small amounts of Factor IX, enough that four of the six could stop the usual treatment, injections of Factor IX concentrate prepared from donated blood. The other two patients continued to need concentrate, but less frequently.\n\nTreating a patient with concentrate costs $300,000 a year, with a possible lifetime cost of $20 million, but the single required injection of the new delivery virus costs just $30,000, Dr. Katherine P. Ponder of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis notes in her commentary in The New England Journal of Medicine, calling the trial \u201ca landmark study.\u201d\n\nThe patients have continued to produce their own Factor IX for up to 22 months, said Dr. Edward G. D. Tuddenham, director of the Hemophilia Center at the Royal Free Hospital in London. One patient, a geologist, had a good response at first, but his level of Factor IX has declined to 1 percent of normal, the level at which the disease kicks in.\n\n\u201cWe attribute this to the fact that he had an inflammation, and although we treated it promptly, we should have been quicker off the mark,\u201d Dr. Tuddenham said.\n\nThe patient cannot be injected again with the same virus because his immune system is now primed to attack it. \u201cHe\u2019s very philosophic about it, but he\u2019s a scientist, and his motivation is to help the science,\u201d Dr. Tuddenham said.\n\nTwenty more patients will be treated to assess the best dose of the virus, the goal being the highest dose that does not set off an immune system attack, Dr. Tuddenham said. \u201cWe are pretty close to the sweet spot,\u201d he said. If all goes well, a genetic treatment for hemophilia B \u201ccould be available for widespread use in a couple of years.\u201d\n\nIn a trial in 2006, a patient injected with a corrective gene produced his own Factor IX but only for 10 weeks. The designer of that treatment, Dr. Katherine A. High of Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the new therapy had worked because the delivery virus had been made more efficient and because the research team had treated the patients with steroids to suppress immune system attacks on the virus.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s incredibly exciting, and I say that even though these people are my competitors,\u201d she said. Dr. High is listed as a co-author of the report because her laboratory helped monitor the patients and provided proof for regulators that the virus would not insert its human gene into the patients\u2019 sperm and make the change hereditary.\n\nA serious problem with other delivery viruses is that they insert themselves randomly into chromosomes, sometimes disrupting a gene. The virus used by Dr. Nathwani\u2019s team, known as adeno-associated virus-8, generally stays outside the chromosomes, so it should not present this problem. Still, patients will need to be monitored for liver cancer, a small possibility that has been observed in mice.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a showstopper, but it\u2019s a critical safety issue that has to be assessed,\u201d Dr. High said.\n\nPatients have little or no immunity to the adeno-associated virus, which infects rhesus monkeys. The virus has a propensity for making liver cells its target, which is good for the therapy because these cells are the natural producers of Factor IX. However, liver cells do not live forever and slowly replenish themselves, possibly limiting how long the therapy will last.\n\nAbout 80 percent of hemophilia cases are of the type known as hemophilia A, which is caused by defects in a different blood-clotting agent, Factor VIII.

Though there were observational studies, those may be biased because men who opt to hold off on treatment may be those whose tumors are lower risk to begin with, he said.\n\nThe study is published in the June 6 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nWatchful waiting -- which does not involve cancer treatment -- means having regular exams while keeping an eye on the tumor to see if it grows or spreads. It is usually recommended when doctors feel someone's advanced age will allow them to outlive the generally slow-moving cancer or when someone has other conditions that are more likely to prove lethal.\n\nMen who are diagnosed with early prostate cancer -- meaning it's confined to the prostate gland and has not spread -- are confronted with a bewildering array of options for treating it: surgery; radiation; drugs to deprive the tumor of the hormone androgen that may drive its growth; or watchful waiting.\n\nIn 2008, AHRQ also commissioned a review of studies on other prostate cancer treatment options, but that report could not draw conclusions on the best approach either.\n\n\"What all of these analyses have found is there is very limited data that allows us to determine which of these approaches in the best approach,\" said Dr. Durado Brooks, director of prostate cancer for the American Cancer Society.\n\nBrooks said more comparative effectiveness research, which compares different kinds of treatments, is needed.\n\nIn the meantime, what are men diagnosed with early prostate cancer to do?\n\nMen and their doctors need to consider what the tumor looks like under the microscope, which can help gauge how aggressive it may be. They should also consider age and overall health status, including whether or not the patient has other conditions more likely to cause death than the prostate cancer.\n\nFinally, patients and their doctors should weight the potential debilitating side effects of the treatments, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction, against how comfortable the man is with holding off on treatment, experts say.\n\n\"Men need to learn as much as they can about the possible outcomes and benefits of the various treatments and the potential side effects, and choose which direction they are most comfortable with,\" Brooks said.\n\nIn the current review, researchers found several trials that compared different doses of radiation and different types of radiation therapy, including external beam radiation therapy, in which a radiation is delivered through a beam through the skin, or brachytherapy, in which radioactive isotopes are delivered via injection into the prostate.\n\nFor those methods, too, there was too little research to say with confidence which method was superior in preventing deaths from prostate cancer, the researchers said. Retrospective studies, however, found that radiation treatments were associated with increased urinary or bowel problems, compared with no treatment or no initial treatment.\n\nThere was also \"moderate strength evidence\" that a higher external beam radiation was more effective than a lower dose.\n\nTaken together, the review \"does point out that based on current evidence, doctors should not be telling their patients that this form of radiation is better than that form,\" Brooks said. \"Some of the distinctions being made are not really supported by the evidence.\"\n\nProton beam therapy in particular is expensive, but according to this report, there isn't enough evidence to show it's any better than other option.\n\nRadiation, he noted, may be the best option for men whose tumors have spread outside the gland, since simply removing the prostate gland surgically is not likely to be as effective, he said.\n\nThe American Cancer Society estimates that in 2009, approximately 192,000 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer and approximately 27,000 men died of the disease.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute has more on prostate cancer.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The story made clear that this is one in a series of federally funded studies on prostate cancer treatment options.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "THURSDAY, Jan. 5, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Preliminary findings suggest a drug used to treat another disease might also reduce painful flare-ups in gout patients starting new medication regimens.\n\nIn a new study, the protein-inhibitor drug rilonacept (Arcalyst) appeared to markedly lower the risk of gout flare-ups during the first few months of treatments aimed at lowering uric acid levels.\n\nWhile effective in lowering the risk for gout attacks in the long-term, uric acid-lowering treatment can initially boost the risk for flare-ups as it breaks up and releases the uric acid crystal deposits at the source.\n\n\"To reduce deposits of crystals in the joints, we advise patients to initiate treatment with medications that lower levels of uric acid in the blood,\" study author Dr. H.

A genetic condition left her with intellectual disabilities and a weak immune system. By 26, she had endured dozens of bacterial infections \u2014 kidney, ear, sinus, heart, bone, and more \u2014 and taken hundreds of antibiotic pills. But when she entered the Harborview Hospital in Seattle for a foot operation, her body\u2019s defenses were pushed to a new limit. Hospitals are hotbeds for nasty \u2014 and sometimes deadly \u2014 infections. After her surgery, Rachel\u2019s lungs picked up two: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both bugs are part of a growing category of bacterial infections that don\u2019t respond to traditional antibiotics. Rachel was supposed to be in the hospital for five days. She stayed nine weeks. She developed pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and was put on a ventilator with a tube down her throat. When her doctors finally released her, they told her mother she had three years to live, at most, before the bugs won. Three years later, in January 2010, Rachel was indeed close to death. She was spending half of every month in intensive care, the other half at home, an IV constantly dripping into her bloodstream. By then she had cycled through more than a dozen powerful antibiotics. Each time the doctors would give her a new drug, then watch helplessly as the bacteria overpowered it. \u201cEvery time we took her back to the hospital, it was a question of whether or not this was going to be it,\u201d her mother, Rose George, told BuzzFeed News. One day the nurse on duty asked Rose if she\u2019d ever considered phage therapy. Rose had never heard of it, and that\u2019s unsurprising: The therapy, which uses specialized viruses (called bacteriophages) to kill bacteria, is only available in a handful of former Soviet countries. Rose asked her daughter\u2019s doctor, but she\u2019d never heard of phage either. Soon Rose was on the phone with doctors at a small clinic in Tbilisi, in the Republic of Georgia, ordering 100 glass vials of viruses at $8 a pop. She\u2019s one of at least 300 people desperate enough to try this little-known viral therapy from Eastern Europe. It\u2019s an extreme solution to what may be this century\u2019s biggest medical crisis: the death of antibiotics.\n\nSince the discovery of penicillin in 1928, scientists have amassed a medical arsenal of more than 130 antibiotics. The drugs have prevented soldiers from losing limbs, and mothers from dying during childbirth. With access to antibiotics, parents no longer worry about losing their kid to an ear infection or bad scrape. But now antibiotics are everywhere \u2014 not just in orange pill bottles, but in the food given to pigs, cattle, and chicken. And the more the bugs interact with antibiotics, the quicker they evolve defense mechanisms. At least 18 strains of bacteria have evolved into \u201csuperbugs,\u201d becoming resistant to most of our drugs. And pharmaceutical companies, more interested in profitable blockbusters like Viagra and Zoloft, haven\u2019t developed a new class of antibiotics in 25 years. We\u2019re dying because of it. More than 23,000 people in the U.S. die each year from antibiotic-resistant infections. By 2050, an estimated 10 million people worldwide will die by superbug. After two decades of warnings from the scientific community, the problem is finally getting serious attention. In his 2016 budget proposal released today, U.S. President Obama threw $1.2 billion at tackling the antibiotic-resistance crisis \u2014 nearly double the amount allocated last year. If approved by Congress, this money will go toward screening soil samples for new antibiotics, reducing the drugs in livestock feed, boosting hospital surveillance, and, perhaps, making phage therapy a viable option in the U.S. Phages are bacteria\u2019s natural enemies. They work by injecting their DNA inside bacterial cells, where they replicate wildly, produce new phages, and eventually cause the bacteria to rupture \u2014 releasing even more viruses to hunt for bacterial prey. Phages\u2019 power comes from two places: They are the most common and diverse organisms on Earth, and each phage harms only specific strains of bacteria. When you turn on the faucet, millions of phages flow out with your tap water. That leaves a nearly inexhaustible supply of potential agents to use in the fight against infection. Doctors have been using phages to kill bacteria for nearly a century \u2014 just not in the U.S. In 1923, a Georgian doctor named George Eliava set up the first phage therapy clinic, the Eliava Institute, in Tbilisi. Antibiotics hadn\u2019t been discovered yet, so phages were a revolutionary weapon against all kinds of infections, Ryland Young, head of the Center for Phage Technology at Texas A&M University, told BuzzFeed News. \u201cIt was kind of pre-scientific \u2014 no one knew what these phages were except that they worked.\u201d Five years later, penicillin came along. Effective, cheap, and quick to produce in large quantities, doctors in the U.S., U.K., and France quickly seized upon the \u201cmiracle drug\u201d as a key to winning World War II. That also meant keeping this weapon away from the Soviets. With no access to antibiotics, scientists behind the Iron Curtain bolstered their use of phages instead. \u201cAt its very peak, when they were supplying the Russian army, the Eliava Institute was producing two to three tons of phages per day,\u201d Zamphira Alavidze, a microbiologist in Tbilisi who worked at the Eliava Institute for 45 years, told BuzzFeed News. But after the fall of the Soviet Union, Eliava\u2019s phage production dropped significantly, and it downsized into a small research center. Today Georgian doctors frequently use antibiotics to treat infections, but often in combination with phages. \u201cEvery clinic, everywhere in Georgia, everybody uses the phages,\u201d Alavidze said. The last decade, she added, has brought another big change: Two small phage clinics in Tbilisi have sprung up to cater specifically to the boom of international patients like Rachel. \u201cTen or fifteen years ago, nobody believed the phages would be so popular. They thought we were crazy,\u201d Alavidze said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s not too easy to come to Georgia, but we try to help somehow because sometimes nothing else works.\u201d\n\nRandy Wolcott, a wound care doctor in Lubbock, Texas, first went to Tbilisi in 2007. He was fed up with the lack of options for his patients with drug-resistant infections, and wanted to investigate phages as a treatment of last resort. Wolcott spent a week at the Eliava Institute. It looked nothing like the gleaming and sterile high-rises of most U.S. hospitals \u2014 the building was small, some of the equipment looked ancient, and the walls were unpainted. But after observing the Georgian clinicians at work, Wolcott was sold. He walked into a city pharmacy and bought hundreds of vials of phages concocted for wound infections. \u201cThey were very cheap, and I bought them by the case,\u201d Wolcott told BuzzFeed News. The only hiccup came when explaining his viral cargo to U.S. customs officials. \u201cIt can cause some problems when our government hears that you\u2019re bringing viruses back from a former Soviet country,\u201d Wolcott said, chuckling. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain. It\u2019s a virus, but it\u2019s a virus only for bacteria, not for us.\u201d Phages aren\u2019t approved for use in the U.S. So, once back in Lubbock, Wolcott wrote to the Texas Board of Medicine and asked for permission to use the viruses on his wound patients. The board decided that, because these patients had exhausted all other options, Wolcott would be allowed to use the experimental treatment in a legal arrangement known as \u201ccompassionate use.\u201d Wolcott\u2019s patients saw improvement within days. In 11 of the cases, the patients\u2019 wounds healed enough to save their limbs. He treated hundreds of patients using the original batch of phages he brought over from Tbilisi. Five years ago, he went back for more. Wolcott usually uses the phages in combination with traditional antibiotics. But he says he couldn\u2019t have offered the same quality of treatment without the viruses. \u201cSomeone needs to do this in America,\u201d Wolcott said. \u201cTo have a bank of stuff that we can turn to for these chronic infections? That would be huge.\u201d\n\nUntil that happens, though, patients are looking abroad. Rose George\u2019s internet search led her to a clinic in Tbilisi called the Phage Therapy Center. It was set up in 2005 by Phage International, a fledgling medical tourism outfit founded in Danville, California, by a computer scientist named Chris Smith. The center\u2019s doctors asked Rose to send over a bacterial sample from Rachel\u2019s lungs. Over the course of a month, Rose attempted to send several samples, but each was rejected by U.S. customs. Rose\u2019s son tried driving a sample across the border into Canada, which led to a seven-hour interrogation by Canadian agents, followed by two more hours with the FBI on the U.S. side. Finally, Smith suggested that Rose ambiguously label the package as \u201cmedical records.\u201d She did, and the shipment slipped through. A few weeks later, the Georgian doctors called Rose with good news: They would be able to design a concoction of phages to treat Rachel\u2019s infections. After convincing Rachel\u2019s doctor to write a prescription for the viruses (so they could cross the U.S. border), Rose paid the Georgian clinic $800 for a three-month supply. She was surprised that phages were so inexpensive; in contrast, her insurance company was forking over roughly $14,000 a month for Rachel\u2019s antibiotics. A couple of weeks later, 10 boxes filled with 100 vials of phages landed on the Georges\u2019 doorstep. Rose used a nebulizer to administer the phages twice a day so that Rachel could breathe the liquids into her lungs. Within three weeks, Rachel\u2019s MRSA \u2014 the same infection she\u2019d been fighting with antibiotics for three years \u2014 disappeared. It hasn\u2019t returned in the five years since.\n\nAdvocates of phage therapy see it as a powerful new weapon in the war we\u2019re quickly losing against bacterial infection. But phages are certainly not a cure-all. Just ask Roger Mintey, a 65-year-old retired accountant from the sleepy English town of Reigate. In 1991, Mintey caught a severe sinus infection that left him with a near-constant cold. He\u2019s had it, on and off, ever since. In the first decade of fighting his illness, Mintey sought help at five English hospitals, underwent two surgeries, and took more than two dozen courses of antibiotics. Nothing worked. In 2006, he heard about phage therapy from his cousin\u2019s wife, who\u2019d gone to Tbilisi to treat a chronic bladder infection. She pointed Roger to Phage International, the same company that helped Rose George get her daughter\u2019s phages. The Georgian doctors affiliated with the company said they could treat his sinus infection, so Mintey cut Phage International a check for $5,000 and sent a sample of his nasal discharge to Georgia via FedEx. Then, accompanied by a friend, he boarded his first-ever plane to fly to the company\u2019s Phage Therapy Center. They landed in Tbilisi at 3 a.m. and were met by someone from the clinic, who escorted them to their hotel. Mintey was instructed to drink a phage preparation three times a day from his hotel room. Every couple of days he would go into the clinic for additional phage treatments. The clinic was inside a nondescript building, set up something like an indoor mall. \"You went through a set of double doors, passed by a suntanning place, and there you were: one office, two treatment rooms, and that was it,\u201d Mintey told BuzzFeed News. A doctor and two nurses had him sit on a cushioned patient\u2019s chair. They tipped the chair back so his nostrils faced up, and poured the phage liquid into his nose. He was instructed to say the word \u201ccuckoo\u201d as the phages slowly slid into all of his sinuses, seeping out from his nasal passages into his forehead and cheekbones. His nose started bleeding, but the clinicians told him it was nothing to worry about. They also gave him a shot of manuka honey extract in his butt, telling him it had antimicrobial properties. \u201cIt was all quite uncomfortable,\u201d Mintey said. After two weeks, Mintey flew back to England. Three days later, his infection was back. \u201cI realized the entire treatment had done absolutely nothing,\u201d he said. Mintey claims to have called, emailed, faxed, and sent physical letters to his doctors in Georgia and to Phage International\u2019s headquarters in California. He heard nothing back. (Smith, of Phage International, claims that emails sent to Roger at the time were bouncing, and that he only had Mintey\u2019s friend\u2019s phone number.) Eventually, the clinic sent Mintey more phages in the mail, but the infection persisted. He says he has not heard from them since. \u201cI was very disappointed,\u201d Mintey said. \u201cBy the end of 2007, I had given up on phages.\u201d Mintey\u2019s situation highlights many of the difficulties surrounding a therapy only accessible through a small and largely unregulated medical tourism industry. Smith says Phage International has served more than 300 patients to date, with some 4,000 registered on its website. He wants to open a new phage therapy clinic in Trinidad, which could be easier for American patients to visit. \u201cDuring the past 10 years, you\u2019d go to an investor or venture capitalist, and they\u2019d never heard of phage \u2014 and they didn\u2019t want to know about it,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that\u2019s changed.\u201d Nothing about Phage International is decidedly illegal, I. Glenn Cohen, a law professor at Harvard\u2019s Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology and Bioethics, told BuzzFeed News. But there are many ethical issues at play. What happens when something goes wrong? Or, as in Roger\u2019s case, when a patient feels like he\u2019s not getting what he paid for? \u201cWho do you go after? Where do you do it?\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThat\u2019s where things get more tricky.\u201d\n\nThis year, two clinical trials are testing phage treatment against several antibiotic-resistant infections. The first, called Phagoburn, is big, testing 220 burn victims at three European hospitals with a $5.2 million investment from the European Union. The second, led by a Richmond, Virginia-based biotech called AmpliPhi, is smaller and privately funded, but will include a collaboration with the U.S. Army, which has a vested interest in treating wounded soldiers. Both studies will be an important first step in giving phage therapy the credibility it will need to pass muster with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and to gain the support of drug companies needed to fund its eventual commercial development. \u201cBig pharmaceutical companies like stuff to appear in bottles and in tablets,\u201d Jeremy Curnock Cook, AmpliPhi\u2019s CEO, told BuzzFeed News. \u201cThey\u2019re waiting for people like us to come back with the clinical data.\u201d But the biggest obstacle for phage therapy in the U.S. may ultimately have less to do with the science than its implementation into the medical system. Rachel George and Roger Mintey both received personalized phage treatments, meaning that the viruses were selected to specifically attack their particular infections. It\u2019s uncertain whether the FDA would be able to adopt such a tailor-made approach, which stands in such stark contrast to the one-size-fits-most approach of antibiotics. What\u2019s more, because of the number and diversity of phages \u2014 and a regulatory system that\u2019s been set up to deal with manufactured chemicals rather than the messiness of nature \u2014 each phage would have to be tested as its own drug, even if it's used in combination. In a concoction of nine phages designed to treat a mixture of three bacteria, that could mean hundreds of trials. Depending on who you ask, this is viewed as anything from costly to impossible. Regardless of whether phage therapy reaches wide-scale use, one thing is clear: Sticking to the status quo is not an option. With 2 million Americans a year acquiring bacterial infections that are no longer thwarted by antibiotics, the era of blissful overdependence on these onetime miracle drugs is drawing to a close. \u201cI\u2019m quite optimistic about the future of phage,\u201d says Randy Kincaid, senior scientific officer for the arm of the National Institutes of Health that will be overseeing phage therapy development. \u201cBut I think until \u2014 and unless \u2014 people take the more structured approach to understanding and using and developing the treatment, we\u2019ll always be asking what if: What if we\u2019d only done it better, what if we\u2019d only done it the right way.\u201d For Rose George, the knotty issues surrounding phage therapy are all beside the point. The Phage Therapy Center gave her access to a treatment she couldn\u2019t get in her own country. And that treatment is still ongoing. Though phages cleared one of Rachel\u2019s infections beautifully, the other \u2014 the Pseudomonas \u2014 is a stubborn bug. Every three months, the Phage Therapy Center asks Rose to send a new sample from Rachel\u2019s lungs, and when the bacteria mutates, they send a new mixture of phages. Somehow the infection persists. But Rose is grateful that Rachel\u2019s infections are finally under control. While the hospital is still their \u201csecond home\u201d because of Rachel\u2019s numerous other health issues \u2014 she recently had hip replacement surgery and had her gallbladder removed \u2014 the infections are no longer what are bringing here there. \u201cThese people saved my daughter\u2019s life,\u201d Rose said. \u201cIt is crazy that it\u2019s not part of our arsenal.\u201d", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The story rightly points out that phage therapy has been in existence longer than antibiotic therapy and the use in Eastern Europe is not new or novel.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Cancer cells remain elusive and tough to locate, but a new crop of nuclear-imaging tests promises to lead to more accurate prognosis and treatment.\n\nThe tests use imaging agents that combine radioactive isotopes with targeted molecules that can spot cancer at the cellular level.

Their blood pressure also dropped the most of the four groups, a finding that the researchers think may relate to their slightly greater weight loss. Those in the Atkins group also experienced the largest increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL), a protective type of cholesterol.\n\nMost important, the Atkins group did not develop the soaring levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) that some experts have thought might result from eating a diet rich in saturated fat and cholesterol found in fatty cuts of meat, butter and cream. High levels of LDL are a major risk factor for heart disease. The study found that while LDL rose slightly for those in the Atkins group, their blood levels did not differ statistically from the other groups.\n\n\"This is the best study so far to compare popular diets,\" said Walter Willett, chair of the department of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health, because of its size, duration and the small number who dropped out. The findings confirm, he said, that reducing carbohydrates, \"especially those with refined starch and sugar like that found in the U.S. diet, has metabolic benefits.\" It also shows that replacing these carbohydrates with either fat or protein \"can improve blood cholesterol fractions and blood pressure,\" he said.\n\nThe findings \"are pretty much in line with what all the other studies have shown comparing Atkins and low-fat diets,\" said Bonnie Brehm, assistant professor of nutrition at the University of Cincinnati College of Nursing and co-author of two, independent studies of the Atkins diet. \"We have found the same thing with all of our trials.\"\n\nAs for weight loss, the goal that concerns dieters the most, none of the groups managed to shed the large numbers of pounds touted by weight-loss programs and television shows such as \"The Biggest Loser.\"\n\nAll the participants reported eating about 2,000 calories a day when the study began. All also reported having cut their intake -- some by as much as 500 calories per day at two to six months -- but then gradually adding back many of those calories. But as researchers noted, if participants ate as little as they said, all the groups would have lost much more weight.\n\nAt first, the Atkins group lost weight faster. But as in previous studies, the pounds shed began to even out across the four groups. After a year, women in the Atkins group averaged a modest 10-pound loss compared with about six pounds for those in the other groups.\n\nBoth the authors and other weight-loss experts were quick to note that the new findings did not answer the question of what is the best way for most people to shed weight.\n\n\"This isn't a study testing how well you would do if you followed these diets to the letter,\" notes Christopher Gardner, assistant professor of medicine at the Stanford Prevention Research Center and lead author of the study, which appears in tomorrow's Journal of the American Medical Association. \"This is a study that shows what happens if you bought the book and tried to follow\" the diets, as most dieters do.\n\nThe 311 overweight and obese women in the study were randomly assigned to one of the four groups. Each received a book detailing her prescribed diet. For the first eight weeks, the women also attended one-hour weekly group sessions with a registered dietitian trained to explain the diet in detail. Participants received follow-up phone calls and e-mails to remind them of appointments, and they were paid $25 to $75 for each appointment they made.\n\nReactions to the findings were mixed.\n\n\"It's bad science, good publicity,\" said the Zone's Sears.\n\n\"For all practical purposes, the programs all worked about the same,\" said Kelly D. Brownell, director of Yale University's Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity and creator of the Lifestyle, Exercise, Attitudes, Relationships and Nutrition (LEARN) program for weight management, one of the diets studied. The extra four pounds lost by the Atkins group are not very meaningful, Brownell said.\n\nOthers were more critical.\n\n\"This study is seriously flawed, and its conclusions misleading,\" said Ornish, clinical professor of medicine at the University of California at San Francisco. A careful read of the study shows \"no significant difference in weight loss between the Atkins and Ornish or LEARN diets after one year!\" he noted in an e-mail. \"There was significantly more weight loss on the Atkins diet after one year only when compared with the Zone diet. This directly contradicts their primary conclusion.\"\n\nAll low-carbohydrate diets are not necessarily created equal, however. A study last year by Willett and his colleagues in the New England Journal of Medicine found that women on low-carb diets who ate mostly animal fat and animal protein did not reduce their risk of heart disease. But those who ate vegetable forms of protein, such as soy, and fat, such as olive oil, did reduce their risk of heart disease. As Willett said yesterday, \"lower-carbohydrate diets look like a good option, but if you consider them, eat olive oil and fish rather than butter and sausage.\"", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The information presented is not novel and was not presented as a new finding.\u00a0", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Using the immune system to beat cancer is quickly becoming a promising new strategy for battling tumors. But most of the success so far has been with blood cancers like lymphomas and leukemias. Immunotherapy, as it\u2019s called, has yet to prove itself with solid tumors like breast, prostate, lung, colon and brain cancers.\n\nBut in a report published in the , researchers led by Dr. Behnam Badie from the City of Hope Beckman Research Institute and Medical Center say that the same immune-based therapy that is successful against blood cancers also helped a patient with advanced brain cancer.\n\nThe 50-year-old man with glioblastoma, a particularly aggressive type of brain tumor, had already been treated with surgery, radiation and anti-tumor drug therapies. Despite these treatments, his cancer had returned and also spread to other parts of his brain and spinal cord. Badie and his team extracted immune cells from him, then engineered them to express proteins on their surface that would recognize and destroy glioblastoma tumor cells. After surgery to remove the bulk of the brain tumor, Badie and his colleagues directly injected the site with the modified immune cells (called chimeric antigen receptor T cells, or CAR T cells) six times, and the remaining part of this tumor stopped growing.\n\nOther smaller growths in the brain continued to grow, however, so the patient received 10 more doses of the CAR T cells injected into the cavities in the brain, called the ventricles. This is the first time that immune cells have been injected into these brain regions, because introducing anything into the ventricles can cause dangerous and possibly deadly inflammation. The man did not develop such serious complications, however, and after about four months, these tumors too started to shrink. By six months, almost all had disappeared.\n\nIf the patient had not received the CAR T therapy, he likely would only have survived a few weeks after his cancer recurred, says Badie. But after being treated with the immune therapy, his cancer did not grow or recur for nearly eight months. \u201cIf we can do the same for other patients, that would be an amazing accomplishment that many decades of work and research on glioblastoma have never done,\u201d says Badie, whose own father passed away a decade ago from glioblastoma.\n\nThe patient is one of nine in the trial, and so far, many of the other people are having similar experiences on the therapy. Based on this man\u2019s case, his team is hoping to now inject not just the tumor site but also the ventricular space in the brain, since that may help control spread of the cancer.\n\nIt\u2019s also becoming clear that more than one type of modified immune cells may have to be enlisted. The tumors in the first patient remained under control for almost eight months, but the cancer returned after that in new parts of the brain. Badie says it\u2019s not obvious why, but his analysis showed that these tumors did not contain much of the protein targeted by the CAR T cells that were injected. It\u2019s possible that the immune cells had destroyed most of the cancer cells expressing the original protein, so other cancer cells with other proteins began to proliferate and survive.\n\nBadie is hoping to take advantage of this information and introduce immune cells with different tumor-targeting proteins. Eventually, these proteins would also be tailored to be specific to each patient\u2019s cancer \u2014 a precision medicine approach to controlling cancer.

And the new research suggests the treatment could prove a boon to back pain patients for whom standard therapies have failed to do the trick.\n\n\"I was amazed with the results of pRF,\" said study author Dr. Alessandro Napoli. \"Especially having read, as a radiologist, numerous lumbar MRI scans of patients with recurrent hernia after surgery.\"\n\nAnd as a patient himself, Napoli added that \"from personal experience I can tell you that the treatment is not painful, and the results are appreciated within days after a single treatment lasting 10 minutes.\"\n\nNapoli is a professor of interventional radiology at Sapienza University of Rome in Italy.\n\nHe and his colleagues plan to report their findings Tuesday at the Radiological Society of North America annual meeting, in Chicago. Such research is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nLower disk herniation results when the insulating disks that sit between spinal vertebrae tear open, allowing jelly-like material to protrude and exert pressure on surrounding nerve roots. Beyond lower back pain, the condition often triggers sciatica, a pain that radiates down a patient's leg.\n\nStandard therapies include over-the-counter pain meds, corticosteroid spinal injections, and/or invasive spine surgery that sometimes involves disk removal and vertebrae fusion.\n\nThe problem, said Napoli, is that such options entail risks without assured relief.\n\n\"Steroid injections are effective only in portion of the patients, and generally require more sessions,\" he noted. And though surgery safety has \"largely improved,\" Napoli pointed to the risk for bleeding and infection, the need for a minimum two- to three-day hospital stay, the high cost, and the fact that some patients ultimately realize little benefit.\n\nBy contrast, pRF is scalpel-free, delivering radio signals directly to affected nerves via a CT scan-guided electrode. The process, said Napoli, requires no hospital stay, is noninvasive, far cheaper and less risky.\n\n\"The rationale for using pRF on disk herniation is that we eliminate the inflammation process of the compromised nerve root,\" he explained. \"Without inflammation the pain fades, and the body starts a self-healing process that allows for complete resolution of the disk herniation in a large proportion of patients.\"\n\nFor the study, the Italian investigators compared 128 lumbar herniation patients who underwent a single 10-minute round of CT-guided pRF with 120 patients who received one to three rounds of steroid injections.\n\nAll the patients had already undergone standard interventions, with poor results.\n\nBy the one-year mark following either treatment, a full \"perceived\" recovery was reported by 95 percent of the pRF patients, compared with just 61 percent of the steroid injection patients.\n\nDr. Daniel Park, director of minimally invasive orthopedic spine surgery at William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich., offered some caution on the findings.\n\nHe noted that because \"the majority of people with back pain improve with time and exercise alone,\" it remains an open question as to whether the pRF procedure really cured the condition.\n\nStill, Park noted that diagnostic uncertainty can undermine the ability of surgery to get at the true source of a patient's pain, given that \"the problem with low back pain is that there are many causes of it, and physicians have trouble identifying the cause of pain.\"\n\nNevertheless, he remains unsure if pRF is truly ready for prime time.\n\n\"Best case, I think [pRF] could be an option for people if they [have already] failed therapy and medication,\" said Park. \"It may be a similar option for people if they do not or cannot have steroid injections, but they need more treatment.

It\u2019s a process that\u2019s undeniably inconvenient, yet one we\u2019re told is unquestionably necessary.\n\nThat\u2019s a shame. Because although colonoscopy certainly has its advantages, direct evidence that it\u2019s the best way to prevent deaths from colorectal cancer is not one of them. And the drawbacks of colonoscopy \u2014 including the time commitment, not-so-fun preparation, expense and small chance of harm \u2014 are probably keeping some people from participating in colorectal cancer screening.\n\nAccording to public health experts, that\u2019s a bad thing. The United States Preventive Services Task Force says the net benefit for screening adults age 50-75 is \u201csubstantial,\u201d adding that colorectal cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death in the country. But as of 2012, just 65 percent of eligible adults were being screened as recommended, and almost 28 percent had never been screened.\n\nAmong those who are screened, colonoscopy is by far the most popular method in the U.S. But there is a menu of options beyond colonoscopies \u2014 and they\u2019re not necessarily any better or worse, according to the USPSTF\u2019s recently finalized updated recommendations for screening among average-risk adults. The group said that while some tests are backed by more evidence than others, it found no head-to-head studies suggesting any strategy \u2014 including colonoscopy \u2014 is better than another. \u201cChoose the one that fits your preferences and lifestyle,\u201d said Douglas Owens, a physician and member of the task force.\n\nIncluded on the list are two cheap, at-home poop tests intended to be done annually: the guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) and a more sensitive test called the fecal immunochemical test, or FIT. Both look for tiny amounts of blood in the stool that might be shed by cancer or polyps. You get one from your doctor, take a poop sample at home, and then return the sample to the doctor. Only if you get a positive result do you need to have a colonoscopy. (These are different from a new stool-based DNA test, which while on the USPSTF\u2019s list is much more expensive and has been studied less.)\n\nOf the two, Richard Wender, a physician and chief cancer control officer of the American Cancer Society, said the FIT is preferable, both because it\u2019s more accurate and because it requires only one poop sample and no changes in diet. It costs about $25 or less and when done every year, the USPSTF\u2019s models estimate, it will avert 20-23 deaths from colorectal cancer per 1,000 people screened. (Wender doesn\u2019t recommend the OTC tests that are available.)\n\nThat\u2019s comparable to the two \u201cscope\u201d tests on the USPSTF\u2019s list, flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy, which have the advantage of both detecting and removing precancerous polyps in one procedure. (Flexible sigmoidoscopy, which looks at the lower part of the large intestine, has been shown by randomized trials to prevent deaths from colorectal cancer but isn\u2019t reimbursed as well as colonoscopy and is on the decline in the U.S.)\n\nColonoscopy is the most popular test in the U.S. In addition to its polyp-removing ability, if you have a negative test, you don\u2019t have to come back for another 10 years. There is indirect evidence it reduces colorectal cancer deaths, in the form of a large study following people who did and didn\u2019t get the test over time. And it seems logical that if sigmoidoscopy cuts colorectal cancer deaths, the more extensive colonoscopy must provide a similar benefit. But that\u2019s not yet been proved by randomized controlled trials. Based on the available evidence and its modeling, the USPSTF estimates it reduces deaths from colorectal cancer by 22-24 per 1,000 people screened.\n\nBut that lack of trial data is why the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care earlier this year recommended against using colonoscopy as a first-line screening method. \u201cThey were very clear: We\u2019re going to stick to the evidence, and right now we don\u2019t have evidence for colonoscopy,\u201d said Aasma Shaukat, section chief of gastroenterology in the Minneapolis VA Health Care System.\n\nColonoscopy also has plenty of downsides. It\u2019s expensive, running upward of $1,000. (The test is covered without cost sharing as preventive care under the Affordable Care Act.) Most people prefer to have sedation during the procedure, which means time off from work and finding a ride home. There\u2019s variation in the quality of the test, depending on who\u2019s doing it. There\u2019s a small but real risk of harm, such as a perforation.\n\nSo why do so many people prefer it to the poop test? For many, because they\u2019ve been told it\u2019s the best test to get. A 2012 study found primary care physicians overwhelmingly said they thought it was the best colorectal screening option. Katie Couric\u2019s on-air colonoscopy in March 2000 boosted awareness and increased colonoscopy rates. There\u2019s also a \u201cmore is better\u201d attitude when it comes to medicine among many people, said Shaukat. And colonoscopies are well-reimbursed for the physicians who perform them. Hospitals have focused on marketing colonoscopies rather than alternative tests.\n\nNo one is arguing colonoscopy is a bad test. It just hasn\u2019t been shown to be better than an annual FIT, said James Allison, a clinical professor of medicine emeritus at the University of California-San Francisco. He said the public health message is slowly changing to reflect that. The 80% by 2018 campaign from the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable, for example, which aims to increase the rate of screening, emphasizes a suite of options. \u201cPeople are very motivated to get screened when they hear colorectal cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer-related death and if they know there are tests that are affordable and can be done at home,\u201d said Wender.\n\nSo if you want a colonoscopy after talking with your physician and digging into all its pros and cons \u2014 fantastic. But if you prefer something less invasive but more frequent, you can test your poop every year without feeling like you\u2019re opting for, um, No. 2.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The story notes that what\u2019s novel here is that the U.S. Preventive Task Force recently finalized their guidelines on colon cancer screening.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Hate needles?

The muscle into which needles deliver vaccine is not nearly as active immunologically.\n\nPatches in the mouse study contained an array of 100 needles, each some 650 microns in length, or about the width of a few strands of human hair. Coated with inactivated flu virus, the patches are pressed manually into the skin, where the microneedles dissolve into bodily fluids.\n\n\"It's a technological approach that makes a lot of sense,\" said Dr. Jan Drutz, a general pediatrician at Texas Children's Hospital who calls needle-phobia common in both kids and adults. \"It would be a wonderful alternative to needles if it truly works in people and is pain free.\"\n\nNeedle-phobia, or trypanophobia, is a recognized medical condition that causes sufferers to avoid medical care. It is estimated to affect more than 10 percent of the adult population.\n\nIn the study, one group of mice received the influenza vaccine from traditional hypodermic needles; another group received the vaccine through the dissolving microneedles; and a control group received the microneedle patches not containing any vaccine.\n\nInfected with the influenza virus 30 days later, both groups that received the vaccine remained healthy while mice in the control group contracted the flu and died.\n\nThree months after vaccination, researchers exposed a different group of immunized mice to the flu virus and found that those who received the microneedles did better than those injected by the hypodermic needles.\n\nNoting that mice are much easier to vaccinate against the flu than humans, Baylor College of Medicine influenza expert Dr. Paul Glezen expressed skepticism about the patch until seeing it in human trials. But he said it will be interesting to watch.\n\nPrausnitz said he hopes to be testing the patch in people in two years and have a product on the shelves in five. He also said that although initially there will be start-up costs, he thinks the price will be no more than traditional flu vaccines once it is mass-produced.\n\nThe microneedle technology may also be used for other vaccinations, such as polio and measles, said Prausnitz. He said his team is working on those diseases but is not as far along.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "There are a variety of methods\u00a0under development for delivering painless injections, including a similar patch technology being investigated by Japanese researchers.

The vaccine won approval from the Food and Drug Administration on Feb. 3, and some doctors have received supplies of it.\n\nThe recommendation for universal use of the vaccine was approved at a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the federal panel that sets vaccination policy in the United States. It comes nearly seven years after an earlier rotavirus vaccine was withdrawn from the market for causing a potentially life-threatening form of intestinal blockage in some babies.\n\nVaccine-safety advocates are urging parents to be wary of the new vaccine because of that history. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the manufacturer, Merck & Co. Inc. of Whitehouse Station, N.J., have promised elaborate studies to catch any safety problems. Merck is selling the vaccine under the brand name RotaTeq.\n\nMerck has tested the vaccine in about 70,000 babies in 11 countries, one of the biggest vaccine trials ever conducted. That test ruled out a safety problem similar to the one that felled RotaShield, an earlier rotavirus vaccine developed by Wyeth, a drugmaker in Madison, N.J. But doctors said it is impossible to design a test big enough to catch all possible side effects that might show up once the product is used in millions of children.\n\nRotaTeq \"generally appears to have a better safety profile than the earlier vaccine,\" said Umesh D. Parashar, a medical epidemiologist at the CDC. \"But at the same time it's something we'll continue to look at, and hopefully confirm absence of risk.\"\n\nRotaTeq is expected to be one of the most expensive vaccines ever marketed, with Merck listing it at $187.50 wholesale for the three-dose series. That means many doctors are likely to charge more than $300 retail, putting the Merck product in league with Prevnar, an expensive Wyeth vaccine that has been widely used in the United States for five years. Prevnar, which protects children against certain types of pneumonia, became the first vaccine to meet the pharmaceutical industry's standard for a blockbuster product, with sales exceeding $1 billion a year.\n\nThe development of such high-priced vaccines is causing strains, particularly in state-sponsored vaccination programs for certain low-income children. But it is also drawing new manufacturers into the vaccine market, which many drug companies had abandoned in the 1980s and 1990s, citing too little profit.\n\nRotaShield appeared on the market in late 1998 but was pulled less than a year later after a handful of babies that received it developed a serious intestinal problem called intussusception, a type of bowel obstruction that occurs when the intestine folds in on itself, like a collapsing telescope.\n\nThe problem occurs naturally, albeit rarely; it showed up at a sharply elevated rate in babies who received RotaShield. Intussusception is life-threatening for some babies, though doctors can usually treat it.\n\nMany people have never heard of rotavirus, but it is one of the most common causes of childhood illness -- many ailments that parents or pediatricians describe as \"stomach flu\" are caused by rotavirus infection. Virtually every child in the world contracts the virus repeatedly by age 5, gradually building immunity.\n\nMost children get over rotavirus at home, but at least 55,000 American children are hospitalized every year after becoming dehydrated from vomiting and diarrhea associated with the infection. Fifty to 60 of them die, but it is a different story overseas, where babies often do not receive good medical care and hundreds of thousands die every year.\n\nRotaTeq contains live, but weakened, strains of rotavirus designed to build immunity without causing illness.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "", "answer": 1}, {"article": "From the Jewish to Mesoamerican \u201chouses of heat,\u201d people all over the world have long associated a good sweat with a wide assortment of health benefits. And some of the latest research seems to support those ideas.\n\nOne long-term study of middle-aged Finnish men found those who spent time in a sauna 2-3 days a week enjoyed a 23% drop in their risk for a fatal heart disease or episode. The heart health benefits were even greater for men who sweated it out in a sauna more frequently.\n\n\u201cSauna bathing leads to a significant increase in heart rate and reduction in total vascular resistance, thereby decreasing blood pressure,\u201d says Dr. Ernst van der Wall, chief of cardiology at the Netherlands Leiden University Medical Centre.\n\nIn a recent editorial appearing in the , van der Wall lays out the research in support of sauna bathing as a safe and salubrious habit for healthy people of all ages. He also says expert concerns about the safety of sauna bathing for those with heart conditions may be overblown. \u201cDeath in the sauna is a rare event, even in Finland where the frequency of sauna bathing is high,\u201d he writes.\n\nStill, the big questions surrounding sauna bathing\u2019s safety have always centered on its occupant\u2019s (and her heart\u2019s) ability to withstand the heat. Traditional saunas use either wood or electricity to warm the air in a chamber to a temperature of 185 degrees, which many people find unendurable for more than a few minutes.\n\nInfrared saunas, by contrast, do not heat the air around you. Using electromagnetic radiation, infrared lamps warm your body directly. That may sound freaky or even unsafe, but neonatal beds for newborns have long utilized infrared heating elements to ensure babies are kept warm without being stifled.\n\n\u201cAs infrared heat penetrates more deeply than warmed air, users develop a more vigorous sweat at a lower temperature than they would in traditional saunas,\u201d says Dr. Richard Beever, a clinical assistant professor of family medicine at the University of British Columbia.\n\nWhile there\u2019s not a ton of published research looking specifically at infrared saunas, Beever has published a review of all the existing studies he could turn up on the subject. He says there\u2019s evidence to support the use of infrared saunas for high blood pressure, congestive heart failure and chronic pain.\n\nPeople who spent 15 minutes a day for two weeks in an infrared sauna enjoyed a significant drop in blood pressure compared to a control group who spend the same amount of time in a \u201croom-temperature\u201d space, one Japanese study reported. More research found time spent in an infrared sauna could help even out irregular heartbeats, improve scores on physical fitness tests and boost endothelial function in the heart\u2019s vessels.\n\nBeever\u2019s review also looked at some of the other purported health benefits of infrared saunas\u2014including pain management. Among 46 chronic pain sufferers, those who spent time each day in a sauna for four weeks enjoyed a 54% improvement in sleep quality and were 27% more likely to return to work compared to a no-sauna group.\n\nBeever makes it clear all of these reports were based on small groups and require further study. Also, he found no strong evidence of lost weight, improved cholesterol scores or some of the other benefits frequently linked to sauna bathing\u2014infrared or otherwise.\n\nBut he also points out that no accidents or adverse reactions occurred in any of the studies he reviewed. (For men hoping to father children, spending time in hot saunas or baths has long been a no-no. Healthy sperm and heat don\u2019t play well together. Beever says infrared heat may damage sperm as do other forms of heat, but at this point there\u2019s no data on those risks.)\n\nSo what to think of infrared saunas? The existing evidence, though scanty, suggests spending up to 15 minutes a day in one could benefit your heart and ease symptoms associated with chronic pain. And, for now, there don\u2019t seem to be any significant health risks.\n\nAsk your doctor first.

Optimized statin therapy was defined as at least atorvastatin 20 mg or equivalent daily with a recommendation for at least atorvastatin 40 mg or equivalent daily where approved. Patients were randomized to receive Repatha subcutaneous 140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg monthly or placebo subcutaneous every two weeks or monthly.

Repatha binds to PCSK9 and inhibits circulating PCSK9 from binding to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR), preventing PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation and permitting LDLR to recycle back to the liver cell surface. By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, Repatha increases the number of LDLRs available to clear LDL from the blood, thereby lowering LDL-C levels.6\n\nRepatha is approved in more than 40 countries, including the U.S., Japan, Canada and in all 28 countries that are members of the European Union. Applications in other countries are pending.\n\nImportant U.S. Product Information\n\nRepatha\u00ae is indicated as an adjunct to diet and:\n\u2022 Maximally tolerated statin therapy for treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), who require additional lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)\n\u2022 Other LDL-lowering therapies (e.g., statins, ezetimibe, LDL apheresis) in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) who require additional lowering of LDL-C\n\nThe effect of Repatha\u00ae on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.\n\nThe safety and effectiveness of Repatha\u00ae have not been established in pediatric patients with HoFH who are younger than 13 years old.\n\nThe safety and effectiveness of Repatha\u00ae have not been established in pediatric patients with primary hyperlipidemia or HeFH.\n\nContraindication: Repatha\u00ae is contraindicated in patients with a history of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to Repatha\u00ae.\n\nAllergic reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. rash, urticaria) have been reported in patients treated with Repatha\u00ae, including some that led to discontinuation of therapy. If signs or symptoms of serious allergic reactions occur, discontinue treatment with Repatha\u00ae, treat according to the standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve.\n\nAdverse reactions: The most common adverse reactions (>5% of Repatha\u00ae-treated patients and more common than placebo) were: nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, influenza, back pain, and injection site reactions.\n\nIn a 52-week trial, adverse reactions led to discontinuation of treatment in 2.2% of Repatha\u00ae-treated patients and 1% of placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction that led to Repatha\u00ae treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo was myalgia (0.3% versus 0% for Repatha\u00ae and placebo, respectively).\n\nAdverse reactions from a pool of the 52-week trial and seven 12-week trials:\n\nLocal injection site reactions occurred in 3.2% and 3.0% of Repatha\u00ae -treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most common injection site reactions were erythema, pain, and bruising. The proportions of patients who discontinued treatment due to local injection site reactions in Repatha\u00ae -treated patients and placebo-treated patients were 0.1% and 0%, respectively.\n\nAllergic reactions occurred in 5.1% and 4.7% of Repatha\u00ae -treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most common allergic reactions were rash (1.0% versus 0.5% for Repatha\u00ae and placebo, respectively), eczema (0.4% versus 0.2%), erythema (0.4% versus 0.2%), and urticaria (0.4% versus 0.1%).\n\nNeurocognitive events were reported in less than or equal to 0.2% in Repatha\u00ae-treated and placebo-treated patients.\n\nIn a pool of placebo- and active-controlled trials, as well as open-label extension studies that followed them, a total of 1,988 patients treated with Repatha\u00ae had at least one LDL-C value <25 mg/dL. Changes to background lipid-altering therapy were not made in response to low LDL-C values, and Repatha\u00ae dosing was not modified or interrupted on this basis. Although adverse consequences of very low LDL-C were not identified in these trials, the long-term effects of very low levels of LDL-C induced by Repatha\u00ae are unknown.\n\nMusculoskeletal adverse reactions were reported in 14.3% of Repatha\u00ae -treated patients and 12.8% of placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions that occurred at a rate greater than placebo were back pain (3.2% versus 2.9% for Repatha\u00ae and placebo, respectively), arthralgia (2.3% versus 2.2%), and myalgia (2.0% versus 1.8%).\n\nHomozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH): In 49 patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia studied in a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 33 patients received 420 mg of\n\nRepatha\u00ae subcutaneously once monthly. The adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2 (6.1%) Repatha\u00ae-treated patients and more frequently than in placebo-treated patients, included upper respiratory tract infection (9.1% versus 6.3%), influenza (9.1% versus 0%), gastroenteritis (6.1% versus 0%), and nasopharyngitis (6.1% versus 0%).\n\nImmunogenicity: Repatha\u00ae is a human monoclonal antibody.

Drugs that target the protein are currently being tested in clinical trials for other cancers.\n\nThe findings, reported online today by the journal Cancer Discovery, raise the prospect that Ezh2 blockers, in combination with Gleevec and similar drugs, could eradicate the disease in some patients in relatively rapid fashion or could be an effective therapy for those who become resistant to Gleevec-like agents, the authors state.\n\nIn a paper published simultaneously by Cancer Discovery, a team of Scottish scientists report similar findings using a different research approach.\n\n\"The vast majority of patients with CML do remarkably well on imatinib [Gleevec] and similar drugs: The disease is well controlled and side effects are tolerable,\" says Stuart Orkin, MD, the study's senior author and a pediatric hematologist/oncologist at Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center. \"In only 10-20 percent of patients, however, are the leukemia cells fully cleared from the body. The other 90 percent retain a reservoir of leukemic stem cells - which initiate the disease - and must stay on the drugs permanently.\"\n\nCML is a slowly progressing type of blood cancer that develops in the bone marrow. Primarily occurring in adults, it is rare in children.\n\nOver time, some patients develop resistance to Gleevec and other drugs that block BCR-ABL, the misbegotten \"fusion\" protein that drives CML growth. Although second- and third-line targeted therapies can often return the disease to remission, some patients don't benefit from these drugs or develop severe side effects.\n\nThe new study grew out of efforts to discover whether different types of cancer are susceptible to Ezh2 inhibitors. In laboratory experiments, the Dana-Farber/Boston Children's researchers found not only that Ezh2 is overabundant in leukemia stem cells but that it helps them survive and give rise to full-fledged CML cells. Follow-up studies in mice showed that inactivating Ezh2 through gene-editing techniques caused CML stem cells to die, halting the disease at its source.\n\n\"The stem cells' dependence on Ezh2 suggests they will be especially vulnerable to drugs that target the protein,\" Orkin remarks. \"Such drugs are already in clinical trials for other diseases, including lymphoma and some solid tumors.\"\n\nEpizyme, a biopharmaceutical company based in Cambridge, MA, recently opened a pediatric trial of an Ezh2 inhibitor for children with rhabdoid and other tumors. Dana-Farber/Boston Children's is a site in the multi-center Phase 1 trial.\n\nAlthough adding Ezh2-targeting agents to the standard drug regimen for CML has the potential to dramatically shorten the treatment period for many patients, ethical considerations may lead to the agents' first being tested in patients who don't respond to Gleevec and similar drugs, either initially or after drug resistance develops, Orkin remarks. \"Our findings suggest inhibition of Ezh2 should be considered as a way to eradicate CML when used in combination with current targeted therapies. It offers a promising approach to shortening the duration of therapy in order to achieve a cure. If successful, the cost savings of such an approach could also be significant.\"\n\nJoining senior author Orkin, the study's lead author is Huafeng Xie, PhD, of Dana/Farber/Boston Children's.

The current standard of care for such children is based mostly on the assumption that they need to eat to regain their strength. Therefore, the method that is applied worldwide is to artificially feed these children during the first days of their stay in intensive care.

The four-day conference, which began Monday, is being held at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, Downtown.\n\nThe government has approved use of growth hormone for a limited array of conditions in adults and children, Dr. Merriam said.

University of Pennsylvania researchers Rebecca Ashare and Heath Schmidt saw potential for a permanent cessation solution in a class of FDA-approved medications used to improve cognitive impairments from Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn a study consisting of a rat trial and a human trial, Ashare and Schmidt studied the effects of two acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, or AChEIs, called galantamine and donepezil on overall nicotine intake. The rat component showed that pretreating the rodents with an AChEI decreased their nicotine consumption. Consistent with these effects, clinical trial participants taking the AChEI, not the placebo, smoked 2.3 fewer cigarettes daily, a 12 percent decrease, and noted feeling less satisfied with the cigarettes they did smoke.\n\n\"We're very interested in screening potential efficacy of anti-addiction medications in our models,\" said Schmidt, a professor in Penn's School of Nursing and Perelman School of Medicine. \"For this study, we looked at potential smoking-cessation medications.\"\n\nThe research itself took a translational approach, what Ashare, a professor in Penn Medicine's psychiatry department, calls bi-directional. In other words, the preclinical data informed the clinical study and vice versa.\n\nAt Penn's Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Nicotine Addiction, work on smoking cessation has been ongoing since 2001. Specifically, research from Caryn Lerman, CIRNA's director and the Mary W. Calkins Professor in Psychiatry, concluded that people who quit smoking often report a decrease in what's commonly called their executive functions.\n\n\"They feel fuzzy. They're forgetful,\" Ashare said. \"Those deficits are related to their ability to quit smoking. It was this clinical aspect of smoking cessation we thought would be useful to take further.\"\n\nThat's when they turned to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.\n\nIn the brain, the neurotransmitter called acetylcholine is important to cognitive functions like learning and short-term memory. When nicotine enters the body, it binds to the same receptors in the brain that acetylcholine binds to, resulting in smoking's rewarding and reinforcement effects. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors increase acetylcholine levels in the brain and, in effect, substitute nicotine's effects.\n\nSchmidt had successfully employed such a model with other addictive substances like cocaine. He divided a group of rats into galantamine and donepezil cohorts. To mirror voluntary drug taking in humans, the rats self-administered nicotine using a lever pushed at will. Once nicotine-taking stabilized, the rats were pretreated with one of the two AChEIs.\n\nFor both drugs, \"we were able to show a reduction in total nicotine self-administered,\" Schmidt said; however, there was a caveat.\n\n\"We know from the literature that upward of 30 percent of patients will report nausea and vomiting [when taking these drugs], and this will limit their compliance,\" he said. \"We had seen that these drugs reduced nicotine self-administration, but we wanted to make sure it wasn't because the rats were sick.\"\n\nUnlike humans who can verbally report when they don't feel well and whose bodies react to nausea, rats lack the reflex to vomit. In previous research, Matthew Hayes, who has appointments in Penn Medicine and Penn Nursing, had shown that in rats kaolin clay consumption coats the stomach like an antacid and quells any ill effects. Collaborating with Hayes, Schmidt offered the animals kaolin clay, then compared how much they ate normally and with the addition of the AChEIs.\n\n\"At the doses shown to reduce nicotine self-administration, the AChEIs did not make our animals sick,\" Schmidt said. The findings sparked the CIRNA clinical trial, which has to date studied 33 smokers ages 18 to 60.\n\nPeople who were interested in quitting smoking signed on for 23 days. For the first two weeks, they continued to smoke but also took either galantamine or a placebo. Before the trial began, researchers assessed the smokers' cognitive function to get a baseline. Participants followed the regimen for two weeks and then were asked to not smoke for one full day. Two more assessments took place: after the two weeks on the cigarette-drug combination and again after that initial smoke-free day. Finally, the researchers asked the study subjects to do their best to not smoke for seven straight days, a time during which the participants still took either galantamine or a placebo.\n\n\"That week-long period is a proxy for longer-term cessation. The ability to quit smoking the first week after you make a quit attempt is highly predictive of long-term success,\" Ashare said.\n\nShe's still actively recruiting for the trial, with an aim of 80 people total. Once the trial reaches that number, she'll dig into overall quit data. What she's learned so far -- that smokers who used the FDA-approved galantamine smoked fewer cigarettes per day and enjoyed them less -- is promising, particularly given that those who don't smoke during that first crucial week are 32 times more likely to quit smoking permanently.\n\n\"Our goal in investigating these different repurposed medications is not to replace the medications that are already available,\" she said. \"We know that they're effective. Our goal is to target different populations of smokers who may be more likely to experience these cognitive deficits.\"\n\nThere's no data to suggest that a clinician treating a smoker should prescribe one of these AChEIs now. But Ashare and Schmidt are forging a path, and, if it leads where they think it might, it could provide smokers yet another option to help them quit.\n\nAshare and Schmidt published their work in the Nature journal Translational Psychiatry.", "question": "Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The news release makes a tepid reference to novelty with the phrase that researchers are \u201cforging a path\u201d with this research.

In men, T plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass and growth of body hair. In addition, T is essential for overall health and well-being and for the prevention of osteoporosis. Insufficient levels of circulating T in men, contributes to frailty and bone loss.\n\nIn the absence of large, prospective, placebo-controlled clinical trials of longer duration, substantial evidence regarding the safety and risk of testosterone therapy (TTh) with regard to cardiovascular outcomes can only be gleaned from observational studies. To date, there are limited studies comparing the effects of long-term TTh in hypogonadal men who were treated or remained untreated with T.\n\nResearchers at Boston University Schools of Medicine (BUSM) and Public Health (BUSPH), along with researchers in Germany, established a registry to assess long-term effectiveness and safety of T in men. For this study, they sought to compare its effects on a host of parameters (obesity, cholesterol levels, diabetes, liver function) considered to contribute to cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe researchers followed a group of men for eight years who had been on TTh and compared them with another group of men who remained untreated for the same time period. They found there were only two deaths in the TTh group and neither was related to CV events. In the non-treated control group, there were 21 deaths, 19 of which were related to CV events. Furthermore, there were 26 non-fatal myocardial infarctions and 30 non-fatal strokes in the control group but none in the T-treated group.\n\nAccording to the researchers, long-term TTh in men with hypogonadism appears to be an effective approach to achieve sustained improvements in cardiometabolic function and reduces the risk of CV events. \"The low CV events observed in the T-group compared to the untreated (control) group strongly suggest that TTh is protective.

By the third week, he said, both he and friends he asked for reactions were seeing results. \u201cI even busted out the old \u2018before\u2019 and \u2018after\u2019 pictures,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a noticeable difference.\u201d\n\nBut Latisse does not appear to be a silver bullet for hair loss. Instead, it appears to work in much the same way as Rogaine or Propecia: All three can strengthen and darken hair that grows from a dying follicle, but none can bring a dead one back to life. The result is an enhanced, refortified hairline rather than a brand new head of hair.\n\nAside from hair transplants, which can cost about $10,000 each and do not always look natural, the only current hope for complete replacement is hair cloning, the act of producing entirely new hair from the DNA of an existing one, which researchers have been attempting, unsuccessfully, for years.\n\nA pair of researchers last year claimed to grow new hair by combining plucked hair with a wound-healing powder made by ACell, a regenerative-medicine company in Columbia, Md. Though the claim was met with some skepticism by other clinicians, the idea that ACell\u2019s powder, which has been approved by the government, could facilitate new hair growth has breathed new life into the race to clone hair.\n\nDr. Robert M. Bernstein, clinical professor of dermatology at Columbia University, is now one of several researchers experimenting with the product.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a question of time now\u201d before hair cloning becomes a reality, Dr. Bernstein said. \u201cWe keep on moving back that time, but I think there\u2019s absolutely no doubt that it\u2019s going to be done.\u201d\n\nHe believes hair cloning will be commercially available within 10 years. This may sound like a long time to wait, but \u201cit\u2019s important to remember that baldness is unlike other conditions where you can progress past the point of being helped,\u201d Dr. Bernstein said. \u201cOnce we have a cure for hair loss, everyone will be able to benefit.\u201d\n\nIt has been been 14 years since the F.D.A. approved a new hair-loss remedy (Propecia, in 1997), so it is understandable that anticipation for a new one might be running high. One advantage of Latisse is that it needs to be applied only once a day (Rogaine needs to be applied twice; Propecia is taken once daily), and does not seem to cause reactions in people who are allergic to minoxidil.\n\nIt is, however, expensive: a month\u2019s supply of Latisse can cost up to $150, and that is in amounts appropriate for use merely on the eyelashes. Rogaine, which is also available over the counter now, costs about $25 a month, and a month\u2019s supply of Propecia runs about $75. (Even Mr. Paduda has now switched to Propecia, citing cost.)\n\nThe potential for Latisse is not lost on Allergan. The company initiated a Phase 1 clinical study in August to determine whether bimatoprost can be used as a treatment in men and women suffering from hair loss (alopecia).\n\n\u201cThere is a great deal of interest in developing other uses of bimatoprost,\u201d Heather Katt, a spokeswoman for Allergan, wrote in an e-mail message, \u201cand Allergan is exploring ways to pursue that pathway through the F.D.A. approval process.\u201d\n\nFor those too impatient to wait, there is also the bold and fashionable solution of shaving one\u2019s head.\n\nBut the fact is that many men \u2014 and women \u2014 simply do not accept baldness easily.\n\n\u201cHair has been an evolutionary sign of health and sexuality and youth, and that doesn\u2019t change,\u201d Dr. Bernstein said. \u201cShaved heads look cool, but not everyone wants one, and not everyone looks good with one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have really dark eyebrows,\u201d he said. \u201cI would look like a psycho if I shaved my head.\u201d", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The product definitely appears to be novel, and the story does a good job placing it in the right context.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Monitoring high-risk pregnancies with ultrasound tests may help prevent some fetal and newborn deaths, a new research review finds.\n\nThe review assessed a technology called Doppler ultrasound, which measures blood flow through the umbilical cord.

Typically, high-risk women would receive other types prenatal testing as well, such as electronic fetal-heart monitoring.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just saying this (Doppler ultrasound) should be part of it,\u201d Alfirevic said.\n\nIn practice, Doppler ultrasound may also be recommended for women who have diabetes or are having a prolonged pregnancy (beyond 42 weeks). But there is not yet strong evidence that these women benefit, Alfirevic said.\n\nIn general, he and his colleagues found, the trials included in the review, which were mainly done in the 1990s, had their shortcomings. Some had flaws in their design, while in other cases the researchers failed to provide details on key elements of the study design.\n\nHowever, with Doppler an established technique for monitoring high-risk pregnancies, Alfirevic said it is very unlikely that any future studies will test Doppler against no Doppler \u2014 as most studies in this review did.\n\nResearch, according to Alfirevic, has moved on to other questions, including how to best manage abnormal findings from a Doppler scan.\n\nIn some cases, early delivery may be the best course, but it is unclear whether other options \u2014 such as bed rest or tighter blood pressure control in a woman with high blood pressure \u2014 are effective.\n\nAnother question, Alfirevic said, is whether ultrasounds of blood vessels other than the umbilical artery might improve pregnancy outcomes.\n\nOne thing that is clear, the researcher stressed, is that Doppler ultrasound is not necessary for women with average, healthy pregnancies.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence to suggest that it should be done in low-risk women,\u201d Alfirevic said.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "1clip_filelist.xml\" rel=\"File-List\"/>\n\n\n\nThe story notes that Doppler ultrasound is an established technology and that most of the studies reviewed were done in the 1990s.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Lynden, WA - August 24, 2017 - Initial findings from several studies - including both human subjects and animals - on the potential health benefits of red raspberries were presented earlier this year at the 2017 Experimental Biology conference in Chicago.

While this emerging research is promising, and contributes to the overall understanding of the health benefits of red raspberries, conclusions cannot be drawn at this time.\n\nIn this human trial, investigators from the Center for Nutrition Research at the Illinois Institute of Technology looked at two study groups: obese individuals with impaired fasting glucose and hyperinsulinemia (PreDM) and healthy weight individuals with normo-glycemia and insulinemia. Participants experienced a significant reduction in postprandial glucose when 2 cups (250g) of red raspberries were consumed with meals compared to no raspberries. The glucose lowering was accompanied with less insulin suggesting improved insulin sensitivity in individuals with pre-diabetes and insulin resistance.\n\n* Xiao, D. Huang, Y. Park, E.

Consumption of the red raspberry puree and the fructo-oligiosaccharide for 4 weeks resulted in decreased Firmicutes and increased Bacteroidetes, which was more pronounced after red raspberry intake. Additionally, a type of bacteria called Akkermansia that has been associated with metabolic health was increased during red raspberry intake only. These preliminary results are promising.

Plaque in these arteries is a red flag for a potential heart attack. (Agatston does not make any money from the coronary calcium scan.)\n\nThe other imaging test Agatston recommends is an ultrasound of the carotid artery, looking at plaque in the main blood vessel leading to the brain. Plaque in the carotid artery is a sign of increased risk for a heart attack and stroke.\n\nBoth tests are non-invasive and outpatient, although the calcium scan does expose the patient to the equivalent of several months of normal background radiation.\n\nOne large federally funded study found the coronary calcium score a better predictor of coronary events like a heart attack than the traditional Framingham Risk Score, which considers age, cigarette smoking, blood pressure, total cholesterol and HDL, the \"good\" cholesterol.\n\nAgatston thinks the coronary calcium scan should be routinely scheduled at age 50, like a colonoscopy, or earlier for people with family histories of heart disease.\n\nMost hospitals now offer the imaging tests, some at less than $100 for both, and they are often covered by insurance.\n\nCardiologists now generally use the calcium scan only for patients considered at intermediate risk for heart disease, determined by traditional measures such as cholesterol, blood pressure, lifestyle and family history.\n\nHigh-risk patients already receive such aggressive treatment as cholesterol-lowering statin medication, but many doctors don't think low-risk patients need to incur the expense or small dose of radiation that comes with a coronary calcium scan.\n\n\"There is a large group in the middle called intermediate risk, which may be as much as 50% of the population,\" said Dr. Erin Michos, a cardiologist at the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at Johns Hopkins University\n\nA good candidate for a coronary calcium scan, she says, would be a 50-year-old man with slightly elevated cholesterol and a father who had a heart attack.\n\n\"Do you put this 50-year-old who has this family history on a statin medication with potential expense (and) side effects for the next four decades of his life, or do you further refine how far at risk he is?\" she asked.\n\nA calcium score would answer that question, she says.\n\nThere's a third test Agatston likes: a $65 blood test that looks at a patient's LDL, or bad cholesterol. LDL particles come in different sizes, and patients with a lot of small-particle LDL are more likely to build up plaque in their blood vessels, Agatston says. Alternately, patients with large LDL particles do not tend to accumulate plaque.\n\n\"There are a lot of little old ladies in their 80s with very high cholesterol who have squeaky clean vessels. They have very large particles, and they don't get into the vessel wall,\" Agatston says.\n\nThese new tests give patients a chance to make major changes in their diet and lifestyle, and give doctors an opportunity to treat them with medication.\n\n\"One of the best-kept secrets in the country in medicine is the doctors who are practicing aggressive prevention are really seeing heart attacks and strokes disappear from their practices.

Removing clots appears to have increased the risk of stroke in the month after clots were removed, the Canadian researchers report.\n\n\"There has been some controversy about removing blood clots during the treatment of heart attacks,\" said lead researcher Dr. Sanjit Jolly, an associate professor of cardiology at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.\n\nA study in 2008 suggested that removing clots during an angioplasty might save lives, he said. \"Guidelines changed based on this study,\" Jolly noted. Another trial in 2013, however, suggested that removing clots was not beneficial, he added.\n\nIn this latest trial, researchers found that routinely removing clots was not beneficial, Jolly said.\n\nJolly isn't sure why removing clots causes additional problems. It is possible that parts of the clot break off and travel elsewhere in the heart or brain, he said.\n\n\"This is an unexpected finding, and we want to confirm this in other studies,\" Jolly said.\n\nJolly said there are mechanical methods of removing clots, which were not tested in this study. Whether these methods would have produced better results isn't clear. \"The jury is out on that. It needs to be tested in large trials,\" he said.\n\nHowever, preliminary results from small trials of mechanical clot removal have not been promising, Jolly noted.\n\nJolly said the lesson from his team's trial is that clot removal should be used only as a rescue treatment when an angioplasty fails to clear an artery.\n\n\"As a routine therapy, clot removal is not beneficial and could have some significant downsides,\" he said.\n\nThe results of the study were published online March 16 in the New England Journal of Medicine to coincide with a planned presentation of the findings at the American College of Cardiology's annual meeting in San Diego.\n\nFor the study, Jolly and colleagues randomly assigned 10,732 patients undergoing an angioplasty after a heart attack to have clots manually removed or to not have them removed.\n\nAmong all the patients, 6.9 percent who had clots removed, and 7 percent of those who didn't, died, had another heart attack or developed heart failure in the 180 days after the procedure.\n\nIn the 30 days after the procedure, 0.7 percent of the patients who had clots removed suffered a stroke, as did 0.3 percent of those who only had angioplasty, Jolly's team found.\n\nDr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said, \"This is a very important and eagerly awaited clinical trial.\"\n\nA number of studies have suggested a benefit from manually removing clots during an angioplasty, but this trial found no clinical benefits for doing so, he said.\n\n\"These findings will likely have important implications for clinical practice,\" Fonarow said.\n\nVisit the U.S. National Library of Medicine for more on angioplasty.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The story makes clear that there was prior research on this topic showing benefit from clot removal.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "There is no significant difference between zinc acetate lozenges and zinc gluconate lozenges regarding their efficacy in shortening the duration of common colds according to a meta-analysis published in Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine Open. Seven randomized trials with zinc acetate and zinc gluconate lozenges found that the duration of colds was shortened on average by 33%.\n\nZinc lozenges appear to influence the common cold through the release of free zinc ions into the oro-pharyngeal region. However, zinc ions can bind tightly to various chemical complexes in such a way that little or no free zinc ions are released. Previously zinc lozenges containing citric acid were shown to be ineffective in treating colds because citric acid binds zinc ions very tightly and no free zinc is released.\n\nZinc acetate has been proposed as the most ideal salt for zinc lozenges since acetate binds to zinc ions very weakly. Zinc gluconate is another salt that has been frequently used in zinc lozenges. However, gluconate binds the zinc ion more tightly than acetate does. Because of the somewhat stronger binding, zinc gluconate has been proposed to be less suitable constituent for lozenges. Although the binding difference between zinc acetate and zinc gluconate is a fact, it is not evident whether that causes significant differences at the clinical level for treating the common cold.\n\nIn the meta-analysis, Dr. Harri Hemil\u00e4 from the University of Helsinki, Finland, collected randomized trials on zinc acetate and zinc gluconate lozenges and compared their observed efficacies. Three trials had used zinc acetate lozenges and found that colds were shortened on average by 40%. Four trials had used zinc gluconate lozenges and colds were shortened on average by 28%. The 12% difference between the average effects of the two kinds of lozenges was explained purely by random variation. Furthermore, one of the zinc gluconate lozenge trials was an outlier inconsistent with all the other six zinc lozenge trials. If that outlier trial was excluded, the difference between the three zinc acetate and the three zinc gluconate trials shrinked to just 2%, i.e., a 40% vs. 38% reduction in common cold duration. Thus, properly composed zinc gluconate lozenges may be as effective as zinc acetate lozenges.\n\nDr. Hemil\u00e4 also analyzed the dose response relationship between the elemental zinc dose and the observed efficacy in reducing common cold duration. There was no difference in the efficacy between five trials that used 80 to 92 mg of zinc per day and the two trials that used 192 and 207 mg of zinc per day. Thus, zinc doses of over 100 mg per day do not seem to provide any more benefit.\n\nAccording to Dr. Hemil\u00e4, there is no justification for the popular phrase that \"there is no cure for the common cold\" because of the strong evidence that zinc lozenges can shorten common cold duration by over 30%. However, in future studies the optimal composition of zinc lozenges should be investigated. The optimum frequency of their administration also warrants further investigation. Nevertheless, he also considers that \"the current evidence of efficacy for zinc lozenges is so strong that common cold patients should be encouraged to try them for treating their colds, but the patients should ascertain that the lozenges do not contain citric acid or its salt citrate.\"", "question": "Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "This release release doesn\u2019t claim the use of zinc lozenges to fight the common cold is a novel idea.

He was there to demonstrate \u2014 although not actually repeat \u2014 a procedure known as transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, in which electromagnetic impulses are fired into carefully targeted areas of a patient\u2019s brain. TMS activates neurological pathways and is most commonly used to treat depression.\n\nRobison, 58, is autistic. At age 40, the Amherst resident was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s syndrome, a developmental disorder marked by impaired social skills and difficulty with nonverbal communication. Although highly competent in fields like electronics, sound design, and car mechanics, Robison found his limited ability to read body language and other unspoken cues left him feeling cut off from normal human interaction.\n\nBeginning in 2008, Robison voluntarily underwent roughly a dozen TMS sessions as part of a research study conducted at BIDMC\u2019s Berenson-Allen Center for Noninvasive Brain Stimulation. The results are chronicled in Robison\u2019s new book, \u201cSwitched On: A Memoir of Brain Change and Emotional Awakening.\u201d\n\nIn a moving, often harrowing narrative reminiscent of \u201cAwakenings\u201d and other popular works by the late neurologist and writer Oliver Sacks, Robison writes of the transformations these sessions helped unlock, the welcome ones \u2014 and the not so welcome.\n\nAfter his initial TMS session, Robison experienced music on a visceral level he had once known, long ago, but sensed he had lost. He burst into tears. \u201cThe experience was richer and deeper, with an added layer of feeling,\u201d he writes. \u201cPerhaps I was hearing music pure and true, without the distorting lens of autism.\u201d\n\nOther striking changes in perception and mood soon followed. Some proved transitory, others seemingly more permanent.\n\n\u201cThe change in my ability to relate to people is really, really big,\u201d he said during an interview in a hospital conference room.\n\nHis book is likely to spark even greater interest \u2014 and funding \u2014 in TMS as a non-medicinal way to treat symptoms associated with disabilities like autism, epilepsy, ADHD, and dementia. Robison certainly hopes so.\n\n\u201cMy world is strikingly different, even if the TMS energy is all dissipated,\u201d he said. He maintains his ability to read body language and communicate his own feelings through facial expression have improved dramatically.\n\n\u201cI feel I hear music with more clarity, too. Whether I think it\u2019s there, or it really is there, it\u2019s all the same,\u201d added Robison, a physically large man who smiles easily and often. To a reporter who first met him a decade ago, the changes in his demeanor are obvious: more relaxed, less guarded, more emotionally engaged.\n\nRobison also happens to be a gifted writer \u2014 his 2007 memoir \u201cLook Me in the Eye: My Life With Asperger\u2019s\u201d was a critically acclaimed bestseller. He\u2019s also a prolific blogger with a knack for dredging wry humor out of awkward situations.\n\nStill, for all the positive changes described in \u201cSwitched On,\u201d Robison\u2019s fourth book, there were negatives he was forced to deal with. TMS treatments chipped away at what he calls his \u201cprotective shield\u201d of autism, he writes, leaving him disoriented and depressed at times.\n\nHis second marriage, to a woman who herself suffered from chronic depression, came undone within a year of his initial TMS sessions. He frequently fell behind schedule at work (Robison runs a high-end car repair business in Springfield and lives in Amherst). Old friendships fell apart. As Robison\u2019s public profile rose \u2014 since \u201cLook Me in the Eye,\u201d he has divided his time between the car business and advocating on behalf of autism awareness \u2014 it disrupted his life on many levels.\n\nAt his lowest point, in 2009, Robison considered killing himself. Gaining and then losing abilities he\u2019d never possessed caused \u201ca mixture of sadness and wonder,\u201d Robison writes, summing up his condition in one word: \u201cjarred.\u201d\n\nRobison has previously written about growing up in Western Massachusetts in an intellectually prominent family (his father taught philosophy, his mother wrote poetry) plagued by alcoholism and mental illness. Much of that dysfunction was also chronicled in \u201cRunning With Scissors,\u201d the 2002 best-selling memoir by Robison\u2019s brother, Augusten Burroughs.\n\n\u201cSwitched On\u201d revisits that dark and stormy past. Yet it is more than a linear account of a life transformed by cutting-edge medical technology.\n\nA \u201ctechno geek\u201d with a deep knowledge of mechanical and electrical systems \u2014 he once worked as a sound engineer and special-effects designer for the rock band KISS \u2014 Robison delves into the latest brain-research findings and TMS\u2019s potential to help others like himself. He celebrates neurodiversity more generally, too, a subject he has been teaching at William & Mary College and Harvard Medical School.\n\nDuring the interview, Robison addressed the concerns and hopes he took into his TMS sessions, and the impact they\u2019ve had on his life since then. People close to him questioned whether the risk was worth it. Or even if an \u201cimproved\u201d version of himself would be someone they could love as much.\n\n\u201cSome thought I was crazy to let them do that to my brain, but I never had that fear,\u201d said Robison. \u201cThe technology was thoroughly familiar to me. And even though I knew these kinds of things could be dangerous if used wrong, I had confidence that a Harvard teaching hospital would use them safely.\u201d\n\nWeighing the risk-reward balance, he continued, \u201cI wondered, what if [the sessions] could really turn me on to being sensitive to other people? I\u2019d concluded that one reason I was kind of down was, I could not receive all these messages of love and kindness coming my way. People would ask, \u2018Can\u2019t you tell how happy you made us?\u2019 Well, no, I\u2019d say. I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nEven a 1 percent chance at success seemed worth the odds, Robison went on. And even if, as he\u2019d been warned, any changes in brain function might last only half as long as the 30-minute treatments themselves.\n\nThe negatives? These, too, he has come to accept.\n\n\u201cI was probably naive at the outset,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI had this idea that if I could only \u2018get\u2019 these happy messages, I would be happier. It didn\u2019t occur to me that most of the news out there, most of the emotion, is, if not bad, at least not all good. Not sweetness and light but a world of angst and avarice and greed. It was overpowering.\u201d\n\nRobison\u2019s TMS research team was led by Harvard neurologist Dr. Alvaro Pascual-Leone, who supplies an introduction to \u201cSwitched On.\u201d In a separate interview, Pascual-Leone says Robison\u2019s book demonstrates how small changes in brain function, however temporary, can have a life-changing impact.\n\nImagine, Pascual-Leone says, someone who cannot see color being told the sky is blue \u2014 an abstract, meaningless concept. Suddenly, for a brief period, he\u2019s able to see the sky in color. Forever after, the idea of \u201cblue\u201d will no longer be meaningless.\n\n\u201cNow translate that concept to emotions,\u201d he continues. \u201cIf you can give [someone like Robison] an idea of what emotions may be hidden behind a voice or face, then it enables his brain, without TMS, to change the way he approaches life and people.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Pascual-Leone acknowledges that these changes can be challenging as well as beneficial, as Robison describes. A recent paper by the BIDMC team concluded that TMS, while appealing and worth further study, is not yet recommended as an autism treatment. Rather, it may be best used to alleviate certain symptoms associated with spectrum disorder, including depression.\n\nStill, there are a number of clinics currently offering TMS as an autism treatment, a practice that concerns many researchers. \u201cPeople are desperate to help their loved ones, which I understand,\u201d Pascual-Leone says. \u201cWill it get more attention because of John\u2019s book?

Although ACE inhibitors were developed 10 years earlier, both types of drugs showed similar effects in the analysis, challenging previous findings that suggest ACE inhibitors have greater benefits.\n\nAccording to the new analysis, published online Jan. 4 in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings, the only difference between the medications is that ARBs are more easily tolerated.\n\n\"There has been debate for many years over the safety and efficacy of ACE inhibitors compared to ARBs, with many of them using an 'ACE inhibitor-first' approach, with ARBs regarded as less effective,\" study author Dr. Sripal Bangalore said in a medical center news release.\n\n\"We believe that our study ends the debate and gives physicians the option to prescribe either drug for their patients,\" added Bangalore, an associate professor in the division of cardiology, in the department of medicine at NYU Langone.\n\nBoth ARBs and ACE inhibitors interfere with the function of a hormone called angiotensin II, which regulates blood pressure, but they do this in different ways, the study authors said.\n\nAngiotensin II restricts blood flow through vessels, raising blood pressure. ACE inhibitors prevent the body from making angiotensin II, while ARBs prevent the hormone from doing its job by taking its place on the surface of blood vessels, the researchers explained.\n\nPrevious studies have suggested that older ACE inhibitors are more effective than ARBs. But, this latest analysis attributed that difference to changes in the standard of care over the decade between trials of the two types of drugs, greater emphasis on quitting smoking, and wider use of cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins.\n\nHowever, when trials were conducted at similar times, one drug was not more effective than the other, the findings showed.\n\n\"This is the first time that we have a clear and consistent message from the three buckets of trials of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, all of which show that there is no outcome difference between the two agents, except for better tolerability of ARBs,\" Bangalore said.\n\n\"The results of our analysis are especially important for patients, given that many ARBs are now also generic, which reduces their costs,\" he added.\n\nFor more about blood pressure drugs, visit the American Heart Association.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The story reports, perhaps too conclusively, that the new analysis finds both ACE inhibitors and ARBs to be equally effective, possibly ending a debate among physicians for some time over which medication is preferable to treat cardiovascular disease.\u00a0 Given the prevalence of the disease among the population, and attention paid to it as a public health concern, the story is justifiably novel.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "WEDNESDAY, April 21, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Researchers are reporting that a drug is showing promise in early testing as a possible new treatment for hepatitis C, a stubborn and potentially deadly liver ailment.\n\nIt's too early to tell if the drug actually works, and it will be years before it's ready to seek federal approval to be prescribed to patients. Still, the drug -- or others like it in development -- could add to the power of new drugs in the pipeline that are poised to cure many more people with hepatitis C, said Dr. Eugene R. Schiff, director of the University of Miami's Center for Liver Diseases.\n\nThe greater possibility of a cure and fewer side effects, in turn, will lead more people who think they have hepatitis C to \"come out of the woodwork,\" said Schiff, who's familiar with the study findings. \"They'll want to know if they're positive.\"\n\nAn estimated 4 million people in the United States have hepatitis C, but only about 1 million are thought to have been diagnosed. The disease, transmitted through infected blood, can lead to liver cancer, scarring of the liver, known as cirrhosis, and death.\n\nExisting treatments can cure about half of the cases. As Schiff explained, people's genetic makeup has a lot to do with whether they respond to the treatment. Those with Asian heritage do better, whereas those with an African background do worse, he said.\n\nAnd there's another potential problem with existing treatments. The side effects, particularly of the treatment component known as interferon, can be \"pretty hard to deal with,\" said Nicholas A. Meanwell, a co-author of the study and a researcher with the Bristol-Myers Squibb pharmaceutical company.\n\nThe study, published online April 21 in Nature, examines an experimental drug designed to combat the hepatitis C virus. It appears to work by interfering with a protective coating around a part of the virus that's key to its ability to reproduce, Meanwell said.\n\nIn a phase 1 trial, the first of three types of studies that new drugs must go through, researchers gave doses of the drug to a small number of people.\n\nThe level of the virus in their bodies dropped significantly for several days. The main side effect was headache, Meanwell said.\n\nAt this point, it's not clear how much the drug might cost or how it would work with existing drugs. However, Meanwell said, it could become part of a combination treatment of several drugs.\n\nSchiff, the University of Miami doctor, said other companies are pursuing similar drugs.\n\nFor now, much of the attention in the world of liver disease is on two drugs -- telaprevir and boceprevir -- that Schiff expects will become available within the next year and a half.\n\nCombination treatments using these drugs will become the standard treatment for many people, he said, and boost cure rates into the range of 70 to 80 percent.

One suggestion is to replace 5% of the flour in pizza dough with dried and granulated seaweed.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of premature death globally. Ironically, many of the pathologies leading to premature death from cardiovascular diseases are not only widespread, but they are preventable.\n\nOne way to prevent cardiovascular diseases is to avoid obesity and eat healthy, leaving the responsibility with the individual consumer.\n\nBut the responsibility should also be shared by society, argues University of Southern Denmark professor of biophysics, Ole G. Mouritsen, who has authored several books on seaweed as food.\n\nProfessor Mouritsen is the co-author of an article in the journal Phycologia reviewing existing knowledge on the health effects of 35 different seaweed species.\n\nIn the article the authors offer suggestions to how both individual consumers and the food industry can use seaweed to make our everyday meals healthier.\n\n\"Certain substances in seaweed may be important for reducing cardiovascular diseases. We think this knowledge should be available for society and also be put to use\", says Mouritsen.\n\nMany seaweed species have a variety of health benefits. They contain, among other things, beneficial proteins, antioxidants, minerals, trace elements, dietary fiber and polyunsaturated fatty acids.\n\nSeaweed's content of potassium salts does not led to high blood pressure - unlike the sodium salts, typically encountered in the processed food.\n\nAn important feature is also that the seaweed has umami - the fifth basic taste, which is known to promote satiety and hence regulate food intake in addition to reduce the craving for salt, sugar and fat.\n\n\"It is difficult to determine how much seaweed a person should consume to benefit from its good qualities. 5-10 grams of dried seaweed per day is my estimate\", says Professor Mouritsen.\n\nHe and the co-authors suggest that seaweed should be added fast food, thus making this type of food healthier. It can even enhance the flavor of the food, they argue. For example, dried and granulated seaweed can replace some of the flour when producing dry pasta, bread, pizza, snack bars, etc.\n\nIt is also possible to add seaweed to meat products and thereby provide the consumer with an increased intake of dietary fiber and antioxidants - or maybe the aim is lower cholesterol levels.\n\nIn the article Professor Mouritsen and his co-authors describe a study in which a group of overweight but otherwise healthy men were asked to taste bread with added dried seaweed from the species Ascophyllum nosodum. The men's reaction was that the bread tasted acceptable as long as the seaweed content was kept under 4%.\n\nBy eating bread containing 4% of dried seaweed the overweight men ingested more dietary fiber (4.5 g more fiber per. 100 g) than when they ate the control whole-meal bread. Another effect was that they consumed 16.4% less energy in the 24 hour period after eating the seaweed enriched bread.\n\n\"We know that many people have difficulty distinguishing between healthy and unhealthy food. By adding seaweed to processed foods we can make food healthier. In many cases we also get tastier food, and it may also help reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases\", the authors believe.\n\u2022 Seaweed contains only few calories, but is still rich in rich in essential amino acids, dietary fibers, minerals, trace elements, vitamins and polyunsaturated fats.\n\u2022 You can easily add up to 5% dried seaweed to a dough without losing its ability to raise.\n\u2022 Dried seaweed can be stored for months or years without loss of flavor and nutritional value.\n\u2022 Dried seaweed can be added to food as powder, granulate or pieces in pastries, egg dishes, mashed potatoes, dressings, or sprinkled on vegetables or fish dishes.\n\u2022 Powders and granulates can be used as a salt substitute.\n\u2022 Hijiki contains arsenic, which is carcinogenic and therefore some national food authorities recommend that you do not eat it. Despite these warnings, you can buy dried hijiki in many stores.\n\u2022 Some species may contain large amounts of iodine.\n\u2022 Never eat seaweed that is washed up on the beach.\n\nContact Professor Ole G.

But within 40 minutes of receiving a ketamine injection, their depressive symptoms improved; the effect persisted for at least three days.\n\nRight now, medications available for treating either major depression or bipolar illness can take weeks, or even months, to work, notes Dr. Carlos A. Zarate Jr. of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, one of the researchers on the study.\n\nAnd as a person waits for their medications to kick in, he added, they will continue to have difficulty working and coping with social and family life; they may even be having thoughts of suicide. \u201cWe want to alleviate the suffering and get them back to their life,\u201d he said.\n\nZarate and his colleagues had previously demonstrated that ketamine shots helped some patients with treatment-resistant unipolar depression, meaning they did not cycle through manic episodes. In the new study, they gave patients with bipolar illness ketamine or a placebo on two test days two weeks apart.\n\nAll of the patients were on lithium or valproate - two drugs commonly used for bipolar illness - but had not responded to treatment. Nearly all were unemployed, Zarate and his team note, and two-thirds were on psychiatric disability.\n\nCompared to placebo, patients showed significant improvement in mood within 40 minutes of receiving the ketamine infusion, using a common depression rating scale. Symptom improvement peaked two days after the injection, but remained significantly greater than for placebo for three days.\n\nSeventy-one percent of the patients responded to ketamine, meaning they had at least a 50 percent improvement in their depressive symptoms. Six percent responded to placebo.\n\nSide effects included anxiety, \u201cfeeling woozy or loopy,\u201d headache, and dissociative symptoms, meaning a temporary sense of disconnection from reality, although there were no serious adverse events. By developing more specifically targeted drugs, Zarate noted, it may be possible to treat patients effectively while avoiding these symptoms.\n\nKetamine appears to work by \u201cresetting\u201d the way nerve cells process glutamate, a brain chemical key for learning, memory, and other functions, according to Zarate. The problem in bipolar illness and depression, he explains, doesn\u2019t appear to be that a person has too much or too little glutamate; instead, it\u2019s likely that the way their neurons release and take up the chemical is out of whack.\n\nFirst introduced in 1962, ketamine is used legally in both human and veterinary medicine as an anesthetic. It\u2019s also a drug of abuse, at much higher doses than those used in Zarate\u2019s research; while patients in the current study received about 50 milligrams during a 40-minute period, a dose too low to induce anesthesia, recreational users of ketamine, known as \u201cSpecial K,\u201d may take hundreds of milligrams per week.\n\nIn 1999, US regulators classified ketamine as a Schedule III controlled substance, meaning it has the potential for abuse but is also useful medically.\n\nKetamine could improve treatment of bipolar illness and depression in a variety of ways, Zarate said; for example, as a means to jump-start standard drug treatment, or as an anesthetic before ECT. \u201cIt\u2019s opened the floodgate of many different directions of research, and all of them are quite encouraging,\u201d said Zarate, who along with a co-author has filed for a patent on the use of ketamine in depression. Those rights would be assigned to his employer, the National Institutes of Health.\n\nEfforts are already underway in Europe to develop guidelines for how ketamine should be used and prescribed to treat bipolar illness and depression, the researcher said.\n\nIn the US, research is continuing on the drug, he added, and some physicians are likely trying the drug in their patients with bipolar illness or depression who aren\u2019t helped by standard treatments. But, according to Zarate, more research is needed on how to use the drug in the safest and most effective way.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "No inordinate claims of novelty were made.\u00a0 The story mentioned some previous research on the drug.\u00a0 It did not discuss the fact that, if the Boston\u00a0Globe story mentioned above is to be believed, a total of 43 patients have been studied over 10 years in federally funded ketamine research.\u00a0 Nonetheless, we\u2019ll give the story the benefit of the doubt.

He is an associate professor at the department of investigational cancer therapeutics at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston.\n\n\"Patients only had one week of exposure to the bacteria, but even with that limited exposure we saw quite interesting and, in some patients, clinically meaningful activity,\" Janku said.\n\nClostridium novyi has been linked to human illness. In 2000, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a handful of drug users in the United Kingdom fell ill or died after their injection sites became infected with the bacteria.\n\nThe strain used in this clinical trial, Clostridium novyi-NT, had been weakened to prevent it from producing its toxin, which can be lethal in humans, Janku said. The NT stands for \"non-toxic.\"\n\nClostridium novyi flourishes in low-oxygen environments. Researchers thought this might make the bacteria a prime candidate for cancer fighting, by keeping the infection focused on the tumor site.\n\n\"Normal tissues, even if they are low on oxygen, they always have enough oxygen to not allow this bacteria to germinate and proliferate,\" Janku explained. \"Cancerous tissue is low in oxygen, most often in the center of the cancers.\"\n\nTo test whether the bacteria could help fight cancer, researchers injected the tumors of 24 patients with a single dose of Clostridium novyi-NT, ranging from 10,000 to 3 million spores.\n\nFifteen of the patients had sarcoma, two patients had melanoma, and seven had a variety of cancers, the researchers said.\n\nThe scientists expected Clostridium novyi-NT to help fight the tumor in two ways.\n\nFirst, the bacterial infection itself could cause direct destruction of the tumor cells, Janku said.\n\n\"If that happens, it actually helps to increase the presence of tumor-specific antigens, which are proteins that make a tumor more obvious to the immune system,\" Janku said. \"It can prime the immune system to attack the cancer.\"\n\nThe bacteria also could activate the immune system to fight the cancer even if the infection didn't kill off tumor cells, Janku added.\n\nPatients in this clinical trial were left with the bacterial infection for one week, and then everyone was given antibiotics to kill off the Clostridium novyi-NT, Janku said.\n\n\"Clostridium is actually quite susceptible to antibiotics,\" Janku noted.\n\nThe bacteria germinated in the cancers of 11 out of the 24 patients, with tumor cells dying off as a result.\n\nTumor shrinkage of greater than 10 percent was observed in 23 percent of patients. However, Janku said this could be an underestimate since the infection causes surrounding tissue to become inflamed, making the lesion appear larger than it actually is.\n\nFollowing bacterial therapy, cancer stabilized in 21 patients. When both injected and uninjected lesions were included, the stable disease rate was 86 percent, the researchers reported.\n\nThe potential for Clostridium novyi-NT to prompt an immune response against cancer is intriguing, said Sacha Gnjatic, who is associate director of the Human Immune Monitoring Center at Mount Sinai in New York City.\n\n\"That's where the promise of this type of therapy lies. You would expect that the injected lesion would have some type of response because you're disrupting the tumor cells,\" Gnjatic said. \"What would be interesting is if this could prime an immune response that would eventually also take care of the non-injected tumors. That's the holy grail of immunotherapy.\"\n\nJanku said he's particularly excited by the ability of the bacteria to battle sarcomas, which are cancers that occur in bone, muscle and soft tissues.\n\n\"Classic immunotherapy which is now approved or being heavily investigated doesn't seem to be working for a majority of sarcomas,\" Janku explained.\n\nResearchers have moved on to the next phase, in which patients taking the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab (Keytruda) will also be treated with a single injection of Clostridium novyi-NT, Janku said. The researchers suspect the two therapies used in combination will create a strong immune response against cancers.\n\nHowever, they will have to keep an eye on potential side effects from Clostridium novyi-NT, Janku added.\n\nTwo patients treated with the heaviest dose of 3 million spores of Clostridium novyi-NT fell ill with sepsis and/or gas gangrene, leading researchers to set the maximum tolerated dose at 1 million spores.\n\nResearchers also found the bacteria in the bloodstream of a couple of patients, meaning that the infection will need to be carefully tracked, Janku said.\n\n\"That didn't result in clostridium seeding anywhere else outside the injected region, but it's a theoretical possibility since we were able to detect it in the blood culture of one or two patients,\" Janku said.\n\nPatients also could be susceptible to immune response side effects, such as low blood pressure or fever, he added.\n\nThe trial results were to be presented Sunday at the International Cancer Immunotherapy Conference, in New York City.

Sixty-six had \u201cmild cognitive impairment,\u201d which falls somewhere between normal forgetfulness and dementia.\n\nBaker said researchers have failed so far to come up with effective drugs to treat mild cognitive impairment, just as there is no known treatment to stave off the normal memory decline that comes with age.\n\nBut recent work by one of Baker\u2019s co-authors hints that nasal sprays with the hormone insulin may have a positive impact on memory in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease - although that\u2019s far from conclusive yet.\n\nGHRH, a hormone produced by the hypothalamus in the brain, is linked to the insulin system, but also has a host of other effects. It dwindles naturally with aging, which has been linked to declines in memory and executive function.\n\n\u201cAll you have to do is supplement that hormone and it then will result in a whole cascade of effects that then restore an aging system to a younger system,\u201d said Baker.\n\nIn her study, people injected a synthetic version of GHRH or a placebo daily for five months. At the end, those who got the drug did better on psychological tests of executive function - whether or not they had mild cognitive impairment.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how the test differences will translate into real life, said Baker. One test, for instance, asked participants to name the color of a font - say, green - used to write the name of a different color - say, \u201cred\u201d. But Baker said people who got the hormone were more likely to report improvements in their ability to focus during the day.\n\nThe researchers found no serious side effects in the study, although people who got the hormone more often complained of symptoms like skin reactions and joint pain.\n\nStill, both Baker and Petersen said more work is needed to gauge the long-term consequences of GHRH injections. It\u2019s possible health problems could show up down the road, and the mental boost may be short-lived.\n\n\u201cIs it going to work in the long run and is it going to be safe? That is still unknown,\u201d said Petersen.\n\nBaker added that it\u2019s too early to say whether the hormone could play a role in thwarting the development of Alzheimer\u2019s, which may affect as many as five million Americans.\n\nStill, she said, \u201cThere are things we can all do to postpone (mental) decline.\u201d Keeping medical conditions such as diabetes under control and getting regular exercise are two examples.\n\n\u201cWe recommend commonly that people start exercising when they are having mild cognitive impairment,\u201d Baker said. \u201cOur work and others\u2019 has shown that exercise really does make a difference.\u201d", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "We think there could have at least been a line in the story about whether this is groundbreaking research looking at GHRH and mental function or whether there\u2019s been some track record.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Why Doctors Are Trying A Skin Cancer Drug To Treat A Brain Tumor\n\nMaryAnn Anselmo feared for the worst when she was diagnosed with a brain tumor called a glioblastoma in late 2013.\n\n\"You start doing research on that type of tumor, and you're saying, 'Oh my God, you're history.' It's like a death sentence,\" says, Anselmo, now 59.\n\nOnly for her it wasn't.\n\nAnselmo's successful treatment shows how precision medicine \u2014 tailoring therapy to each patient's genetic needs \u2014 is beginning to transform cancer care.\n\nAt first, the outlook seemed grim. Although Anselmo's surgeon was able to surgically remove most of her tumor, she couldn't tolerate traditional chemotherapy that was the planned second step, and had to discontinue it.\n\nThe chemo failure was the latest in a string of personal setbacks.\n\nThe year before she was diagnosed with brain cancer, she'd lost her son to suicide. Weeks after that she was almost killed in a car crash outside a local mall. Her cancer was discovered after she had a dizzy spell, and her husband, Joseph, insisted she return to the hospital to have it checked out.\n\nAfter all that, Anselmo and her husband weren't ready to give up on her cancer fight. He'd read about advances in targeted therapies \u2014 drugs that go after cancer cells at the molecular level.\n\nThe family sent samples of her tumor samples for genetic testing to several leading cancer hospitals. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where she was being treated, also did its own sequencing. They all found the same thing. Anselmo's tumor had a BRAF mutation common in skin cancer, but very unusual for a brain tumor.\n\nHer oncologist, David Hyman at Memorial Sloan Kettering, enrolled Anselmo into a new kind of drug trial. Called a basket trial, the study is designed to include people whose tumors have the same kind of genetic fingerprint regardless of where in the body the tumors are found.\n\nKnowing more about the genetic mutations of a tumor enables doctors to find a potentially effective drug much more quickly and accurately. \"It's like you're in a parking lot,\" Hyman says. \"And you have a key to one of the cars in the parking lot. And so one option is just to go to each car and try to open the lock. The other is to know that it's the third car on the right. What we're doing now is we're saying, OK, this key fits that lock. And we're only going straight to that car.\"\n\nToday, Anselmo is doing well. She's been in the clinical trial for a year now, and continues to take Zelboraf (or vemurafenib generically) daily. The pills have kept her cancer from growing.\n\nThere are side effects, of course. She's lost some peripheral vision, though she's been able to compensate. And Zelboraf is expensive, though it's free to Anselmo because she's taking it as part of a study.\n\nNow she can focus again on the things she loves, like singing. Anselmo, a jazz singer who performed under the stage name Mariel Larsen before her illness, is planning a comeback. She's back in training with her longtime vocal coach.\n\nAs this kind of genetic sequencing of tumors has become faster and cheaper, more patients have access to this technology. More doctors are taking advantage of the information to treat patients with a targeted approach.\n\n\"We took a disease where nothing really works for any length of time and we've given her a year of life, and hopefully much more, where she's been much better,\" Hyman, her oncologist, says.\n\nStill, he cautions that the targeted treatments can't be considered cures. At some point the drug that is keeping Anselmo's cancer at bay could stop working. \"Every patient is different in how long it works,\" he says. \"We all have patients that have been on these drugs for years. But I don't know, I mean, I think if I was being honest eventually our expectation would be that it would stop working.\"\n\nThere's no way to predict when.

It\u2019s roughly the 50th coronary artery bypass Liao has performed using the robotic system at the University of Minnesota Medical Center, Fairview, and the surgeon said he\u2019s seen enough cases to believe it\u2019s making a difference.\n\n\u201cThe difference is, the length of stay is cut in half,\u201d he said.\n\nThe da Vinci is criticized by health policy experts as the poster child for the medical arms race \u2014 the competitive fever among hospitals to buy new technology whether or not it improves care. The robotic systems come with million-dollar price tags and are used for a limited number of surgeries \u2014 mostly the removal of cancerous prostates in men or uteruses in women.\n\nStudies have disagreed on whether the outcomes of these surgeries are better when using the robotic system versus other minimally invasive techniques.\n\nThose limitations haven\u2019t deterred hospital executives, though, who see the robotic systems as crucial for attracting and retaining surgeons and patients. The number of da Vinci robots has doubled in Minnesota in less than two years, with two at the university and four at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester.\n\nSurgeons believe the growth in robotic heart procedures will help justify those investments and may ultimately reduce costs if they shorten patient stays. There\u2019s a competitive interest for heart surgeons as well. With more patients using stents to prop open clogged arteries, surgeons are seeing their own number of procedures decline.\n\nWhen California-based Intuitive Surgical first unveiled the da Vinci eight years ago, it was marketed as a heart surgery device. The learning curve for cardiac surgeons was too steep, though, and the system\u2019s tools weren\u2019t as useful for heart surgeries as they were for other procedures, said Dr. Goya Raikar, a cardiothoracic surgeon at Regions Hospital in St. Paul.\n\n\u201cThe system and instruments have kind of caught up to the point where heart surgeons are taking a close look at this now,\u201d he said.\n\nRegions and Mercy Hospital in Coon Rapids started using da Vincis for heart procedures in the past year, and Methodist Hospital in St. Louis Park is preparing to do so. Raikar mostly uses the surgical robot to repair or replace damaged mitral valves, which separate the two chambers on the left side of the heart.\n\nThe robotic system puts a surgeon at the controls of a large viewing console. The doctor peers inside at magnified three-dimensional images coming from cameras inside the patient. Hand-held controls allow the surgeon to maneuver tools that are threaded into the patient through small incisions.\n\nRaikar said the magnified vision allows him to do more valve repairs, which present lower risks of complications than replacements. Unlike other surgeries, there are no minimally invasive alternatives for valve repairs, he said. The only other option is open-heart surgery, which carries a higher risk of infections and longer recoveries.\n\nLiao said the robotic surgery was the right choice for Holmes, the bypass patient.\n\nHolmes was a competitive decathlete with no hint of heart problems until he collapsed earlier this year at the University of Minnesota Field House and his heart stopped beating. Workers there used an external defibrillator to restart his heart, and doctors cooled him into hypothermia to reduce damage to the brain caused by the disruption of blood flow.\n\nLater, Holmes learned a key artery to his heart was completely clogged. Liao feared that cutting open Holmes\u2019 chest and sternum for an open bypass surgery would disrupt his rehabilitation from the cardiac arrest and delay his plans to return to athletics.\n\nUsing the da Vinci, Liao disconnected the mammary artery \u2014 which usually directs blood to the left breast \u2014 and connected it to the heart so normal blood flow could resume. A stabilizer held a section of the beating heart in place so he could secure the new coronary artery.\n\nIf all goes as expected, Holmes could go home today.\n\nJeremy Olson can be reached at 651-228-5583.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The story makes no false claims of novelty.

The number of women taking them early in pregnancy is unknown but probably is small, the study suggests.\n\nACE inhibitors are the second-most commonly prescribed class of pharmaceuticals in the United States, with 149 million prescriptions dispensed last year. They came on the market 25 years ago.\n\n\"It would be important for a pregnant woman and her health-care provider to be aware of this, so they can identify an alternative medicine to treat her hypertension,\" said William O. Cooper, a pediatrician at Vanderbilt Children's Hospital who headed the study, published in today's New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nExposure to ACE inhibitors early in pregnancy nearly tripled the risk of birth defects, the study showed. \"We all believe that we want to see more data. But this is important enough and impressive enough to tell people about,\" said Robert Temple of the Food and Drug Administration, who spoke to reporters about the findings.\n\nThe agency will consider broadening the \"black box\" warning against taking ACE inhibitors late in pregnancy, he said. The message is that women trying to get pregnant should switch to a different blood-pressure drug, Temple said.\n\nOne-third of the defects involved the heart, one-quarter the limbs or face, and one-tenth the brain or spinal cord, the study found. Many defects, especially the heart problems, are curable with surgery or other treatment. Others, however, cause permanent disability or retardation.\n\nCooper and his colleagues looked at 29,507 births to women covered by Medicaid in Tennessee between 1985 and 2000.\n\nOf that group, 209 babies were born to women who took an ACE inhibitor, and 18 had birth defects. Among 202 babies born to mothers taking some other blood-pressure medication, four had defects. The fraction of babies with defects was 7.1 percent in the ACE-inhibitor group; 1.7 percent in the other anti-hypertensive group; and 2.6 percent in the group taking no blood-pressure medication.\n\nThat such an effect was first noticed a quarter-century after ACE inhibitors arrived on the market points up the lack of data about the effect of drugs in pregnancy.\n\nAll new drugs are tested on pregnant animals to see whether they cause malformations, but those tests can be misleading. It's considered unethical to include pregnant women in studies of new drugs unless the medication is intended to treat pregnancy-related conditions.\n\nAs a consequence, the labels on nearly all medications carry a statement saying their safety to fetuses has not been established.\n\n\"I think it is safe to say that not a lot is known about the options for women in pregnancy,\" said Sandra L. Kweder of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.\n\nStudies of large databases such as Medicare records or registries that enroll pregnant women already taking particular drugs are the chief ways to discover and measure possible risks to the fetus from prescription drugs.\n\nIncreasingly, the FDA is seeking such data. It paid for the ACE-inhibitor study with help from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The alternatives that clinicians might want to consider are diuretics, alpha-methyldopa, some beta-blockers, and the calcium-channel blocker nifedipine, according to the FDA officials and an editorial accompanying the study.\n\nBlood pressure often falls slightly in pregnancy, and women with mild hypertension may be able to go without medicines, experts say. Some pregnant women develop hypertension that can be life-threatening to them and their babies.\n\nACE inhibitors -- the acronym stands for angiotensin-converting enzyme -- have become more popular.

However, this approach also affects fat tissue and can lead to excessive weight gain, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes.\n\nResearchers at the University of Edinburgh's British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science studied another steroid called corticosterone, which is also naturally produced by the body. Until now, there has been little research into its activity.\n\nIn a mouse study, the team showed that the effects of corticosterone on fat cells were reduced compared with cortisol. They found the effects were reduced because fat cells have a pump that removes corticosterone - but not cortisol - from the fat cells.\n\nThe researchers tested the therapy in a small group of patients with Addison's disease.

Caruso, the chief commercial officer for Allos, a 17-year-old publicly traded company based in Westminster, Colo., that has no other drugs on the market.\n\nMr. Caruso also said the price of Folotyn was not out of line with that of other drugs for rare cancers. Patients, moreover, are likely to use the drug for only a couple of months because the tumor worsens so quickly, he said. So the total cost of using Folotyn will be less than for many other drugs with lower monthly prices.\n\n\u201cWe believe we are fairly priced,\u201d he added, \u201cand we\u2019re benchmarked\u201d against other drugs. In a conference call with analysts last month, Mr. Caruso said Allos had \u201cnot had pushback of any type at this point\u201d from insurers.\n\nSome drugs for rare cancers are close to Foltyn\u2019s price. Genzyme\u2019s Clolar for pediatric leukemia costs about $34,000 a week, though the company says that only two weeks of treatment are typically needed. Genzyme\u2019s drug Campath, for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, costs about $5,000 a week for several weeks.\n\nGlaxoSmithKline is charging up to $98,000 for a six-month treatment course of Arzerra, a drug approved in late October for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which strikes about 15,000 Americans a year. About $60,000 of the cost would be incurred in the first eight weeks, when the drug is given more frequently.\n\nGloucester Pharmaceuticals, which won approval in November for a drug to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, another rare cancer, declined to discuss what it would charge when that treatment, called Istodax, goes on sale in January.\n\nDespite such comparisons, Dr. Lee N. Newcomer, senior vice president for oncology at the big insurer UnitedHealthcare, called the price of Folotyn \u201cunconscionable.\u201d He said that Folotyn alone would cost as much as UnitedHealthcare now typically spends in total to treat a lymphoma patient from diagnosis until death. That median expenditure now, he said, is $87,000 for a little over a year of treatments.\n\nBut Dr. Newcomer said insurers would be obligated to pay for Folotyn because there were no alternatives.\n\nFolotyn has not yet shown an effect on longevity. In the clinical trial that led to approval of the drug, 27 percent of the 109 patients experienced a reduction in tumor size. The reductions lasted a median of 9.4 months.\n\nBut considering all the patients in the trial, only 12 percent had a reduction in tumor size that lasted for more than 14 weeks. The trial did not compare Folotyn to another drug or a placebo.\n\n\u201cThis drug is not a home run,\u201d Dr. Brad S.

Even to try the drug for the first seven-week cycle to see if it works would cost over $50,000. In the clinical trial, the median duration of use was 70 days, which would cost roughly $70,000 to $80,000. But some patients used the drug for many months.\n\nIn a note to clients in October, Joshua Schimmer, an analyst at Leerink Swann, estimated that a typical treatment would last 3.5 months and cost $126,000, or about $36,000 a month.\n\nFor investors, a high price is usually a good thing. Mr. Schimmer\u2019s note was entitled \u201cFolotyn Prices High, Reiterate Outperform.\u201d He estimated annual sales of the drug in the United States reaching about $300 million by 2014.\n\nPatient advocacy groups say that while they wish prices were lower, high prices might be needed to encourage companies to develop new drugs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a two-edged sword that we have to live with and deal with,\u201d said Louis J. DeGennaro, chief scientific officer of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, which has received donations from Allos and other companies. \u201cA peripheral T-cell lymphoma patient,\u201d he said, \u201cat first blush will see this therapy as a very good thing.\u201d\n\nAllos, which is still unprofitable, has lost $350 million since its founding in 1992 and failed to win approval of a previous drug.\n\n\u201cEvery dime that goes into the company supports Folotyn,\u201d Mr. Caruso said.\n\nAt the time Folotyn was approved in September, stock in Allos briefly peaked above $8.50 but has slipped since then, closing up 16 cents at $6.62, or an increase of nearly 2.5 percent, on Friday.\n\nAfter the approval, Allos raised $93 million in a secondary stock offering. In the prospectus for that offering, the company said that one of the risks for investors was \u201cthe relative price of Folotyn as compared to alternate treatment options.\u201d It said there was a risk it might have to lower the price or offer discounts to successfully market Folotyn.\n\nLike many other companies with high-priced drugs, Allos has established a program to help patients arrange insurance reimbursement. It says it will give the drug free to uninsured patients who cannot pay for it any other way.\n\nAnd because a patient\u2019s out-of-pocket co-payments alone \u2014 Medicare\u2019s is 20 percent \u2014 could be thousands of dollars a month for Folotyn, Allos is financing a co-payment assistance program run by the National Organization for Rare Disorders, a patient advocacy group.\n\nWhile this helps patients, it also helps the company sell more of its drug.

The data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nFor the study, Cao and her colleagues collected data on 82,600 women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study in 1980 and 47,650 men enrolled in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study in 1986. The researchers collected data on aspirin use, risk factors for cancer and diagnoses of cancer.\n\nAfter up to 32 years of follow-up, about 20,400 women and 7,570 men developed cancer, the investigators found. Among men, prostate cancer was excluded.\n\nCao's team found that men and women who took a regular dose of aspirin (325 milligrams) two times a week or more had a lower risk of cancer overall than people who did not regularly take aspirin. The reduced risk was largely due to fewer cases of gastrointestinal cancers, including colon cancer, rectal cancer and esophageal cancer.\n\nRegular aspirin use was not associated with a reduced risk of other cancers. Specifically, no link was found between aspirin use and a lower risk of breast cancer, advanced prostate cancer or lung cancer, the researchers said.\n\nMoreover, the benefit of aspirin in reducing overall cancer risk appeared to depend on how much one took. So the more aspirin taken, the more the risk was reduced. Amounts ranged from less than one aspirin a week to 15 or more, the researchers said.\n\nGetting the biggest benefit from aspirin required taking it for at least 16 years. The benefit was no longer seen within four years of stopping it, the researchers found. And the study only showed an association between aspirin use and gastrointestinal cancer risk, not a cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nThe association of aspirin with reduced cancer risk was the same for women and men regardless of race, history of diabetes, family history of cancer, weight, smoking, regular use of other painkillers or taking multivitamins, the study authors added.\n\nEric Jacobs, strategic director of pharmacoepidemiology at the American Cancer Society, said the new study \"confirms the now well-established link between regular aspirin use and lower risk of developing certain cancers of the gastrointestinal tract -- cancers of the colon, rectum and esophagus.\"\n\nSome, though not all, previous studies have indicated that aspirin might slightly lower risk of certain other cancers, including breast cancer, prostate cancer and lung cancer, he added.\n\n\"Although aspirin is recommended for most people who have had a heart attack, and has some benefits for cancer risk as well, at this point the American Cancer Society does not recommend that people use aspirin specifically to prevent cancer because it is not clear that the benefits with respect to cancer outweigh the risks,\" Jacobs said.\n\nWhile not common, aspirin can cause serious, even occasionally fatal, stomach bleeding, even at low doses, he said.\n\n\"People who are uncertain about whether they should be using aspirin should talk to their health care provider, who knows their personal medical history and can help weigh their individual risks and benefits,\" Jacobs said.\n\nVisit the U.S. National Cancer Institute for more on aspirin and cancer risk.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The story notes that the study is the latest in a long line of studies that have reached similar conclusions.

It does this by converting a key substance used by cancer cells to provide the energy they need for rapid division (pyruvate) into an unnatural lactate - leading to the cells' destruction.\n\nUniquely, this chemo-catalyst treatment can be recycled and reused within a cancer cell to attack it repeatedly.\n\nThis unprecedented functional ability to recycle and reuse the compound within cancer cells could lead to future anticancer drugs being administered in smaller, more effective, and potentially less toxic doses - decreasing the side-effects of chemotherapy.\n\nThe researchers have been focusing on the potential to use this compound on ovarian and prostate cancers.\n\nOvarian cancers are becoming increasingly resistant to existing chemotherapy drugs (such as the platinum drug, cisplatin). Since this new research functions in a totally new and unique way, it may overcome this acquired resistance and widen the spectrum of anticancer activity.\n\nImportantly, the development opens up a possibility for a more selective cancer treatment as JPC11 was observed to specifically target the biochemistry of cancer cells, leaving healthy cells largely untouched - another improvement compared to existing platinum-based drugs, which can also attack non-cancerous cells.\n\n\"This is a significant step in the fight against cancer.

Only the correct hand works, in the same way that a right hand does not fit a left-hand glove.\n\nIn this case, the osmium compound JPC11, with sodium formate, can selectively produce a molecule of a specific 'handedness' - thus manipulating how cancer cells grow.\n\n\"The 'handedness' of molecules is critical in the body. Our hands are near-identical, but are mirror images of each other.

Some prostate cancers evolve to use energy from lipids (fat). Previous work shows that metabolizing lipids helps prostate cancer escape anti-androgen therapy. However, there are many steps involved in lipid metabolism and researchers have been working to break prostate cancer\u2019s ability to harness this energy source. In this study the researchers focused on the CPT1A enzyme. CPT1A helps facilitate the entry of long chain fatty acids into the cell\u2019s mitochondria for oxidation. This oxidation is vital to lipid metabolism and has been shown to aid cancer cell survival, resistance to radiation, oxidative stress, and activation of oncogenic signaling pathways.\n\n\u201cWe had to find a way to block this pathway so that the cancer would not be able to burn lipid in the mitochondria to acquire energy to resist therapy,\u201d explains Schlaepfer.\n\nIn fact, we are already able to block the action of the CPT1A enzyme.

And unfortunately there is no cure.\n\nMany practitioners and patients have turned to diet as a possible treatment, but many of the dietary recommendations have not been backed by clinical trials.The study, the largest of its kind, measured the degree of relief from low FODMAP, a frequently recommended diet, which stands for Fermentable Oligo-Di-Monosaccharides and Polyols.\n\nThis diet excludes many compounds found in wheat, certain fruits and vegetables, garlic, onions and sugar substitutes.\n\nOver a six-week process, registered dietitians educated and monitored the progress of more than 90 IBS patients. Roughly half followed a prescribed low FODMAP diet, and half were a control group that used a common-sense regimen, cutting down on large meals, binges and known irritants such as caffeine and alcohol.\n\nThe results were impressive: More than 50 percent of the patients on the low FODMAP diet had major improvement of their abdominal pain, compared with 20 percent of the control group.\n\nThere was also more improvement of other bothersome symptoms compared to the control group: bloating, diarrhea and stool urgency.\n\nEswaran collaborated with William Chey, M.D., professor of internal medicine, Kenya Jackson, Sivaram G. Pillai, Samuel W. Chey and Theresa Han-Markey, M.S., R.D., at the University of Michigan on the study abstract published in Gastroenterology.\n\nAt four weeks, the proportion of patients with a meaningful improvement in IBS quality of life was significantly higher in the low FODMAP group compared to the control group \u2014 61 percent versus 27 percent.\n\nWhile the results are highly encouraging for IBS sufferers, there are a few important caveats, Eswaran says.\n\nBecause of the many unknowns about the chemical causes and triggers of IBS, the list of \u201cbad\u201d foods is exhaustive and elusive, and help from a dietician is highly recommended.\n\n\u201cLow-FODMAP is not a new treatment, but we are now convinced that it really works,\u201d she says. \u201cOur next step will be to more precisely determine the underlying chemistry of how and why particular foods can yield dramatically different results for different people.

Like every new study of prostate cancer, the results need to be carefully parsed.\n\nFirst, the study results, which appear in this week's New England Journal of Medicine. It's actually an update of a 2008 report, with an additional three years of data on the nearly 700 men who volunteered for the trial up to 15 years ago. All of them had early-stage prostate cancer at the beginning.\n\nThe study found 38 percent fewer prostate cancer deaths among men randomly assigned to the surgery group versus those in what the Swedes called the watchful-waiting group. Men who had surgery had 41 percent lower risk of their cancer spreading throughout the body, and 66 percent less risk of growth within the prostate.\n\nThe survival benefits were restricted to men under 65. For this group, surgery saved one life for every seven men who had prostatectomies \u2014 considered a favorable ratio. And it applied to men with tumors considered low-risk, meaning they have a relatively low Gleason score, a marker of tumor aggressiveness.\n\n\"Our findings show that some tumors that are considered to be low-risk at diagnosis do pose a threat to life, especially if they are not surgically removed,\" the study authors write.\n\nSo is this a slam-dunk for radical prostatectomy? Game over?\n\nFar from it. In an editorial accompanying the study, Dr. Dr. Matthew Smith of Massachusetts General Hospital makes some important points.\n\nFirst, only about 1 in 20 men in the Swedish study had a prostate cancer diagnosis based on a high PSA level. Almost 90 percent had tumors their doctors could feel on digital rectal exams. But in the U.S., most prostate cancers are identified by PSA screening, and less than half have palpable tumors.\n\nThis is important, because experts believe many prostate tumors found by PSA are likely to be slow-growing \u2014 perhaps so slow they will never cause a problem before the man dies of something else.\n\nSo \"low risk\" in the Swedish study means higher-risk than the current \"low risk\" men diagnosed in the United States. By the way, 9 out of 10 prostate cancers in the U.S. these days is considered low risk.\n\nSecond, the Swedish study compared radical prostatectomy to watchful waiting. And Smith points out that \"watchful waiting\" does not mean the same thing as \"active surveillance.\"\n\n\"Watchful waiting means we're not going to treat you now and if you progress clinically, we'll treat you with hormone therapy \u2013 not with curative intent,\" Smith tells Shots.\n\n\"Active surveillance means observing the patient in a proactive way, with regularly scheduled biopsies,\" he adds. If there's a sign the cancer is progressing, doctors currently would treat with intent to cure, using surgery, radiation or both.\n\nSmith makes another point: Both surgical techniques and radiation therapy technology have improved since the Swedish study was done. So there's reason to think men followed with active surveillance and treated when necessary would fare better than the \"watchful waiting\" group in the newly published study.\n\nUnfortunately, there haven't been any large studies in which prostatectomy and radiation therapy have been compared in patients with early-stage prostate cancer who have been randomly assigned to one or the other.\n\nTwo such studies are underway. Results are some years off. But Smith warns against assuming those results will settle the question of how men with early-stage prostate cancer should be treated.\n\n\"There will always be questions, and an ongoing need to individualize therapy,\" he says.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "It was clear from this story that the approaches to managing prostate cancer detailed in the study reported on are neither new nor novel.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "THURSDAY, Jan. 11, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Injecting a calcium-based cement into the bones of some people with knee or hip pain could help them avoid joint replacement surgery, Ohio State University doctors say.\n\nThe calcium phosphate cement flows into the spongy inside portion of the bone, filling in microfractures and other damaged areas, and it hardens in about 10 minutes' time, said Dr. Kelton Vasileff, an orthopedic surgeon at the university's Wexner Medical Center.\n\nThe cement braces the bruised or injured joint bone from the inside, Vasileff explained, and eventually is replaced by new bone as part of the body's natural healing process.\n\nThe procedure, called subchondroplasty, has been available to people with knee problems for years, Vasileff said. Now he and his colleagues are testing to see whether hip patients also can benefit from it.\n\nIt is much less invasive than a knee or hip replacement, and typically is performed on an outpatient basis, Vasileff said.\n\nThe procedure involves a smaller incision than joint replacement surgery, so there's less risk of infection, and a quicker recovery time that means fewer of the side effects associated with being bedridden, Vasileff said.\n\nHowever, subchondroplasty is only feasible in a narrow range of patients. Those with full-blown bone-on-bone arthritis or joint pain caused by damage to the cartilage and ligaments will get little to no relief from the procedure, Vasileff said.\n\n\"People who have significant arthritis where the cartilage itself is damaged and thinned, this isn't going to fix the arthritis,\" Vasileff said. \"But there are some people who may have some issues with the bone and mild arthritis. In these patients who might otherwise have needed a knee or hip replacement to deal with that, this could be an alternative.\"\n\nSoftware engineer Ben Wallace underwent subchondroplasty in November to help shore up a damaged hip.\n\n\"The end of September I noticed I was really struggling to move around my left leg very well,\" said Wallace, who lives in Columbus, Ohio. Imaging scans revealed a hip in very bad shape, with a misshapen femur.\n\nA five-hour surgery cleaned up the femur and bolstered the bone with cement.\n\n\"It's been going really great. I'm better than what they expected. One week after surgery I was off the crutches, walking on my own,\" Wallace said.\n\n\"I figured I'm going to have a fake hip in there at the age of 30, which was very depressing,\" Wallace explained. \"The fact I was able to keep all my bones and joints in there was quite a surprise.\"\n\nSubchondroplasty has shown solid potential, but orthopedic surgeon Dr. Matthew Hepinstall is concerned that it might be \"oversold\" to desperate patients who want to avoid joint replacement surgery.\n\n\"The claims that are being made are not evidence-based yet, although they are intellectually appealing,\" said Hepinstall. He is associate director of the Center for Joint Preservation & Reconstruction at Lenox Hill Hospital, in New York City.\n\n\"It's just important not to oversell this,\" he added.\n\nThe best candidates for the procedure are patients who still have some cartilage protecting their joint, but have somehow \"overloaded\" and injured the bone, causing swelling and pain, Hepinstall said.\n\n\"If you inject this substance into the bone, you're basically providing internal support, a scaffold protecting the bone. That can theoretically reduce bone pain,\" Hepinstall noted.\n\n\"The appealing thing about it is instead of going in and resurfacing a damaged joint, you're injecting something to help the bone, but keeping the patient's own anatomy,\" Hepinstall continued.\n\n\"But there's a very narrow window of patients who are good ideal candidates for this, who basically have a real overload of their bone causing severe enough pain to warrant a surgical procedure, but also have healthy enough cartilage that doing something about the bone swelling is going to alleviate the majority of their pain,\" he stressed.\n\n\"We don't want to send the message to people who have bone-on-bone, with big bone spurs and limited range of motion that they're all of a sudden going to get relief from injecting a little bit of cement into their bone,\" Hepinstall said. \"This is for people who have basically a normal joint that has normal range of motion and normal stability, just a little thinning of the cartilage.\"\n\nFor more on knee pain, visit the Arthritis Foundation.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The story started to describe the novelty here:\n\u201cThe procedure, called subchondroplasty, has been available to people with knee problems for years, Vasileff said.

And the news is very good.\n\nThe paper outlines the results of an international clinical trial, led by Jeff Elias, MD, of the University of Virginia Health System, that evaluated the scalpel-free approach called focused ultrasound for the treatment of essential tremor (ET), a condition that afflicts an estimated 10 million Americans. Not only did the researchers determine that the procedure was safe and effective, they found that it offered a lasting benefit, reducing shaking for trial participants throughout the 12-month study period.\n\n\u201cThis study represents a major advance for neurosurgery, treatment of brain disease and specifically the treatment of ET,\u201d Elias said. \u201cFor the first time in a randomized controlled trial, we have shown that ultrasound can be precisely delivered through the intact human skull to treat a difficult neurological disease.\u201d\n\nPioneering Tremor TrialThe multi-site clinical trial included 76 participants with moderate to severe essential tremor, a condition that often robs people of their ability to write, feed themselves and carry out their normal daily activities. The trial participants all had tried existing medications, without success. The mean age was 71, and most had suffered with their tremor for many years.\n\nSeventy-five percent of participants received the experimental treatment using focused ultrasound guided by magnetic resonance imaging. The remaining 25 percent underwent a sham procedure, to act as the control group. (They would later be given the opportunity to undergo the real procedure.)\n\nParticipants who received the treatment showed dramatic improvement, with the beneficial effects continuing throughout the study period. The researchers employed a 32-point scale to assess tremor severity, and they found that mean tremor scores improved by 47 percent at three months and 40 percent at 12 months. Participants reported major improvements in their quality of life. People who couldn\u2019t feed themselves soup or cereal could again do so.\n\nParticipants who received the sham procedure, on the other hand, showed no significant improvements.\n\n\u201cThe degree of tremor control was very good overall in the study, but the most important aspects were the significant gains in disabilities and quality of life \u2013 that\u2019s what patients really care about,\u201d Elias said.\n\nThe most commonly reported side effects were gait disturbances and numbness in the hand or face; in most instances, these side effects were temporary but some were permanent.\n\nFDA Approved Based on the clinical trial led by Elias, the federal Food and Drug Administration has approved the focused ultrasound device, manufactured by InSightec Inc., for the treatment of essential tremor. The device focuses sound waves inside the brain to create heat, much like a magnifying glass focuses light. That heat can then be used to interrupt the troublesome brain connections responsible for the tremor. Elias can actually watch as patients\u2019 tremor decreases, and the real-time imaging allows him to zone in on exactly the right spot before making any permanent changes to the brain.\n\nThe FDA approval means UVA can make the procedure available to eligible patients. UVA, however, is still working out the necessary logistics; it\u2019s not yet clear when Elias will begin treating patients. Because the approach is so new, insurance plans will not yet cover the procedure, though that may change in the coming months. The cost at UVA has not yet been determined.\n\nPeople interested in the procedure can learn more at uvahealth.com/focusedultrasound. The site includes a list of frequently asked questions and will be updated as UVA prepares to make the treatment available.\n\nThe procedure is not for everyone with essential tremor. It can\u2019t be used in patients who cannot undergo MRI imaging, including those with implanted metallic devices such as a pacemaker. It is also not available for pregnant women, people with heart conditions or very high blood pressure, patients with kidney disease or clotting disorders, patients on blood thinners, patients with a history of strokes or brain tumors and people with substance abuse issues. There are other exclusions as well. Doctors at UVA will evaluate potential patients to determine their eligibility and then recommend the best course of treatment.\n\nGroundbreaking ResearchUVA is a world leader in focused ultrasound research. Elias and his colleagues are testing the capability of focused ultrasound to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease, epilepsy, brain tumors and benign breast tumors.\n\nThe essential tremor research has been supported by InSightec, the Focused Ultrasound Foundation and the BIRD (US-Israel Binational Industry Research and Development) Foundation.\n\nFOR REPORTERS: Elias will be available for interviews today, and he\u2019ll be doing a Facebook Live broadcast at 3:15 Eastern.

He's a professor of anesthesiology at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.\n\nThe dorsal root ganglions are nerve cells, on both sides of each of the spine's vertebra, and are the gateway to pain between nerves in different parts of the body, spinal cord and brain. Stimulating this area interrupts pain signals between the painful area and the brain, the researchers explained.\n\nA pacemaker-like device implanted under the skin in the lower back sends small electronic pulses through a wire placed near the specific dorsal root ganglion associated with the pain, McCarthy said.\n\nThe pulses replace pain with tingling or numbness. The strength of stimulation, programmed by a doctor, is based on the patient's level of pain, he said.\n\nThe treatment has two advantages over spinal cord stimulation, McCarthy said. In spinal cord stimulation, a wire runs along the spinal cord sending pulses along the entire spine, but the pulses don't target the specific pain source.\n\nIn addition, dorsal root ganglion stimulation requires significantly lower levels of electric current to quell pain, McCarthy said.\n\nThe goal of this study, he said, was to judge the effectiveness of the therapy over a long period. McCarthy and his colleagues implanted the device in 67 people suffering with chronic back pain and followed them for three to 18 months. Among the participants, 17 had the device for over a year.\n\nBefore receiving the device, most patients rated their pain as an 8 on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being the worst. For most patients, the device reduced pain by 33 percent, which was significant, the researchers reported.\n\nIn addition, patients said they experienced a 27 percent reduction in disability or limitations on daily activities caused by pain. In all, 94 percent of the participants said the treatment was beneficial.\n\nThe procedure was not without complications. Five patients needed to have the wires implanted again, two patients had them removed because they were infected, and one had the device removed because of a complication.\n\nMcCarthy said the therapy is not widely available, even though it was approved by the FDA in 2016. At the moment, its use is confined to more advanced medical centers where doctors have been trained in how to implant and regulate the device.\n\nAlso, the procedure isn't covered by all insurance companies, so out-of-pocket costs to patients can be very high. It is, however, covered by Medicare, he said.\n\nFor uninsured patients, the cost of having spine stimulation devices can range from $15,000 to $50,000 or more, according to a 2008 report funded by the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries.\n\nSpine stimulation is usually approved only after patients have not responded to other treatment, according to Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other insurance companies may have varying policies.\n\nMcCarthy hopes that more doctors will be trained in the procedure and that it will become more available, especially because it has the potential to allow patients to stop taking opioids to control their pain.\n\nOne pain specialist not involved with the study saw the benefits of this procedure.\n\n\"The results of this study are very significant,\" said Dr. Kiran Patel, director of neurosurgical pain at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\nIt shows long-term data that patients experienced significant pain relief and functional improvements, she said.\n\n\"In my pain practice and career, dorsal root ganglion stimulation therapy has been one of the most effective technologies available to combat chronic pain,\" Patel said.\n\n\"I encourage chronic pain patients to seek out physicians who are trained and experienced in the application of dorsal root ganglion stimulation therapy to determine if they are a candidate,\" she said.\n\nThe findings were presented Sunday at the American Society of Anesthesiologists annual meeting, in San Francisco.

It's crazy enough to laugh off.\n\nBut here's the thing: BYU researchers have discovered certain compounds found in cocoa can actually help your body release more insulin and respond to increased blood glucose better. Insulin is the hormone that manages glucose, the blood sugar that reaches unhealthy levels in diabetes.\n\nOf course, there's a catch.\n\n\"You probably have to eat a lot of cocoa, and you probably don't want it to have a lot of sugar in it,\" said study author Jeffery Tessem, assistant professor of nutrition, dietetics and food science at BYU. \"It's the compound in cocoa you're after.\"\n\nWhen a person has diabetes, their body either doesn't produce enough insulin or doesn't process blood sugar properly. At the root of that is the failure of beta cells, whose job it is to produce insulin. The new study, published in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, finds beta cells work better and remain stronger with an increased presence of epicatechin monomers, compounds found naturally in cocoa.\n\nTo discover this, collaborators at Virginia Tech first fed the cocoa compound to animals on a high-fat diet. They found that by adding it to the high-fat diet, the compound would decrease the level of obesity in the animals and would increase their ability to deal with increased blood glucose levels.\n\nThe BYU team, comprised of graduate and undergraduate students in Tessem's lab and the labs of Ben Bikman and Jason Hansen (BYU professors of physiology and developmental biology), then dove in and dissected what was happening on the cellular level -- specifically, the beta cell level. That's when they learned cocoa compounds named epicatechin monomers enhanced beta cells' ability to secrete insulin.\n\n\"What happens is it's protecting the cells, it's increasing their ability to deal with oxidative stress,\" Tessem said. \"The epicatechin monomers are making the mitochondria in the beta cells stronger, which produces more ATP (a cell's energy source), which then results in more insulin being released.\"\n\nWhile there has been a lot of research on similar compounds over the past decade, no one has been able to pinpoint which ones are the most beneficial or how exactly they bring about any benefit -- until now. This research shows the epicatechin monomers, the smallest of the compounds, are the most effective.\n\n\"These results will help us get closer to using these compounds more effectively in foods or supplements to maintain normal blood glucose control and potentially even delay or prevent the onset of type-2 diabetes,\" said study co-author Andrew Neilson, assistant professor of food science at Virginia Tech.\n\nBut rather than stocking up on the sugar-rich chocolate bars at the checkout line, researchers believe the starting point is to look for ways to take the compound out of cocoa, make more of it and then use it as a potential treatment for current diabetes patients.

Administering the hormone soon after a child's autism is diagnosed might help him or her develop more normally, she said.\n\n\"It's possible it can become a cure, if it's given early when the problems are detected in the little kids,\" Sirigu said. \"We can change the way these patients interact with people from childhood.\"\n\nBecause previous research has indicated that some people with autism might have abnormally low levels of oxytocin, conducting tests to identify those people and administering them the hormone might help as well, said Karen Parker, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine.\n\n\"If you can find someone who appears to have deficits in oxytocin biology, giving them what you might argue would be replacement oxytocin may be helpful,\" Parker said.\n\nAutism is a baffling disorder that can cause a variety of symptoms, including speech and learning problems and profound, disabling difficulties understanding emotions and social cues when interacting with people. The number of children found to have autism has been increasing for reasons that remain mysterious.\n\nOxytocin is produced naturally in the bodies of humans and animals. It plays a key role in social interaction, promoting maternal behavior and monogamy in animals. The hormone also heightens social sensitivity, social awareness, generosity and trust in people.\n\nPrevious U.S. studies found that people with autism who received the hormone intravenously were less likely to engage in repetitive behavior that is another hallmark of autism and were more likely to be able to identify emotions in voices. Another study being published in the journal Biological Psychiatry found that 16 autistic males in Australia ages 12 to 19 who received the hormone through a nasal spray were better able to recognize other people's facial expressions.\n\n\"All the data seem to suggest that manipulating the oxytocin system has a powerful effect on the core symptoms of autism,\" said Eric Hollander, director of the compulsive, impulsive and autism spectrum disorders program at the Montefiore Medical Center in New York.\n\nWhile cautioning that more research is needed on children and additional patients to make sure oxytocin is safe and effective, advocates for families with children with autism welcomed the findings.

Ergo, it may be necessary to draw out the day\u2019s protective ministrations into nighttime.\n\nThis information is in the early stages of transforming the category of after-sun care\u2014a category traditionally limited to aloe vera-laden moisturizers and gels that lowered the temperature of sun-parched skin but not much else. Product formulators are now seeing after-sun care as another line of defense to stop cell mutations and aging in its tracks.\n\nMs. Peterson recommends her Pacific Mist spray which contains antioxidant-rich green tea and white tea extracts as well as sea fennel extract, which aids in hydration, and the line\u2019s Pacific Face Oil which contains a mix of oils from chia seed, kiwi, passion fruit and papaya seed\u2014all rich in essential fatty acids and antioxidants.\n\nWhen shopping for other after-sun treatments, be aware that some labels only add a trace, ineffective amount of a beneficial ingredient to a product in order to tout its effects on the label, while others have a bona fide antioxidant slant.\n\nOne Love Organics, a 6-year-old company founded by ex-lawyer Suzanne LeRoux, is a fine example of the latter. Based in St. Simons Island, Ga., the brand has an Eco-Cert-certified lab that creates mostly organic, botanical-based face and body treatments developed with sun exposure in mind. Ms. LeRoux typically recommends layering the brand\u2019s Vitamin C Body Oil or the Gardenia + Tea Antioxidant Body Serum under sunscreen during the day. Rich with botanical oils and green tea extract, both are also ideal after-sun products. \u201cOur lab is on an island in the South. We think about sun exposure a lot,\u201d she added.\n\nAfter-sun care converts should also look for products dispensed in a pump or spray which keeps contents from oxidizing when exposed to air, like Blissoma\u2019s pomegranate extract-filled Amend Antioxidant Sprayable Lotion. Avoid products formulated with alcohol, which can dry skin out.\n\nNot everyone is convinced of the effectiveness of after-sun care. Beverly Hills-based dermatologist Rhonda Rand believes most products can only lower skin temperature and add moisture. \u201cThat can make sun-exposed skin feel better,\u201d she said, \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing you can do to reverse sun exposure.\u201d And while Henry Lim, president of the American Academy of Dermatology, believes that the Yale study was important, he cautions that you only have a three-hour window after sun exposure to take advantage of any potential product benefits\u2014and that antioxidants \u201care notoriously not very stable and must be formulated carefully in order to be effective.\u201d\n\nBut believers like True Nature Botanicals\u2019 Ms. Peterson are undeterred. \u201cIn medicine, you need a definitive study,\u201d she countered. \u201cWe can\u2019t get doctors to say if you eat a healthier diet, your body will function better.

Patients were treated with SBRT for early-stage lung cancer between 2004 and 2014 and followed for a median of 1.7 years. The cohort included 305 patients under 70 years of age, 448 patients ages 70 to 79 years, and 330 patients aged 80 years or more (which included 16 patients aged 90 years or more). The median age was 75 years (range 41to 94).\n\nStudy results show no significant differences among the three age groups with respect to 2-year local recurrence, regional recurrence, distant metastases or the incidence of grade 3 or higher toxicity. Cause-specific survival was similar among all three age groups (90.3 to 90.6 percent). Two-year overall survival was lower in older patients, which is likely related to other medical issues.\n\n\"Older patients are often not considered for radiation therapy due to concerns about their ability to tolerate treatment.

Bipolar disorder often is misdiagnosed as major depression. But while the symptoms of the depressive phase of bipolar disorder are similar to that of major depression, the treatments are different and often challenging for the physician. In bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, a patient swings between an emotional high (manic episode) and severe depression. Treatment for the depressed phase includes an antidepressant along with a safeguard such as a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic drug to prevent a switch to a manic episode. A physician who misdiagnoses bipolar disorder as major depression could inadvertently trigger a manic episode by prescribing an antidepressant without a safeguard mood stabilizing drug. The study found that heart rate variability, as measured by an electrocardiogram, indicated whether subjects had major depression or bipolar disorder. (Heart rate variability is a variation in the time interval between heartbeats.) The study, by senior author Angelos Halaris, MD, PhD and colleagues, was published in the World Journal of Biological Psychiatry. \"Having a noninvasive, easy-to-use and affordable test to differentiate between major depression and bipolar disorder would be a major breakthrough in both psychiatric and primary care practices,\" Dr. Halaris said. Dr. Halaris said further research is needed to confirm the study\u2019s findings and determine their clinical significance. Dr. Halaris is a professor in Loyola's department of psychiatry and behavioral neurosciences and medical director of adult psychiatry. Major depression is among the most common and severe health problems in the world. In the United States, at least 8 to 10 percent of the population suffers from major depression at any given time. While less common than major depression, bipolar disorder is a significant mental health problem, affecting an estimated 50 million people worldwide. The Loyola study enrolled 64 adults with major depression and 37 adults with bipolar disorder. All subjects underwent electrocardiograms at the start of the study. Each participant rested comfortably on an exam table while a three-lead electrocardiogram was attached to the chest. After the patient rested for 15 minutes, the electrocardiographic data were collected for 15 minutes. Using a special software package, researchers converted the electrocardiographic data into the components of heart rate variability. These data were further corrected with specialized software programs developed by study co-author Stephen W. Porges, PhD, of Indiana University's Kinsey Institute. In measuring heart rate variability, researchers computed what is known to cardiologists as respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). At the baseline (beginning of the study), the subjects with major depression had significantly higher RSA than those with bipolar disorder. In a secondary finding, researchers found that patients with bipolar disorder had higher blood levels of inflammation biomarkers than patients with major depression. Inflammation occurs when the immune system revs up in response to a stressful condition such as bipolar disorder. The study is titled \"Low cardiac vagal tone index by heart rate variability differentiates bipolar from major depression.\" In addition to Drs. Halaris and Porges, other co-authors are Brandon Hage, MD, a graduate of Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine now at the University of Pittsburgh (first author); Stritch student Briana Britton; Loyola psychiatric resident David Daniels, MD; and Keri Heilman, PhD of the University of North Carolina.", "question": "Does the news release establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "From the news release, it\u2019s hard to determine what exactly is new in this study.\nA Google search yields a similar study published in the IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics.

On average, the accuracy of such predictions was 69 percent.\nAnother 2002 study published in the Journal of Affective Disorders looked at levels of respiratory sinus arrhythmia to predict the course of major depressive disorder.\nIf the news release uses terms like \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d and \u201cmajor breakthrough\u201d (see the unjustifiable language section), we especially need more context on exactly how this research differs from other studies and what it brings to the current body of literature.\nWe rate this one Not Satisfactory.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "Researchers are hoping that by using a common tool for measuring of brain activity in a new way, they may be one step closer to identifying whether a child is a greater risk for autism.\n\n\"We haven't diagnosed autism at this point,\" says William Bosl, Ph.D., lead author and a research scientist at Children's Hospital Boston. But he says by using an electroencephalogram and new, sophisticated computer programs to analyze the EEGs, he and his co-authors were able to correctly identify with 80% accuracy, which babies were at higher risk for autism and which were not.\n\nScientists have known for quite some time now that the earlier a child with autism gets therapy, the easier it is to improve language and behavioral skills. In 2007, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that all children be screened for autism at the ages of 18 months and 24 months. Here researchers are trying to find markers for autism before a child begins showing signs of autism.\n\nIn a new study published Tuesday in the journal BMC Medicine, scientists studied 79 infants. 46 babies had a brother or sister with known autism, which means they themselves are at an increased risk for the neurodevelopmental disorder that affects about one in 110 children according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The sibling of a child with a confirmed diagnosis of autism has a 1 in 5 chance of also developing the disorder. These infant siblings were compared with 33 infants with no known family history of autism.\n\nThe babies were given EEG's at 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months of age. Researchers strapped a net of 64 electrodes all over a baby's head while it was sitting in its mom's lap and a research assistant was blowing bubbles to hold the child's attention. The electrodes measured actual firings of neurons. The EEG technique is much easier to use because the baby can be awake and moving and wiggling around, says Dr. Geraldine Dawson, chief science officer for the advocacy group Autism Speaks, which partially funded this research. Other brain imaging technologies like magnetic resonance imaging would require a baby to be asleep or sedated because they have to be completely still while the test is being done. \"Nobody wants to sedate a healthy infant,\" says Dawson.\n\nBosl explains that the new computer algorithms that he developed were able to analyze results of the EEG much better than in the past. He said that, judging by the differences in brain activity, he and his colleagues could detect which babies were in the high-risk group. They say they were nearly 100% accurate when the boys were 9 months old. They were most accurate with baby girls at age 6 months. Overall, the biggest differences in brain activity were seen at 9 months \u2013 which is much earlier than when a child typically shows behavioral problems associated with autism. The differences in brain activity were smaller as the babies got older.\n\nDoctors and scientists not connected to the study are intrigued by the results but caution that this is very early research and not something concerned parents can be looking for as a screening tool for their babies any time soon.\n\nSarah Paterson, Ph.D., is the director of the neuroimaging lab at the Center for Autism Research at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. She is also looking for early signs of autism as part of the Infant Brain Imaging Study, but her work focuses on differences in brain structure. Paterson says that if the results out of Boston can be confirmed, \"It's very exciting because finding an early sign for autism is really the holy grail.\" But she cautions that a lot more work needs to be done. \"This study needs to be replicated by their lab and independent scientists,\" she says.\n\nDr. Max Wiznitzer says the researchers have found a \"really fascinating technique, that offers a different way to look at the brain.\" Wiznitzer \u2013 a pediatric neurologist at Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio \u2013 notes that what the study can't tell us is what the differences in brain activity between the two groups of babies actually mean. He, too, is hopeful that further research will provide more concrete information.\n\nBosl says the first children enrolled in his study are now at 2 and 3 years old, which is the age when autism usually is diagnosed. This will now allow the researchers to evaluate them for autism and then look back at the brain activity patterns of the children who do fit the clinical criteria for autism.\n\nBosl acknowledges that if this is very early research, but he believes if the results are confirmed, it may lead to a safe and inexpensive way to detect autism, which would allow intervention before any autistic behaviors appear.\n\n \"It'll change the field, if this works,\" says Bosl. He hopes to expand the number of babies in his study to 200. \"The only thing slowing us down right now is funding.\"", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The story is quite clear that EEG is not new but that the analysis method is new.

Men with high-risk cancer need long-term hormone therapy.\n\nThe hormone therapy is known as androgen deprivation therapy. It's designed to reduce the levels of male hormones (androgens) in the body, since they can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells.\n\n\"For patients with early, localized cancer of the prostate who were treated with radiation therapy, [by] adding short-term androgen deprivation therapy, we improved their cure rates and increased their chance of living 10 years from 57 percent to 62 percent,\" said lead researcher Dr. Christopher U. Jones, from Radiological Associates of Sacramento, Calif.\n\nBut when the researchers looked closely at those findings, they found that patients with low-risk prostate cancer did not need hormone therapy because the chance they would survive with radiation alone was already almost 99 percent, Jones said.\n\nAnd while short term hormonal therapy is \"not very toxic, there are [still] some toxicities,\" Jones noted. \"We don't want to treat any man unnecessarily with that type of treatment. We really want to make sure -- if we are going to recommend that treatment -- the person really needs it,\" he said.\n\nOn the other hand, hormone therapy plus radiation was most effective in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer. \"We decreased the risk of dying from prostate cancer in those patients from 10 percent to 3 percent, at 10 years,\" Jones said.\n\nFor patients with high-risk prostate cancer, using hormone therapy for just a short while is not effective, he added. \"We know from other studies that short-term androgen deprivation therapy isn't enough. You need to give long-term androgen deprivation therapy in addition to radiation to have the best results,\" Jones said.\n\nThe report was published in the July 14 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nFor the study, Jones' team randomly assigned almost 2,000 men with prostate cancer to radiation therapy alone or in combination with four months of hormone therapy. The hormone therapy started two months before radiation.\n\nSide effects of male hormone therapy can include erectile dysfunction (impotence), loss of sex drive, hot flashes, growth of breast tissue, loss of muscle and bone mass, weight gain, nausea, liver problems, fatigue, memory problems and mood swings.\n\nIn October 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration asked manufacturers to add a warning that certain drugs used in hormone therapy (including the one used in the study) were linked to a small but increased risk of diabetes, heart attack, stroke and sudden death in men.\n\nIn this study, men treated with hormone therapy experienced a much higher percentage of liver damage; toxic effects of radiation treatment were similar in both groups.\n\nOver an average of over nine years of follow-up, 62 percent of the men who had combination therapy were alive, compared with 57 percent of the men who received radiation therapy alone, the researchers found.\n\nOverall, hormone therapy reduced the risk of dying from prostate cancer over 10 years from 8 percent to 4 percent, Jones said.\n\nHe noted that the radiation treatments in use today differ from those given in 1994 when the trial began.\n\n\"We can give 15 to 20 percent higher doses of radiation now than we could then, and we can do it more safely and more accurately,\" he said. So, that brings into question how much, if any, hormone therapy is needed, he added.\n\nAn ongoing trial among patients with intermediate risk prostate cancer aims to answer that question, Jones said. \"We are going to find out if androgen deprivation therapy still applies to patients treated with modern techniques,\" he said.\n\n\"This study, in conjunction with what we know about hormonal therapy, really nails home the conclusion that hormonal therapy should not be used in men with low-risk disease because the risks outweigh any conceivable benefit,\" commented Dr. Anthony D'Amico, chief of radiation oncology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and author of an accompanying journal editorial.\n\nD'Amico noted that new studies using up-to-date high-dose radiation also found that the addition of short-term hormone therapy improved outcomes at five years for men with intermediate risk prostate cancer, compared with radiation alone.\n\n\"If you are in the low-risk category, stay away from hormone therapy. It does no good. [It] can hurt,\" D'Amico said. \"If you have anything beyond low-risk [prostate cancer], the hormonal therapy helps,\" he said. \"It's just a matter of how long you need it for. It could be four months, six months or longer.\"\n\nThese findings are good news for some men, since the effects of short term of hormone therapy are reversible, D'Amico said. \"It's not three years, where men are changed forever,\" he said.\n\nFor more information on prostate cancer, visit the American Cancer Society.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The story was clear that the treatments in the study, with some modification, are currently available.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Twelve years ago, a car wreck took away Nathan Copeland's ability to control his hands or sense what his fingers were touching.\n\nA few months ago, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center gave Copeland a new way to reach out and feel the world around him. It's a mind-controlled robotic arm that has pressure sensors in each fingertip that send signals directly to Copeland's brain.\n\nThe scientists published details of their work online Thursday in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\n\"It's a really weird sensation,\" Copeland, now 30, says in a video made shortly after he first tried the system. \"Sometimes it feels, kind of, like electrical and sometimes it's more of a pressure.\" But he also describes many of the sensations coming from his robotic hand as \"natural.\"\n\nWhen Copeland touches an object with the robotic hand, he can tell which finger the sensation is coming from and whether an object feels hard or soft, says Robert Gaunt, a bioengineer and assistant professor in the Department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\n\"But we're really not at the point where we could, say, get him to feel the difference between silk and burlap,\" Gaunt says.\n\nThe success represents an advance that is \"absolutely critical in terms of making prosthetics useful,\" says Mike McLoughlin, an engineer at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.\n\nMcLoughlin is part of a team at Hopkins that developed the Modular Prosthetic Limb that Copeland is using. The research at both Hopkins and in Pittsburgh is supported by the government's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.\n\nFor several years now, people have been able to control robotic arms using thoughts alone. But they have relied entirely on vision to know whether the arm is going in the right direction or grasping an object with the proper amount of force.\n\nThat makes it very challenging to perform simple tasks like grasping a foam coffee cup without crushing it, McLoughlin says.\n\n\"Without sensory feedback, somebody would have to actually have to look at the prosthetic, look at the cup, start to close the hand, (and) visually see the cup is starting to deform,\" he says.\n\nRestoring Copeland's sense of touch was a painstaking process, but the Pittsburgh team knew it was possible.\n\n\"His hand has been disconnected from his brain because of his spinal cord injury,\" Gaunt says. \"But the brain hasn't lost its ability to feel.\"\n\nSo the team began looking for a way to send touch sensations directly to Copeland's brain. The first step was to monitor his brain activity using a technique called magnetoencephalography.\n\n\"We were able to see the parts of his brain that became active when he was watching videos of a hand being touched,\" Gaunt says.\n\nNext, the researchers placed tiny electrodes in Copeland's brain that could stimulate the areas corresponding to each finger. Then they waited for the brain to heal, as it adjusted to the presence of the electrodes.\n\nIt was several weeks before the team was able to send the first tiny pulse of electricity to Copeland's brain. \"When it finally happened, he just very calmly said, 'Yep, I felt it on my index finger,' \" Gaunt recalls. \"But in the background I was breathing a sigh of relief and other people were cheering.\"\n\nOf course, mind-controlled robots are still years away from consumer applications, McLoughlin says. At the moment, they are still too expensive, too bulky and too finicky to be used outside a laboratory setting. And there's no good way to control them without implanting electrodes in the brain.\n\nStill, the ability to receive touch sensation from a robotic arm has the potential to help not only thousands of people who are paralyzed, but also people with a wide range of physical disabilities, McLoughlin says. For example, robots that provide sensory feedback could eventually help a disabled person cook a meal or clean up things at home.\n\n\"We're on the verge of something here that's going to transform lives,\" he says.", "question": "Does the story establish the true novelty of the approach?", "explanation": "The novelty is well-established by the story\u2019s explanation of the experimental therapy.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Highlight\n\u2022 A healthy diet high in fruits, vegetables, fish, legumes, cereals, whole grains, and fiber, and low in red meat, salt, and refined sugars was linked with a reduced risk of early death in an analysis of 7 studies.\n\nNewswise \u2014 Washington, DC (December 8, 2016) \u2014 A diet that emphasizes healthy foods rather than individual nutrients may help patients with chronic kidney disease live longer.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2015 gave the food industry until next year to eliminate artificial trans fats from American products.\n\nNew York City enacted a restaurant ban on the fats in 2007 and several counties in the state did the same. Hospital admissions for heart attacks and strokes in those areas declined 6 percent starting three years after the bans, compared with counties without bans. The results translate to 43 fewer heart attacks and strokes per 100,000 people, said lead author Dr. Eric Brandt, a Yale University cardiology fellow.\n\nHis study was published Wednesday in JAMA Cardiology.\n\nTrans fats, also called partially hydrogenated oils, enhance food texture and structure. They were once commonly used to make restaurant fried chicken, French fries, doughnuts and other foods and found in grocery items including cookies, crackers and margarine.\n\nThese fats can boost blood levels of unhealthy cholesterol, increasing risks for heart problems. The FDA in 2006 required them to be listed on food labels and the food industry has been switching to healthier oils.\n\nThe researchers examined hospital admissions data from 2002 to 2013 in 11 New York counties that adopted bans and in 25 counties that did not.

It found that bariatric surgery:\n\u2022 produced a mean weight loss of more than 100 pounds\n\nCHARLOTTESVILLE, Va., Oct. 1, 2015 - A study evaluating the effects of bariatric surgery on obese women most at risk for cancer has found that the weight-loss surgery slashed participants' weight by a third and eliminated precancerous uterine growths in those that had them. Other effects included improving patients' physical quality of life, improving their insulin levels and ability to use glucose - which may reduce their risk for diabetes - and even altering the composition of their gut bacteria.\n\nThe study speaks both to the benefits of bariatric surgery and to the tremendous toll obesity takes on health. \"If you look at cancers in women, about a fifth of all cancer deaths would be prevented if we had women at normal body weight in the U.S.,\" said Susan C. Modesitt, MD, of the University of Virginia Cancer Center. \"When you're looking at obesity-related cancers, the biggest one is endometrial cancer, but also colon cancer, breast cancer, renal cancer and gall bladder cancer. We think about 40 [percent] to 50 percent of all endometrial cancer, which is in the lining of the uterus, is caused by obesity.\"\n\nThe study looked at 71 women with a mean age of 44.2 years and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 50.9. Women are considered obese at a BMI of 30 and morbidly obese at 40 (which is typically about 100 pounds over a woman's ideal body weight), yet almost a third of women presenting for bariatric surgery did not identify themselves as obese.\n\nThe study looked at the effects of bariatric surgery in a relatively short timeframe, one to three years after surgery. A total of 68 participants underwent the procedure; two opted out of the surgery, and another died of a heart condition prior to surgery. The effects of surgery on body weight were dramatic: Mean weight loss was more than 100 pounds.\n\nTen percent of study participants who had not had a hysterectomy showed precancerous changes in the lining of the uterus, and all of those resolved with weight loss. \"We're talking about small numbers, really tiny numbers\" of study participants, Modesitt said, noting one limitation of the study. \"So I could never say that effect is definitive, but it is suggestive, given that we know already the incredibly strong link between endometrial cancer and obesity.\"\n\nModesitt, of the UVA's Division of Gynecologic Oncology in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, was most surprised by the dramatic changes seen in the patients' metabolic profiles derived from the gut microbiome, the population of microorganisms living inside us. \"The study results demonstrate that there is a huge alteration, but I don't even know what to say about that, except it is really new and intriguing area to look at in the link between obesity and cancer. For example, before groundbreaking work by Dr. John Marshall at UVA in the past, no one knew that ulcers were from bacteria. Who knows what role the gut bacteria play in promoting obesity, but metabolic parameter/markers of the bacteria definitely changed after [study participants] lost weight.\"\n\nWhile the study speaks to the transformative effect bariatric surgery can have, Modesitt urged people to avoid gaining weight in the first place and for those seeking to lose weight to exercise and eat more healthily before turning to surgery. \"We really should be working on diet and exercise from the get-go in our entire society, starting with our children. And exercise does seem to be protective -- even if you don't lose all the weight, it absolutely has beneficial effects,\" she said. \"There are lots of studies showing if you exercise, it improves your insulin, your glucose, all of those sorts of things that go along with the cancer-causing effect.

The research team reports that the potential improvement in diagnostic accuracy will spare thousands of patients each year in the United States alone from having to undergo unnecessary surgery.\n\nIn a recent report on ongoing work to improve kidney tumor classification, published in the April issue of the journal Clinical Nuclear Medicine, the team reports that the sestamibi SPECT/CT test\u2014short for 99mTc-sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography(CT) \u2014 adds additional diagnostic information in conjunction with conventional CTs and MRI and improves physicians\u2019 ability to differentiate between benign and malignant kidney tumors.\n\n\u201cSestamibi SPECT/CT lets radiologists and urologists \u2018see\u2019 the most common benign kidney tumor, something CT and MRI have not succeeded in doing alone,\u201d says Mohamad E. Allaf, M.D., MEA Endowed Professor of Urology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \u201cThis noninvasive scan may prevent patients with a potentially benign kidney tumor from having to undergo a surgery to remove the tumor or potentially the entire kidney, along with its associated risks and high costs. At Johns Hopkins, use of this test has already spared a number of our patients from unnecessary surgery and unnecessary removal of a kidney that would require them to be on dialysis. These results are hugely encouraging, but we need to do more studies.\u201d\n\nFor this study, 48 patients who were diagnosed with a kidney tumor on conventional CT or MRI were imaged with sestamibi SPECT/CT at Johns Hopkins prior to surgery. Radiologists, who were not allowed to talk to each other or know the results of the surgeries, graded the conventional and sestamibi SPECT/CT images benign or malignant using a 5-point scale (1 = definitely benign, 5 = definitely cancerous).\n\nFollowing surgery, similarly \u2018blinded\u2019 pathologists analyzed the tumors without knowing the radiologists\u2019 imaging results. Pathology results of surgically removed tumors showed that 8 of the 48 were benign. The remaining 40 were classified as a variety of other tumor types, including malignant renal cell carcinomas.\n\nReviewing sestamibi SPECT/CT scan results in conjunction with CT or MRI changed the initial rating levels from cancerous (score 3, 4, 5) toward benign (score 1 and 2) in 9 cases, and changed reviewers\u2019 score from likely cancerous (score 4) to definitely cancerous (score 5) in 5 cases, or about 10 percent of all cases. The addition of sestamibi SPECT/CT increased the reviewers\u2019 diagnostic certainty in 14 of the 48 patients, or in nearly 30 percent of all cases.\n\nOverall, the investigators said, adding sestamibi SPECT/CT helped identify 7 of 9 benign tumors, and conventional imaging with added sestamibi SPECT/CT outperformed conventional imaging alone, as measured by a statistical analysis that measures tradeoffs between sensitivity and specificity. On this measure, a value of 0.50 indicates that a diagnostic test is no better than chance. Conventional imaging combined with sestamibi SPECT/CT had a value of 0.85, while conventional imaging alone had a value of 0.60.\n\nEven for patients whose tumors were not reclassified, the addition of sestamibi SPECT/CT increased physicians\u2019 ability to more confidently classify malignant tumors, which reduces the risk of misdiagnosis and unnecessary surgery for all patients, the researchers say.\n\nRadiologists and urologists have been frustrated for decades by the inability of conventional imaging tests, such as CT and MRI, to distinguish benign from malignant kidney tumors. At Johns Hopkins, multispecialty teams work together to determine the best care for patients and as partners on research innovations and quality improvement initiatives. \u201cThis collaborative venue enabled two then-residents [Drs. Michael Gorin and Steven Rowe] from different departments and specialties to design a clinical trial based on a few reports in the literature suggesting a potential role for sestamibi SPECT/CT in this diagnostic conundrum, and their hypothesis proved correct,\u201d says Mehrbod Som Javadi, MD, assistant professor of radiology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the senior author on the paper. Pamela T. Johnson, MD, associate professor of radiology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine notes, \u201cthese types of advances are critical to our precision medicine initiative, Hopkins inHealth, designed for individualized patient management, and to our mission of high-value health care, where the highest quality care is safely delivered at the lowest personal and financial cost to the patient.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs radiologists, we have struggled to find noninvasive ways to better classify patients and spare unnecessary surgery, but this has not been easy,\u201d says Steven P. Rowe, M.D., Ph.D., one of the two former residents who developed this approach, and now assistant professor of radiology and radiological science at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \u201cSestamibi SPECT/CT offers an inexpensive and widely available means of better characterizing kidney tumors, and the identical test is now being performed as part of a large trial in Sweden, for which the first results have just recently been published and appear to confirm our conclusions.\u201d\n\nAlthough further study is needed to validate the accuracy of sestamibi SPECT/CT, this test appears to be a less expensive, faster, noninvasive alternative to surgery, says Michael A. Gorin, M.D., the other resident involved in developing this approach and now chief resident with The James Buchanan Brady Urological Institute of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \u201cIn the absence of diagnostic certainty, surgeons tend to remove kidney tumors in an abundance of caution, leading to an estimated 5,600 surgically removed benign kidney tumors each year in the United States.\u201d\n\nOther authors on this paper include, Sara Sheikhbahaei, Christopher S.
