[{"article": "Many migraine sufferers could have fewer, less severe headaches if they took preventive medicines, but few eligible patients do, say doctors releasing updated treatment guidelines Monday.\n\nThe guidelines list seven prescription medicines and one herbal remedy backed by strong evidence, and include many other treatments that might work for some patients.\n\n\"Migraine is one of the most disabling conditions known to man, but patients need to know that there is hope,\" says Stephen Silberstein, a neurologist at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia and lead author of the guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society. They were presented at an academy meeting and published in the journal Neurology.\n\nMedicines backed by the strongest evidence include anti-seizure drugs (divalproex sodium, sodium valproate and topiramate), blood pressure drugs (metoprolol, propranolol and timolol) and, for menstrual-related migraines, a medicine called frovatriptan, the guidelines say. They also cite strong support for the herbal remedy butterbur and include a longer list of prescription and non-prescription therapies patients can consider.\n\nThese preventive treatments usually are used daily. The guidelines do not look at the options patients have once symptoms begin.\n\nNot everyone with migraines needs prevention medicine. But nearly 40% have headaches that are so frequent (at least once a week), severe or hard-to-treat that they qualify, Silberstein says. Studies find that just 3% to 13% use the treatments.\n\nWhy so few? One reason is that it's hard to persuade people to take medicines on days when they feel fine, says Elizabeth Loder, a neurologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Silberstein adds that some patients have not been properly diagnosed or made aware of their options. Still others try the treatments and decide they don't work or have unacceptable side effects.\n\n\"You have a lot of gun-shy patients because of a lot of bad experiences,\" says Michael John Coleman, founder of the patient group MAGNUM, also known as the National Migraine Association. Many spend months or years taking medicines that don't work and make them miserable, he says.\n\nThat's what happened to Emily Guzan, 26, a lawyer from Pittsburgh who was diagnosed with migraine in 2008. She was given a prescription for Topamax (topiramate), and it \"was a real nightmare,\" she says. She kept having headaches bad enough to land her in an emergency room once a month and suffered nightmares, an altered sense of taste, an unwanted 30-pound weight loss and memory problems \u2014 all of which she attributes to the drug.\n\nShe tried some other medications, but for now, she's given up on all of them and says she's getting better results with diet, yoga and other lifestyle changes.\n\nFinding the right medication for the right patient can take a lot of trial and error and careful dosing, Silberstein says. But about 80% will get relief, he says \u2014 defined as a headache reduction of at least 50% \u2014 after trying three or four drugs, alternative remedies and lifestyle changes.\n\nEven hard-to-treat patients may eventually respond to something, Loder says, so she urges frustrated patients to keep trying.\n\n\"The life toll that poorly controlled headaches take is really underappreciated,\" she says. \"You don't get back the time you lost at work or the time you lost with your children.\"\n\nColeman, of Alexandria, Va., also urges fellow sufferers to keep working with their doctors: His own migraines took 40 years to control. \"This is not a cookie-cutter disease and there is no magic bullet, but there is hope.\"", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story was not based solely or largely on a press release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "(Reuters Health) - Complementary and alternative medicine options may help men manage premature ejaculation, according to a new review of existing research.\n\nThe improvements were small, and the studies were of varying quality, but preliminary evidence suggests that acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, Ayurvedic herbal medicine and a Korean topical cream may all have desirable effects, researchers conclude in the journal Sexual Medicine.\n\n\u201cThere are a range of treatments available for premature ejaculation, including drug treatments, behavioral techniques and counseling, however, some men may not want to visit the doctor, take drugs long-term or be on a long wait list for counseling,\u201d said lead author Katy Cooper of the University of Sheffield in the UK.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to evaluate the evidence for other therapies,\u201d she told Reuters Health by email. \u201cTo our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to assess complementary and alternative medicine for premature ejaculation.\u201d\n\nAccording to the International Society for Sexual Medicine, premature ejaculation can be a lifelong problem, and this primary form of the problem is usually defined as ejaculation happening within one minute of initiating vaginal intercourse every time a man has ever had sex. A man\u2019s \u201clatency time\u201d can also become reduced later in his sexual life, and this secondary form is usually defined as ejaculation within three minutes or less.\n\nIn the current study, researchers evaluated 10 randomized controlled trials that included comparisons either to another type of treatment or to a placebo, or dummy, treatment. Two studies were of acupuncture, five were of Chinese herbal medicine, one of Ayurvedic herbal medicine and two of Korean topical \u201cseverance secret\u201d cream.\n\nTogether, the two acupuncture studies found that the treatment slightly increased intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) by about half a minute compared to placebo.\n\nChinese herbal medicine increased IELT by about two minutes, Ayurvedic herbal medicine increased IELT by nearly a minute and topical cream increased IELT by more than eight minutes.\n\nIn some instances, a combination of traditional and alternative options was the most effective. For example, Chinese medicine paired with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) increased IELT by two minutes longer than SSRIs alone and nearly three minutes longer than the Chinese medicine alone.\n\n\u201cThere are no approved treatments for premature ejaculation,\u201d said Donald Patrick, vice chair for research at the University of Washington in Seattle. \u201cThis is a common condition that has serious psychological effects on relationships,\u201d said Patrick, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cWe need treatments to address it, and it should be treated with equal seriousness as erectile dysfunction.\u201d\n\nThe prevalence of premature ejaculation is difficult to measure because of the differing definitions of the problem and some men\u2019s reluctance to report it. Some studies suggest that between 20 and 30 percent of men report early ejaculation concerns, but the International Society for Sexual Medicine estimates that about 4 percent of men have a lifelong condition.\n\n\u201cAlthough it is not openly discussed in the media - at least not as much as erectile problems have been discussed in the post-Viagra era - numerous studies report men feel frustrated, depressed and anxious because of this problem,\u201d said Ege Can Serefoglu of the Bagcilar Training and Research Hospital in Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nThe main limitation of the study is the underlying weakness of the studies evaluated. Bias was unclear in most of the studies, and only five used stopwatches to measure IELT, which is the \u201cgold standard\u201d for premature ejaculation studies, Patrick said.\n\nIn addition, the authors write, the studies are so different, it\u2019s tough to draw conclusions about the different options. For example, the five Chinese medicine studies tested different substances, including Qilin pills, Yimusake and Uighur.\n\nSome studies, but not all, discussed side effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort, dizziness, mild pain and decreased libido. When they were reported, the adverse effects were generally mild, the study team writes.\n\n\u201cNowadays, I am encountering alternative medicine-obsessed patients more than I used to, and it doesn\u2019t make sense to argue with them about the treatment they want,\u201d Serefoglu told Reuters Health by email. \u201cAfter all, the placebo is a well-known clinical phenomenon, and some of my patients report surprisingly favorable outcomes.\u201d", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The range of quoted experts and the comprehensiveness of this story would suggest there isn\u2019t an over-reliance on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Jan. 24, 2011 -- Using electrical pulses to stimulate nerve centers deep within the brain may reduce high blood pressure that can\u2019t be controlled with medication, a case report shows.\n\nDoctors in the U.K. made the discovery after implanting a device that works as an electric stimulator of a region of the brain in a 55-year-old man who had developed chronic pain on the left side of his body following a stroke.\n\nThough his pain eventually returned after four months, his doctors report that their patient\u2019s previously uncontrolled blood pressure has remained normal for nearly three years.\n\nThat was a surprise because experts had long thought that pain had to be reduced to see a reduction in blood pressure.\n\n\u201cPain creates stress and that can have an effect on one\u2019s blood pressure,\u201d says Nikunj J.

Details appear in the current early online edition of the American Journal of Epidemiology.\n\nEarly menopause, the cessation of ovarian function before age 45, affects about 10 percent of women and is associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and early cognitive decline, the authors note. Few studies have evaluated how protein intake is associated with menopause timing, they add, and to their knowledge this is the first to look specifically at early menopause.\n\nBoutot, Bertone-Johnson and colleagues in the School of Public Health and Health Sciences at UMass Amherst, with others, evaluated the relationship between diet and risk of early menopause among members of the Nurses' Health Study II (NHS2), an ongoing prospective study of 116,000 women aged 25-42 when they entered it in 1989.\n\nParticipants were asked to report how often they ate a single serving of 131 foods, beverages and supplements over the previous year, from \"never or less than once a month\" to \"6+ per day.\" They observed that women consuming approximately 6.5 percent of their daily calories as vegetable protein had a significant 16 percent lower risk of early menopause compared to women whose intake was approximately 4 percent of calories.\n\nFor a woman with a 2,000 calorie per day diet, the authors explain, this is equal to three to four servings of such foods as enriched pasta, breakfast cereal, tofu and nuts, or about 32.5 grams a day. They adjusted for age, smoking, body mass index and other possible confounding factors.\n\nBoutot and Bertone-Johnson add, \"Though relatively few women in our study consumed very high levels of vegetable protein and our power for analyses of more extreme intake levels was limited, women consuming 9 or more percent of their calories from vegetable protein had a hazard ratio of 0.41 (95 percent confidence interval = 0.19-0.88)\" compared to those eating less than 4 percent.\n\nOthers on the study team were from Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.

Good news for the millions of people who suffer from skin wounds that won\u2019t heal. A team of researchers at The Ohio State University has brought a potentially transformative solution to the problem by creating a portable adhesive patch that drives a continuous, small electrical current to stimulate healing and reduce the risk of infection.\n\nNearly 7 million Americans have chronic wounds \u2013 typically a result of diabetes, obesity or other conditions that impact circulation \u2013 costing the healthcare system nearly $25 billion each year. The non-healing wounds are painful, can permanently damage nerves, prevent mobility and in extreme cases, cause infection that can lead to death.\n\nThe patch\u2019s design significantly advances existing FDA-approved wireless electroceutical dressing (WED) that harnesses the body\u2019s innate response to injury to help wounds heal.\n\n\u201cA wound naturally produces its own electrical fields that help reduce bacteria and promote cell regeneration; however, this function is likely impaired in chronic wounds,\u201d said Sashwati Roy, PhD, an Associate Professor in the Department of Surgery at Ohio State\u2019s College of Medicine. \u201cThe prototype dressing mimics this physiological process, and while it has proven to create an optimal environment where chronic wounds can heal, we are always looking for new ways to keep pathogens under better control.\u201d\n\nRoy notes that chronic wounds are particularly susceptible to infection because bacteria, which at times are free floating within a wound \u2013 can sometimes mobilize, creating colonies covered by a thick sticky coating called a biofilm. The immune system cannot penetrate the biofilm, and antibiotics can\u2019t get in either \u2013 causing constant inflammation and low-level infection that can further dampen the healing process.\n\nNow, with support from Ohio State\u2019s Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS), researchers from both the College of Engineering and the College of Medicine are taking the technology to the next level. Working with a mechanical and aerospace engineering team led by Shaurya Prakash, PhD and Vish Subramaniam, PhD, the scientists have optimized the bandage\u2019s design and the amount of electrical current delivered. Like present WEDs, the new prototype is flexible, portable and self-contained. Made of silk and silver, the experimental dressing includes a self-contained battery that delivers a continuous, safe, low-level electrical current to the injury. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping this new design may allow electric fields and currents to penetrate more deeply into wounds, and really get to where these biofilms may be hiding,\u201d said Subramaniam, chair of the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Ohio State. \u201cThe destruction of the biofilm would enable antibiotics to start killing off bacteria, reduce chronic inflammation and allow the body\u2019s natural immune response to work more effectively. Bacteria are known to quickly acquire resistance against antibiotics, but to our knowledge, bacteria do not develop resistance against electroceuticals.\u201d To test the experimental design, Roy and a team of scientists developed an animal model to mimic the skin function of a person suffering from metabolic syndrome \u2013 obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar - which mirrors the type of patient that typically develops chronic wounds. Animal models had skin injuries infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus or Acinetobacter baumannii, three different types of bacteria that commonly infect wounds and develop biofilms that are treatment resistant.\n\nEarly results, which were presented at the Wound Healing Society\u2019s Annual Meeting in April 2016 indicate that infected wounds covered by the experimental bioelectric dressing healed better and more quickly than those covered with a plain dressing that is commonly used in the care of wounds today. Scientists hypothesize that the electrical currents may disrupt bacteria in two ways: by interrupting the production of chemical messages that instruct bacteria to develop biofilms and by weakening the molecular structure of existing biofilms, potentially making them more susceptible to antibiotics or the body\u2019s natural immune response. The team\u2019s next move is to focus on the bioelectric bandage as a treatment for chronic wounds in a patient population; however, the technology could also be used to treat acute injuries. Roy also notes that the U. S. Department of Defense is very interested in the dressing as a temporary measure to help prevent infection in soldiers wounded on the battle front.\n\n\u201cThis technology has a long shelf life and is compact enough to be put into any field medical kit. It could be applied immediately to wounds help keep bacteria from mobilizing and start promoting healing until the soldier could be transported to a facility for more intensive medical care.\u201d\n\nThe team already has interest from several industry partners, and is hoping to begin testing the new technology in patients before the end of the year to determine optimal treatment duration and more about the healing effects of electrical fields on skin cells on a molecular level.\n\nThe Ohio State University Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) is funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) program (UL1TR001070, KL2TR001068, TL1TR001069) The CTSA program is led by the NIH\u2019s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS).

Suskind, M.D., M.S., and Emily Finlayson, M.D., M.S., of the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nTo place an electronic embedded link to this study in your story: This link will be live at the embargo time: http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/10.1001/jamasurg.2016.4219\n\nIn a study published online by JAMA Surgery, Daniel E. Hall, M.D., M.Div., M.H.Sc., of the Veterans Affairs Pittsburgh Healthcare System and University of Pittsburgh, and colleagues examined the effect of a Frailty Screening Initiative (FSI) on death and complications by comparing the surgical outcomes of patients treated before and after implementation of the FSI.\n\nAs the U.S. population ages, the number of operations performed on elderly patients will likely increase. Frailty predicts postoperative mortality and illness more than age alone, thus presenting opportunities to identify the highest-risk surgical patients and provide tailored clinical care to improve their outcomes. This study included 9,153 patients (average age, 60 years) from a Veterans Affairs medical center who presented for major, elective, noncardiac surgery. Preoperative frailty was assessed with the Risk Analysis Index (RAI; a 14-item questionnaire), and the records of all frail patients (as determined by a certain RAI score) were flagged for administrative review by the chief of surgery (or designee) before the scheduled operation. On the basis of this review, clinicians from surgery, anesthesia, critical care, and palliative care were notified of the patient\u2019s frailty and associated surgical risks; if indicated, perioperative plans were modified based on team input.\n\nThe researchers found that overall 30-day mortality decreased from 1.6 percent (84 of 5,275 patients) to 0.7 percent (26 of 3,878 patients) after FSI implementation. Improvement was greatest among frail patients (12.2 percent to 3.8 percent), although mortality rates also decreased among the robust patients (1.2 percent to 0.3 percent).

Migraine symptoms, which can be debilitating for many people, are the sixth leading cause of disability, according to the World Health Organization.

It's safe, easy to use and noninvasive.\n\nMULTIMEDIA ALERT: Video and audio are avaiable for download on the Mayo Clinic News Network.\n\nResearchers at Mayo Clinic and other major academic headache centers across the U.S. recently conducted the study that examined the effectiveness of using a single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation device to prevent migraine attacks. The eNeura SpringTMS Post-Market Observational U.S. Study of Migraine study, also known as ESPOUSE, instructed participants to self-administer four pulses with the device in the morning and four pulses at night over three months to prevent and treat migraine attacks as needed.

They also reported paying less attention to pain.\n\nIn general, they also had less disability, a reduced fear of moving, and improvement in mental and physical outlook, according to the study authors.\n\n\"These positive effects were found until the last follow-up measurement at one year after treatment,\" Malfliet said.\n\nThe program involves \"pain neuroscience education with cognition-targeted motor control training,\" she said.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nPain neuroscience education aims to change patients' beliefs about pain, to increase their knowledge of pain and to decrease its threat, Malfliet said.\n\nBesides focusing on the makeup of the spine, the program stressed lifting techniques and stretching. Participants also learned the value of strength, endurance and fitness training.\n\nMany back patients are afraid certain movements will cause them pain, so they avoid them. The new exercises are designed to help overcome that fear, Malfliet said.\n\nThe regimen included the best known exercises for back pain and general exercises, she said. It also included group classes, online activities and personalized training sessions.\n\n\"Be active, and move without fear of pain or reinjury,\" Malfliet said. \"Your level of activity or way of moving before the chronic pain began should be used as a guideline target.\"\n\nWhereas back pain studies involving exercise and drugs have shown changes to the brain's gray matter, the program in this study found no brain changes, Malfliet said.\n\nDr. Kiran Patel is director of neurosurgical pain at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\nPatel said the dual mental and exercise approach is used to treat phantom pain in patients after a limb amputation.

Oct. 8, 2018 \u2013 The Maryland Proton Treatment Center (MPTC) is now offering deep-tissue external thermal therapy in combination with high-precision proton-beam radiotherapy as a potential way to boost survival chances for certain cancer patients. MPTC is the only center in the world to offer these two treatments at the same facility, an advantage to patients because these therapies are typically given within an hour of each other.\n\nResearch has shown that thermal therapy can be especially useful in difficult-to-reach cancers in the abdomen and pelvic region. Studies have found that adding thermal therapy to standard treatments can significantly shrink tumors and can improve survival for some patients. External thermal therapy, or hyperthermia \u2013 in the range of 104\u00b0 up to 110\u00b0 F. \u2013 sensitizes tumor cells to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In addition, heat has been shown to enhance anti-tumor immune response.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased to be able to offer deep-tissue thermal therapy, which can be combined with standard radiation therapy as well as proton-beam therapy to enhance the cancer-killing effects of the radiation,\u201d says Zeljko Vujaskovic, MD, PhD, a professor of radiation oncology and director of the Division of Translational Radiation Sciences (DTRS) in the Department of Radiation Oncology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM).\n\n\u201cEarly research suggests that adding thermal therapy to proton-beam therapy may be associated with an even greater benefit than when combined with standard radiation therapy, and we are excited to be at the forefront of making this combination therapy available to cancer patients,\u201d says Dr. Vujaskovic, an internationally recognized expert in hyperthermic oncology.\n\nProton therapy is a precise form of radiation therapy that deposits all of its energy within the tumor and allows for less irradiation of noncancerous tissue. MPTC \u2013 which is affiliated with the University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center (UMGCCC) at the University of Maryland Medical Center \u2013 is the only proton treatment center in Maryland.\n\nRadiation oncologists at UMGCCC already use external thermal therapy to treat a range of cancers, but do not currently use it for cancers that are deeper in the body.\n\nAccording to Dr. Vujaskovic, the new deep-tissue thermal therapy equipment, which is made by Pyrexar, will be used to treat cancers of the abdominal and pelvic region, including cancer of the bladder, rectum, cervix, ovaries, pancreas and connective tissue, which are known as sarcomas. Patients would typically receive the thermal therapy two times a week for an hour before or after they receive standard (photon) radiation or proton-beam therapy.\n\nThe system heats the tumor tissue to 108\u00b0 F. with internal and external probes that enable doctors to continuously monitor the temperature. A water-filled applicator is placed over the area to be treated, and non-invasive radio frequency energy is directed at the tumor. The heat causes the blood vessels in the tumor to dilate, bringing more oxygen into the tumor, which makes cancer cells more vulnerable to radiation therapy.\n\nThe acquisition of the deep-tissue thermal therapy system was made possible by donations from Jack and Emily Howell and the Middendorf Foundation, Inc.\n\n\u201cWithin the Department of Radiation Oncology and throughout our cancer center, we strive to make every available tool in the cancer-fighting toolbox available to our patients,\u201d says William F. Regine, MD, FACR, FACRO, the Isadore & Fannie Schneider Foxman Endowed Chair and Professor of radiation oncology at UMSOM and chair of radiation oncology at UMGCCC. \u201cBy continuing to develop a comprehensive thermal oncology program, we are giving patients more effective treatment options and therefore another reason to hope for better outcomes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Maryland Proton Treatment Center has achieved another milestone by becoming the first center to offer both deep-thermal therapy and proton therapy,\u201d says E. Albert Reece, MD, PhD, MBA, Executive Vice President for Medical Affairs at UM Baltimore and the John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor and dean at UMSOM. \u201cThis achievement is a testament to Dr. Vujaskovic\u2019s considerable expertise in hyperthermic oncology and leadership in developing an outstanding thermal oncology program at the University of Maryland. It\u2019s this type of innovation that sets MPTC apart from other proton treatment centers.\u201d\n\nAbout the University of Maryland School of Medicine\n\nCommemorating its 210th Anniversary, the University of Maryland School of Medicine was chartered in 1807 as the first public medical school in the United States.

It is a highly effective treatment for a wide range of localized tumors such as those found in the brain, base of the skull, head and neck area, eye tumors, tumors of the esophagus, lung, prostate, liver, breast, spinal cord, as well as gastrointestinal malignancies. It is also an important treatment option for children with cancer.\n\nAt MPTC, each treatment room is equipped with the most advanced form of \u201cpencil beam\u201d proton therapy, which essentially paints the radiation onto the tumor while stopping precisely at the site of the tumor. Proton therapy is performed on an outpatient basis and is a well-tolerated, non-invasive treatment that can reduce side effects. It can be used in conjunction with other modalities of cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and surgery. MPTC offers a robust clinical trial program to all its patients to further evidence-based medicine.\n\nMPTC has been patient-centered from the beginning \u2013 with a focus on accessibility and affordability. The center was designed to be a regional resource, providing the same training, privileges and clinical guidelines to physician groups across the region that work side-by-side with MPTC faculty and staff, thus improving efficiency and affordability. MPTC offers free concierge services to ensure a seamless patient experience and a successful reconnection back to their referring physician. One of the goals of MPTC is to remain cost-neutral to insurance providers, meaning patients pay the same for proton treatment as they would for other more conventionally available intensity-modulated treatments at the University of Maryland Medical Center. www.mdproton.com", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "The release employs unjustified language throughout.

Nearly a quarter of a million people worldwide have leprosy, which causes disfiguration of the skin and mucous membranes as well as progressive and incurable nerve damage. While drug therapy exists for leprosy, it must be taken for many months, has many side effects and often is given too late to reverse the permanent damage caused by the bacterial infection. A viable vaccine to prevent and/or treat leprosy is the next step in the effort to bring this disease to an end.\n\nScientists at IDRI, along with national and international collaborators including the National Hansen's Disease Program and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, with financial support from American Leprosy Missions, have developed a promising leprosy vaccine candidate designed to help treat leprosy and prevent exposed individuals from developing disease and the resulting disabilities. Based on data generated in preclinical studies, the vaccine candidate, called LepVax, has progressed to Phase I clinical testing in the United States, the first stage of safety testing in human volunteers. The clinical trial is focused on safety, as well as evaluating the immune response to the vaccine.\n\n\"While previous attempts have used vaccines primarily developed for other diseases, this is the first totally defined vaccine candidate developed specifically for leprosy, using the latest technologies and offering no less than those exposed to leprosy deserve,\" said Steven Reed, Ph.D., IDRI President, CEO & Founder. \"The leprosy vaccine program at IDRI has benefited greatly from what we've learned in the development of tuberculosis vaccine candidates over the past two decades. Although the bacteria that cause tuberculosis and leprosy are related, leprosy vaccine development posed great challenges. This vaccine represents a unique accomplishment, requiring the most advanced technologies in molecular biology and immunology, and American Leprosy Missions has been there from the beginning.\" IDRI scientists have also developed two vaccine candidates for tuberculosis, both in clinical stages of development.\n\n\"We are thrilled that after 15 years and an investment of over $5.1 million, made possible by our faithful donors and partners, a leprosy-specific vaccine is beginning a Phase I clinical trial,\" says Bill Simmons, President and CEO of American Leprosy Missions. \"We believe this may be the most exciting breakthrough in leprosy treatment since multi-drug therapy, the current treatment for leprosy, was launched in the 1980s. We look forward to this vaccine improving the health outcomes of people diagnosed with leprosy. And, it may be that this vaccine can lead to interruption of the transmission of leprosy all together. What a tremendous legacy this would leave for millions of people worldwide.\"\n\nThe vaccine was developed through significant efforts in screening and identifying M. leprae proteins that trigger an effective immune response. IDRI scientists then produced a fusion of four leprosy proteins, which is combined with IDRI's proprietary immune-stimulating adjuvant (GLA-SE). With recent developments in vaccine technology, IDRI scientists can now induce protective responses even after infection, meaning it could be possible to prevent disease development in people already infected with the leprosy bacterium.\n\n\"This generation of a vaccine to prevent and possibly treat leprosy is the result of years of research. The development has been complicated by the fact that the organism that causes leprosy cannot be grown in culture in the laboratory,\" Reed explained. \"This is a unique example of a vaccine produced by totally synthetic methods.\"\n\nReed added that, without the foresight and support of American Leprosy Missions, there would be no leprosy vaccine candidate. \"The vision and support of American Leprosy Missions has been tremendous as we've worked with them throughout the years, moving from our work in developing a leprosy diagnostic to our current focus on a successful leprosy vaccine,\" he said. \"The progress we've had to date would not have been possible without American Leprosy Missions' financial support and guidance.\" Early results from the Phase I study should be available in 2018, and the partners are currently exploring mechanisms to advance the vaccine through later-phase clinical trials should results from the Phase I study (clinical trial NCT03302897) support further evaluation.\n\nThe vaccine candidate will serve as part of an overall strategy to end leprosy, which will require detection, prevention and treatment. IDRI had developed technology to enable a rapid, affordable, point-of-care diagnostic test, which was funded by NIAID (grant numbers 1R43AI066613-01A1 and 2R44AI066613-02.)\n\nIn addition to IDRI and American Leprosy Missions, a variety of partners are taking part in efforts to eliminate leprosy, including Novartis and the Novartis Foundation. Reed, along with scientists from a variety of scientific organizations recently published \"Innovative tools and approaches to end the transmission of Mycobacterium leprae\" in , outlining what is needed to achieve this goal. Together with scientific, government and NGO partners, the Novartis Foundation develops and implements strategies to help interrupt leprosy transmission, while Novartis donates the treatment for leprosy free of charge.\n\nAbout IDRI: As a nonprofit global health organization, IDRI (Infectious Disease Research Institute) takes a comprehensive approach to combat infectious diseases, combining the high-quality science of a research organization with the product development capabilities of a biotech company to create new diagnostics, drugs and vaccines.

The findings are published in the European Journal of Cancer.\n\nTerry Martin of McKinney, Texas, - about an hour outside Dallas - said the fewer number of treatments was a compelling advantage when he was evaluating treatment options.\n\n\"I live 45 minutes away from UT Southwestern. The difference between being treated five times versus 44 times is enormous,\" said Mr. Martin, a retired airline pilot. \"I felt that I was back to normal just 10 days after finishing treatment.\"\n\nIn addition to shorter treatment times, researchers found that side effects were not necessarily different compared to other forms of prostate cancer treatment. In the short term, the side effects of SBRT can include urinary issues (urgency, frequency and burning) and rectal irritation, which are often temporary and reverse within four weeks of treatment. Researchers found a small risk of longer-term urinary and rectal complications, which is also comparable to conventional treatments. Decrease in erectile function was seen in 25 percent of patients, fewer than with conventional radiation or surgery, said Dr. Hannan.\n\nTo reduce the side effects associated with SBRT, current clinical trials at UTSW are using a unique and biodegradable rectal spacer gel to protect the rectum. UTSW is currently the only accredited site in Texas at which this spacer gel can be used.\n\nOther clinical trials at the UTSW Department of Radiation Oncology are seeking to expand the application of SBRT to high-risk (Stage III) prostate cancer patients. \"Our hope is that the high potency of this form of treatment will significantly improve treatment of these patients,\" says Dr. Hannan, the principal investigator of the high-risk prostate SBRT trial.\n\nUT Southwestern has been a leader in pioneering use of SBRT. Dr. Timmerman, Director of Image-Guided Stereotactic Radiation Therapy, Medical Director of Radiation Oncology, and holder of the Effie Marie Cain Distinguished Chair in Cancer Therapy Research, has served as the lead investigator in several national trials designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SBRT to treat other types of cancer, including cancer in the lung, liver, and spine. A range of clinical trials of SBRT therapy are under way at Simmons Cancer Center, including new investigations evaluating use of SBRT for cancers in the breast and larynx.\n\nSince 2009, UT Southwestern has trained more than 300 physicians and peers interested in implementing SBRT in their clinical practice. Simmons Cancer Center's arsenal of stereotactic radiotherapy technology includes the cutting-edge Gamma Knife, CyberKnife, Agility, Vero SBRT and TrueBeam technologies.\n\nThe SBRT study for prostate cancer was supported by a grant from the U.S. Department of Defense. Additional UTSW researchers involved in the study include Dr. Yair Lotan, Professor of Urology and holder of the Helen J. and Robert S. Strauss Professorship in Urology, and Dr. Xian-Jin Xie, Professor of Clinical Science.\n\nThe Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center is the only NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in North Texas and one of just 45 NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers in the nation. The Simmons Cancer Center includes 13 major cancer care programs with a focus on treating the whole patient with innovative treatments, while fostering groundbreaking basic research that has the potential to improve patient care and prevention of cancer worldwide. In addition, the Center's education and training programs support and develop the next generation of cancer researchers and clinicians.\n\nThe Simmons Cancer Center is among only 30 U.S. cancer research centers and the only cancer center in North Texas to be named a National Clinical Trials Network Lead Academic Participating Site, a prestigious designation by the NCI, designed to bolster clinical cancer research for adults and to provide patients access to cancer research trials sponsored by the NCI, where promising new drugs often are tested.\n\nUT Southwestern, one of the premier academic medical centers in the nation, integrates pioneering biomedical research with exceptional clinical care and education.

Maybe we were brainwashed by the industry paying people to tell us that in medical school.\"\n\nNow, other drugs have come into use for hot flashes, but not much is known about their effectiveness or long-term safety. Until recently, there was little interest in studying them rigorously, because hormones worked so well for most women.\n\n\"There's a lot of hype around trying things that we haven't proven effective and, sadly, we haven't proven they're safe,\" said Dr. Heidi D. Nelson, the first author of the journal article and an internist and professor at the Oregon Health and Science University.\n\nThe report is based on a review of 43 studies of various nonhormonal drugs being used for hot flashes. Most were originally approved for other purposes. The drugs include the antidepressants Paxil (paroxetine), Effexor (venlafaxine), Prozac (fluoxetine) and Celexa (citalopram), the blood pressure drug Catapres (clonidine), and the seizure drug Neurontin (gabapentin). Some came into use for menopause because women taking them for other reasons told doctors the drugs seemed to diminish their hot flashes.\n\nThe researchers also examined studies of nonprescription extracts from soy and red clover, which contain plant estrogens called isoflavones and are marketed as a \"natural\" treatment for hot flashes.\n\nNone of the drugs or extracts are approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat hot flashes \u2014 only hormones are approved for that purpose \u2014 but doctors are free to prescribe medicines for any use they see fit, and many recommend the drugs or plant products for hot flashes, based on study findings and their patients' experiences.\n\nThe researchers found that on average, antidepressants and Catapres each appeared to reduce hot flashes by about one per day, and Neurontin by about two per day. For women with a lot of hot flashes, that is not a very impressive performance, Dr. Nelson said, but she added that the drugs may also lessen their severity.\n\nEstrogen, by comparison, gets rid of two to three flashes a day, and also makes them milder, Dr. Nelson said. Though hormones cause small increases in the risks for breast cancer and heart disease, a short course may still be the best choice for women with very severe symptoms, she said, though she added that women who have had breast cancer should definitely not take hormones.\n\nAll the nonhormonal drugs have side effects. The antidepressants can cause headache, nausea, dry mouth, dizziness and insomnia or sleepiness. Catapres can cause some of the same symptoms and also constipation. Neurontin causes sleepiness, and soy extracts can produce gastrointestinal troubles.\n\nAmong the antidepressants, Paxil seemed to have the strongest evidence of benefit. There were only two studies for Effexor, just one of which suggested it might help.\n\nFor the other antidepressants, Prozac and Celexa, and for the plant extracts, there was no statistically significant evidence that they worked for hot flashes.\n\n\"But I wouldn't want any drug company to get an edge,\" Dr. Nelson said. \"It's just where we are today. It's not the end of the story.\"\n\nShe took a cautious view because she and her colleagues found that there was relatively little reliable data on using the drugs for hot flashes. Of 10 studies on antidepressants, for instance, the researchers judged only two of the studies to be good, and the rest fair or poor. The poor rating often meant a study, even though well conducted, was too small or too short to be conclusive.\n\n\"If there were only 20 women in the study, how do we say it's appropriate for all the women in the country?\" Dr. Nelson said.\n\n\"Now we know what we need,\" she said. \"More bigger studies on more things.\"\n\nIn the meantime, both Dr. Tice and Dr. Nelson said that for women who find their symptoms intolerable and want treatment, they would favor antidepressants over hormones. But Dr. Tice warned that the drugs should not be used long term.\n\n\"I wouldn't encourage the mindset of putting women on these drugs thinking they're going to be on them for life,\" he said, adding that patients should try the drugs for a few months and then try to stop.\n\n\"We hate to medicalize a natural process,\" Dr. Nelson said, but she added that severe symptoms should not be dismissed. \"We want to take it seriously, but not everybody needs to be on prescription drugs for it.\"", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "Not enough information to determine if this relies on a JAMA press release.

McEvoy, MD, MCR, and her co-authors report that at three months of age, the infants whose mothers took 500 mg of vitamin C in addition to their prenatal vitamin had significantly better forced expiratory flows (FEFs). FEFs measure how fast air can be exhaled from the lung and are an important measure of lung function because they can detect airway obstruction.\n\nThe researchers also discovered an association between the infant FEFs and a genetic variant some of the mothers possessed that appeared to amplify the negative impact of nicotine on the babies before they were born. Other studies have linked this genetic factor, specifically for the \u03b15 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, to increased risk of lung cancer and obstructive lung disease.\n\n\u201cSmoking during pregnancy reflects the highly addictive nature of nicotine that disproportionately affects the most vulnerable populations,\u201d said Dr. McEvoy, lead study author and professor of pediatrics at Oregon Health & Science University. \u201cFinding a way to help infants exposed to smoking and nicotine in utero recognizes the unique dangers posed by a highly advertised, addictive product and the lifetime effects on offspring who did not choose to be exposed.\u201d\n\nIn a previous study, the authors had shown that 72 hours after birth, babies of mothers who smoked had better lung function if their mothers were randomized to vitamin C (500 mg/day) during their pregnancies compared to those born to mothers who smoked and were randomized to placebo. That study used passive methods to measure lung function, and the authors note that FEFs provide a more direct assessment of airway function and are similar to methods used to diagnose lung disease in adults and older children.\n\nIn the current study, 251 pregnant women who smoked were randomly assigned at 13 to 23 weeks of gestation to either receive vitamin C (125 women) or a placebo (126 women). Smoking was defined as having had one or more cigarettes in the last week. All participants received smoking cessation counseling throughout the study, and about 10 percent of the women quit smoking during the study.\n\nThe researchers wrote that study results support the hypothesis that oxidative stress caused by cigarette smoking reduces the amount of ascorbic acid, a component of vitamin C, available to the body. At the time they enrolled in the study, the women had lower levels of ascorbic acid than have been reported among women who do not smoke. Those levels rose in study participants who received vitamin C to become comparable to women who do not smoke.\n\nInfants in this study will continue to be followed to track their lung function and respiratory outcomes. The authors believe that future trials of vitamin C supplementation in pregnant smokers should determine whether the benefits are greater if the supplementation starts earlier and continues postnatally in the babies themselves.\n\nSumming up the findings of the current study, Dr. McEvoy said that a relatively low dosage of vitamin C may present \u201ca safe and inexpensive intervention that has the potential to help lung health of millions of infants worldwide.\u201d\n\nHowever, she added, helping mothers quit smoking should remain the primary goal for health professionals and public health officials. \u201cAlthough vitamin C supplementation may protect to some extent the lungs of babies born to mothers who smoke during pregnancy, those children will still be at greater risk for obesity, behavioral disorders and other serious health issues,\u201d she said.\n\nThis study was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the Office of Dietary Supplements.\n\n\u201cFor mothers who smoke during pregnancy, vitamin C may reduce harm #smoking causes to their babies\u2019 #lungs, finds new study of #vitaminC supplementation. #Nosmokingduringpregnancy.\u201d\n\nAbout the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine\n\nThe AJRCCM is a peer-reviewed journal published by the American Thoracic Society.

Three of them found that zinc acetate in daily doses of more than 75 milligrams (mg) shortened colds' duration by 42 percent, on average.\n\nFive trials using zinc salts other than acetate in daily doses greater than 75 mg shortened colds by an average of 20 percent, while another five using less than 75 mg per day produced no effect.\n\n\"Much of the variation in the published study findings can be explained by the daily dose of zinc administered in the zinc lozenges,\" said Hemila, who funded the research himself. \"When focusing on those studies which have used large daily doses of zinc, there is strong evidence that zinc lozenges shorten the duration of colds.\"\n\nThe study is published in The Open Respiratory Medicine Journal.\n\nDespite the popularity of zinc supplements, controversy over their effectiveness has continued since a much-publicized 1984 study first suggested a cold-limiting effect. Allowing the lozenge to dissolve instead of swallowing it seemed to provide a therapeutic effect. Since then, more than a dozen studies have been carried out, but data on the trace mineral's effectiveness has been mixed.\n\nAll of the trials examined by Hemila compared zinc lozenges to placebos. While surprised to note how strong the correlation was between daily doses of zinc and its effect on colds' duration, he said he and his colleagues still don't know why it seems to work.\n\n\"In the evidence-based medicine framework, we are primarily interested in the question whether there is an effect, and how great, whereas the mechanism of the effect is a secondary issue,\" he said.\n\nNo prior studies showed zinc lozenge use -- even up to 150 mg per day -- might cause harm aside from bad taste or constipation, Hemila said, and the most recent trial on zinc acetate indicated no significant differences between zinc and placebo groups in adverse effects even though the daily zinc dose was 92 mg.\n\nDr. Lisa Winston, an epidemiologist at San Francisco General Hospital, praised the study as a \"pretty good synthesis of the data,\" although she noted that the trials Hemila reviewed involved small numbers of participants.\n\n\"It's an area of controversy and question . . . but I don't think the evidence is strong enough, nor do I think the author is suggesting, that we can base clinical practice on it,\" said Winston, also an associate professor in the University of California-San Francisco Department of Medicine. \"I would tell my patients we still don't have a cure [for the common cold], and we don't know if zinc works.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Library of Medicine has more about the common cold.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not rely solely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The cancer drug that former president Jimmy Carter says made his melanoma seemingly disappear has helped about 40 percent of similar patients survive for as long as three years, oncologists said Wednesday.\n\nThe drug, called Keytruda, takes a new approach to treating cancer by stopping tumor cells from cloaking themselves against the normal, healthy immune system response.\n\nNew data about to be released to a meeting of cancer specialists shows that 40 percent of the patients who have been taking the drug are still alive three years later. That compares to about 5 percent of patients given the standard therapy, interleukin, the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) says.\n\nThat means 60 percent of patients are not living that long \u2014 but it\u2019s still far more than the usual 11-month survival with advanced melanoma.\n\n\u201cIt is definitely a huge benefit over what we have seen in the past,\u201d said ASCO president Dr. Julie Vose, a specialist in blood cancers at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.\n\nMelanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. It will be diagnosed in more than 76,000 Americans this year, according to the American Cancer Society, and it will kill 10,000.\n\nRates are rising, in part because tanning became fashionable. Melanoma is easy to cure when caught early, but it is often hard to tell if a mole or freckle has turned cancerous. Carter, for example, was only diagnosed once the tumors had spread to his brain, last fall.\n\nThat\u2019s Stage IV cancer and it\u2019s almost always deadly at that stage. But Carter has remained well enough to continue teaching his weekly Sunday school classes and said this past Sunday he\u2019d just traveled to London.\n\nHe says there\u2019s no trace of his cancer now.\n\n\u201cIn the past, patients with this type of melanoma \u2014 he has metastases to the brain \u2014 you don\u2019t even see responses to therapy,\u201d Vose told NBC News. \u201cThis is something really different than what we have seen in the past.\u201d\n\nOther people are having similar experiences.\n\nFor the trial, Caroline Robert of Gustave Roussy and Paris-Sud University in France and colleagues treated 655 patients with advanced melanoma.\n\n\"These are patients whose disease cannot be surgically removed, cannot be cured by surgery and usually the majority of these patients have disease that involved vital organs,\" said Dr. Stephen Hodi, a melanoma specialist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute who worked on the study.\n\nSeventy-five percent of them had already been given other cancer treatments, including Yervoy, known generically as ipilimumab.\n\nOn average, the patients lived two years and 40 percent of them are still alive three years later. About 15 percent of these patients have what\u2019s called a complete remission, meaning there is no trace of their tumors. That doesn\u2019t mean a cure \u2014 it\u2019s too soon to say that \u2014 but it does mean months or years of cancer-free life that they otherwise could not have hoped for.\n\nAnd 61 of the patients, or 9 percent, have stopped taking the drug after their tumors went away. Virtually all of them are still in remission.\n\n\u201cThis is huge in the melanoma community,\u201d said Tim Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation.\n\n\u201cIt's difficult to know at what point you call it a cure. For the patient, though, it means they are cancer-free and for some of those patients, it is likely that their cancer never will come back,\u201d Turnham told NBC News.\n\n\u201cWhen this study was started the average life expectancy of someone with advanced melanoma was 11 months and now we're seeing that a large percentage of people are living at least three years.\u201d\n\nKeytruda \u2014 known generically as pembrolizumab \u2014 targets the activity of genes called PD-1 (anti-programmed-death-receptor-1) and PD-L1. The interaction between the two genes lets some tumors escape detection and destruction by immune system cells.\n\nPD-1 stops immune cells from attacking normal healthy cells by mistake. Tumor cells make PD-L1 turn on PD-1 when immune cells approach. Keytruda, an engineered immune protein called a monoclonal antibody, disrupts this signal and lets the immune cells attack the tumor cell.\n\nThe drug works far better in patients whose tumors express more PD-1, meaning they have a lot of PD-1 activity, so the drug will optimally be used jointly with a test for PD-1. There are side-effects, including fatigue, itchiness and rash. It was bad enough for 8 percent of patients that they stopped taking it.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration gave Keytruda accelerated approval for melanoma in 2014. It's got breakthrough therapy designation for Hodgkin's lymphoma and colon cancer and got accelerated approval for lung cancer.\n\n\u201cIn a matter of a few years, these therapies have truly transformed the outlook for patients with melanoma and many other hard-to-treat cancers,\u201d said Dr. Don Dizon, an oncologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and a spokesman for ASCO.\n\nKeytruda's being tested in other cancer types now.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the FDA gave accelerated approval to a drug that works in a similar way.\n\nIt approved Tecentriq, known generically as atezolizumab, for use in patients with advanced bladder cancer.\n\nLike Keytruda, Tecentriq is a monoclonal antibody. It goes straight to PD-L1, so its target is slightly different.\n\nFDA\u2019s approval was made on the basis of a trial that showed 12 percent of patients with advanced bladder cancer who had high levels of PD-L1 activity saw their tumors disappear, compared to 5.5 percent of patients on other treatments. Another 14 percent had a partial response, meaning their tumors shrank a little, compared to 9.4 percent on standard treatment.\n\nThe drugs must be infused and they are pricey.

The study was published in SLEEP, the official journal of the Sleep Research Society.\n\nChronic insomnia is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders as sleeping poorly at least three nights a week for a month or longer, despite adequate opportunity for a full night's sleep. It is \"a significant problem in the military,\" said Taylor, who noted that military personnel often develop insomnia because of rapidly changing schedules and deployments that keep them constantly on alert.\n\nChronic insomnia is a strong risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and substance abuse, absenteeism and occupational accidents, Taylor said. Treatment of insomnia may not only improve sleep in these soldiers, but also improve these other conditions, he said.\n\n\"About 10 percent of deployed military personnel take sleep medications, which are effective for short-term treatment of insomnia in civilian populations. For deployed military personnel, the side effects such as grogginess, slowed cognitive processing and slowed reaction time can be dangerous,\" Taylor said.\n\nOne hundred soldiers at Fort Hood who had chronic insomnia were recruited for Taylor's study. All completed one week of sleep monitoring by keeping sleep diaries and wearing activity monitors.\n\nOne third of the participants met with clinicians at Fort Hood for cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia once a week for six weeks, while another third received the therapy via the Internet once a week for six weeks. Both the in-person and Internet therapy had the exact same content, with the Internet lessons presented as audio recordings accompanied by visual graphics and animations. A third control group of participants was contacted by the researchers every other week during the six weeks, but did not receive cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\nTaylor discovered that the study participants who received in-person cognitive behavioral treatment for their insomnia reported significantly greater improvements in sleep quality -- as determined by the sleep diaries and activity monitors -- than those who received the Internet therapy. Both groups had greater improvements in sleep quality than those who did not receive cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\nHe noted that that cognitive behavioral therapy is \"a multifaceted intervention that can be difficult to administer without the benefit of a therapist.\" Additional training in the therapy for behavioral health providers in all branches of the military is needed, he said.\n\nIn a previous study of civilians with insomnia, Taylor and his research team discovered that cognitive behavioral therapy led to significant improvements in sleep efficiency, with the research subjects' use of sleep medication declining from 87.5 percent before therapy to 54 percent afterward, although the subjects weren't required to stop taking their medication.\n\nKristi Pruiksma, a STRONG STAR collaborating investigator and clinical psychologist, served as a clinician on Taylor's study. She said the benefits of the online therapy include easy access to the treatment and flexibility in times for completing the sessions, which \"is really helpful for those juggling work and family demands.\"\n\n\"The online program can also be done from home rather than at a military behavioral health clinic, which some service members may avoid due to concerns about stigma,\" said Pruiksma, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio).\n\n\"Successful treatment has a real impact on patients' daily lives.

In 2013, it was 12.6.\n\nAn effort that began in Detroit in 2001 to treat the most common cause of suicide \u2014 depression \u2014 is offering hope. With a relentless focus on finding and treating people with depression, the Henry Ford Health System has cut the suicide rate among the people in its insurance plan dramatically. The story of the health system's success is a story of persistence, confidence, hope and a strict adherence to a very specific approach.\n\nThat approach saved the life of a woman who prefers to be known only by her first name, Lynn. She agreed to share her medical history on the condition that we not use her full name to protect her privacy.\n\nLynn, who's now in her mid-50s, has had bipolar disorder, also known as manic-depressive illness, for nearly 30 years. The depressive part of her illness \"is like the pain of having a cancer,\" she says. About 15 years ago, she started getting irresistible urges to take her own life and she started making serious attempts \u2014 at times almost monthly.\n\n\"When I was in the depths of depression, I was being pulled and sucked into this black tunnel,\" she says. \"I was desperately trying to grab onto something to stop from being sucked in.\" Sometimes she couldn't find anything to hang on to. \"Those are the times when I finally let go and attempted suicide,\" she says.\n\nThe program that saved Lynn almost didn't get off the ground.\n\nFifteen years ago, suicide prevention care at Henry Ford, like in many places, was mostly reactive. When patients came in talking about suicide, health providers took notice. But little was done to find people before they reached that point.\n\nSome of the health providers in the psychiatric division decided they could do better. So they applied to a foundation for a grant to provide something they called \"perfect depression care\" for the 200,000 patients in the health system. The goal: zero suicides.\n\nThe mental health division failed to win the grant, but the health system went ahead with the proposed changes anyway.\n\nThe plan it developed is intensive and thorough, an almost cookbook approach. Primary care doctors screen every patient with two questions: How often have you felt down in the past two weeks? And how often have you felt little pleasure in doing things? A high score leads to more questions about sleep disturbances, changes in appetite, thoughts of hurting oneself. All patients are questioned on every visit.\n\nIf the health providers recognize a mental health problem, patients are assigned to appropriate care \u2014 cognitive behavioral therapy, drugs, group counseling, or hospitalization if necessary. On each patient's medical record, providers have to attest to having done the screening, and they record plans for any needed care.\n\nTherapists involve patients' families, and ask them to remove guns or other means of suicide from their homes. Clerks are trained to make sure that patients who need followup care don't leave without an appointment. Patients themselves come up with \"safety plans.\"\n\nLynn has two copies, one by her nightstand and one in her kitchen. Each lists things she can do when she feels depression coming on. She could sit on her balcony, or do some drawing or painting. The list includes her therapists' phone numbers. And there's a reminder that the feeling will pass \u2014 it has before.\n\nBefore the zero suicide plan went into effect, says psychiatrist Doree Ann Espiritu, acting head of the zero suicide program at Henry Ford, you might make a contract with a patient where the patient agrees not to commit suicide. Studies show it doesn't work very well, she says.\n\nToday, providers are trained to be comfortable asking their patients about suicidal thoughts. \"There is a fear among clinicians that if you ask questions about suicide, you are giving the patient an idea that this could be an option,\" says Espiritu, \"and if you ask about guns or pills, that you are giving them some hints on how they can carry out a plan.\" The Henry Ford therapists are trained to break that barrier.\n\nFor Lynn, the key was persistence \u2014 her therapists', and her own. \"I recall one time with my psychiatrist, who kept trying to encourage me and help me find ways of coping, and I can remember saying, 'I don't believe there's hope, I don't see it, I don't feel it, I need you to hold on to that for me because it's not there,' \" she recalls.\n\nHer therapists never gave up. \"There is no question that the message I got from Day 1 is that they knew they could help me, and they would help me,\" Lynn says. Over the years she's been in group therapy, day treatment, and, when things got bad, the emergency room.\n\nThe Henry Ford approach is catching on. A stream of visitors from U.S. health insurers and from the United Kingdom have made site visits. The Suicide Prevention Resource Center has run two zero suicide training academies for teams from health care systems based on the Henry Ford principles. Other health systems have adapted the plan, including Group Health Cooperative in Seattle and the behavioral health provider Centerstone in Tennessee.\n\nEspiritu started work at Henry Ford just as the program was starting, and she remembers the initial staff meetings: \"There was a lot of, 'How can you do this? How can you aim for zero? How can you expect your clinicians to be perfect and follow this protocol?' \" Some people didn't think it could be done, she says, or even attempted.\n\nStill, the health system went ahead, and the rewards were nearly immediate. Henry Ford epidemiologist Brian Ahmedani studies the numbers. In 2009, for those being actively treated for a mental health problem or substance abuse, \"we had a rate of zero per hundred thousand,\" he says. It's crept up to 20 per 100,000 per year, but that's still 80 percent lower than it was when the program began. The rate is five per 100,000 in the organization's general population, which is well below the national average and has remained steady despite an increasing rate of suicide statewide.\n\nThere's reason to think a full-bore effort to treat depression could reduce health costs, because untreated depression is associated with higher medical bills for chronic illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension. But there are training costs involved, and the Henry Ford system has had to keep its staffing up to be able to provide care for people who need it.\n\nOfficials at Henry Ford say they haven't analyzed the costs. But Centerstone has. The behavioral health provider in Nashville implemented the Henry Ford approach for nearly 200 patients who'd already made a suicide attempt. Reductions in emergency room visits and hospitalizations over the course of a year resulted in savings of more than $400,000.\n\nWhy push for zero, rather than just a reduction? \"Because if you say we're OK with five a year, one of those might be your brother or your friend,\" says Espiritu. \"We aim for zero because it reminds all of us of what we would want for ourselves.\" Maybe it is not possible, she says. But it is a goal.\n\nAnd as for Lynn, she doesn't consider herself cured. She says with the treatment she's received at Henry Ford, she's learned to live, even thrive, with bipolar disease. And she's alive. That, she says, makes her a big success story.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not appear to be based on a news release.

Then President Richard Nixon declared drugs \u201cpublic enemy No. 1\u201d and the so-called \u201cwar on drugs\u201d began. All this combined to give psychedelics a bad name at the time and led to most of them being outlawed. For nearly a generation, science on these substances shut down.\n\nBut that\u2019s changing. In the past 20 years or so, a small amount of research has once again begun to focus on these chemicals, showing that they have promise for treating a range of conditions, from addiction to depression and anxiety, says Evan Wood, a psychiatric researcher at the University of British Columbia.\n\nIn 2006, researchers at the University of Arizona published a study showing obsessive-compulsive patients who ingested psilocybin had immediate and lasting reductions in problematic symptoms. The same year, Johns Hopkins University physician and researcher Roland Griffiths showed that in healthy volunteers, psilocybin produced lasting benefits like improved mood and peacefulness six months after ingestion. Study participants \u201cmade claims to be more sensitive, compassionate, tolerant, to have increased positive relationships, an increased need to serve others,\u201d according to Griffiths. \u201cThose kinds of changes are not delusional, because blinded interviews with family members, friends and work colleagues [confirm these reports].\u201d\n\nSimilar work has shown psilocybin can help treat anxiety associated with cancer, at UCLA and New York University. Grob says work by his group and others has shown that psilocybin can help treat \u201cterminal cancer patients with overwhelming existential anxiety, an area that traditional medicine struggles with.\u201d And a study in late 2014 found that LSD permanently reduced anxiety in a small number of patients.\n\nWood says he\u2019s most excited about research into using psychedelics to treat addiction, and he published a review on September 8 in the Canadian Medical Association Journal covering recent work in this field. One study from earlier this year in the Journal of Psychopharmacology found, for example, that 10 alcoholic patients given psilocybin in a controlled setting had greatly reduced cravings for and intake of alcohol in the months after the treatment. Another study, authored in 2014 by Griffiths and Matthew Johnson at Johns Hopkins and published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, found the substance helped people give up cigarettes. Twelve out of 15 patients in this small study had given up smoking six months after a psilocybin-assisted therapy session.\n\nAyahuasca, an Amazonian brew containing dimethyltryptamine that causes hallucinations and often intense spiritual experiences, has also shown promise in treating addictions, besides anxiety and depression, Wood says. Another chemical, called MDMA, the active ingredient in the drug Ecstasy, can help treat post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nPsychedelics generally are thought to work by allowing individuals to have a spiritual or \u201cmystical\u201d experience, during which time people can have profound realizations that permanently change their behaviors, Wood says. The idea that you can take a medicine one or a few times and become \u201ccured,\u201d or at least significantly helped, conflicts with current standard practices, which often involve taking medications every day for years, or life.\n\n\u201cWith even minor mental health conditions like minor depression or anxiety...or more serious problems like addiction, the existing paradigm is to frame these as chronic, lifelong diseases\u201d that require continuous medication with drugs like serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors, Wood says. But not so with psychedelics, which represent \u201ca total paradigm shift in the way that mental illness is treated,\u201d he adds.\n\nHe points out that psychedelics should never be used carelessly, and that the \u201cset and setting\u201d (meaning the dose, mood, environment, company and surroundings) where a person takes them are of paramount importance. That said, when studied under controlled and supervised conditions, these chemicals have not been found to cause lasting negative health consequences, the Canadian Medical Association Journal review noted. All of which adds up to a compelling argument that psychedelics \u201cshould be the focus of intensive study for treating mental illness,\u201d Wood says.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "This shows no hallmarks of having been generated by, or dependent upon, a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "In more than 22% of cases, implantable defibrillators are given to heart patients who don\u2019t meet the guidelines for receiving the pricey devices, according to a study just published in JAMA.\n\nThe research, based on 111,707 cases submitted to a national registry over a three-and-a-half-year period, also finds that those patients who didn\u2019t meet the guidelines had a higher risk of dying in the hospital and of complications from the implantation.\n\nICDs, which can cost north of $30,000, monitor the rhythm of the \u2026", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Oct. 17, 2010 -- Women aged 65 and older are advised to undergo bone mineral density (BMD) screening every two years, but those with normal results at age 67 may be able to wait 10 years before their next screening test, a new study suggests.\n\nResearchers say the 10-year interval is OK because the women\u2019s risk of developing the brittle bone disease osteoporosis in that time is low.\n\nThe new findings are slated to be presented at the annual meeting of the American Society for Bone Mineral Research in Toronto.\n\n\"If a woman's bone density at age 67 is very good, then she doesn't need to be re-screened in two years or three years, because we're not likely to see much change,\" says study author Margaret L.

This success in large animals holds considerable potential for a safe, effective and long-lasting new treatment in humans with the same bleeding disorder.\n\n\"Our finding has great clinical relevance for patients with factor VII deficiency,\" said study leader Paris Margaritis, D. Phil., a hematology researcher at the Raymond G. Perelman Center for Cellular and Molecular Therapeutics (CCMT) at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). \"These dogs have the type of mutation found in the majority of patients with this disorder, so this approach could lead to a sustained gene therapy in people.\"\n\nThe Margaritis team collaborated with University of North Carolina (UNC) scientists, led by Tim Nichols, M.D., professor of Medicine and Pathology at the UNC School of Medicine.\n\nFactor VII deficiency is rare, found in about one in 300,000 to one in 500,000 people. Because a gene mutation impairs normal production of a blood clotting factor, patients may suffer excessive bleeding in the central nervous system or GI tract, or after surgery or an injury. Female patients may suffer excessive menstrual bleeding.\n\nFactor VII (FVII) deficiency has a range of severity, with about 40 percent of patients having severe disease. They are most commonly treated with regular infusions of clotting factor. Unlike hemophilia, a better-known bleeding disorder that predominantly affects males, factor VII deficiency strikes males and females equally.\n\nGene therapy proposed for bleeding disorders involves introducing DNA carrying the code to produce the specific clotting factor lacking in patients. Researchers at CHOP and elsewhere have bioengineered an adeno-associated virus (AAV), which does not cause disease, as a vector to deliver DNA into cells where it can express enough factor to make the blood clot normally. Over the past 15 years, CHOP hematology researchers have performed clinical trials of gene therapy for hemophilia B that have helped define efficacy and dosing levels in humans.\n\nThe CCMT at CHOP houses a clinical-grade laboratory that manufactures gene therapy vectors, including the AAV vectors used in the current study. Margaritis, a member of the CHOP group long engaged in hemophilia research, currently leads a laboratory focused on factor VII deficiency as well as hemophilia.\n\n\"We developed a unique animal model of this disease after identifying dogs with naturally occurring factor VII deficiency,\" said Margaritis. \"Our investigations enabled us to design the corrective gene to insert into our virus vector in the current study.\"\n\nThe CHOP team collaborated with scientists at UNC who have a long-established colony of dogs for hematology research. Based on previous work by Margaritis, the UNC team identified dogs for this gene therapy study.\n\nNichols, the director of UNC's Francis Owens Blood Research Laboratory, characterized factor VII deficiency in four individual dogs. Using the AAV vectors supplied by Margaritis, Nichols injected the dogs with varying dosages and monitored their health outcomes and biological markers over several years.\n\nThe treated dogs had expressed levels of clotting factor VII that would be therapeutic in humans, with long-term stability. In one dog, the effects persisted nearly three years. Based on kidney function, liver function, and blood measurements in the dogs, the treatment was safe, and did not elicit unwanted immune responses.\n\nThe current study sets the stage for clinical trials in humans. This gene therapy may especially benefit young children with severe bleeding from factor VII deficiency, such as patients receiving care in CHOP's hematology program.\n\n\"This work is very exciting and promising,\" said Nichols, who added, \"The FVII-deficient dogs tolerated the initial gene therapy infusions very well and have had no adverse side effects over several years of follow up. In other related studies in dogs with hemophilia B, similar positive findings have translated to people with hemophilia B.\" Both Nichols and Margaritis agreed: \"The table is now set to propose clinical trials that would treat people who suffer from FVII deficiency.\"\n\nThe National Institutes of Health (grants HL064190 and HL63098), the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the Pennsylvania Department of Health supported this study.

One found a link between the supplements and a build-up of calcium in arteries, a possible precursor to heart attacks and strokes.\n\nA second, wider-ranging study found no heart risks and was the basis of new guidelines from two medical groups saying that calcium supplements should be considered heart safe.\n\n\u201cThe public has been receiving very confusing and alarming messages about calcium supplements,\u201d says JoAnn Manson, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Boston.\n\nAbout 35% of U.S. adults take calcium supplements, alone or in multivitamins, according to a recent report in the medical journal JAMA.\n\nSo here\u2019s what all those people need to know.\n\nConcerns about heart risks may be fading.\n\nOver the past decade, some studies have raised the possibility that calcium, from supplements but not from food, might raise heart risks.\n\nMost recently, researchers at Johns Hopkins University tracked nearly 3,000 adults and found that those who took calcium supplements at the study outset were 22% more likely to show artery calcification 10 years later. Those who got the most calcium from food had a decreased risk. But the study, published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, was not designed in a way that could prove the supplements caused the artery changes.\n\nAnd its findings were quickly refuted by a larger review of 31 previous studies, including some with more rigorous designs. Taken together, those findings suggest healthy adults face no increased heart risks from calcium, in food or supplements, in amounts of up to 2,000-2,500 mg a day, researchers reported in the Annals of Internal Medicine. The review was funded by the non-profit National Osteoporosis Foundation, with support from Pfizer Consumer Healthcare, which makes calcium supplements.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the overall totality of the evidence, there\u2019s a lack of association between supplement use and heart attack and other cardiovascular events,\u201d says Manson, who co-wrote an editorial accompanying the review.\n\nThe review \u201cis really reassuring,\u201d says Clifford Rosen, senior scientist at the Maine Medical Center Research Institute at the University of Maine. He was not involved in the research.\n\nAlso reassured: The osteoporosis foundation and the American Society for Preventive Cardiology, which issued new guidelines saying supplements appear heart safe.\n\nNot everyone is convinced.\n\nThe larger review did not include all potentially relevant studies, says Erin Michos, an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology who led the Johns Hopkins study. \u201cI\u2019m still concerned about harm from supplements and I don\u2019t advise them for my patients,\u201d she says.\n\nThere are other reasons not to take calcium supplements.\n\nThe first is that most people don\u2019t need them, Rosen says. Calcium intake from food has been rising, he says, with recent surveys finding averages around 1,000 mg a day \u2014 close to or meeting the 1,000 mg. to 1,200 mg recommended for adults (the higher level is advised for women over 50 and men over 70). Many people get more than they realize, he says, not just from milk, cheese and yogurt, but from vegetables, grains, and, increasingly, fortified foods and beverages.\n\nWhen there is a gap, food is a better choice than supplements, the experts agree. Calcium-rich foods, such as milk (300 mg a cup), plain yogurt (400 mg per cup) and kale (100 mg a cup), come with added nutritional benefits. And supplements come with extra risks: increases in kidney stones and, for some people, constipation and bloating.\n\nSome people do need supplements.\n\nOlder adults with osteoporosis \u2014 bone thinning severe enough to raise the risk of debilitating fractures \u2014 can benefit from calcium supplements, Rosen says, though most need just one 500 mg to 600 mg dose a day. Larger doses are poorly absorbed and rarely needed, he says.\n\nAmong others who might need a boost: Vegans, people with lactose intolerance and anyone who, for whatever reason, does not consume enough calcium, says Taylor Wallace, an affiliate professor of nutrition at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., and a co-author of the new cardiovascular statement.\n\nTeen girls, who are in crucial bone-building years, often have diets that fall short of their needs, 1,300 mg a day, Wallace says.\n\nYour bones need more than calcium alone.\n\nVitamin D \u2014 found in fatty fish, fortified foods and supplements, and produced by the skin in response to sun exposure \u2014 also is essential to bone health. Many supplements combine vitamin D and calcium, but experts disagree on who should take those supplements and in what doses. Under current U.S. nutrition guidelines, teens and adults are advised to get 600 to 800 international units of vitamin D each day.\n\nAlso important for bone health: weight-bearing exercise, such as walking, dancing and workouts with weights.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not appear to rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Why Doctors Are Trying A Skin Cancer Drug To Treat A Brain Tumor\n\nMaryAnn Anselmo feared for the worst when she was diagnosed with a brain tumor called a glioblastoma in late 2013.\n\n\"You start doing research on that type of tumor, and you're saying, 'Oh my God, you're history.' It's like a death sentence,\" says, Anselmo, now 59.\n\nOnly for her it wasn't.\n\nAnselmo's successful treatment shows how precision medicine \u2014 tailoring therapy to each patient's genetic needs \u2014 is beginning to transform cancer care.\n\nAt first, the outlook seemed grim. Although Anselmo's surgeon was able to surgically remove most of her tumor, she couldn't tolerate traditional chemotherapy that was the planned second step, and had to discontinue it.\n\nThe chemo failure was the latest in a string of personal setbacks.\n\nThe year before she was diagnosed with brain cancer, she'd lost her son to suicide. Weeks after that she was almost killed in a car crash outside a local mall. Her cancer was discovered after she had a dizzy spell, and her husband, Joseph, insisted she return to the hospital to have it checked out.\n\nAfter all that, Anselmo and her husband weren't ready to give up on her cancer fight. He'd read about advances in targeted therapies \u2014 drugs that go after cancer cells at the molecular level.\n\nThe family sent samples of her tumor samples for genetic testing to several leading cancer hospitals. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where she was being treated, also did its own sequencing. They all found the same thing. Anselmo's tumor had a BRAF mutation common in skin cancer, but very unusual for a brain tumor.\n\nHer oncologist, David Hyman at Memorial Sloan Kettering, enrolled Anselmo into a new kind of drug trial. Called a basket trial, the study is designed to include people whose tumors have the same kind of genetic fingerprint regardless of where in the body the tumors are found.\n\nKnowing more about the genetic mutations of a tumor enables doctors to find a potentially effective drug much more quickly and accurately. \"It's like you're in a parking lot,\" Hyman says. \"And you have a key to one of the cars in the parking lot. And so one option is just to go to each car and try to open the lock. The other is to know that it's the third car on the right. What we're doing now is we're saying, OK, this key fits that lock. And we're only going straight to that car.\"\n\nToday, Anselmo is doing well. She's been in the clinical trial for a year now, and continues to take Zelboraf (or vemurafenib generically) daily. The pills have kept her cancer from growing.\n\nThere are side effects, of course. She's lost some peripheral vision, though she's been able to compensate. And Zelboraf is expensive, though it's free to Anselmo because she's taking it as part of a study.\n\nNow she can focus again on the things she loves, like singing. Anselmo, a jazz singer who performed under the stage name Mariel Larsen before her illness, is planning a comeback. She's back in training with her longtime vocal coach.\n\nAs this kind of genetic sequencing of tumors has become faster and cheaper, more patients have access to this technology. More doctors are taking advantage of the information to treat patients with a targeted approach.\n\n\"We took a disease where nothing really works for any length of time and we've given her a year of life, and hopefully much more, where she's been much better,\" Hyman, her oncologist, says.\n\nStill, he cautions that the targeted treatments can't be considered cures. At some point the drug that is keeping Anselmo's cancer at bay could stop working. \"Every patient is different in how long it works,\" he says. \"We all have patients that have been on these drugs for years. But I don't know, I mean, I think if I was being honest eventually our expectation would be that it would stop working.\"\n\nThere's no way to predict when. But in the meantime, patients like Anselmo are grateful to have time they wouldn't have had otherwise.\n\nAfter all the misfortunes she's been through, it would be easy to think Anselmo has been incredibly unlucky. But she doesn't see it that way. No, she says after rehearsing for her comeback show, \"I'm the luckiest.\"\n\nOur series is produced with member station WNYC, and with Ken Burns Presents: Cancer: The Emperor of All Maladies, which will air on PBS starting March 30.

Recent findings point to the benefits of breastfeeding on heart disease and other specific cardiovascular risk factors,\" said Lisette T. Jacobson, Ph.D., M.P.A., M.A., lead author of the study and assistant professor in the department of preventive medicine and public health at the University of Kansas School of Medicine-Wichita.\n\nThis is among the first studies to examine breastfeeding and a possible relationship to stroke risk for mothers, as well as how such a relationship might vary by ethnicity.\n\nResearchers analyzed data on 80,191 participants in the Women's Health Initiative observational study, a large ongoing national study that has tracked the medical events and health habits of postmenopausal women who were recruited between 1993 and 1998. All women in this analysis had delivered one or more children and 58 percent reported ever having breastfed. Among these women, 51 percent breastfed for one-six months, 22 percent for seven-12 months and 27 percent for 13 or more months. At the time of recruitment, the average age was 63.7 years and the follow-up period was 12.6 years.\n\nAfter adjusting for non-modifiable stroke risk factors (such as age and family history), researchers found stroke risk among women who breastfed their babies was on average:\n\u2022 19 percent lower in women who had breastfed for up to six months. A longer reported length of breastfeeding was associated with a greater reduction in risk.\n\n\"If you are pregnant, please consider breastfeeding as part of your birthing plan and continue to breastfeed for at least six months to receive the optimal benefits for you and your infant,\" Jacobson said.\n\n\"Our study did not address whether racial/ethnic differences in breastfeeding contribute to disparities in stroke risk. Additional research should consider the degree to which breastfeeding might alter racial/ethnic differences in stroke risk,\" Jacobson said.\n\nBecause the study was observational, it couldn't establish a cause-and-effect relationship between breastfeeding and lower stroke risk, meaning that it is possible some other characteristic that distinguishes between women who breastfeed and those who don't is the factor changing the stroke risk. However, because the Women's Health Initiative is large, researchers were able to adjust for many characteristics, and the effects of breastfeeding remained strong, Jacobson said.\n\n\"Breastfeeding is only one of many factors that could potentially protect against stroke. Others include getting adequate exercise, choosing healthy foods, not smoking and seeking treatment if needed to keep your blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar in the normal range,\" Jacobson said.\n\nThe study was also limited by the relatively small number of strokes that occurred during the follow-up period (just 3.4 percent of the women experienced a stroke during the study period and 1.6 percent reported having had a stroke prior to the study) and by the Women's Health Initiative's exclusion of women who had already had severe strokes at the time of recruitment.\n\nCurrently, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend exclusive breastfeeding for six months, with continuation of breast feeding for one year or longer. For babies health, the American Heart Association recommends breastfeeding for 12 months with transition to other additional sources of nutrients beginning at about four - six months of age to ensure sufficient micronutrients in the diet.\n\nFrontiers: The Heartland Institute for Clinical and Translational Research and the Wichita Center for Graduate Medical Education-Kansas Bioscience Authority funded the study.

The comprehensive meta-analysis and assessment of human clinical trials, published in the official journal of the American Urological Association, The Journal of Urology\u00ae, assures practitioners and their patients that cranberry products are a low cost, low risk and effective way to help prevent recurrent UTIs.1\n\nTo answer the question, \"Can Cranberries Contribute to Reduce the Incidence of Urinary Tract Infections?\" a total of 28 studies showing results from nearly 5,000 patients were considered. Authors found a statistically significant risk reduction in repeat UTIs overall, but not significant for any particular subgroup. However, patients with recurrent UTIs who ingested cranberry products and had undergone gynecological surgery, experienced a significant reduction in UTIs.\n\n\"Our investigation supports that cranberry products can be a powerful tool to fight off frequent UTIs,\" explains lead author, Dr. \u00c2ngelo Lu\u00eds. \"While recommendations for dosage and duration of treatment require further study, the efficacy of the medicinal properties of cranberry products has been well-established.\"\n\nThe review explains that the medicinal properties of cranberries may be attributed to their unique polyphenol, proanthocyanidins - or PACs, for short. Their ability to keep infection-causing bacteria from sticking to the urinary tract walls may be the major reason for their effectiveness in limiting infection growth and recurrence.\n\nAccording to the authors, scientists and practitioners continue to explore the use of alternative therapies in the prevention of common infections as part of the global movement to reduce antibiotic use and resistance. It is estimated that one third of women in the United States will get a UTI by the age of 24.2\n\n\"Findings like this,\" adds Dr. Luis, \"give practitioners a viable, inexpensive, non-antibiotic option to help patients reduce the recurrence of an uncomfortable and potentially debilitating infection.\"\n\n\"As one of the oldest alternative therapies and U.S.-born berries, independent research such as this not only provides public health benefits, it revitalizes the enthusiasm for cranberry products year-round.

And this strategy \u2026 could potentially be used,\u201d said Dr. Jean-Michel Molina, head of infectious diseases at Saint-Louis Hospital in Paris and the lead author of the study.\n\nMolina insisted he would never support long-term use of antibiotics to prevent STIs, but said that the approach might be an effective short-term strategy when paired with other control approaches, like more frequent STI testing among high-risk populations.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want this strategy to be used widely in any person, clearly,\u201d Molina said. \u201cBut if you can select a group with a high incidence rate of syphilis or chlamydia, and you want to try to reduce the rate of syphilis quite quickly in this group of people, you may think that this strategy could be used for a couple of months.\u201d\n\nRates of syphilis in particular have risen steadily in recent years; the rate in 2015-2016 \u2014 8.7 cases per 100,000 people \u2014 was the highest since 1993, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. The rate of infection increased in every age group over the age of 15, in both men and women, and in all ethnic groups.\n\nMolina\u2019s study was recently published by the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was one of its funders.\n\nThe researchers randomly assigned 232 men to one of two groups. One of the groups was given antibiotics \u2014 the drug doxycycline \u2014 to take if they had unprotected sex. They were told to take two pills per encounter, and no more than six in a week, ideally within 24 hours and no later than 72 hours after the intercourse. In reality, the median use among the men was about 6.8 pills per month.\n\nThe men were tested regularly for STIs, and in the nine or so months they were followed, the rates of some sexually transmitted infections fell dramatically in the treatment group. The overall reduction of all STIs was 47 percent, but that average was dragged down by the fact that doxycycline doesn\u2019t cure gonorrhea.\n\nThere was, however, a 70 percent reduction in chlamydia infections and cases of syphilis decreased by 73 percent. The authors noted, however, that the study length was short and they can\u2019t tell if the strategy would work as well over the long term.\n\nThe results can\u2019t be taken in isolation, others experts warned. Using doxycycline this way could drive the bacteria that cause the infections to develop resistance to the drug, warned Dr. Brad Spellberg, an infectious diseases specialist and chief medical officer at the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center in Los Angeles.\n\nSpellberg also said people who used the drug this way would be exposing the bacteria they have in their gastro-intestinal tracts \u2014 their own gut flora \u2014 to regular doses of doxycycline. And those bacteria too could develop resistance to the drug, leading to a host of other health problems.\n\nThe full picture of the knock-on effects of exposing your gut flora to antibiotics is still coming into focus, said Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics, and Policy and a leading voice on the dangers of mounting antibiotic resistance. He noted a recent report in the journal Science revealed that some cancer immunotherapy drugs worked less well in people who had recently taken antibiotics.\n\nMolina noted that antibiotic resistance to doxycycline has not been seen in chlamydia or syphilis, despite the fact that the drug has been used to treat these infections for decades. Still, he said the possibility it could arise cannot be discounted.\n\nA commentary published with the study argued that reducing infection rates in men who have sex with men and who are highly sexually active might lower STI infection rates more generally in a community.\n\nAuthors Christopher Fairley and Eric Chow, of Australia\u2019s Melbourne Sexual Health Center at Monash University, said pressure from patients to be given doxycycline on a preventative basis might be substantial, given that the drug is also prescribed in six-month courses to treat acne. Like Molina and his co-authors, they said STI preventive use at this point is premature.\n\nLaxminarayan did not dismiss the notion of this type of use out of hand, however. \u201cI certainly think that for a small subset of the population, if this helps prevent syphilis, then it certainly is worth exploring further,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he said additional studies should be conducted first to try to get a better picture of the potential consequences of using doxycycline this way, including the risk of resistance developing, the potential that it might further erode condom use, and any other unintended consequences.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story includes quotes with researchers and independent sources that appear to be from original reporting.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Pill That Hits A Cause Of Cystic Fibrosis Beats Expectations\n\nMore than 20 years after the gene behind cystic fibrosis was identified, a pill that could fix the problem in some people is getting closer to reality.\n\nThe experimental medicine, taken twice a day, goes by the code name VX-770.

Just under a third of women taking flibanserin got over their sexual distress and/or lack of sexual desire (vs. about a fifth of women taking placebo pills). But the difference was important to the women, says study researcher Michael L.

It is estimated that the condition affects one in 110 children in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"There is a serious unmet need in the autism world, where diagnosis is currently done by subjective reports, and after the child has missed many developmental milestones,\" said lead researcher Joy Hirsch, a professor of functional neuroradiology, neuroscience and psychology, and director of the Functional MRI Laboratory at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City.\n\n\"It is now possible to develop an objective imaging diagnostic,\" she said. Indeed, the researchers found a difference between autistic brains and typical brains in the level of responsiveness in language areas, Hirsch noted.\n\n\"What we can measure are signals in the brain, in a specific language area, that are depressed in autistic children and normal in typical children,\" she said.\n\nAlthough this study was done with school-aged children and teens, the same test can be done with children as young as 18 months, Hirsch noted. \"We know this technique can be used on young children,\" she said.\n\nThe report was released in the May 31 online edition of Radiology, in advance of publication in the August print issue.\n\nFor the study, 12 children with autism and 15 children without the condition underwent functional MRI (fMRI) exams. Both groups of children ranged in age from 4 to 17 years.\n\nWhile the children were undergoing the fMRI, the researchers played recordings of their parents talking to them and watched for brain activity in areas of the brain responsible for hearing and understanding language.\n\nThe researchers found no differences in the activity in the hearing area of the brain between the two groups. However, in the language comprehension area, there was significantly more activity among typical children than among children with autism, Hirsch's group noted.\n\nTo further test this screening approach, another group of 27 autistic children, aged 5 to 17, underwent fMRI and the researchers were able to identify 26 of them as autistic.\n\nDr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York in Lake Success, said that \"although the investigators did indeed find significant differences on neuroimaging between controls and autistic children, the clinical utility from a diagnostic standpoint is unclear.\"\n\nThere are important limitations to the study, Adesman said.\n\nFor one, this study was done in school-aged children, many of whom were actually teenagers, so it is impossible to know if these differences in neuroimaging would also be found in younger patients, Adesman pointed out.\n\n\"It is during the toddler/preschool years that autism typically presents and needs to be diagnosed,\" he explained.\n\n\"The other major limitation of this study is that the investigators did not look at whether these brain differences are specific to children with autism, or if they would also be seen, for example, in children with language delays who are not autistic,\" Adesman said.\n\nHirsch noted the study is preliminary and, as such, has some limitations. For one, it is not known whether this technique can identify autism across the entire spectrum of the disorder.\n\n\"There are questions about how this varies across the severity of autism. Also, can we distinguish autism from other forms of developmental delay?\" she asked. \"These are things that aren't known.\"\n\nFurther work is needed to refine the test, Hirsch added. \"This is not the diagnostic that you can package and send to all community health centers in the United States. This is an announcement that this can be done,\" she said.\n\nThis test costs no more than a standard MRI, which runs around $1,500, Hirsch noted.\n\nAnother expert, Dr. Robert F. Lopez-Alberola, chief of pediatric neurology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, said that \"it's nice to have an objective measure, but it doesn't really do much.\"\n\nUltimately, he said, \"the diagnosis of autism is a clinical diagnosis. I see this as having more implications for research into the pathophysiology of autism.\"\n\nHowever, if this test could be done in really young children, it might help identify autism so that treatment can begin early, Lopez-Alberola suggested. \"We know the earlier we begin interventions, the greater the likelihood of better outcome,\" he said.\n\n\"Although this technique holds promise for identifying infants at risk for autism, it still needs to be determined whether the atypical patterns of brain activation are specific to autism,\" said Geraldine Dawson, chief science officer for Autism Speaks.\n\n\"It is possible that children who have delayed language but not autism would also show the same pattern. Regardless, this research is promising as a method for identifying young children at risk for autism,\" Dawson said.\n\nFor more on autism, visit the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A patient's own heart cells can be used to regrow new heart tissue and help undo damage caused by a heart attack, according to early research published on Monday.\n\nScientists at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore were able to treat 17 heart attack patients with cells grown from their own heart tissue. Not only did this show that the procedure was safe, it also showed that the cells can help reduce scarring and even cause new heart muscle to grow.\n\nWhen a person suffers a heart attack, he or she is often left with huge areas of scarring in the heart. Scarred heart muscle doesn't pump blood as well as it used to, putting stress on other parts of the heart to make up for the deficit. The damaged area also doesn't conduct electric current as well, leading to an abnormal heart rhythm, which can cause more problems. Heart attack patients often go on to develop heart failure.\n\n \n\n \"This is the first instance of therapeutic regeneration,\" says Dr. Eduardo Marb\u00e1n, director of the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute.\n\nHe says while nature abounds with examples of spontaneous regeneration of limbs or tissues - like a salamander's new tail or a human liver regrowing to full size if partially damaged - doctors have not been able to help patients regrow heart tissue. This could change in the future if larger clinical trials and longer patient outcomes confirm the results of this early research published Monday in the journal The Lancet.\n\nMarb\u00e1n and his colleagues first presented this research at an American Heart Association conference in November.\n\nTo qualify for this clinical trial, patients had to have suffered a recent heart attack and \"had to have a significant amount of damage to begin with and weren't squeezing [blood into the body] as well as they should have,\" says Dr. Peter Johnston, one of the study authors who injected the new heart cells into patients treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital.\n\nA total of 25 patients participated in the clinical trial, which was designed to determine if it was safe to have cells grown from one's own heart tissue injected back into the heart. Seventeen patients received the stem cell transplants, while the other eight patients were given conventional post-heart attack therapy.\n\nIn an outpatient procedure under local anesthesia, doctors funneled a catheter into the patient's heart and removed peppercorn-sized bits of tissue from the part of the patient's heart that was unaffected by the heart attack. Using a procedure invented by Marb\u00e1n, heart stem cells were isolated from the tissue and then millions of new cells were grown in a petri dish.\n\nAbout four to six weeks after having suffered the heart attack, the patients had either 12 million or 25 million heart-derived cells injected back into the their hearts.\n\nMarb\u00e1n says when the first patient data came in, he and his colleagues were relieved to see the procedure was safe. After 12 months, researchers report only one patient appeared to have a serious side effect that may have been connected to the experimental cells.\n\nSix months after the first patient was injected with his cells grown from his own heart tissue, Marb\u00e1n says there was dramatic shrinking of scar tissue and new tissue had grown. \"That was unprecedented\" he says. \"No one had demonstrated that before.\"\n\nAll patients were followed for six months and researchers have 12-month data for 21 patients. In patients who received the cell transplant, Marb\u00e1n says about half of their scar tissue dissolved and the reduction in scar size appears to get bigger after the first six months. He says that why this is happening is still unclear.\n\nMarb\u00e1n says the amount of new heart tissue that grew was not subtle. [On average] \"22 grams (about .78 ounces) of new heart tissue grew,\" which he says is quite remarkable considering this had never been done before and the average weight of the part of the heart that is responsible for pumping the blood through the body is about 150 grams (about 5.3 ounces).\n\nPatients in the control group, those who didn't get a cell transplant, did not regenerate any tissue and the amount of scar tissue they had remained the same.\n\nSonia Skarlatos, Ph.D and deputy director of the Division of Cardiovascular Sciences at the NIH\u2019s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute says this early research is very exciting and a move in the right direction. She cautions that this procedure has to be tested on many more patients and they have to be observed for longer periods than in the current study, but she says these results are all very positive. She is hopeful further studies will confirm these early results.\n\n\"By preventing the consequences of a heart attack you may be able to prevent further down the heart failure that happens in [many of these] patients.\" Skarlatos says.\n\nShe was not involved in the research but the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute did help fund it.\n\nSkarlatos also says it's still not clear exactly what is making the heart regenerate and scar tissue disappear. Is it the cells themselves or proteins and other factors produced by these newly introduced cells that help fix the heart? Further research will hopefully also help answer those questions, she says. The study authors say based on these results, further research is warranted.\n\nMarb\u00e1n, who began his research at Johns Hopkins, says \"we did see a glimmer [of regeneration] in animal testing,\" but the results in humans were much better. \"That doesn't usually happen this way in research.\"", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story goes beyond the Cedars-Sinai press release.\n\u00a0", "answer": 1}, {"article": "We're sorry, but we seem to have lost this page.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "There is a press release, but this story goes beyond the release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "University of Miami cardiologists last week reported success in a small, preliminary human clinical trial of a new stem cell therapy they hope some day will routinely mend human hearts and reduce the need for lifelong medication, even for transplants.\n\n\u201cThat's the Holy Grail, the quest the whole field has been pursuing for close to a decade, and this is evidence we're on the right track,\u201d said Dr. Joshua Hare, director of the University of Miami Medical School's Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Institute. He's lead author of the study that appears in Thursday's peer-reviewed Circulation Research: Journal of the American Heart Association.\n\nMax Eaton, the 68-year-old direct-buy franchise owner who was patient No.1 in the eight-person trial, said Wednesday he's thankful he was part of the trial, adding that he had just completed a 2.8-mile, 41-minute walk around his neighborhood in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Fla.\n\n\u201cI feel very grateful,\u201d he said. \u201cAlmost certainly, I would be deceased or in much worse shape had I not had the opportunity to be in this program.\u201d\n\nHare stressed that the current trial is only a small, run-up phase of extensive testing that will take up to five years and involve dozens of hospitals and hundreds of patients before winning U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for routine use.\n\nThe trial was primarily about the safety of the procedure, and all eight patients came through without significant side effects, he said. The procedure also reduced the size of hearts swollen by previous heart attacks, a condition called cardiomyopathy or simply heart failure.\n\nThe reduction was up to 25 percent, while current therapies including medication and pacemakers typically reduce the size by only about 5 percent, he said. The reduction in swelling increases the heart's ability to pump blood, he said. By implication, it almost certainly improves the patient's health, although that was not directly measured in the small, early study.\n\nIn the study, stem cells were taken from the patient's own bone marrow and injected by catheter into scar tissue in the patient's heart caused by an earlier heart attack. It worked in patients such as Eaton, whose heart attack was 11 years ago, Hare said. The hope was that the immature adult stem cells would turn into heart muscle, replacing the scar tissue.\n\nThe study shed new light on a question of prime interest to cardiologists: whether the injected stem cells actually transformed themselves into heart muscle, or improved heart function in some other way.\n\nSome of the stem cells did become heart muscle, Hare said; they also triggered the heart to produce more of its own stem cells which became new heart muscle as well, he said.\n\nThe next step is two more near-term studies. The first, which started in 2009, is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 60 patients designed further to test the safety of the procedure, but primarily its efficacy, or how well it works.\n\nAnother study about to get underway will see whether bone marrow from a donor can work as well as the patient's own bone marrow.\n\nLater, researchers will conduct a study involving 50 to 100 hospitals and many hundreds of patients aimed at winning final FDA approval.\n\nEaton's part of the testing is finished.

To complicate matters, many migraine sufferers can also experience severe bouts of nausea and vomiting.\n\nAnother expert described the problem this way.\n\n\"I've had some patients where the nausea and vomiting was so bad they couldn't even swallow a pill,\" said Nancy Waltman, a nurse practitioner with the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Nursing, Lincoln Division.\n\nA nasal spray is available, as is an injection, but many patients aren't comfortable with these options, Khan and Waltman noted.\n\nKhan said the Zecuity patch is \"simple, efficient and can deliver the exact amount of dosage with minimal variability.\"\n\nThe patch is attached to the upper arm or thigh, and when the patient pushes a button the drug is delivered through the skin.

In a small study from Spain, lupus patients showed dramatic improvements in skin lesions while taking the drug, lenalidomide (Revlimid), and most relapsed soon after they stopped taking it.\n\nThalidomide is best known as the drug that caused thousands of children to be born with missing limbs and other birth defects in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In more recent years it has been brought back to the market to treat a number of serious conditions, but its use is monitored closely to ensure that it is not taken by women who are pregnant or who might become pregnant. Dermatology professor Andrew G. Franks Jr., MD, of the NYU Langone Medical Center, says thalidomide is very effective for treating people with lupus skin conditions who do not respond to standard treatments such as steroids and antimalarial drugs. He says about 75% of patients with affected skin will go into remission with these standard treatments. \u201cThe question has been, \u2018What do you do with the rest?\u2019\u201d he says.

Then she developed knee pain so severe that she could not climb stairs.\n\nSo Pierce, a doctoral student in food science, went to see physical therapist Matt Briggs at The Ohio State Wexner Medical Center in Columbus. He performed deep massages, suggested changes in her running form and taught her how to exercise her thigh and gluteal muscles to better protect her knees. She believes all of that helped.\n\nBut Pierce, like a growing number of patients, had another treatment she is convinced helped even more. It\u2019s called \"dry needling,\" and it involves the insertion of thin, non-medicated solid needles into muscles or connective tissues. Proponents say it can reduce pain and improve movement.

For one thing, he says, dry needling as performed by a physical therapist is not rooted in ancient Chinese medicine \u2014 there\u2019s no talk about redirecting the body\u2019s energy flow by placing needles at certain points in the body. Instead, needles are placed directly in problem areas.\n\nElliott says dry needling also is practiced by some chiropractors, naturopathic physicians and nurses, which puts it outside the realm of any one specialty.\n\nAcupuncturists beg to differ. \u201cWhat is being called dry needling is clearly a form of acupuncture\u201d and should be done only by professionals extensively trained in that discipline, says Thomas Burgoon, a West Chester, Pa., physician who is president of the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture. He says many acupuncturists do exactly what the physical therapists describe, with the same kind of needles.\n\nBurgoon\u2019s group has persuaded some states to bar physical therapists from the practice. \n\n\n\nHow might it work?\n\nOne theory is that the needles cause tight muscles to twitch, then relax. The needles may also increase blood flow or set off nerve responses that alter pain perception, Briggs says.\n\nAnother possibility: It\u2019s a placebo effect, an improvement triggered by the expectation that a treatment will work rather than by the treatment itself. To look for that possibility, the Ohio State study will compare patients who get the real needle treatment to those poked with sham needles that don\u2019t pierce the skin.\n\nMark Crislip, an infectious-disease doctor in Portland, Ore., who recently wrote about dry needling for Science-Based Medicine \u2014 a website critical of alternative medicine \u2014 says the version practiced by physical therapists doesn\u2019t \u201ccome with the mystical baggage that accompanies acupuncture.\u201d But he says it may well be a \u201ctheatrical placebo.\u201d\n\nWhat do published studies say?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mixed bag,\u201d Elliott says. In a 2011 review, the physical therapy association rated the evidence for dry needling a 3 out of 5, based on the best studies. A formal analysis of 35 trails on acupuncture and dry needling for chronic lower back pain was published by the Cochrane research group in 2005. It found they \u201cmay be useful\u201d additions to standard treatment. But it said higher quality studies were needed.\n\nWhat are the risks?\n\nNeedling can produce minor bleeding and some soreness, but in trained hands, and with the use of sterile needles and gloves, \u201cit\u2019s a very safe procedure,\u201d Briggs says.\n\nIn rare cases, deep needling can lead to a punctured lung or injuries to nerves and blood vessels, and acupuncturists fear non-specialists will be more likely to make such mistakes, Burgoon says.\n\nWill insurers pay for this?\n\nMany will not. Charges for patients can range from $10 to $75 per session, says Edo Zylstra, CEO of KinetaCore, a company that offers intensive three-day weekend courses in dry needling to physical therapists.\n\nDo all physical therapists offer this?\n\nNo. The physical therapy association tells members in seven states to steer clear because of recent court or regulatory decisions or language in existing licensing laws.

None took any medications during that time to control their disease and relied on weight loss alone.\n\nType 2 diabetes is caused by the body\u2019s in ability to break down sugars from the diet. Normally, cells in the pancreas work to release insulin, a hormone that can process sugar and either send it to cells that need it for energy or store it as fat for future energy needs. Cells in the liver are responsible for clearing insulin from the circulation. But excess fat in the pancreas and liver can start to shut down these insulin-producing cells, leading to spikes in blood sugar levels. Diabetes medications can bring sugar levels down but do not address the compromised insulin machinery.\n\nIn the study, Dr. Roy Taylor, professor of medicine and metabolism at Newcastle University, and his colleagues randomly assigned nearly 300 people to either a weight management program or their usual treatments, including diabetes medications. All of the people had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in the six years preceding the study. The people assigned to the diet group stopped any diabetes drugs they were taking on the same day they began the diet.\n\nThe diet, which was designed to help people lose up to 30 pounds, involved three to five months of a strict low-calorie liquid formula diet averaging no more than 850 calories a day, followed by two to eight weeks of reintroducing food, along with nutritional education and cognitive behavioral therapy to help people stick with the new eating plan.\n\nTaylor and his team tracked outcomes including weight loss, diabetes remission and level of fat in the pancreas and liver. After a year, most of the people in the diet group lost about 22 pounds, compared to two pounds in the control group. Nearly a quarter of the people who managed their weight were able to lose 33 pounds or more, while none in the control group were able to lose that much. Most importantly, 46% of the people in the diet group went into remission with their diabetes, compared to just 4% in the control group.\n\nMORE: Antibiotics Are Linked To Type-2 Diabetes\n\n\u201cPeople newly diagnosed with diabetes for the first time can look at this and know it isn\u2019t necessarily for life,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cIt isn\u2019t an irreversible, inexorable condition that you can never escape from \u2014 at the moment, people are told that.\u201d\n\nPrevious studies have suggested that lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise, can be powerful ways to lose weight and combat diabetes. The Diabetes Prevention Program in the U.S. revealed in 2002 that diet and exercise alone can prevent people from progressing from pre-diabetes to diabetes, in some cases better than medications designed to control blood sugar. Gastric bypass surgery, which can result in dramatic weight loss, can also help to reverse diabetes, but the procedure is costly and carries a high risk of complications.\n\nThe current study takes that work a step further and shows that it\u2019s possible to actually reverse the disease in people who have been diagnosed. Taylor stresses that the study only addressed people diagnosed relatively recently \u2014 within the past six years \u2014 and that the effect may not apply to more long-term patients. That\u2019s because as the disease continues, he says, insulin-producing cells start to die off. Initially, the cells slowly shut down, entering a so-called resting state. Those are the cells that weight loss can re-activate.\n\nBut left in this state too long, the cells eventually die and cannot be revived. Studies suggest that people living with diabetes for more than 10 years, for example, may not be able to rely on weight loss alone to push them into remission.\n\nThat points to an important lesson that Taylor hopes doctors and patients will learn from the results. He says that it\u2019s critical to discuss from the start \u2014 when people are diagnosed with diabetes \u2014 the possibility of using diet and weight loss to treat their disease. If more people can benefit from losing weight alone, then that would mean less cost to the health care system, as fewer people will suffer the serious complications of advanced disease, which can include heart problems, neuropathy, vision issues and even amputations.\n\nTaylor says he intends to follow up on the people in the study for another four years to see if they are able to maintain their weight, and, if they are, whether they continue to remain in remission. \u201cFrom the very clear data we produced in this trial, yes, this is a watershed moment for diabetes,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can offer people hope from the start.\u201d", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not appear to rely on the new release put out by The Lancet, the journal that published the study.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Morristown, N.J., Aug. 7, 2017 - As we age, managing healthy weight may become more difficult due to a slowing metabolism, however, help may come from a fiery source -- the capsicum pepper. A recent paper, Capsaicinoids Enhance Metabolic Rate in Normal Healthy Individuals using a Novel Metabolic Tracker Breezing Device-An Open Label Placebo Controlled Acute Study, published in the journal Obesity Open Access discussed the findings of the Metabolic Rate (MR) Study, which demonstrated that an extract from red hot peppers boosted metabolic rate (Chen, et al., 2017).\n\n\"Because capsaicinoids (the component of hot peppers that gives them heat) are hot, it was imperative that we use an ingredient which the subjects could tolerate,\" said Vijaya Juturu, Ph.D., F.A.C.N., one of the lead researchers on the MR Study. \"Since Capsimax is made using a proprietary beadleting technology, OmniBead, which coats the capsicum extract, releasing it only when it reaches the intestines where it is absorbed without discomfort, we were able to deliver beneficial levels of capsaicinoids to our subjects, which made the MR Study possible.\"\n\nThe MR Study was a placebo-controlled, crossover open label study with 40 healthy adults examining the effects of either 2 mg capsaicinoids from 100 mg of Capsimax or placebo on resting energy expenditure, heart rate and blood pressure. Resting energy expenditure is the amount of energy required by the body during resting conditions and accounts up to 60% of the calories you burn each day and so increasing this amount can aid in managing weight. The study showed that supplementing with this low dose of Capsimax increased metabolic rate which calculated to an equivalent to burning an extra 116 calories per day. Moreover, though resting energy expenditure varies with each individual, this increase would yield almost 1 lb. of fat lost over 30 days.\n\n\"Aging is inevitable, but that doesn't mean we can't be active participants in our weight management as we age,\" said Abhijit Bhattacharya, President of OmniActive Health Technologies Ltd., producers of Capsimax. \"Capsimax is supported by multiple studies with findings showing safety, increased lipolysis and satiety and improved healthy body composition.

The San Francisco airport now deploys a pig to calm frazzled travelers. Universities nationwide bring dogs (and a donkey) onto campus to soothe students during finals. Llamas comfort hospital patients, pooches provide succor at disaster sites and horses are used to treat sex addiction.\n\nAnd that duck on a plane? It might be an emotional-support animal prescribed by a mental health professional.\n\nThe trend, which has accelerated hugely since its initial stirrings a few decades ago, is underpinned by a widespread belief that interaction with animals can reduce distress \u2014 whether it happens over brief caresses at the airport or in long-term relationships at home. Certainly, the groups offering up pets think this, as do some mental health professionals. But the popular embrace of pets as furry therapists is causing growing discomfort among some researchers in the field, who say it has raced far ahead of scientific evidence.\n\nEarlier this year in the Journal of Applied Developmental Science, an introduction to a series of articles on \u201canimal-assisted intervention\u201d said research into its efficacy \u201cremains in its infancy.\u201d A recent literature review by Molly Crossman, a Yale University doctoral candidate who recently wrapped up one study involving an 8-year-old dog named Pardner, cited a \u201cmurky body of evidence\u201d that sometimes has shown positive short-term effects, often found no effect and occasionally identified higher rates of distress.\n\nOverall, Crossman wrote, animals seem to be helpful in a \u201csmall-to-medium\u201d way, but it\u2019s unclear whether the critters deserve the credit or something else is at play.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a field that has been sort of carried forward by the convictions of practitioners\u201d who have seen patients\u2019 mental health improve after working with or adopting animals, said James Serpell, director of the Center for the Interaction of Animals and Society at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine. \u201cThat kind of thing has almost driven the field, and the research is playing catch-up. In other words, people are recognizing that anecdote isn\u2019t enough.\u201d\n\nUsing animals in mental health settings is nothing new. In the 17th century, a Quaker-run retreat in England encouraged mentally ill patients to interact with animals on its grounds. Sigmund Freud often included one of his dogs in psychoanalysis sessions. Yet the subject did not become a research target until the American child psychologist Boris Levinson began writing in the 1960s about the positive effect his dog Jingles had on patients.\n\nBut the evidence to date is problematic, according to Crossman\u2019s review and others before it. Most studies had small sample sizes, she wrote, and an \u201calarming number\u201d did not control for other possible reasons for a changed stress level, such as interaction with the animal\u2019s human handler. Studies also tend to generalize across animals, she noted: If participants are measurably soothed by one golden retriever, that doesn\u2019t mean another dog \u2014 or another species \u2014 will evoke the same response.\n\nEven so, media headlines are often about the happiness bounce. Hal Herzog, a Western Carolina University psychologist who has long studied human-animal interactions, recalls a 2015 study on the health benefits for children of having a pet dog. \u201cHere\u2019s a reason to get a puppy,\u201d NBC announced. \u201cKids with pets have less anxiety.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s actually not what the study concluded. The authors did find that children with dogs had lower anxiety based on screening scores than children without dogs. Still, they cautioned that \u201cthis study does not answer whether pet dogs have direct effects on children\u2019s mental health or whether other factors associated with acquisition of a pet dog benefit their mental health.\u201d\n\nIt was a classic case of conflating correlation and causation, which Herzog says is common. Cherry-picked positive results also are a problem, as he says happens in promotional materials from the Human-Animal Bond Research Initiative (HABRI). The pet-industry backed organization funds research on the topic.\n\n\u201cThe number of papers I see that start out, \u2018It is now well-established that there are health benefits from owning pets\u2019 \u2014 that drives me crazy,\u201d Herzog said. \u201cYes, there\u2019s literature that supports that. But there\u2019s also literature that doesn\u2019t find that.\u201d\n\nHABRI Executive Director Steven Feldman takes a more positive view of the science while acknowledging that more research needs to be done. \u201cJust like getting vegetables and getting exercise, I would say having animals in our lives is also an essential element of human wellness,\u201d he said.\n\nTo many animal lovers and pet owners, the back-and-forth might sound horribly wonky. There\u2019s something intuitive about the good feelings animals give us. Why over-analyze it?\n\nAlan Beck does not disagree. Beck, who directs the Center of the Human-Animal Bond at Purdue University, cites one common theory for why animals might be therapeutic. It\u2019s called the biophilia hypothesis, and it argues that humans evolved a built-in need to affiliate with other living beings.\n\n\u201cThroughout history, animals gave us some comfort. So if it works for you and me in a relatively normal environment, maybe it has a special role for someone who has a depression and stress disorder \u2014 that just makes sense,\u201d he said. \u201cThe literature does show it\u2019s not bad. And that\u2019s just as important.\u201d\n\nFocusing too much on scientific support sometimes feels like a form of \u201cphysics envy,\u201d Beck added, \u201cwhere you try to quantify everything without appreciating it.\u201d\n\nBut there are good reasons for rigorous research on animals and mental health. In 2012, the Department of Veterans Affairs said it would not cover costs of service dogs for veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder, citing \u201ca lack of evidence to support a finding of mental health service dog efficacy.\u201d The department is now in the midst of a multiyear study on the topic, which could lead to government funding for these pooches.\n\nAnother reason, the scientists say, is for the animals\u2019 sake. Crossman pointed to a 2014 incident at Washington University in St. Louis as an example of animal therapy gone wrong. A bear cub brought to campus during finals week nipped some students, causing a rabies scare that almost ended with the animal being euthanized. More generally, Serpell said, the popular idea that pets make you happier \u201cis not a harmless distortion. \u2026 If the public believes that getting an animal is going to be good for them, many times an unsuitable person will get an unsuitable animal, and it doesn\u2019t work out well for either.\u201d\n\nThe research is getting stronger, in part because funding is growing \u2014 from HABRI as well as from a public-private partnership between the National Institutes of Health and the Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition. Crossman\u2019s recent study at the Yale Innovative Interactions Lab was among the work being supported.\n\nIt relied not just on the Labrador retriever Pardner but seven other certified therapy dogs. Several times a month over much of the past year, they hung out at the university for 15-minute sessions with children who had just finished two stressful tasks: spontaneously crafting stories and telling them to strangers, followed by doing math problems.\n\nThe strangers were the researchers, and their mission was to assess whether the kids, ages 10 to 13, would find their time with the dogs to be therapeutic. The study was designed to avoid some of the pitfalls that Crossman has seen elsewhere, which is why some of the 78 young participants got to play only with a fuzzy blanket \u2014 because tactile stimulation is known to reduce stress \u2014 and why others simply waited for the 15 minutes.\n\n\u201cWithout the controls, the changes could be due to all kinds of things, like the fact that lots of time has passed,\u201d Crossman said. \u201cKids are actually pretty good at coping.\u201d\n\nThe children completed questionnaires to assess their mood and anxiety before and after; spit samples, to measure the \u201cstress hormone\u201d cortisol, were taken at three points. At the end, all the kids got a \u201cjunior scientist\u201d certificate, lots of praise and an open play session with the dogs.\n\nCrossman, who emphasizes that she is an animal lover, declined to reveal the findings before they\u2019re published. But \u201chopefully\u201d they will show that dogs can affect children\u2019s stress, she said \u2014 before quickly offering a researcher\u2019s clarification.\n\n\u201cI say \u2018hopefully\u2019 not just because I think it works or hope it does, but because these programs are used so widely,\u201d she explained. \u201cKids are already participating in this on a huge scale. Ideally, the order goes the other way around: We test the idea, and then we implement.\u201d\n\nThese states have the fattest pets \u2014 and they might surprise you\n\nLong before they conquered the Internet, cats took over the world\n\nA kitten nursery saves tiny lives in a city aiming to become \u2018no kill\u2019\n\nBear breaks into house, plays the piano but not very well", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not appear to be based on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "MONDAY, Aug. 15, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- A traditional Chinese herbal treatment may reduce fever from H1N1 (\"swine flu\") influenza just as well as the prescription medication Tamiflu, a new study suggests.\n\n\"For thousands of years, Chinese herbs have been used to treat influenza,\" study co-authors Dr. Chen Wang and Dr. Bin Cao, of Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, in China, said in an email. \"The pandemic influenza 2009 gave us the opportunity to evaluate a standard Chinese herb formula\" designed to target the flu, they added.\n\nCao and Wang, who specialize in infectious diseases and clinical microbiology, said the herbal recipe -- known as maxingshigan-yinqiaosan (M-Y) -- is easily accessible throughout China and much less expensive than Tamiflu (oseltamivir).\n\nHowever, finding the medicine in the United States is difficult, if not impossible, given that it contains the stimulant ephedra. The United States has banned or restricted the sale of ephedra products because of concerns about possible complications, such as heart attack, stroke and even death, related to its use as a weight-loss supplement.\n\nThe authors discuss their findings in the Aug. 16 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nThe 2009 H1N1 (\"swine flu\") pandemic sparked influenza cases around the globe, resulting in nearly 18,000 deaths, the authors said.\n\nPer World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, in most instances, Tamiflu was the treatment of choice, where it was available. However, it is often out of reach in less developed parts of the world, such as rural China, where traditional herbal medicines are a likely default treatment.\n\nThe M-Y flu preparation is composed of 12 herbs: ephedrae, zhimu, qinghao, shigao, yinhua, huangqin, chaoxingren, lianqiao, bohe, zhebeimu, niubangzi and gancao.\n\nTo compare the relative effectiveness of M-Y and Tamiflu in treating H1N1 influenza, the authors focused on 410 previously healthy patients who were diagnosed with a \"very mild\" form of the illness.\n\nThe men and women were relatively young, with an average age of 19. They were being treated in 11 different medical facilities across four Chinese provinces during the height of the pandemic, between July and November of 2009, to prevent spreading the flu, not because their symptoms were severe.\n\nWithin 72 hours of the onset of symptoms, the patients were assigned to one of four five-day treatment groups. One group was given 75 milligrams of Tamiflu twice a day in capsule form; a second group received 200 milliliters of M-Y four times a day in liquid form; a third group took the same dosages of Tamiflu and M-Y together; and a fourth group received no treatment.\n\nAll of the herbs were screened for quality, and the M-Y mixture was deemed to meet Chinese safety standards.\n\nThe results: Both M-Y and Tamiflu were effective at eliminating fever, whether administered on their own or in combination.\n\nAll three approaches helped to resolve fever sooner than no intervention whatsoever, the authors said, noting it appeared that fever dissipated fastest when M-Y and Tamiflu were given together. However, none of the treatment methods appeared to be superior in terms of overall viral control, and side effects were minimal in all cases.\n\nEven though the ephedra-containing herbal is not readily available in the United States, the M-Y herbal formula is available in many countries besides China, including Korea, Japan, India and Germany, the study authors noted.\n\nDuffy MacKay, vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs at the Council for Responsible Nutrition, which represents the dietary supplement industry, believes that fears over ephedra's use as a weight-control agent have overlooked \"its more traditional and much safer\" role as a medicine against lung inflammation.\n\nMacKay said that in China, traditional medicine is \"seamlessly integrated\" into everyday medical practice.\n\n\"Here in the U.S., we do things differently,\" he said. \"We have our prescription drugs on the one hand, and then we have dietary supplements on the other.\"\n\nBut, MacKay continued, \"it should also be understood that these two treatments actually work very differently. Tamiflu works to stop viral replication. But the herbal formula is working on symptoms to help people become more comfortable. And those are two very different goals,\" he noted.\n\n\"So our advice,\" MacKay added, \"is that because H1N1 can be very serious, it's very important to see your doctor. And once you're under the care of your licensed physician there's certainly a lot of things in the world of botanicals that might help.\"\n\nFor more on the flu and traditional medicine, visit the U.S. National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "This story was not based on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Newswise \u2014 Montreal, March 22, 2016 \u2014 The proportion of older adults with age-related vision loss is estimated to be as high as one in three over the age of 50.

After six months, his wife, co-workers and he noted improvement in memory. A life-long ability to add columns of numbers rapidly in his head returned and he reported an ability to remember his schedule and recognize faces at work. After 22 months on the protocol he returned for follow-up quantitative neuropsychological testing; results showed marked improvements in all categories with his long-term recall increasing from the 3rd to 84th percentile. He is expanding his business.\n\nAnother patient, a 49-year old woman who noted progressive difficulty with word finding and facial recognition went on the protocol after undergoing quantitative neuropsychological testing at a major university. She had been told she was in the early stages of cognitive decline and was therefore ineligible for an Alzheimer\u2019s prevention program. After several months on the protocol she noted a clear improvement in recall, reading, navigating, vocabulary, mental clarity and facial recognition. Her foreign language ability had returned. Nine months after beginning the program she did a repeat of the neuropsychological testing at the same university site. She no longer showed evidence of cognitive decline.\n\nAll but one of the ten patients included in the study are at genetic risk for AD, carrying at least one copy of the APOE4 allele. Five of the patients carry two copies of APOE4 which gives them a 10-12 fold increased risk of developing AD. \u201cWe\u2019re entering a new era,\u201d said Bredesen. \u201cThe old advice was to avoid testing for APOE because there was nothing that could be done about it. Now we\u2019re recommending that people find out their genetic status as early as possible so they can go on prevention.\u201d Sixty-five percent of the Alzheimer\u2019s cases in this country involve APOE4; with seven million people carrying two copies of the ApoE4 allele.\n\nBredesen\u2019 s systems-based approach to reverse memory loss follows the abject failure of monotherapies designed to treat AD and the success of combination therapies to treat other chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and HIV. Bredesen says decades of biomedical research, both in his and other labs, has revealed that an extensive network of molecular interactions is involved in AD pathogenesis, suggesting that a broader-based therapeutic approach may be more effective. \u201cImagine having a roof with 36 holes in it, and your drug patched one hole very well\u2014the drug may have worked, a single \u2018hole\u2019 may have been fixed, but you still have 35 other leaks, and so the underlying process may not be affected much,\u201d Bredesen said. \u201cWe think addressing multiple targets within the molecular network may be additive, or even synergistic, and that such a combinatorial approach may enhance drug candidate performance, as well.\u201d\n\nWhile encouraged by the results of the study, Bredesen admits more needs to be done. \u201cThe magnitude of improvement in these ten patients is unprecedented, providing additional objective evidence that this programmatic approach to cognitive decline is highly effective,\u201d Bredesen said. \u201cEven though we see the far-reaching implications of this success, we also realize that this is a very small study that needs to be replicated in larger numbers at various sites.\u201d Plans for larger studies are underway.\n\nCognitive decline is often listed as the major concern of older adults. Already, Alzheimer\u2019s disease affects approximately 5.4 million Americans and 30 million people globally. Without effective prevention and treatment, the prospects for the future are bleak. By 2050, it\u2019s estimated that 160 million people globally will have the disease, including 13 million Americans, leading to potential bankruptcy of the Medicare system. Unlike several other chronic illnesses, Alzheimer\u2019s disease is on the rise--recent estimates suggest that AD has become the third leading cause of death in the United States behind cardiovascular disease and cancer.\n\nTHE BREDESEN PROTOCOL, Dr. Bredesen\u2019s book describing for a lay audience the interventions described in this paper, will be released by Penguin Random House in May 2017. Dr. Bredesen hopes to eventually transform the perception and reality of Alzheimer\u2019s disease from a death sentence to a preventable reversible condition.\n\nOther collaborators on the study include Edwin C.

Invasive coronary angiography (ICA) is considered the gold standard for determining the percent of stenosis, or narrowing, due to plaque in a coronary artery. However, the degree of stenosis on ICA is not always an accurate predictor of heart attack risk because it gives no information on perfusion, or the flow of blood into the heart muscle. Inadequate perfusion, also known as ischemia, is a potential danger to the patient.\n\n\"In lesions with less than 50 percent narrowing, one in five lesions still produce an ischemia,\" said study coauthor Philipp A. Kaufmann, M.D., professor and chair of nuclear medicine, and director of cardiac imaging at University Hospital Zurich in Switzerland.\n\nCardiac hybrid imaging combines coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and myocardial perfusion imaging with single photon emission tomography (SPECT) to provide information on both stenosis and perfusion. The approach has shown promise in studies focusing on short-term observations, but information is lacking on long-term outcomes.\n\nThe research team looked at 428 patients who underwent hybrid imaging. During a median follow-up of 6.8 years, a total of 160 major adverse cardiac events, including 45 deaths, were observed in the final study population. Patients with matched findings--stenosis of 50 percent or more on CCTA with evidence of ischemia on SPECT in the area of the heart to which the blocked vessel was supplying blood--had more than five times the risk of adverse events than those with normal findings. Patients with unmatched findings, or evidence of ischemia but not in the area of the heart being fed by the stenotic artery, had three times the risk. Major adverse cardiac event rates were 21.8 percent for matched findings and 9.0 percent for unmatched--considerably higher than the 2.4 percent rate for normal findings.\n\nThe results show that cardiac hybrid imaging is an excellent long-term predictor of adverse cardiac events in patients evaluated for coronary artery disease. Dr. Kaufmann said that hybrid imaging findings could help guide treatment decisions, such as whether or not a patient should have a revascularization procedure such as bypass or angioplasty.\n\n\"In patients with multiple lesions or complex coronary anatomy, it is, in many cases, very difficult to correctly identify the culprit lesion,\" he said. \"In a previous multicenter trial, with hybrid imaging we were able to see that about one in five patients should be revascularized in another coronary artery than originally planned. The present study now documents the prognostic importance of the comprehensive assessment provided by hybrid imaging.\"\n\nThe study supports CCTA use for an initial, noninvasive evaluation of patients with known or suspected stable coronary artery disease. No additional imaging would be necessary if the results were normal. If a lesion was evident, then clinicians could employ a nuclear scan to assess ischemia and take advantage of both modalities by fusing the results together to make a hybrid image.\n\n\"The strategy of direct referral to invasive coronary angiography without noninvasive imaging is obsolete,\" Dr. Kaufmann said. \"Even after documenting coronary artery disease with coronary CT angiography, we need further noninvasive evaluation before deciding upon revascularization versus medication.\"\n\nThe researchers hope to run a trial to show that hybrid imaging can have a positive impact on patient outcomes. They are also looking at what they call \"triple hybrid\" imaging, which combines the CCTA/SPECT hybrid with information on coronary artery shear stress. The shear stress information could help identify lesions that do not yet have an impact on ischemia but will in the future.\n\n\"Hybrid SPECT Perfusion Imaging and Coronary CT Angiography: Long-Term Prognostic Value for Cardiovascular Outcomes.\" Collaborating with Dr. Kaufmann were Aju P.

Some days the pain is so bad, she says, \"By 11 o'clock in the morning, I'm on the couch in a darkened room with my head packed in ice.\"\n\nOver the years, Bradford, who is 50 years old and lives in Bedford, Mass., has searched desperately for pain relief. She's been to the doctor countless times for countless tests. \"Everything I've had, I've had twice,\" she says. \"I've had two spinal taps; I've had so many nerve blocks I've lost count.\"\n\nBradford is not alone. It's estimated that every year 12 million Americans go to the doctor seeking help for headaches. Nearly one quarter of the population suffers from recurrent severe tension headaches or migraines.\n\nPeople who go to the doctor for headaches are increasingly likely to be sent for advanced testing and treatment, a study finds. That testing is expensive, it may not be necessary and it could even be harmful, says lead researcher Dr. John Mafi, of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.\n\nMafi looked at the rates of advanced imaging like CT scans and MRIs in people with headaches, as well as referrals to other doctors, presumably specialists. He found that from 1999 to 2010, the number of diagnostic tests rose from 6.7 percent of all doctor visits to 13.9 percent. At the same time, referrals to other doctors increased from 6.9 percent to 13.2 percent. In other words, almost double what it was a decade ago.\n\nMafi says this isn't because more people are suffering headaches. The headache rate has remained virtually the same over the past decade. But what has changed is supply and demand. Today there are a lot more advanced diagnostic machines than there were a decade ago, and more patients are asking to be tested.\n\n\"Patients are more assertive than ever before,\" Mafi says. \"They do research online, are more informed and sometimes go to the doctor demanding, 'I think I need an MRI.' \"\n\nAnd while an informed patient is a good thing, Mafi says sometimes the patient gets it wrong. \"I think there's a subconscious perception that more is better, and that fancier, more expensive tests are better and that equals better care.\"\n\nMafi's study did not include patients with tumors or other serious problems that can cause headaches. He only looked at otherwise healthy patients who suffered chronic headaches. And in these cases, repeated diagnostic testing can lead to further unnecessary procedures like biopsies.\n\nOn top of that, exposure to radiation in tests like CT scans adds up over time and can increase the risk of certain cancers.\n\nFor Terri Bradford, the years of searching for effective treatment proved futile. \"I've been to four neurologists. A lot of them have given up on me because I haven't gotten any better,\" she says.\n\nEventually Bradford ended up at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where neurologist Carolyn Bernstein directs the Comprehensive Headache Center. Bernstein says she sees lots of desperate patients like Bradford. \"The majority of them have really been suffering a number of years and they're really miserable with the pain,\" Bernstein says. They say, \" 'I hope you have a magic pill,' and of course there is no magic pill.\"\n\nThere is just no single reason why people get chronic headaches, although we do know that migraines have a genetic component and usually a trigger. \"If you are a migraine sufferer and I expose you to the right trigger, you're going to have a migraine,\" Bernstein says.\n\nBut the triggers are different for different people. They can include poor diet, too much sugar or certain types of alcohol. Problems sleeping, stress, lack of exercise or a combination of any number of these things can cause chronic headaches.\n\nAt the headache center, patients receive a thorough medical history that includes headache patterns, disability and mood assessments. Then the center works with patients to try to identify what triggers their headaches and how they can avoid those triggers in the future.\n\nSome people find relief through exercise. \"I write an exercise prescription probably as often as I write a prescription for medication,\" Bernstein says. She acknowledges it's sometimes difficult to encourage a patient with cracking head pain to get up and exercise. But even a little can help, and according to Bernstein it doesn't have to be jogging for miles and miles. It can be yoga, tai chi or even just a little stretching.\n\nA big lifestyle adjustment worked for Terri Bradford. She started exercising and changed her diet, giving up gluten, dairy and sugar. And she learned how to meditate to reduce stress. All these changes, she says, have made a huge difference. She has far fewer headaches and when she does have them, they're far less severe. \"I'm finally healing,\" she says.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "TUESDAY, March 23, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- An ingredient in agave -- the plant used to make tequila -- may help fight bone-weakening osteoporosis and other diseases, Mexican researchers say.\n\nAgave, artichokes, garlic, onions and chicory are rich, natural sources of fructans -- nondigestible carbohydrates consisting of molecules of fructose linked together into chains, according to background information in a news release from the American Chemical Society.\n\n\"Experimental studies suggest that fructans may be beneficial in diabetes, obesity, stimulating the immune system of the body, decreasing levels of disease-causing bacteria in the intestine, relieving constipation and reducing the risk of colon cancer,\" Mercedes Lopez, of the National Polytechnic Institute in Guanajuato, said in the news release.\n\nPrevious research has also suggested that fructans stimulate the growth of beneficial bacteria in the large intestine in a way that increases the body's absorption of minerals, including calcium and magnesium, which are needed for bone growth.\n\nIn this study, Lopez and colleagues tested the effects of agave fructans on bone growth in mice.

The study is published today by The Lancet. Unlike the more common obstructive sleep apnea, in which the airway partially collapses and causes pauses in breathing, central sleep apnea (CSA) occurs when the brain fails to control breathing during sleep.\n\n\"CSA is a serious concern because it affects about a third of people with heart failure and it's known to make the condition worse,\" Abraham said. \"Currently, we don't have good treatments available. Positive airway pressure devices have been used, but many patients don't tolerate them well and a recent study showed them to be harmful.\"\n\nAbraham, along with lead author Dr. Maria Rosa Costanzo at Advocate Heart Institute in Naperville, IL, led the study at 31 hospitals in the United States, Germany and Poland. The research team tested the safety and effectiveness of a transvenous phrenic nerve stimulator made by Respicardia Inc. Much like a pacemaker, it sends a regular signal telling the diaphragm to breathe during sleep.\n\nIn the randomized study, 151 patients were implanted with the device. Ten were excluded due to non-study related medical issues or deaths, exiting the study or missing visits. During the first six months of evaluation, 68 devices were activated for treatment, while 73 were left inactive as the control group. Between six and 12 months of follow-up, all patients received the neurostimulation treatment.\n\nAt the six month evaluation, the device reduced CSA events per hour by half or more for 35 of the 68 members (51 percent) of the treatment group. Only eight (11 percent) of those in the control group achieved the same reduction. Other important sleep measures, such as the amount of time spent with a low blood oxygen level, were also significantly improved. About a third of patients in the treatment group reported therapy-related discomfort that was resolved with some reprogramming of the device.\n\n\"Not only did we see this reduction in events per hour, the patients also rated themselves better on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (meaning they were less sleepy during the day) and on a global assessment of their overall quality of life,\" Abraham said. \"This tells us the effects of neurostimulation are clinically relevant and this could be a promising therapy for those with central sleep apnea.\"\n\nIn addition to Abraham, Ohio State's Dr. Rami Khayat and Dr. Ralph Augostini participated in this research, making Ohio State one of the high enrolling centers participating in the study worldwide.\n\nThe study was funded by Respicardia.

The results, based upon nearly 3 million people with ADHD in the United States, are reported in the American Journal of Psychiatry.\n\n\"This study contributes to growing evidence that ADHD medication is linked to lower risk for many types of harmful behavior, including substance abuse,\" said Patrick D. Quinn, a postdoctoral researcher in the IU Bloomington College of Arts and Sciences' Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, who led the study. \"The results also highlight the importance of careful diagnosis and compliance with treatment.\"\n\nAs one of the largest analyses on the risks and benefits of ADHD medication, the study drew on anonymous health care data from 146 million people with employer-based health insurance in the United States from 2005 to 2014.\n\nSpecifically, the researchers mined the data to identify people with ADHD whose records showed periods of ADHD medication use and periods without ADHD medication use -- as well as one or more visits to the emergency room due to drug or alcohol use. They then calculated the odds of the visits occurring during the person's use of ADHD medication versus the same person's non-use of ADHD medication.\n\n\"Many factors can influence who receives ADHD treatment, including socioeconomic factors, health care access, the strength of support networks and disorder severity,\" Quinn said. \"Although no single study of real-world treatment practices can definitively show whether medication use lowers risk, studying the same people at different points in their medical history helps us control for these factors and isolate the role of medication in their behavior.\"\n\nOf the nearly 3 million people with ADHD in the study's database, about 57 percent experienced periods in which they were and were not prescribed medication to treat the disorder. About 2 percent experienced an emergency room visit due to substance abuse. The median age of the study's participants was 21 for men and 28 for women.\n\nThe majority of the ADHD medicines used in the study were stimulants such as Adderall, an amphetamine, and Ritalin, or methylphenidate. A significantly smaller number used nonstimulant ADHD medication such as Strattera, or atomoxetine.\n\n\"While concerns about prescribing medications to treat ADHD that have the potential for abuse are understandable, this study provides further evidence that the use of these medications is not associated with increased risk of substance use problems in adolescence or adulthood,\" Quinn said. \"Rather, this and other recent studies find that the risk of such problems is lower during and after periods of use of these medications.\"\n\nQuinn is a member of the lab of Brian M.

The results were especially dramatic for men who had prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels above .07 ng/ml when they started the trial. (While that is a relatively low level for most men, PSA levels should be close to zero after a prostatectomy.) Men with medium-grade tumors and those who may not have had their entire cancer removed during surgery also survived significantly longer if they received the drug.\n\nHowever, See and Shipley both noted that looking at those subsets of patients was not what the study was initially designed to do, which limits the statistical power of those conclusions. More research will be needed to confirm which men benefit most from taking the drug.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to treat a patient if he doesn\u2019t need to be treated,\u201d Shipley said.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "We didn\u2019t find any evidence of reliance on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Many more stroke victims than previously thought can be saved from disability or death if doctors remove blood clots that are choking off circulation to the brain, a new study has shown.\n\n\u201cThese striking results will have an immediate impact and save people from lifelong disability or death,\u201d Dr. Walter J.

(1)\n\nThis paper emphasized that overall diet quality, rather than individual foods, may have a greater impact on reducing risk of physical function impairments. Specifically, diet quality traits most associated with reduced rates of incident physical impairment were higher intake of fruits and vegetables; lower intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, trans fat, and sodium; and moderate alcohol intake. Among food components, the strongest relations were found for increased intakes of oranges, orange juice, apples, pears, romaine or leaf lettuce, and walnuts.\n\n\"There's a lot of research that looks at specific health conditions in aging, such as diabetes and heart disease, but less attention to research on quality of life and ability to maintain independence with aging,\" said Dr. Francine Grodstein, ScD, professor of medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. \"The simple message from this study is that eating an overall healthy diet, including certain foods, such as walnuts and other whole foods, may help women with the ability to do key everyday tasks as they age, like carrying groceries or dressing themselves.\"\n\nThe researchers looked at data from 54,762 women in the Nurses' Health Study, which tracked women for over 30 years. Between 1992 and 2008, the women were asked questions about their physical function, including their ability to perform basic activities of daily living. This new paper prospectively examined the association between the dietary habits of the participants and subsequent impairment in physical function. Diet was assessed using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI-2010), a measure of diet quality that incorporates foods and nutrients predictive of chronic disease risk based on scientific evidence.\n\n\"These results add to the large body of evidence that outline the many benefits of a healthy diet for women. Additional research is needed to better understand how diet and lifestyle choices can help maintain our health and well-being as we age,\" said Dr. Grodstein.\n\nThere are numerous possible active properties in walnuts that may be contributing factors in providing health benefits. Walnuts are unique among nuts in that they are primarily composed of polyunsaturated fat (13 grams per ounce), which includes alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), the plant-based omega-3 fatty acid. They are the only nut to contain a significant amount of ALA with 2.5 grams per one ounce serving.\n\nSome study limitations should be considered. The sample only included women, so these results may not be generalizable to men. Additionally, participants were not assigned to eat walnuts or other foods, and were just asked about their dietary choices. It is also possible that subjects may have misreported their dietary intake since this information was collected by questionnaires. In addition, because this is an observational study, residual confounding cannot be ruled out (i.e. that other lifestyle habits which are more common in adults who eat walnuts could contribute to the study findings); and, thus, the results should be interpreted with caution.\n\nThis research was supported in part by the California Walnut Commission (CWC). The CWC has supported health-related research on walnuts for more than 25 years. While the CWC does provide funds and/or walnuts for various projects, the actual studies are conducted independently by researchers who design the experiments, interpret the results and write the manuscripts.\n\nThe California Walnut Commission, established in 1987, is funded by mandatory assessments of the growers. The Commission is an agency of the State of California that works in concurrence with the Secretary of the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA).

For one thing, it can be the factor that sends someone to get a genetic test in the first place. For another, people in many parts of the world don\u2019t have access to genetic tests at all.\n\nThat\u2019s inspired years of effort to train a computer to do the same thing. Software that analyzes a patient\u2019s face for signs of disease could help clinicians better diagnose and treat people with genetic syndromes.\n\nSome older attempts at facial analysis relied on large, clunky scanners \u2014 a tool better suited to a lab, not the field. Now, in the era of smartphones, such efforts have a whole new promise. Face2Gene, a program developed by Boston-based startup FDNA, has a mobile app that clinicians can use to snap photos of their patients and get a list of syndromes they might have.\n\nMeanwhile, Muenke and his colleagues at the NIH last month published an important advance: the ability to diagnose disease in a non-Caucasian face.\n\nIt\u2019s a promising preliminary sign. But if facial recognition software is to be widely useful for diagnoses, software developers and geneticists will need to work together to overcome genetics\u2019 systemic blind spots.\n\nThe algorithms in general work on the same principles: measuring the size of facial features and their placement to detect patterns. They\u2019re both trained on databases of photographs doctors take of their patients. The NIH works with partners around the world to collect their photos; FDNA accepts photos uploaded to Face2Gene.\n\nBut they differ in a key way: Whereas the algorithm the NIH uses can predict if someone has a given genetic disorder, the Face2Gene algorithm spits out not diagnoses, but probabilities. The app describes photos as being a certain percent similar to photos of people with one of the 2,000 disorders for which Face2Gene has image data, based on the overall \u201clook\u201d of the face as well as the presence of certain features. However, the app won\u2019t give clinicians a yes or no answer to the question of, \u201cDoes my patient have a genetic disorder?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s intentional. Face2Gene is meant to be more like a search engine for diseases \u2014 a means to an end.\n\n\u201cWe are not a diagnostic tool, and we will never be a diagnostic tool,\u201d said FDNA CEO Dekel Gelbman.\n\nDrawing that bright line between Face2Gene and \u201ca diagnostic tool\u201d allows FDNA to stay compliant with FDA regulations governing mobile medical apps while avoiding some of the regulatory burden associated with smartphone-based diagnostic tools.\n\nThe algorithm the NIH uses \u2014 developed by scientists at Children\u2019s National Health System in Washington, D.C., \u2014 seems to work pretty well so far: In 129 cases of Down syndrome, it accurately detected the disorder 94 percent of the time. For DiGeorge syndrome, the numbers were even higher: It had a 95 percent accuracy rate across all 156 cases.\n\nFace2Gene declined to provide similar numbers for their technology. \u201cSince Face2Gene is a search and reference informational tool, the terms sensitivity and specificity are difficult to apply to our output,\u201d Gelbman cautioned.\n\nBut there\u2019s one big stumbling block for both of them, a problem that has dogged medical genetics for decades: Data for non-white populations is sorely lacking.\n\n\u201cIn every single textbook, the ones we had [when I trained] in Germany and the major textbooks here in the US, there are photos of individuals of northern European descent,\u201d Muenke said. \u201cWhen I told this to my boss, he said there have to be atlases for children from diverse backgrounds. And there aren\u2019t. There just aren\u2019t.\u201d (Today there is that resource, based on Muenke and the NIH\u2019s work.)\n\nSo diagnosing diseases from a face alone presents an additional challenge in countries where the majority of the population isn\u2019t of northern European descent, because some facial areas that vary with ethnic background can often overlap with areas that signify a genetic disorder. Eventually, the software will also have to be able to tackle people with mixed ethnic backgrounds, too. \u201cWe have thought about it but haven\u2019t gone there yet,\u201d Muenke said.\n\nFor example, children with Down syndrome often have flat nasal bridges \u2014 as do typically developing African or African-American children. Across different races and ethnicities of children there were only two reliable identifiers that could be used to diagnose Down syndrome \u2014 the angles between landmark points on the child\u2019s nose and eye, according to a paper Muenke and Marius Linguraru at Children\u2019s National published with their colleagues earlier this year. All of the other \u201ctypical\u201d features weren\u2019t significantly more likely to show up when children were compared to ethnically matched controls.\n\nIn fact, using a Caucasian face as a reference can sometimes be the least representative choice. \u201cOne of the findings that I\u2019m very interested in [in] our recent study was that the population that we found to be most different from the others, in terms of facial patterns characteristic of DiGeorge syndrome, was the Caucasian population,\u201d Linguraru said.\n\nTo continue to fix this problem, both the NIH and Face2Gene need help from more researchers who can upload more patients\u2019 faces \u2014 but that\u2019s easier said than done. Confirming a suspected disorder with genetic tests is standard practice today, and there are no genetic labs based in Africa registered in the NIH\u2019s Genetic Testing Registry. Asia and South America are also relatively underserved.\n\nThose numbers also reflect the general patterns of distribution for medical geneticists. \u201cMost practitioners are located in North America and Europe,\u201d Gelbman said. Nigeria, for example, doesn\u2019t have a single medical geneticist in the entire country.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that might change, with time and effort. In addition to his work as a researcher, Muenke directs a program that brings health care professionals from developing countries to the US for a month-long crash course in medical genetics. (The program is funded by the NIH\u2019s Fogarty International Center; President Trump eliminated funding for the center in his 2018 \u201cskinny\u201d budget proposal announced in March.)\n\nFor now, both algorithms have shown that they can handle a diverse patient set. FDNA scientists published a paper in January showing that their algorithm could better identify Down syndrome after being trained with a more diverse set of faces, and Muenke and Linguraru have also published papers this year demonstrating their algorithm\u2019s ability to identify genetic disorders correctly in children across a variety of ethnic backgrounds.\n\nAs both groups work on recruiting more researchers, they are also working to push their tech forward. FDNA is working on establishing partnerships with pharmaceutical companies to start their commercial outreach. In theory, these partnerships could contribute to precision medicine efforts or help companies develop new therapies for rare diseases.\n\nMeanwhile, Linguraru has his eyes on eventual FDA approval for the algorithm the NIH has used. The ultimate goal would be a simple tool that any doctor could use anywhere to get fast results and better diagnose their patients.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "TUESDAY, Aug. 16, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental drug appears to reduce the risk of bone fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis better than a placebo and the currently available drug, a new study finds.\n\nIn this phase 3 trial funded by the drug's maker, Radius Health, fewer women on the injectable drug abaloparatide had spine fractures (0.58 percent) than women receiving a placebo (4.22 percent) and slightly fewer than those taking a similar injectable drug, teriparatide (Forteo) (0.84 percent).\n\n\"If this gets approved, and there is no reason to think it won't, this will be the second drug available for the treatment of high-risk osteoporosis,\" said lead researcher Dr. Paul Miller of the Colorado Center for Bone Research.\n\nForteo has been in use for the past 16 years, he said. Abaloparatide works differently from Forteo and improves bone density more than Forteo, Miller said.\n\nWomen taking abaloparatide also had fewer other types of fractures (2.7 percent) than those who got a placebo (4.7 percent) and slightly fewer than those on Forteo (3.3 percent), the researchers found.\n\nMiller said many spine fractures are painless. Patients are often unaware they have happened until a doctor measures their height and finds they are up to an inch shorter than before, he said.\n\nAbaloparatide and Forteo are synthetic peptides that help grow and strengthen bone, Miller said.\n\nAlong with building bone density, they are the only ones that increase bone quality, he said. \"Bone quality is an important aspect of bone strength -- the ability to withstand a break,\" Miller said.\n\nHe predicts that when abaloparatide is on the market, it will compete with Forteo, driving down the price of both drugs.\n\n\"I am hoping that having a second drug available, that it will help reduce the cost,\" he said. \"Forteo costs about $2,500 a month if you don't have insurance.\" Even if a patient is insured, monthly copays can range from $30 to $400. Forteo is covered by Medicare, Miller said.\n\nThe report was published Aug. 16 in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nA study based on 2010 U.S. Census data estimated that more than 3 million women between the ages of 50 and 69 have osteoporosis. A 60-year-old woman has a 44 percent lifetime risk of fracture due to low bone density.\n\nFor the study, Miller and colleagues randomly assigned nearly 2,500 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to receive daily injections of abaloparatide, Forteo or a placebo for 18 months. Their average age was 69.\n\nAmong the nearly 2,000 women who completed the trial, increases in bone mineral density were greater with abaloparatide than placebo, the researchers found.\n\nIn addition, fewer cases of hypercalcemia (abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood) occurred among women taking abaloparatide (3 percent) than Forteo (6 percent). Hypercalcemia can weaken bones, cause kidney stones and interfere with heart and brain function.\n\nThere were no differences among the groups in other serious side effects, such as nausea and heart palpations, Miller said.\n\nDr. Caroline Messer, director of the Center for Pituitary and Neuroendocrine Disorders at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, is eager for further research. There needs to be a large head-to-head trial between Forteo and abaloparatide, she said, to really see which drug is better.\n\n\"Everybody is going to want to know if this is inferior or superior to Forteo,\" she said, adding that this is an early study. \"It shows more bone building and fewer fractures than Forteo, but whether it will replace that drug is still up in the air.\"\n\nAn editorial accompanying the study said which drug is selected may be less important than identifying and starting an approved treatment.\n\n\"The bar is high for any preventive treatment -- in the efforts to prevent a fracture that may or may not ever occur, prescribers do not want to prescribe a therapy that causes a new problem. The way forward for fracture prevention involves not only the development of better therapies . . . and easier delivery systems, but also improved adoption of existing osteoporosis therapies for patients with prior fractures and minimization of adverse effects, particularly those associated with long-term use,\" the editorial said.\n\nThe editorial was co-written by Dr. Anne Cappola of the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, associate editor of JAMA, and Dr. Dolores Shoback of the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nTo learn more about osteoporosis, visit the American College of Rheumatology.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not appear to rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "It\u2019s notoriously hard to treat depression in kids\u2014the antidepressants we rely on to treat adults seem to be less effective and more dangerous when used on younger minds. New research out of Oxford helps confirm this and then some: The researchers\u2019 meta-analysis on how commercially available antidepressants compare with a placebo showed that just one of the 14 antidepressants examined was significantly better than a placebo in treating depression in children and adolescents.\n\nThe only drug to pass the test was fluoxetine, sold in the U.S. under the trade name Prozac. It outperformed all other antidepressants in both efficacy and tolerability, a term that researchers use to mean how often patients had to quit the drug due to negative side effects.\n\nProzac is also the only antidepressant approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat depression in people under 18. That\u2019s because the FDA has deemed that Prozac has demonstrated benefits that outweigh one of the suspected downsides of antidepressants in kids and teens: disrupting brain development. Dr. Andrea Cipriani, psychiatrist and lead author on the study, says these are concerns that practicing psychiatrists confront daily. \u201cFrom a clinical point of view, we tend to be very cautious when prescribing medication to children and adolescents because of the unknown effects on the developing brain,\u201d he said.\n\nThere\u2019s good reason for this. Researchers have long worried about the effects of psychoactive drugs on people whose brains are still developing. Back in 2004, researchers at Harvard Medical School released a study that sought to answer questions about the safety of certain drugs and chemicals, including antidepressants, in adolescents. The study, which used rats in lieu of human children, found evidence that reward pathways are severely altered following exposure to drugs that affect the brain. Research on how antidepressants actually affect human children\u2019s brain development is extremely hard to come by, given the limited numbers of actual children on antidepressants and the complications of gaining consent to study them. But other research on antidepressants suggest they negatively affect brain plasticity and memory\u2014something that would be problematic while the brain is still developing.\n\nAnd there\u2019s another major problem with the use of many antidepressants in children: They may increase suicidal thoughts and behavior. Since 2004, the FDA has advised that antidepressants not be prescribed to individuals under 24 due to the increased risk in suicidality, especially during the early phases of treatment. Dr. Mina Fazel, child psychiatrist at the Oxford University Children\u2019s Hospital, says, \u201cIt\u2019s complicated, because you\u2019re giving antidepressants when you\u2019re very worried about that young person\u2019s mood.\u201d Essentially, the moment when it seems most necessary to prescribe the drugs may also be the moment when the patient is most at risk of suicide. Untangling this cause and effect has thus far eluded researchers, though there is some evidence to suggest that antidepressants spark a chemical reaction in the brain that does in fact increase the risk of suicide. So far, the FDA is erring on the side of caution.\n\nA comment attached to the Oxford paper, written by Dr. Jon Jureidini, a child psychiatrist at the Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital in Adelaide, Australia, goes even further in decrying the use of antidepressants in kids. \u201cOnly if the discounted benefit outweighs the boosted harm should the treatment be prescribed,\u201d he writes. \u201cFor antidepressants in adolescents, this equation will rarely favor prescribing; in younger children, almost never.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, Jureidini believes there is almost never a justification for prescribing antidepressants to children or adolescents. I called him to be sure. \u201cThey\u2019re not better than nothing,\u201d he said, \u201cand there\u2019s quite clear evidence that they\u2019re more dangerous than nothing.\u201d He arrived at this conclusion after applying the customary dose of skepticism doctors are taught to apply when translating research findings to clinical practice.\n\nHis wariness of antidepressants being prescribed for kids, Prozac included, is further bolstered by the theory that these drugs don\u2019t work well in children because they weren\u2019t designed for children. They were designed for adults, and adults have very different physiological states than adolescents.\n\nThe Oxford paper notes that 3 percent of children ages 6-12 and nearly 6 percent of teenagers ages 13-18 suffered from major depressive disorder, the psychiatric term for what is colloquially known as depression. Given the U.S. population, that works out to more than a million children and adolescents. The disease manifests differently in kids: Whereas adults might report feeling apathetic, unmotivated, unfocused, and just plain sad, children with this disorder tend to be irritable and aggressive and as a result have trouble navigating social situations with adults and peers. That means that one of the first battles in treating depression in kids is recognizing it in the first place. Of course, having an effective intervention once it is recognized would help.\n\nIf there\u2019s an upside to be found in how ineffective antidepressants likely are for kids, it\u2019s that pharmacological solutions are not the recommended first line of defense, anyway. Guidelines from the psychiatric associations in most countries recommend that doctors first try psychotherapy, or \u201ctalk therapy,\u201d which is has been shown to work, at least by participants\u2019 own assessment of their depression levels (it\u2019s very hard to test therapy against a placebo, for obvious reasons). Methods such as cognitive behavioral therapy, in which psychiatrists help patients overcome destructive behaviors and thought patterns, and interpersonal therapy, which focuses more on the effect depression has on relationships, seem to be equally effective in treating depression, particularly in adolescents. Of course, this is a high-cost intervention in terms of both dollars and time invested, and it may not always be readily available\u2014but the upside is that there is no reason to believe it is harmful.\n\nLike in nearly all areas of science, biomedical or otherwise, our understanding is limited, and further research is required to find out more about both potential treatment options. Adolescent depression is particularly difficult, since gaining consent to study interventions in children is more complicated than it is in adults. If we are to answer these big unknowns regarding the safety of antidepressants in young patients (critical, because therapy and medication are more effective together than in isolation), we need more data.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not appear to rely solely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Compared with the 35 stroke patients who got clot-dissolving medicine alone, the 35 who got the two-pronged treatment were nearly twice as likely to regain some neurological function after three days.

Kale and oranges are high in vitamin C, another antioxidant.\n\nMORE: Mediterranean Diet With Olive Oil Linked to Lower Breast Cancer Risk\n\n\u201cThis study underscores the importance of what a young girl eats for her future health,\u201d says Farvid. \u201cThis study also has an important message for schools and the need to provide students with the opportunity to consume more fruits and vegetables as part of the school meal program.\u201d\n\nFarvid wasn\u2019t able to document a strong relationship between vegetables and lower breast cancer risk, but says that may be because the study wasn\u2019t powered enough to detect an effect.\n\nThe findings are among the first to look at how diet during adolescence can affect health later, and highlights the importance of establishing healthy habits from a young age, especially since many of the chronic diseases occur over many years and get rooted early in life.\n\nThe results also underscore the importance of eating whole fruit, rather than fruit juice. In the study, Farvid and her team could not find any significant relationship between fruit juice and breast cancer risk; that may be because fruit\u2019s anti-cancer effects may have to do with the fiber found in the whole fruit, which is stripped out of juice. In the latest Dietary Guidelines for Americans, however, government nutritionists equated servings of whole fruit with fruit juice. \u201cWe recommend whole fruit and not fruit juice,\u201d says Farvid, \u201cbecause maybe one of the most important ways that fruit decreases risk of breast cancer is through fiber, and even natural fruit juice often has no fiber in it.\u201d\n\nIn another study also published in the , a separate group of researchers found that among 22,000 Danish women, those who added two alcoholic drinks a day on average increased their risk of developing breast cancer by 30% over five years. The added risk of cancer, however, was counterbalanced by a lower risk of heart disease.\n\nTaken together, the results show how critical diet can be in modulating risk of breast cancer. While challenging, changing diet can be a relatively easy way to alter a woman\u2019s breast cancer risk equation, beginning even at a young age.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "This is a close one, since the story is very similar to a release from BMJ.

They're all temporary means of birth control -- devices you have to keep ingesting or inserting. Even the IUD can't stay in place for more than 10 years.\n\nThe only once-and-be-done-with-it option for women has been tubal ligation (\"tying the tubes\") -- surgery that renders a woman sterile. Now a procedure called Essure, recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, gives women an alternative. The nonsurgical approach uses a hysteroscope -- a camera-tipped instrument -- to thread two small wires through the vagina, cervix and uterus and into the fallopian tubes. The wires, composed of polyester fibers and metals, cause inflammation and, over time, scar tissue that blocks the fallopian tubes, preventing sperm from reaching eggs. Women can undergo the procedure in 35 minutes in their doctor's office, under local anesthesia; they are advised to rest for 24 to 48 hours before resuming normal activity. Essure is 99.8 percent effective in preventing pregnancy -- a rate similar to that of tubal ligation, according to the manufacturer, Conceptus Inc. of Mountain View, Calif.\n\nPros and Cons Ellen Whitaker, a gynecologist at the Washington Hospital Center, says \"the biggest advantage\" of Essure is that it involves no incisions or general anesthesia, which both carry risks. By going through the vagina, she says, you \"avoid all the organs in the abdomen.\" In a tubal ligation, she says, \"there's always the possibility of bowel injury, bladder injury . . . which can be very serious.\"\n\nThe biggest drawback, Whitaker says, is the need for X-rays three months after the procedure to confirm the fallopian tubes are blocked. Until then, the patient must use another form of birth control.\n\nSide effects may include pain, cramps and mild bleeding or spotting. There is the risk of infection or a puncture of the vagina or uterus while inserting the hysteroscope. As with tubal ligation, there is also an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy -- a pregnancy that develops outside the uterus.\n\nOne for the Guys Men, too, have an option for a faster, less painful procedure than vasectomy to tie the vas deferens -- the tubes that carry sperm from the testicles to the penis. In the increasingly popular \"no-scalpel vasectomy,\" a doctor uses an instrument called a dissecting forceps to poke a very small hole in the skin of the testicles to reach the vas deferens. There is very little bleeding, and no stitches are needed to close the tiny openings (one on each side). The procedure is very effective (there is less than a 1 percent chance the man's partner will get pregnant) and takes about 10 minutes to perform in the doctor's office.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "There is no way to know if the story relied on a press release as the sole source of information.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "Many people who attempt suicide end up in an emergency room for immediate treatment. But few of those suicide survivors get the follow-up care they need at a time when they are especially likely to attempt suicide again.\n\nNow, a study shows that a simple intervention conducted by staff in emergency departments can reduce the risk of future attempts. The intervention involves creating a safety plan for each patient and following up with phone calls after discharge.\n\n\"It reduced the odds of suicidal behavior by half,\" says Barbara Stanley, a psychologist at Columbia University and the lead author of the study. \"That's a phenomenal difference.\"\n\nThe study, which was published Wednesday in JAMA Psychiatry, included 1,200 patients at five Veterans Affairs hospitals around the country. The findings offer a way for hospitals and clinics to help reduce the rising numbers of death by suicide across the country.\n\n\"When someone goes to the emergency room for a suicide attempt, they are at risk of another suicide attempt for the next three months,\" says Stanley. \"It's like a ticking time bomb.\"\n\nThis is the first large-scale study of the Safety Planning Intervention, which Stanley and her group developed in 2008 and which has been adopted at hospitals and clinics around the country. It can be provided by a physician, a nurse or a social worker and requires very little training.\n\n\"The interesting thing about the Safety Planning Intervention is that it is a relatively brief intervention and can be used in a lot of different [health care] settings,\" says Brian Ahmedani, director of behavioral health research at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, who wasn't involved in the new study.\n\nMany health care systems are starting to think about ways to prevent suicide, he says. That's because, as his own work has shown, almost 83 percent of people who die by suicide make a health care visit in the year before their death. Yet only 50 percent of those people have been diagnosed with a mental illness.\n\nThe intervention studied by Stanley and her group starts in the ER or a clinic, before the suicidal patient is released. First, a health care professional talks with the patient and tries to understand that person's warning signs for a suicide attempt.\n\n\"If they've grappled with being suicidal, they know what their warning signs are,\" says Stanley. For example, she says, someone might say, \" 'I find that I'm staying in my room, not answering the phone, not answering texts, not answering emails.' That could be a warning sign.\" Others might have repeated thoughts that they're not worthy.\n\nThe next step is for the patient \u2014 with help from the clinician \u2014 to come up with a set of coping strategies to help get through moments of intense suicidal ideation.\n\nFor most people, this intense state only lasts from a few minutes to a couple of hours, she says.\n\nThe coping strategy could be something as simple as playing video games, watching TV or talking to a loved one.\n\nIf people contemplating suicide can distract themselves with something they enjoy doing, they can bypass that narrow window during which suicidal thoughts can overpower them, notes Stanley. \"For suicidal people, the passage of time is their friend,\" she says.\n\nThe provider also tries to persuade patients to remove or distance themselves from their means of suicide. For example, if they own a gun, they should lock it away or give it to someone who can keep it away from them. \"If you make it really hard to use whatever means you were going to use, time passes and you give a chance for suicidal thoughts to subside,\" she says.\n\nSafety planning includes follow-up phone calls with the patient \u2014 the first call is made within 72 hours of being discharged from the ER. The provider asks the patient how the safety plan is being used and helps revise it if needed. The provider also makes sure the patient sees a mental health care provider for long-term care. A provider keeps calling until the patient has had a second appointment with a therapist or counselor.\n\nThat follow-up is key, says Julie Goldstein Grumet, a psychologist at the Zero Suicide Institute at the Education Development Center, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit.\n\n\"People often fall off and they don't follow up on their referrals,\" she says. \"And the times during these transitions from acute care settings is one of the highest risk times of suicides.\"\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, Stanley's team looked at five VA emergency departments across the country that used it and compared the outcomes with four VA emergency rooms that simply discharge patients after stabilizing them.\n\nAmong the nearly 1,200 people who received the intervention, half as many people had made suicide attempts (or had come very close) as those in the control group. In other words, the intervention had nearly halved the risk of suicide in the six months after discharge. Two-thirds of the people in the treatment group had used their safety plans, and they were also twice as likely to get follow-up mental health treatment when compared with the control group.\n\n\"The study is incredibly important ... because it shows brief interventions work,\" says Goldstein Grumet.\n\nRick, a father in Missouri, says a safety plan may have saved his 12-year-old daughter's life. (NPR is leaving off his last name to protect his daughter's privacy.)\n\nIn September 2017, she came very close to taking her own life. When he found out about this from her school principal the next day, Rick rushed her to the ER at Mercy Hospital Jefferson. \"The whole process was overwhelming, because you have your 12-year-old who's wanting to end her life,\" Rick says. \"And she'd not shared any of that with us.\"\n\nThe hospital wasn't part of the new study but was also using a safety planning intervention as part of its efforts to prevent suicides.\n\n\"The crisis counselor did such an amazing job of setting up a safety plan that my daughter felt comfortable with,\" he says.\n\nHe says his daughter didn't want to talk to him or her mother about her struggles, but she agreed to communicate with them in other ways. During times when she felt her urge to take her own life coming back, she agreed to watch TV with her mother or call or text her father.\n\nRick says she usually sends a specific emoji when she is having a bad day. And he responds by distracting her with something completely different.\n\nHe says she also agreed to use a crisis help line if things escalated.\n\n\"It was something that she could follow through with,\" he says. \"It gave her some confidence and it gave me some confidence.\"\n\nHe says the plan has helped his daughter get through her suicidal phase and even slowly open up to her parents.\n\n\"That's what is so powerful about a safety plan,\" says Ahmedani. \"The patient is the author of their safety plan, but it's guided by a provider.\"\n\nAs part of the 2012 National Strategy For Suicide Prevention, many health care providers have adopted the approaches to prevention outlined in the Zero Suicide Initiative, which includes safety planning based on previous evidence showing it works.\n\nWhile safety planning has begun to be used across the country, it ought to be adopted universally, says Goldstein Grumet.\n\n\"It is a brief intervention that hospital workers, primary care staff, outpatient behavioral health, can all be trained in to utilize,\" she says.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story did not appear to rely on the news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Two drugs already on the market \u2014 an antifungal and a steroid \u2014 may potentially take on new roles as treatments for multiple sclerosis. According to a study published in Nature today, researchers discovered that these drugs may activate stem cells in the brain to stimulate myelin producing cells and repair white matter, which is damaged in multiple sclerosis. The study was partially funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), part of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nSpecialized cells called oligodendrocytes lay down multiple layers of a fatty white substance known as myelin around axons, the long \u201cwires\u201d that connect brain cells. Myelin acts as an insulator and enables fast communication between brain cells. In multiple sclerosis there is breakdown of myelin and this deterioration leads to muscle weakness, numbness and problems with vision, coordination and balance.\n\n\u201cTo replace damaged cells, the scientific field has focused on direct transplantation of stem cell-derived tissues for regenerative medicine, and that approach is likely to provide enormous benefit down the road. We asked if we could find a faster and less invasive approach by using drugs to activate native nervous system stem cells and direct them to form new myelin. Our ultimate goal was to enhance the body\u2019s ability to repair itself,\u201d said Paul J. Tesar, Ph.D., associate professor at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine in Cleveland, and senior author of the study.\n\nIt is unknown how myelin-producing cells are damaged, but research suggests they may be targeted by malfunctioning immune cells and that multiple sclerosis may start as an autoimmune disorder. Current therapies for multiple sclerosis include anti-inflammatory drugs, which help prevent the episodic relapses common in multiple sclerosis, but are less effective at preventing long-term disability. Scientists believe that therapies that promote myelin repair might improve neurologic disability in people with multiple sclerosis.\n\nAdult brains contain oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), which are stem cells that generate myelin-producing cells. OPCs are found to multiply in the brains of multiple sclerosis patients as if to respond to myelin damage, but for unknown reasons they are not effective in restoring white matter. In the current study, Dr. Tesar wanted to see if drugs already approved for other uses were able to stimulate OPCs to increase myelination.\n\nOPCs have been difficult to isolate and study, but Dr. Tesar and his colleagues, in collaboration with Robert Miller, Ph.D., professor at George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C., developed a novel method to investigate these cells in a petri dish. Using this technique, they were able to quickly test the effects of hundreds of drugs on the stem cells.\n\nThe compounds screened in this study were obtained from a drug library maintained by NIH\u2019s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS). All are approved for use in humans. NCATS and Dr. Tesar have an ongoing collaboration and plan to expand the library of drugs screened against OPCs in the near future to identify other promising compounds.\n\nDr. Tesar\u2019s team found that two compounds in particular, miconazole (an antifungal) and clobetasol (a steroid), stimulated mouse and human OPCs into generating myelin-producing cells.\n\nNext, they examined whether the drugs, when injected into a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, could improve re-myelination. They found that both drugs were effective in activating OPCs to enhance myelination and reverse paralysis. As a result, almost all of the animals regained the use of their hind limbs. They also found that the drugs acted through two very different molecular mechanisms.\n\n\u201cThe ability to activate white matter cells in the brain, as shown in this study, opens up an exciting new avenue of therapy development for myelin disorders such as multiple sclerosis,\u201d said Ursula Utz, Ph.D., program director at the NINDS.\n\nDr. Tesar and his colleagues caution that more research is needed before miconazole and clobetasol can be tested in multiple sclerosis clinical trials. They are currently approved for use as creams or powders on the surfaces of the body but their safety administered in other forms, such as injections, in humans is unknown.\n\n\u201cOff-label use of the current forms of these drugs is more likely to increase other health concerns than alleviate multiple sclerosis symptoms. We are working tirelessly to ready a safe and effective drug for clinical use,\u201d Dr. Tesar said.\n\nThis work was supported by the NINDS (NS085246, NS030800, NS026543), the New York Stem Cell Foundation and the Myelin Repair Foundation, New York City.\n\nThe NINDS is the nation\u2019s leading funder of research on the brain and nervous system.

Fielding, senior scientist and director of the Nutrition, Exercise Physiology, and Sarcopenia Laboratory at the USDA HNRCA.\n\nFor the LIFE study, the researchers analyzed data from 1,635 men and women age 70-89 over an average of 2.6 years. Half were randomly assigned to a program of walking and walking-based strength, flexibility and balance training; half participated in health education workshops. All had low levels of physical functioning at the start and reported fewer than 20 minutes per week of regular physical activity in the month prior to starting the study. Participants were evaluated at baseline, six, 12, and 24 months. The researchers relied on movement monitors and self-reporting to measure physical activity outside study sessions.\n\nChanges in activity were significantly greater in the physical activity intervention group than the health education group from baseline through 24 months. There was a continuous, graded effect with the greatest benefits seen in the participants who engaged in at least 48 minutes of physical activity per week. The greater differences were also associated with prevention of major mobility loss.\n\n\"Our goal was to have participants walking up to 150 minutes per week. To see benefits at 48 minutes is encouraging. We wanted the physical activity sessions to include exercise that participants could do outside of the study, and we hope that learning of these results might motivate others to try to make safe, incremental changes to their activity levels.

The anticipated cost of the vaccine, administered in three shots over six months, is $300 to $500, a possible impediment to widespread vaccination campaigns.\n\nGardisil is likely to be approved in early June, After that, the vaccine will move into the hands of the Centers for Disease Control, which will have to decide if it should be a mandatory vaccine or just a recommended vaccine, CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Kaledin reports.\n\nThe drug protects against the two types of human papillomavirus (HPV) believed responsible for about 70 percent of cervical cancer cases. The vaccine also protects against two other virus types that cause 90 percent of genital wart cases. All four virus types are sexually transmitted.\n\nHowever, this vaccine should not be considered a replacement for the standard screening test: the pap smear, adds Kaledin.\n\nThe FDA is not required to follow the recommendations of its outside panels of experts, but usually does. An agency decision is expected by June 8.\n\nHPV is the most common sexually transmitted disease. It affects more than 50 percent of sexually active adults. The cervical cancer it can cause kills each year about 290,000 women worldwide, including 3,500 women in the United States, where regular pap smears often detect precancerous lesions and early cancer.\n\n\"This is certainly a wonderful, good step in addition to our screening processes\" in helping eradicate cervical cancer, said Dr. Monica Farley, who heads the advisory panel. She is a bacterial infectious disease expert at the Emory University School of Medicine.\n\nAdvocates are recommending the vaccine be given to 11- and 12-year-old girls before they become sexually active, but argue that it is not a license to behave promiscuously, Kaledin reports.\n\nMaking their case for approval, Merck officials suggested that development could make Gardasil the biggest advance in preventing cervical cancer since the pap test.\n\n\"Gardasil has the potential to meet an unmet medical need as the first vaccine to prevent cervical cancer,\" Merck's Dr. Patrick Brill-Edwards told the Vaccine and Related Biological Products advisory committee.\n\nSeveral speakers said the vaccine should not replace screening. Merck said the drug is not intended to do that.\n\n\"We would like to see the FDA mandate some sort of labeling or other mechanism to communicate to health care providers and patients the continued need for regular cervical screening,\" said Amy Allina, program director of the National Women's Health Network.\n\nMerck said the vaccine could be used in females age 9 to 26, but would work best when given to girls before they begin having sex.\n\nPending action by the FDA, the national Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will decide in June whether to endorse routine vaccination with the vaccine.\n\nThe committee's HPV vaccine group is recommending giving the vaccine to girls 11 and 12. The 15-member committee of experts who advise the government will consider recommendations for females 13 to 26.\n\nThe committee's HPV vaccine workgroup is recommending the vaccine be given to girls 11 and 12, and the committee will consider recommendations for females 13 to 26.\n\nEarly opposition to Gardasil was based on concerns it could encourage sexual activity in the young. But that largely faded away because of vaccine's potential for reducing cancer.\n\nFDA reviewers said Gardasil appears safe and effective, according to agency documents. One agency reviewer, Dr. Nancy Miller, told the advisory committee that Merck submitted data to support the use of the vaccine in females 9 to 26.\n\nMiller said Gardasil does not necessarily protect against one or more of the four viruses in people already infected before they get the vaccine, and can increase their risk for precursors to cervical cancer.\n\nAlso, the drug does not protect against infection from the many other virus strains not included in the vaccine. In addition, the FDA staff highlighted five cases where children with birth defects were born to women who received the vaccine around the time of conception.\n\nMerck, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., developed the vaccine and tested it in more than 27,000 females and males.\n\nThursday's discussion focused on its use in preventing HPV-related disease in girls and women, including those as young as 9.

The hope is that the devices, now being tested in clinical trials, will save lives, reduce medical expenses and nudge heart patients toward managing their symptoms much the way people with diabetes manage theirs. Patients, who often are frail or live far from their doctors, can be spared frequent office visits. Doctors can learn immediately if devices are malfunctioning or if patients\u2019 hearts are starting to fail.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like having an office visit every day and a complete physical every week,\u201d said Dr. Leslie Saxon, a cardiologist at the University of Southern California.\n\nThe big leap forward came a few years ago when device companies figured out how to make transmitters that send data over a broader range, 20 or 30 feet. That meant that, with her device, Mrs. Elzo did not have to wait till her doctor could put a receiver directly on her chest. Instead, she simply went near a small box, which is attached to a phone jack near her bed. Once a week, she also measures her weight and blood pressure \u2014 key indicators of heart failure \u2014 and that information is automatically transmitted to her doctor. If there are problems, the machine alerts her doctor.\n\n\u201cNow, every single day the device is being queried,\u201d said her doctor, James Coman of the Heart Rhythm Institute in Tulsa. \u201cIt\u2019s just a phenomenal tool.\u201d\n\nThere is a downside, though: \u201cInformation overload is a very serious problem\u201d for the doctors, said Dr. Lynne Warner Stevenson, director of the Heart Failure Program at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston and a professor at Harvard Medical School, who counts herself as a proponent of smart devices. More information, she warned, is not always beneficial.\n\nThe devices transmit useful data along with data whose significance is not clear, like variations in heart rate. Large swings in heart rate can indicate risk, but it is not clear what to do about them.\n\nEven more confusing are changes in thoracic impedance, a measurement of resistance to electric current through the lung. Impedance changes can predict future heart crises, but more often have no clinical explanation. Yet when doctors get data on impedance changes, they often feel uneasy and call patients to see how they are, making patients uneasy in turn, Dr. Stevenson said.\n\nDr. Stevenson likened such information to the game of \u201cJeopardy!\u201d \u2014 doctors are given answers in search of a question. It\u2019s a challenge even for the nation\u2019s 1,000 heart failure specialists. But it can be even harder for primary care doctors, who have less expertise in heart failure yet care for most of the six million patients in the country with the condition.\n\nDr. Richard Page, president of the Heart Rhythm Society, said doctors wonder if they can be held liable if they do not look at all the data. Still, he said, the new technology \u201cis potentially transformative.\u201d\n\nFor researchers the information deluge leads to a different problem: how to analyze the data. A large clinical trial of a cardiac device used to involve 1,000, maybe 2,000 patients. Now, Boston Scientific, a maker of one of the smart heart devices, is following 400,000 patients.\n\n\u201cNo one has ever done research like this before,\u201d said Dr. Saxon, who leads an independent team of academic scientists overseeing Boston Scientific research. The company has no editorial control over the papers the scientists write, Dr. Saxon said.\n\nBoston Scientific gets data from patients\u2019 defibrillators. It also gets information on deaths from Medicare.\n\nThe data are stripped of patient identifiers and analyzed, a task requiring the company to become more like a Google or a Microsoft, handling enormous amounts of information. There are, for example, more than four million recordings of weights and blood pressures and over 60,000 instances when the defibrillators went off, shocking a patient\u2019s heart.\n\nSo far, Dr. Saxon\u2019s group has reported on the first 90,000 patients. Half of them had not been enrolled for remote monitoring and served as a control group.\n\nPatients whose doctors looked at the data survived 5 to 15 percent longer than patients in earlier clinical trials of the devices, Dr. Saxon reported. And, in a paper under review, the group reports that their three-year survival was significantly greater than that of patients in the study whose doctors did not see the data.\n\nOther researchers will be analyzing economic data. The devices can cost as much as $30,000. Do patients with defibrillators make up for some of that expense with fewer hospitalizations or doctor visits?\n\nA study using a similar device, made by Medtronic, suggests that is the case. The Medtronic study, directed by Dr. George Crossley, president of St Thomas Heart at Baptist Hospital in Nashville, involved 2,000 patients randomly assigned to receive a defibrillator that transmitted data or a device that did not transmit. Those with the nontransmitting device were seen in their doctor\u2019s offices every few months, the standard of care.\n\nPatients whose devices transmitted spent less time, on average, in the hospital when they were admitted \u2014 3.3 days compared with 4 days \u2014 and their hospital costs were $1,600 less per admission.\n\n\u201cThe plausible reason, we think, is that we got to these people much sooner in the course of their illness,\u201d Dr. Crossley said. \u201cWe think we did not let the people in the remote sensing group get into heart failure.\u201d\n\nStill, the information overload problem looms. One solution, being tested by St. Jude Medical, a medical device company in St. Paul, is to let patients deal with important data.\n\nThe idea, said Dr. Neal Eigler, a senior vice president at St. Jude, is to get heart patients to adjust their medications regularly based on readings of their heart\u2019s functioning, just as patients with diabetes adjust their insulin based on blood glucose readings.\n\nPatients hold a small device over their chest twice a day, and if they experience symptoms like shortness of breath. It transmits readings of blood pressure in the left atrium \u2014 the upper left chamber of the heart. If pressure in that chamber gets too high, the lungs can fill with fluid.\n\nDoctors preprogram the hand-held device to provide instructions to patients in response to their left atrial pressure measurements, telling them, for example, to take a different dose of a medication, restrict fluid intake, increase their activity level or call the clinic.\n\nIf successful, the smart device could have a big effect. One million patients a year are hospitalized for heart failure. Ninety percent of the time it is because fluid has accumulated in their lungs.\n\nDr. Stevenson, who has no connection with St. Jude, is intrigued. Patients can see what is happening to their own bodies and act accordingly. They have to strictly limit salt in their diet, for example, and seeing their left atrial pressure might be motivating.\n\n\u201cA patient might say, \u2018Maybe my pressure is higher because that pizza I had for dinner last night had a lot of salt,\u2019 \u201d Dr. Stevenson said.\n\nAs a more positive incentive, the device can also instruct patients to decrease their medications if they are doing well.\n\nSt. Jude recently completed a small study of 40 patients and is starting a large clinical trial. In the pilot study, the device reduced the frequency of high atrial pressure readings by two-thirds and the number of hospitalizations by 80 percent over five months.\n\nMeanwhile, patients whose doctors can deal with the data stream from smart devices say they are getting peace of mind.\n\nThey include people like Danielle Denlein, who, to her total shock, developed a serious heart problem.On October 20, 2008, at 1:50 p.m., Ms. Denlein was driving to a drug store to buy formula for her 5-day-old baby girl. Suddenly, she felt a pain in her chest. She thought it was heartburn. Then it began radiating down her arm.\n\n\u201cI just knew \u2014 I don\u2019t know how I knew, but I knew \u2014 I was having a heart attack,\u201d she said.\n\nAlthough she was only 35, her main coronary artery had ripped open, a rare complication associated with pregnancy.\n\nMs. Denlein now relies on her smart defibrillator to save her from her injured heart, and to alert her doctor, Dr. Saxon, to problems if they occur.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s life changing,\u201d Ms. Denlein said. \u201cIt gives me such a feeling of comfort.\u201d\n\nMrs. Elzo feels the same way.\n\nHad her device not alerted her doctor that it needed to be replaced, she said, \u201cI shudder to think what would have happened.\u201d", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "\u00a0Does not appear to rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The researchers, who published their findings in The New England Journal of Medicine, noted that the deck might have been stacked in favor of a hazardous outcome because study participants, especially the group that received testosterone, had high rates of high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity and elevated blood lipids. Then again, this may be a realistic population to study, given that many candidates for hormone therapy are likely to have such health issues.\n\nA $45 million study financed by the National Institute on Aging is under way at 12 medical centers to see if a year of treatment with testosterone will help 800 men aged 65 and older with low levels of the hormone and problems with physical functioning, fatigue and sexual or cognitive performance. The study, in which the men are being randomly assigned to receive the hormone or a look-alike placebo, will also evaluate the hormone\u2019s effects on cardiac risk factors.\n\nStill, this study will not answer the question of whether it is safe to use the hormone for years, even decades, which would be necessary to maintain any benefits. A major concern is whether long-term use would promote the growth of prostate cancer, which is present but hidden in as many as half of older men.\n\n\u201cThere are not many good studies of testosterone in older men,\u201d Dr. William J. Bremner, a urologist at the University of Washington in Seattle, said in an interview. \u201cThe studies are small and the longest of them lasted only three years. We need the same kind of study for testosterone as the Women\u2019s Health Initiative \u2014 several thousand men followed for maybe 10 years. Currently, we\u2019re in limbo as to how to advise patients.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged that the need for such a study for men is \u201cless compelling\u201d because, in contrast to women, who experience an abrupt drop in estrogen at menopause, often with disruptive symptoms, hormone decline in aging men is far more gradual, and symptoms, when they occur, are commonly viewed as normal signs of aging, not hormone deficiency.\n\nA large European study published in the same issue of the journal sought to better determine who, among middle-aged and elderly men, might be candidates for testosterone replacement. Among a sample of 3,369 men aged 40 to 79, researchers at eight European medical centers found that \u201climited physical vigor\u201d and three sexual symptoms \u2014 diminished sexual thoughts and morning erections and erectile dysfunction \u2014 were most closely linked to low levels of testosterone.\n\nAlthough low hormone levels are widely thought to increase a man\u2019s risk of depression, the researchers found that \u201cpsychological symptoms had little or no association with the testosterone level.\u201d\n\nThere are four main approaches to testosterone therapy available in this country: intramuscular injections every one to three weeks; skin applications through a patch or gel; and pellets implanted under the skin that last for months. The patch can cause skin irritation, and the gel can be transferred to others through skin contact unless care is taken to cover the area where it is applied. But oral administration is rarely used because of toxic effects on the liver.\n\nThe most common reason men seek testosterone therapy is waning sexual desire or performance, although the ability of the hormone to relieve sexual symptoms is unpredictable. More than one-quarter of men with normal testosterone levels have such symptoms, and many men with subnormal levels do not. Dr. Bremner said he typically suggests a trial of therapy for up to a year to see if sexual function or other symptoms improve.\n\nCiting the results of many small studies, Dr. Bremner said, \u201cThere is good evidence that testosterone administration can improve muscle mass and strength and increase bone density\u201d in men with subnormal levels. Dr. Abraham Morgentaler, a urologist at Harvard Medical School and author of \u201cTestosterone for Life\u201d (McGraw-Hill, 2009), said in an interview that other noted benefits include a decrease in body fat and total cholesterol and improved blood sugar metabolism.\n\nIn a report on the risks of testosterone therapy, written with Dr. Ernani Luis Rhoden and published in 2004 in The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Morgentaler noted that testosterone has widespread effects throughout the body, but he and Dr. Rhoden concluded that with proper monitoring, any looming hazards can be readily detected.\n\nBefore the most recent study, at doses considered normal, the testosterone gel showed little or no effect on cardiovascular risk, the two doctors reported. Injections could result in harmful thickening of the blood, however, especially if above-normal blood levels of the hormone result.\n\nAlthough testosterone can cause overgrowth of the prostate, studies have not shown harm to urinary function, Dr. Morgentaler said. The risk of prostate cancer is of greater concern, given that suppressing the body\u2019s natural production of testosterone can cause this cancer to regress. Men considering treatment should first undergo a full prostate exam and PSA measurement, with periodic prostate checkups during therapy, Dr. Bremner said.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "This article is clearly not based on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "July 14, 2010 -- An experimental weight loss drug that targets the brain\u2019s hunger center was shown to be safe and effective for helping dieters shed pounds in a two-year study, researchers say. The drug lorcaserin works on the serotonin receptor -- the same appetite-controlling hormone targeted by the notorious drug fenfluramine, the \"fen\" component of combination medication fen-phen. Fenfluramine was taken off the market in 1997 after being linked to potentially life-threatening heart valve problems. But lorcaserin is far more selective than the drug fenfluramine and much safer, its manufacturer says, because it specifically targets the serotonin receptor associated with hunger while having no impact on the heart.\n\nAbout half the dieters who took lorcaserin for a year in the study lost at least 5% of their body weight, compared to 20% of dieters who took a placebo pill. About one in five lorcaserin users lost 10% or more of their body weight, compared to one out of 14 placebo users.

A shorter urethra makes it easier for bacteria from rectum to enter the vagina and travel to the bladder.\n\nStudy author Dr. Thomas Hooton said it's thought that increasing fluid intake decreases UTI risk in two ways: by preventing bacteria from adhering to the bladder and by reducing the overall concentration of bacteria that could cause an infection.\n\n\"Flushing bacteria out of the bladder, it's been known, at least it's been thought, that it is protective. This study suggests that it is,\" said Hooton, clinical director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Miami School of Medicine.\n\nDr. Hunter Wessells, who wasn't involved in the study, called the additional fluid intake \"substantial,\" leading to a corresponding increase in urine output.\n\n\"It is the urine output which is of course the key factor leading to the effect seen in the study,\" said Wessells, chair of the department of urology at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.\n\nDr. Susan Bleasdale, medical director of infection control at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said the study \"may be a game changer\" for antibiotic \"stewardship\" programs aimed at reducing inappropriate antibiotic use.\n\nShe cited a 2010 review estimating that 11 million to 12 million women a year will suffer from a UTI, accounting for 1.6 billion antibiotic prescriptions a year.\n\n\"We might not even need to use antibiotics,\" she said.\n\nThe study, conducted in Bulgaria, involved 140 healthy premenopausal women who had at least three UTIs in the past year. All reported low daily fluid intake. They drank roughly four cups of fluid per day, including just 2 cups of water a day.\n\nHalf of the women in the study were asked to consume 1.5 liters of water, or about 6 cups, each day in addition to their usual daily fluid intake. Specifically, they were asked to begin drinking a 1/2-liter water bottle at each meal and finish each bottle before the next meal.\n\nThe remaining women served as a control group. They continued their usual fluid intake.\n\nThe women were followed for a year, with clinic visits at the beginning of the study as well as 6 and 12 months later. Researchers measured their water and fluid intake; urine volume, frequency and concentration; and symptoms. They also called the women each month to assess compliance and counsel them to return to the clinic for evaluation and possible treatment if they were experiencing UTI symptoms.\n\nOverall, the water group increased daily water intake by close to 5 cups a day. Their total daily fluid intake, including water and other beverages, averaged nearly 12 cups.\n\nBy contrast, the control group's total daily fluid intake was less than half of that.\n\nHooton noted that it's not clear exactly how much fluid intake must increase to deliver a benefit.\n\n\"There's no magic in a liter-and-a-half,\" he said.\n\nLikewise, he believes any increase in fluid -- not just water -- may be beneficial since fluids are mostly water.

The new moms found that the conversations helped relieve symptoms.\n\n\u201cPostpartum depression is a problem for one in seven women, and many of them don\u2019t get help because there\u2019s a stigma and they don\u2019t have time and it\u2019s expensive,\u201d said study leader Dr. Nicole Letourneau, a professor and research chair in parent-infant mental health at the University of Calgary. \u201cTraining peer counselors to do phone counseling is an effective, low-cost and non-stigmatizing way for new moms to get the help they need.\u201d\n\nParticularly for first-time mothers, postpartum depression can be hard to distinguish from the stress and fatigue that come with caring for a new infant around the clock, Letourneau said. Symptoms can include sadness, insomnia, difficulty concentrating and making decisions, feelings of shame or guilt, as well as difficulty bonding with the baby or thoughts about harming the baby.\n\nTo assess the effectiveness of phone counseling for easing these symptoms, Letourneau and colleagues identified 64 mothers with symptoms of major depression within 24 months after delivery and offered them up to 12 weekly peer support calls.\n\nThe average mom with depression was about 26 years old. Most had symptoms of depression before they got pregnant, and many had previously been treated with medication or professional counseling.\n\nThe women who volunteered as peer counselors attended an eight-hour training course and received reference materials about postpartum depression. They also had nurses available for phone consults if they had concerns about anything the moms said during their conversations.\n\nBy midway through the study, 37 new moms had received at least one call from a peer counsellor. On average, the women spoke more than eight times and the calls typically lasted about 38 minutes, the researchers reported in the Journal of Advanced Nursing.\n\nOver the second half of the study, 34 mothers had at least one phone conversation with a peer counsellor. On average, they spoke about three times.\n\nMothers who left the study said they no longer needed support, sought counseling from mental health professionals, or didn\u2019t have time for the phone calls.\n\nWhile all of the mothers were depressed at the start of the study, at mid-point only 32 percent were at risk for depression, and this declined to 15 percent at the end. Furthermore, at mid-point, 60 percent of the mothers had low depression scores; this percentage rose to 75 percent at end.\n\nEven though the small study had several women drop out and lacked a control group of moms who received different treatment, the results are consistent with previous research that has proven peer counseling works, said Dr. Ruta Nonacs, a psychiatrist at the Center for Women\u2019s Mental Health at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.\n\n\u201cIt is a very powerful experience to be able to talk to a woman who has gone through the same thing and come out the other side,\u201d said Nonacs, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cA lot of first-time moms wonder what\u2019s normal, what\u2019s depression, and what to do with the fact that they feel overwhelmed and alone and like their experience looks nothing like the happy moms they see smiling in all of the baby food and diaper commercials.\u201d\n\nBecause postpartum depression is the most common complication of childbirth, it makes sense to explore peer counseling and other interventions that can reach women in rural or suburban areas where access to mental health professionals may be limited, said Dr. Samantha Meltzer-Brody, director of the perinatal psychiatry program at the Center for Women\u2019s Mood Disorders at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\n\u201cMost people in the world have access to a telephone,\u201d said Meltzer-Brody, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cThis study, while small, suggests that peer phone counseling could be a very effective, widespread public health intervention.\u201d", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "Because the story includes interviews with independent experts, we can be sure it did not rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Dr. Constance Lehman, a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School and director of breast imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, who is not on the task force, said she was pleased to see that although its advice had not changed, the group had placed more of an emphasis than before on the importance of women\u2019s having the freedom to decide how often to be screened and when to start.\n\nThe guidelines state that from ages 40 to 74, screening will reduce the odds of dying from breast cancer, with women 40 to 49 benefiting the least and those 60 to 69 benefiting the most.

The recovery has been pain-free, and the cancer hasn't returned, he said.\n\nThis technique, which Lee helped develop and has been using for about a year, represents a big advance over conventional kidney-cancer surgery, which can require a foot-long incision and, sometimes, removal of a rib so the doctor can reach the malignancy, according to experts.\n\nIt even represents an advance over conventional laparoscopic surgery, which requires separate incisions for devices that can grasp and sever the cancer, as well as an endoscope that provides illumination and a view of the target area, said Marvin Guiles, director of engineering at Cambridge Endo, who worked on the instruments with Lee.\n\nOnly one incision is required because Lee and other doctors can use a device called a trocar, which has holes for each instrument and the endoscope. Besides providing an entry point, the trocar makes a seal at the incision point to prevent the leakage of carbon dioxide, which is pumped into the abdomen to give the surgeon more space in which to work.\n\nThe hook, grasper and scissors are on the ends of shafts less than one-fifth of an inch wide. Besides being tiny, Guiles said they offer the advantage of flexibility.\n\nWhile keeping an eye on his progress on an operating-room monitor, Lee was able to move the tools into position and administer two freezing blasts through a needle probe that had been inserted through Davis' skin and placed inside the tumor.\n\n\"The ice ball forms very rapidly, \" Lee said.\n\n\"I was amazed at what they could do through that opening with those tools . . . to manipulate the tools and not destroy you in the process, \" he said.\n\nTechnically known as single-port cryosurgery, the technique is used only for cancers no bigger than an inch and a half wide that haven't spread beyond the kidney, Lee said.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, the five-year survival rate for kidney cancer found at this stage is 96 percent. This form of cancer strikes about 57,760 Americans every year, according to the organization. About 12,980 die of the cancer each year.\n\nWhile kidney cancer can have symptoms such as back pain and bloody urine, it's difficult to detect early, said Lee, who said about half of these tumors are found when people undergo X-rays for other reasons.\n\nThat was what happened to Davis, who had gone to a hospital for a kidney stone. His doctor saw a suspicious growth on Davis' kidney and referred him to Lee.\n\nDavis said he chose single-port cryosurgery \"because I didn't want to be cut wide open any more than I had to be.\"\n\nWhile the procedure may look straightforward, it's extremely delicate, said Linda Cormier, a sales representative for Cambridge Endo, whose headquarters is in Framingham, Mass.\n\nIf a rare mishap occurs, the doctor will have to resort to conventional surgery, requiring a much bigger incision.\n\nDavis said he was aware of that possibility before he underwent the procedure. He also knew that the cancer happened to be a spot where the small instruments couldn't reach it, the operation might have to be much more extensive.\n\nThat was the first thought on Davis' mind as he returned to consciousness in the recovery room, he said. \"When I woke up and saw that I wasn't all bandaged up, I said, \"Aha! I'm OK!' \"\n\nJohn Pope can be reached at jpope@timespicayune.com or at 504.826.3317.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "There is no way to know if the story relied on a press release as the sole source of information.", "answer": 2}, {"article": "Claudia Kawas, a geriatric neurologist at the University of California, Irvine, said a patient strode into her office soon after the FDA approved the procedure and asked for the \"Alzheimer's test.\" In one hand, he held an article about the approval of Amyvid.

It is also the first clinical trial investigating the efficacy, tolerability and safety of intranasal-administered oxytocin in young children with autism.\n\nAutism is a group of complex brain developmental disorders characterized by impairments in social interaction, communication, and stereotypical and repetitive behaviours. The diagnosed incidence is estimated to be one in 68 children and effective interventions remain limited.\n\nBehavioural therapies can improve social, emotional and behavioural impairments but these are typically time consuming (40 hours per week), remain costly and show mixed outcomes. There is currently no medical treatment for these problems.\n\nIn this new study, 31 children aged three to eight years of age received a twice daily course of oxytocin in the form of a nasal spray.\n\n\"We used some of the most widely used assessments of social responsiveness for children with autism,\" said autism expert, Associate Professor Adam Guastella of the Brain and Mind Centre.\n\n\"We found that following oxytocin treatment, parents reported their child to be more socially responsive at home, and our own blind independent clinician ratings also supported improved social responsiveness in the therapy rooms of the Brain and Mind Centre,\" he said.\n\nOverall, the nasal spray was well tolerated and the most common adverse events were thirst, urination and constipation.\n\nThis is the first time a medical treatment has shown this type of benefit for children with autism and findings reinforce outcomes from a longer sustained program of research by this team.\n\nOver the last 10 years Brain and Mind Centre researchers have been documenting the benefits of oxytocin in humans, revealing that it enhances eye gaze, emotion recognition and memory across a range of populations.\n\nStudy co-author and co-director of the Brain and Mind Centre, Professor Ian Hickie noted the new results were a critical first advance in the development of medical treatments for the social deficits that characterize autism.\n\n\"The potential to use such simple treatments to enhance the longer-term benefits of other behavioural, educational and technology-based therapies is very exciting,\" he said.\n\nMost recently the team has linked observed changes from treatment to brain changes associated with social circuitry.

But doctors do not always want to run the risks that can be associated with that technique, and the leading candidates for less invasive assessment are CT and MRI.\n\nCT is a scanning technique using X-rays that produce a set of slice-by-slice heart images, up to 16 slices, depending on the power of the machine. MRI uses a powerful magnetic field and pulses of radiowave energy to create images.\n\nThe German researchers looked at results of 109 published studies of noninvasive heart artery imaging, including 89 that used CT and 20 that used MRI and involving 8,505 people. In the studies of people with suspected coronary artery disease, CT proved to be 97 percent sensitive, compared with 87 percent sensitivity for MRI exams, the analysis found. Sensitivity rates the ability of a test to correctly identify people who have a particular disease.\n\n\"This article holds no surprises whatever,\" said Dr. Uwe Joseph Schoepf, a professor of radiology and cardiology at the Medical University of South Carolina. \"This is really something that is sort of common trade knowledge.\"\n\nIndeed, CT and MRI are not contenders in clinical practice but are used for different reasons to make different assessments, Schoepf said. \"It is a question of what specific question you are looking to answer,\" he said.\n\nCT is the preferred noninvasive technology for assessing the condition of heart arteries, whether there is narrowing that might end with the total blockage that causes a heart attack, Schoepf said. \"MRI is not in current use to look at coronary artery disease,\" he said. \"We use MRI angiography if we are interested in heart muscle, as when there are congenital heart abnormalities in children. The strength of MRI is that it shows tissue configuration.\"\n\nThat difference helps explain why there are so few studies doing head-to-head comparison of CT versus MRI, he said. The German analysis found only five such studies.\n\nDr. Ricardo Cury, director of cardiac MRI and CT at Baptist Cardiac & Vascular Institute in Miami and a consultant radiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, said that the \"meta-analysis demonstrates a knowledge that we have accumulated for the past several years.\"\n\n\"For imaging of the cardiac arteries, CT is more robust,\" Cury said. \"We perform MRI on a clinical basis more for functional assessment, as opposed to looking at the coronary arteries.\"\n\nThough that difference is well established among radiologists, the new study may be of assistance in the general medical community, including general cardiologists, because \"it summarizes the advantages of CT at this point in time,\" he said.\n\nIndeed, CT appears to be better for assessment of coronary artery disease, matched against not only MRI but other methods, such as echocardiography, he said.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic has more on CT, MRI and similar tests.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not appear to rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "In 37 years as a police officer, Edwin Michel coped with a plane crash, a sniper, wildfires and three bullet wounds.\n\nNothing much rattled him until he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in November 2016.

But after the robotic job earlier this month, she was out of the hospital in a few days and feeling chipper.\n\n\"The robot is the way to go,\" Jackson said. \"Yes, indeed.\" Using a robot enables a surgeon to work on a patient without splitting open the chest and using a heart-lung machine, as happens with traditional surgery. The robotic tools are inserted through small openings made in the patient's body, minimizing trauma and significantly reducing recovery time.\n\nWhile surgical robots have been available for most of this decade, few are used to do cardiac bypass surgery, even though that was their focus when the machines were introduced.\n\nThe robot - not a kind of mechanical being but a system that enables a surgeon at a control panel to manipulate microtools - has proved more challenging to integrate into coronary bypass surgery than expected, illustrating how technological advancements can be difficult to readily adapt.\n\nNow, the University of Chicago Medical Center, where Jackson had her surgery, has launched a major new effort to make robotic bypass surgery more widely available.\n\nIt has hired the nation's foremost master of robotic bypass surgery to help lead a revolution in coronary bypass. Dr. Valluvan Jeevanandam, the chief of cardiothoracic surgery at the U. of C. Medical Center and in charge of the hospital's initiative, acknowledges he has set a difficult task.\n\nInstead of opening up a patient and working directly on his heart, the robotic-assisted surgeon sits at a console near the patient, looking at three-dimensional high-definition images on a screen and using his hands and feet to control the microtools inserted within the patient's chest. Tiny laser lights and video cameras provide the surgeon's view of what's happening.\n\n\"Using the robot isn't easy,\" Jeevanandam said. \"A drop of blood can block your view and you have to take out the camera and clean it.\" Heart surgeons tend to be confident, competent people used to taking hold of a problem and moving ahead directly. Many who trained to use robots to do coronary bypass run out of patience after three or four procedures, Jeevanandam said, which is why he decided to hire Dr. Sudhir Srivastava, who performed hundreds of robotic bypasses while working at a center in Odessa, Texas.\n\n\"We're a top center,\" said Jeevanandam. \"If they can do this in Odessa, why not Chicago?\"\n\nSrivastava brings a focus and determination to mastering robotic surgery that Jeevanandam wants to spread to other heart surgeons at Chicago.\n\n\"He practices yoga,\" Jeevanandam said. \"It comes in handy.\" But Dr. Pat Pappas, chief of cardiac surgery at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, Ill., wonders if Jeevanandam may be overestimating robotic capabilities.\n\n\"At some point it may happen,\" he said. \"But given the current state of the technology, I don't think that's the case now.\" Pappas started using a surgical robot in 2001, and he intended to use the machine to do minimally invasive coronary bypass procedures, but he found it too difficult. Instead, he has used the machine to do hundreds of heart valve repairs.\n\nThe robots have proven popular for urologic, gynecologic and some general surgery, Pappas said, but few coronary surgeons use them for valve repairs and fewer still do bypass procedures. The problem, he said, is a surgeon cannot feel what he's doing.\n\n\"There's no tactile feedback,\" Pappas said. \"The exactness of bypass surgery is so high that many people are reluctant to do it without tactile as well as visual feedback.\"\n\nSrivastava said it is true that the normal sense of touch is missing from robotic work, and that is a shortcoming, but it can be overcome with practice. Before working on humans in Odessa, he practiced on dozens of pig hearts.\n\n\"After doing it hundreds of times,\" Srivastava said, \"I almost feel the machine is no longer between me and the patient. My hands and feet move in a way that's totally intuitive. That is achievable. You almost develop this sixth sense where looking at what you're doing gives you pseudo-tactile feedback.\"\n\nWhile some have suggested that younger physicians who grew up playing video games may find robotic surgery more natural, Srivastava disagrees. He said that experienced cardiac surgeons who have mastered conventional bypass surgery are the best candidates for learning to use robots because they have the skills and confidence to get themselves out of difficult situations that may arise.\n\n\"Skill set is important, but mental attitude is very important,\" he said. \"I've been in practice more than 20 years, and five years ago we launched robotics. This old dog learned.\"\n\nThe maker of the robotic systems, Intuitive Surgical Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., is an enthusiastic backer of the University of Chicago's initiative.\n\nRecent concerns raised over the safety of medicated stents used in coronary angioplasty procedures have caused more patients and physicians to consider bypass surgery as a better therapy for blocked coronary arteries, said Chris Rabbitt, cardiac marketing director for the company.\n\nAngioplasty, which uses a balloon to open blocked arteries, has been a popular alternative to bypass surgery in part because it brings less trauma to the patient. Stents are small devices used to keep arteries open after the balloon breaks up the blockage. Many stents are infused with chemicals intended to keep the arteries open, but some studies suggest the medication introduces new risks to cardiac health.\n\n\"Patients are more educated,\" Rabbitt said. \"It used to be that when you fell ill, you'd get angioplasty and be stented. But patients understand they have more options.\"\n\nUsing robotics to bypass major blocked arteries and putting stents in other blocked arteries is gaining some currency, Rabbitt said, although few surgeons have come close to Srivastava's familiarity with the robot.\n\nEven though they cost, on average, $1.5 million, the robot systems are gaining popularity. There are 504 systems in North America, 108 in Europe and 44 in the rest of the world.\n\nIf he can train several cardiac surgeons and their teams at the University of Chicago to do robotic coronary bypass procedures, Srivastava said it will change the face of bypass surgery because consumers who hear the benefits of avoiding a cracked sternum will demand the minimally invasive approach.\n\nFinding satisfied patients is probably the easiest aspect of robotic surgery.\n\nJohn Farrell, 70, of Valparaiso, Ind., had severe back pain and needed surgery this summer, but his cardiologist said that blockage of his coronary arteries need to be fixed before he could undergo the back operation. By opting for robotic surgery, Farrell was able to get his back repaired just 10 days after his heart.\n\n\"The heart operation was no problem at all,\" he said.\n\nFor Mary Lou Coulter, 77, of Westville, Ind., the main aftereffect of her robotic procedure was some soreness and numbness.\n\n\"When I left the hospital, I asked them when I could drive,\" she said, \"and they said `Whenever you feel like it,' which really surprised me.\"\n\nFirst published on September 5, 2007 at 12:00 am", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "A\u00a0University of Chicago issued a press release on the robot surgery program\u00a0and its head, Sudhir Srivastava,\u00a0on July 31.

The authors, from Cleveland Clinic in the US, say considering radiosurgery earlier on could make a big difference to patients' lives.\n\nTrigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a very painful nerve disorder that causes an electrical shock feeling in the face, usually in older people. Some things can trigger it, like chewing or even the wind blowing, but attacks can be random. On a scale of 1-10, patients often describe the pain as 15 - off the scale. TN is commonly treated with anti-epileptic medications. While this can reduce the pain, it makes patients drowsy and tired, and they report feeling drunk. This has an impact on their quality of life and frequently causes depression, as it stops them from driving, working or even just leaving the house.\n\nAccording to the new study, radiosurgery, which is normally a second line treatment to be used following the medication, helps improve quality of life and reduce depression in patients with TN. By considering it earlier as a treatment option, doctors could help improve the lives of patients with TN more quickly.\n\n\"We knew radiosurgery results in pain relief, but we didn't know if the patients actually felt better,\" said Dr. Samuel Chao, corresponding author of the study. \"I think people go and see their neurologist and get the pain under control with medication, but they don't realize how lousy this can make them feel. Using radiosurgery earlier on allows patients to get off the medications, improving their quality of life by allowing them to return to activities they used to do.\"\n\nRadiosurgery is a method for physically treating the nerve using radiation - with stereotactic radiosurgery, doctors can focus 192 beams of radiation on a single point. It is non-invasive, so doesn't require the healing time of traditional surgery. Treatment takes less than an hour and requires no anesthetic. However, it is often overlooked or delayed as a treatment because there is a lack of capability and experience with the method. Research has shown that radiosurgery reduces pain for 80% of patients, but the broader impact on their lives remained unknown.\n\nIn the new study, Dr. Chao, Dr. Kotecha and his colleagues prospectively collected data from 50 patients they treated with radiosurgery using two questionnaires: EuroQOL 5-Dimension and Patient Health Questionnaire 9. They asked questions about the patients' pain and facial numbness, their health and their ability to take care of themselves. The researchers analyzed patients' answers before treatment and at each follow-up appointment, and found that patients reported an improved quality of life and lower rates of depression after radiosurgery. Importantly, the benefit of treatment was strongly driven by improvements in pain and discomfort as well as self-care.\n\n\"Pain and the medication to stop the pain make it difficult for people with TN to go outside and live life,\" explained Dr. Chao. \"With radiosurgery, we can reduce pain, improve quality of life and decrease depression - people can go out and enjoy life without worrying they will have a random attack. Giving options empowers the patient to be more aware of themselves and manage their own condition.\"\n\nThe team plans to analyze the impact of other treatment options and carry out a cost-based analysis to establish the best treatment options for TN.\n\nThe article is \"Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Trigeminal Neuralgia Improves Patient-Reported Quality-of-Life and Reduces Depression,\" by Rupesh Kotecha, Jacob A.

Risk reduction [was] probably in the range of 80 to 95 percent,\" said researcher Timothy Rebbeck, an epidemiologist at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nAnd women who had ovaries removed reduced their risk of ovarian cancer by as much as 80 percent.\n\nThe study findings are extremely reassuring to Rebbeck -- no breast cancer diagnoses among women who had double mastectomies after three years of follow-up. Among the women who did not have the surgery, 7 percent were later diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nRebbeck says these decreases are big but are cautions that cancer risk will never be brought down to zero. That's because all the tissue is never completely taken out.\n\n\"Breast tissue is found throughout the torso and can't be completely removed through surgical means. And, with ovarian cancer, the ovary leaves behind cells that could go on to become cancerous. So, it's just not possible to remove all the tissue that might be at risk,\" he says.\n\nOne of the women who decided to take that chance is 61-year-old Toby of New Jersey. (Because she's worried about her health coverage, she doesn't want her last name used.)\n\nToby's mother died of ovarian cancer when Toby was in her 20s. Researchers now know that disease is linked, along with breast cancer, to genetic mutations.\n\nToby had first her ovaries and then both breasts removed after she tested positive for the BRCA genes about five years ago.\n\nBut at first, she had hoped to avoid the surgery.\n\n\"After my genetic testing, they would alternate mammogram with MRI every six months. I thought I was getting very, very good surveillance, and I thought that would probably be enough and they would be able to diagnose something very, very early and be able to cure me if I were to get breast cancer,\" she says.\n\nBut her doctors thought otherwise. Breast cancer caused by BRCA mutations is particularly aggressive. And they told Toby her lifetime risk of that type of cancer was as high as 90 percent.\n\nToby was one of the women researchers from around the country tracked in the study to see how they fared after having this surgery.\n\nWomen like Toby who chose both ovary and breast removal had dramatically lower risks of getting both cancers after the surgery. Only 3 percent of those who had surgery died, compared with 10 percent of those who did not, during the follow-up period.\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the study, Virginia Kaklamani, an oncologist at Northwestern University, says lives can be saved if women have genetic testing.\n\n\"A lot of times I see these women having had a very preventable type of breast cancer. Preventable because I can identify the fact that they had a higher risk of getting breast cancer,\" she says.\n\n\"Had they been genetically tested a few years prior to my seeing them, they would have had the option of having bilateral mastectomy. So, we could have prevented these breast cancers and we didn't,\" says Kaklamani.\n\nFor Toby, it's been about a year since her double mastectomy. She's had reconstruction. And, today, she says she feels physically strong again. But she now feels an emotional empowerment, and that comforts her.\n\n\"My mother left me when I was 26, and it was extremely painful and traumatic for my entire life,\" she says. \"I just didn't want to do that for my children. I had a chance to control that and to fight what my mother never had a chance for.\"\n\nOncologist Kaklamani says women with the BRCA mutation should be counseled about genetic testing, and strongly consider it.\n\nWhile surgical decisions are up to patients, the findings of this study should help them decide what to do, she says.\n\nToby has a daughter who decided to take the test, based on her mother's experience.

Diane Zheng of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.\n\n\u201cTaking care of your vision is important in order to maintain good cognitive function,\u201d she said in a telephone interview.\n\nPoor eyesight and weakening mental function are common in older people and related to one another, but the question of whether vision influences cognition, or vice versa, has not been clear, the study team writes in JAMA Ophthalmology.\n\nTo investigate, Zheng\u2019s team followed 2,520 adults for eight years, testing their vision and cognitive status every other year.\n\nOver the course of the study, average visual decline was roughly equivalent to losing the ability to read one line of an eye chart. People who had worse vision at the beginning of the study had worse scores on the cognitive exam as well. A person\u2019s vision at their previous check-up was related to their mental function at the following check-up. While mental function at one check-up was also related to vision at the following exam, the effect of vision on subsequent mental function was significantly stronger.\n\nWhile the mechanism behind the vision-cognition relationship isn\u2019t well understood, Zheng said, worsening vision can discourage people from brain-stimulating activities like doing crosswords and engaging with other people.\n\nShe recommended that older adults get regular eye checkups, and have any vision symptoms checked out and treated promptly.\n\n\u201cThis study provides additional evidence that would suggest that people who can keep their vision healthy as they age might also be protecting their cognitive health,\u201d said Dr. Heather E.

They reported this screening approach detected high-risk HPV in all of the cases of women who were found to have high-grade, abnormal cervical precancerous growths, showing that self-collection at home for HPV may be a viable method to identify women at high-risk for cervical cancer.\n\n\"This is a demonstration that mailing self-collection kits and returning them to test for high-risk HPV infection has big potential to increase screening access among under-screened women, and to do that successfully,\" said UNC Lineberger's Jennifer S. Smith, the study's senior author, and a professor in the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health.\n\nAlthough cervical cancer is preventable through early detection and treatment, the American Cancer Society estimates that more than 4,100 women will die from cervical cancer in the United States this year. Nearly 20 percent of women in the United States who are eligible for cervical cancer screening report they haven't been tested for cervical cancer within the recommended time interval, national surveys have shown.\n\n\"Women are dying unnecessarily of cervical cancer because they either haven't been vaccinated against HPV in adolescence, or they've not been getting screened according to national guidelines,\" Smith said. \"Increasing screening rates among under-screened women is of paramount importance.\"\n\nIn 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration signed off on using an HPV test alone to screen for cervical cancer for women 25 years and older, in conjunction with the Pap test. Earlier this year, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force gave an \"A\" rating to HPV primary screening alone for women aged 30 to 65.\n\n\"There are a lot of different barriers that cause women to be underscreened,\" said the study's first author Andrea Des Marais, MPH, project manager with the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health. \"HPV tests are being widely used now in the United States, but only through physician collection in clinical practice, which requires that women come to a clinic. Offering HPV testing using self-collection by mail has a lot of potential to reach women who are the highest risk of being screened: those who don't access regular medical care.\"\n\nFor the study, researchers mailed at-home, self-collection kits to low-income women in North Carolina who were overdue for screening by national guidelines. They included women between the ages of 30 and 64 years who had reported no history of receiving a Pap test, which checks for precancerous or cancerous cells, within the past four years.\n\nResearchers provided study participants with self-collection brushes along with instructions for how to take a sample from inside the vagina. The brush samples were then tested in a lab for HPV and other sexually transmitted infections. Participants also self-collected samples at a clinic and handed them to a nurse, and had a pelvic exam for a clinician to collect a Pap smear sample.\n\nThe researchers compared the results from self- and clinician-samples - which were tested for high-risk HPV strains that are linked to cervical cancer - to the Pap results and the results of cervical biopsies collected during colposcopy, which is a secondary diagnostic test that confirms the presence of cervical pre-cancerous lesions among women with abnormal Pap smear results.\n\nThe home self-collection test indicated that 12.4 percent of women were infected with high-risk HPV, the self-collection tests used in the clinic found 15.5 of the women had high-risk HPV infection, and the clinician-collected test identified 11.4 percent of the women had high-risk HPV infection.\n\n\"We found comparable detection between self-collection and physician-collection,\" Des Marais said.\n\nAll women found to have high-grade cervical lesions by Pap smear or by cervical biopsy were positive for high-risk HPV on their home self-collected sample.\n\n\"We found in this sample, all of the women who had high-grade lesions had HPV-positive home self-collection results,\" Smith said. \"We didn't miss any of those high-grade cases by conducting home self-collection.\"\n\nSmith said there is more work to be done, such as identifying ways to make the self-collection process more efficient and cost-effective, and getting FDA approval for the clinical use of self-collection for cervical cancer screening.\n\n\"This is a proof-in-principle study that we used to determine whether home self-collection is highly effective for detecting high-grade disease,\" Smith said. \"We are already working on the next step, which is a clinical trial in which women who aren't up-to-date on screening get either a referral to a free clinic appointment to receive a screening, or receive a self-collection kit in the mail, followed by referral to a free clinic appointment.

It could also help keep you thinking clearly.\n\nNew research shows that sticking to the Mediterranean diet, previously shown to reduce heart and other health issues, also may help lower the risk of having small areas of dead tissue linked to thinking problems. Known as brain infarcts, they're involved in vascular dementia, the second most common form of dementia, after Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"We've got these diseases of aging that cause disability, cost a ton of money to treat and manage, and wreck people's lives,\" said Dr. Gregory Cole, a professor of medicine and neurology at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was not involved in this new study. \"You've got to get in there and figure out what actually works for prevention, and not have people guessing.\"\n\nA Mediterranean diet includes a lot of fruit, vegetables and fish, olive oil, legumes and cereals, and fewer dishes containing dairy, meat, poultry, and saturated fatty acids than other diets. It also involves small to moderate amounts of alcohol.\n\nThe study relates diet to strokes, said Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, a neurologist at Columbia University Medical Center and lead author of the study. The research will be presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in April.\n\nAn infarct, a kind of stroke, happens when the passage of blood is slowed or completely blocked by clotting. This study looked at people who had never had a clinical stroke, but may have had smaller strokes that went unnoticed. An MRI brain scan can detect these small strokes.\n\nThe study looked at 712 people over the age of 65 living in New York. Participants were asked about their diet and then, about six years later, underwent an MRI. In general, dietary patterns are consistent for at least seven or eight years, Scarmeas said.\n\nResearchers found that people who most closely followed a Mediterranean-like diet were 36 percent less likely to have areas of brain damage, compared with those whose eating habits were furthest from the diet.\n\nThe study shows association, not causation, meaning there could be some other factors linking the Mediterranean diet to resilience against this form of brain damage. For example, other research has found that higher adherence to the diet seems to protect against hypertension, also associated with these brain problems.\n\nBut in this new research, when the scientists controlled for hypertension, the diet was still linked to a lower risk of brain damage. It is possible that the diet protects the brain vessels themselves, irrespective of other problems such as high blood pressure, Scarmeas said.\n\nThe participants who followed the Mediterranean diet the least had an increased risk for having strokes that was similar to people with hypertension. Those who most strongly adhered to the dietary regimen had a level of protection similar to people who did not have hypertension.\n\nScarmeas' previous research has shown that the Mediterranean diet may reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Looking at 2,250 individuals from the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project, researchers found a 40 percent lower risk among those who stuck to this diet, scientists reported in the Annals of Neurology in 2006. The people involved in the brain infarcts study are a subset of that original group.\n\nAs many as 2.4 million to 4.5 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, according to the National Institute on Aging. Between 1 and 4 percent of people over the age of 65 have vascular dementia, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nOther studies have suggested that this food regimen may help in preventing second heart attacks, lowering cancer risk and stopping the need for diabetes drugs in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe new study \"gives you better evidence than ever that this is actually protective, and protective against the development of dementia,\" Cole said.\n\nThe risk factors for vascular disease overlap with those of Alzheimer's disease, he said. These include high blood pressure, high-fat diets, type 2 diabetes and low folate intake. People who have both Alzheimer's and vascular disease -- a condition called mixed dementia -- have a more rapid progression of Alzheimer's disease, Cole said.\n\nA subsequent issue to address is whether a person must follow the entire Mediterranean diet in order to reap these benefits, or whether there are portions of it that contribute positive effects, Cole said. It would be easier for people to focus on adding particular elements to their diets -- for example, by taking fish oil capsules -- rather than trying to readjust their eating habits altogether.\n\nCole's own research deals with fish oil, which is relevant because fish is a component in the Mediterranean diet. The bottom line for dementia is that fish oil may help in the very early stages, but more research must be done to confirm this, he said.\n\nIn a study, his group found that DHA fatty acids from fish oil could delay or deter the onset of Alzheimer's disease in rats or older mice that had been genetically altered to develop the condition. Also, a recent study found that the DHA component of fish oil from algae helped people with minor memory impairment, but this needs to be replicated in order to be more definitive, he said.\n\nWhen Scarmeas' group looked at the individual components of the diet, they found a stronger association between the overall diet and brain damage prevention than with any individual food in the diet, suggesting that the combination all of the elements may be producing the effect, Scarmeas said.\n\nResearchers will continue to follow the participants in the study and check in on them every year and a half, Scarmeas said.\n\nThe next step would be to have controlled experiments concerning food and dementia in which participants are randomly assigned to follow a diet, Cole said. It is complicated in general to compare the benefits of a particular diet with the benefits of not following a different food regimen.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "Although there is some language in the story that is very similar to that found in a news release, we rule this satisfactory because an independent expert was quoted, indicating that the story didn\u2019t rely solely or largely on a news release.

These limited screening criteria also missed more racial and ethnic minorities, most notably Asians.\n\nFailing to screen high-risk adults could lead to delayed treatments to prevent type 2 diabetes or manage the condition for those who already have it, possibly contributing to a worsening of the diabetes epidemic. Prediabetes and diabetes affect half of U.S. adults with an estimated cost of $327 billion per year.\n\nThe United States Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) currently recommends that physicians screen patients for dysglycemia (prediabetes or type 2 diabetes) when they are 40 to 70 years old and are overweight or obese. By following this recommendation, 53 percent of patients who had prediabetes or type 2 diabetes would not be screened. The study showed that screening patients using an expanded set of risk factors, which the USPSTF suggests but does not formally recommend, would identify most cases of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.\n\nOnly 23 percent of patients with prediabetes or diabetes would be missed if expanded screening criteria were used to make screening decisions, the study found. The expanded criteria include a family history of diabetes, history of gestational diabetes or polycystic ovarian syndrome or non-white race or ethnicity.\n\n\"This seems like a no-brainer to screen patients who have any of these additional risk factors,\" said lead author Dr. Matthew O'Brien, assistant professor of medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. \"By demonstrating how well these expanded criteria work in identifying patients with prediabetes and diabetes, we're proposing a better path for the USPSTF to strengthen its screening guidelines.\"\n\nThe study was published today, Friday, April 13, in the Journal of General Internal Medicine. O'Brien will be presenting his findings today at the Society for General Internal Medicine conference in Denver, Colorado. This is the first study to report how these expanded screening criteria would perform in practice among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults.\n\nThe USPSTF has come under scrutiny for other screening recommendations, most notably for breast cancer. But there has been little attention focused on this group's most recent diabetes screening guideline.\n\nIntensive lifestyle programs and some medications have been proven to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes among adults with prediabetes. A large volume of research over the last three decades has demonstrated that treating type 2 diabetes prevents life-threatening complications such as heart attacks, strokes and kidney failure.\n\n\"The earlier patients are diagnosed with these conditions, the sooner they can begin to combat them,\" O'Brien said.\n\nAfrican-Americans and Latinos develop type 2 diabetes at younger ages, so waiting until they are 40 years old to screen them is problematic, O'Brien said. In the study, 50 percent of whites with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes were identified using the limited criteria compared to only 48 percent of African-Americans and only 44 percent of Latinos.\n\nAsians are at high risk of developing diabetes even at a healthy weight. By following the limited guidelines and only screening patients who are overweight or obese, approximately 30 percent of Asians with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes would be identified. That would leave 70 percent of Asians with prediabetes or diabetes undiagnosed until their next screening test, which could occur years later.\n\nThe study also touches on the financial implications of these guidelines. Under a provision in the Affordable Care Act, all services recommended by the USPSTF must be fully covered by insurers. But O'Brien said it is unclear whether insurers will be required to pay for diabetes screening if patients only meet the expanded criteria.\n\n\"This could be a particular problem for people of low socioeconomic status who are at high risk of developing diabetes and may be unable to pay for a screening test,\" O'Brien said.\n\nThe study was conducted collaboratively with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), using data collected every year from a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults.

We believe this percentage is very high, and we hope that in the next year this percentage will decrease.\"\n\n\n\nAlong with discovering that the use of laparoscopy for the surgical treatment of GERD has increased significantly in the last decade, the researchers also found that, on average, the minimally invasive approach reduced length of hospital stay by approximately two days, and open operations were more than $9,000 more expensive than minimally invasive procedures.\n\n\n\nThe researchers also found that laparoscopic procedures were better for patients in terms of fewer complications. Laparoscopic anti-reflux operations were less likely to result in postoperative blood clots, wound complications, surgical site infection, esophageal perforation (which can be life threatening), bleeding, cardiac failure, and death.\n\n\n\n\"Our study highlights the fact that laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery is as effective as the open approach, and in 2017, with all its advantages, should be the standard of care,\" said senior study author Marco G. Patti, MD, FACS, a surgeon and Director of the Center for Esophageal Diseases and Swallowing, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.\n\n\n\n\"We found that laparoscopic surgery is associated with significantly lower costs. In addition, indirect costs of the open approach, including an impaired ability to work, time off from work, and intangible costs of postoperative pain and healing, are difficult to measure but also favor the laparoscopic approach,\" said Dr. Patti.\n\n\n\n\"GERD is a common digestive disorder that can usually be treated with dietary changes and medications such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). However, chronic and not-controlled GERD can cause serious complications. Repeated exposure to stomach acid can damage the lining of the esophagus and lead to a precancerous condition called Barrett's esophagus,\" said Dr. Schlottmann.\n\n\n\nStudy results also revealed that urban academic or teaching hospitals performed laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery at a higher rate than open procedures, 54.4 percent versus 45.6 percent. \"We think that it is important to make this information more available to the public. In order to achieve good outcomes, anti-reflux surgery should be performed laparoscopically in specialized centers,\" said Dr. Patti.\n\n\n\nPaula D Strassle, MSPH Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC also participated in this study.\n\n\n\nCitation: Comparative Analysis of Perioperative Outcomes and Costs Between Laparoscopic and Open Antireflux Surgery.

The researchers conducted this study to further clarify the association between metformin use and lung cancer risk.\n\nSakoda and colleagues conducted a retrospective cohort study of 47,351 diabetic patients (54 percent men), 40 years or older, who completed a health-related survey between 1994 and 1996. Information on their diabetes medications was collected from electronic pharmacy records. About 46 percent of them were \"ever-users\" of metformin, defined as those who filled two or more prescriptions within a six-month period.\n\nDuring 15 years of follow-up, 747 patients were diagnosed with lung cancer. Of them, 80 were nonsmokers, and 203 were current smokers.\n\nMetformin use was not associated with lower lung cancer risk overall; however, the risk was 43 percent lower among diabetic patients who had never smoked, and the risk appeared to decrease with longer use. Nonsmokers who used metformin for five years or longer had a 52 percent reduction in lung cancer risk, but this finding was not statistically significant.\n\nMetformin use for five or more years was associated with a 31 percent decrease in the risk for adenocarcinoma, the most common type of lung cancer diagnosed in nonsmokers, and an 82 percent increase in the risk for small-cell carcinoma, a type of lung cancer often diagnosed in smokers, but neither of these findings were statistically significant.\n\nIn an interview, Sakoda said, \"Metformin use was not associated with lung cancer risk when we looked at all patients with diabetes. However, our results suggest that risk might differ by smoking history, with metformin decreasing risk among nonsmokers and increasing risk among current smokers. Our results suggesting that the risk associated with metformin might differ by smoking history were unexpected. Additional large, well-conducted studies are needed to clarify whether metformin may be used to prevent lung or other cancers, particularly in specific subpopulations, such as nonsmokers.\"\n\nThis study was funded by the National Institutes of Health. Sakoda declares no conflicts of interest. Assiamira Ferrara, Charles Quesenberry Jr., and Laurel Habel, coauthors on this study, have received research funding from Takeda to Kaiser Foundation Research Institute for a study of pioglitazone and cancer and from Sanofi through a subcontract from University of North Carolina to Kaiser Foundation Research Institute for a study of insulin glargine and cancer. Habel has received additional research funding from Genentech to Kaiser Foundation Research Institute for a study of HER2-positive breast cancer, including risk of cardiotoxicity following trastuzumab.\n\nAbout the American Association for Cancer Research\n\nFounded in 1907, the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) is the world's oldest and largest professional organization dedicated to advancing cancer research and its mission to prevent and cure cancer. AACR membership includes more than 33,000 laboratory, translational, and clinical researchers; population scientists; other health care professionals; and cancer advocates residing in 101 countries. The AACR marshals the full spectrum of expertise of the cancer community to accelerate progress in the prevention, biology, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer by annually convening more than 20 conferences and educational workshops, the largest of which is the AACR Annual Meeting with over 18,000 attendees. In addition, the AACR publishes eight peer-reviewed scientific journals and a magazine for cancer survivors, patients, and their caregivers. The AACR funds meritorious research directly as well as in cooperation with numerous cancer organizations. As the Scientific Partner of Stand Up To Cancer, the AACR provides expert peer review, grants administration, and scientific oversight of team science and individual grants in cancer research that have the potential for near-term patient benefit. The AACR actively communicates with legislators and policymakers about the value of cancer research and related biomedical science in saving lives from cancer.

The surgery necessary to allow deep brain stimulation is extremely expensive. And for now, the research is preliminary, so it's too early to know for sure if the treatment is appropriate to be used for any kind of depression.\n\nStill, the study suggests that brain stimulation \"not only just helps patients who haven't been able to recover from depression, but it seems to be associated with the absence of relapses. They're not only getting better, they're staying better,\" said study co-author Dr. Helen Mayberg, a professor in both the departments of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, and neurology, at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta.\n\nIn deep brain stimulation, surgeons insert wires into the brain that allows a specific region to be continuously hit with an electronic pulse. The level of stimulation is controlled by a pacemaker-like device implanted in the chest.\n\nDeep brain stimulation has been around for more than 20 years, Mayberg said, and is commonly used to treat Parkinson's disease. The cost of the surgery is about $50,000, she said.\n\nPrevious research by Mayberg and others suggested that deep brain stimulation had potential as a treatment for depression. The St. Jude Medical Neuromodulation company, which has provided consulting fees to Mayberg and some of the other study authors, is currently recruiting patients for a study that could pave the way for its approval as a treatment for depression, Mayberg said.\n\nThe new study, which appears online Jan. 2 in the Archives of General Psychiatry, began with 10 patients with depression and seven with bipolar disorder -- a condition that causes severe mood swings and is also known as manic depression. They all received deep brain stimulation for 24 weeks after going through four weeks either with or without stimulation.\n\nMost of the patients continued to receive the treatment over two years, although researchers temporarily turned it off in three of them as part of the study before realizing that doing so caused their depression to return.\n\nThe researchers found that 18 percent of patients went into remission after 24 weeks, 36 percent (of 14 patients) after one year. After two years, of the 12 patients still in the study, seven patients (58 percent) were in remission.\n\n\"The number of patients who got better increased over time, but it's not quite clear as to why,\" Mayberg said. The workings of deep brain stimulation as a whole are a mystery, although Mayberg said it may work by changing the brain's rhythms.\n\nDr. Samuel James Collier, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Austin, predicted that even if deep brain stimulation turns out to be an effective treatment for depression, it'll be far from the first line of defense.\n\n\"Medications and ECT -- electroconvulsive therapy -- are clearly safer, better tolerated, and do not embody a large surgical risk,\" Collier said. \"I can't think of a scenario where deep brain stimulation would be considered even remotely before medications and ECT were exhausted.\"\n\nStill, he said, it's important to note that \"we seem to be making progress and hopefully those who are suffering the most can find solace in that and not give up hope.\"\n\nFor now, research continues. If patients are interested in deep brain stimulation treatment, they should try to get into the study that's ongoing, Mayberg said.\n\nFor more about deep brain stimulation, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not rely on this press release from Emory University.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "But two studies discussed at the oncology meeting found that patients who were considered Her2-negative even using both tests benefited from Herceptin.\n\nBoth studies reanalyzed tumor samples from earlier clinical trials showing that Herceptin, if used after a tumor is removed by surgery, cuts the risk of the cancer\u2019s recurring by half. For a woman to have entered those trials, her tumor had to be classified as Her2-positive by a local clinical laboratory.\n\nBut scientists have now gone back and retested those preserved tumor samples and found that as many as 20 percent of them were actually Her2-negative. Yet the women with those tumors also experienced a reduction in cancer recurrence from Herceptin, in some cases as great as that in the Her2-positive women.\n\n\u201cThis is a revolution compared to what we believed before,\u201d said Dr. Edith A. Perez of the Mayo Clinic, who presented one of the studies. She said the findings raised questions of whether women who were Her2-negative should be tested again.\n\nSome experts were skeptical, saying the number of patients in the two studies was too small to draw firm conclusions. Also, they said, it was not clear if those women were truly Her2-negative, since they had tested positive by the local laboratory.\n\nDr. Daniel F. Hayes, a breast cancer specialist at the University of Michigan who helped develop guidelines for Her2 testing, said it would be unwise to start giving Herceptin to Her2-negative women because the drug was expensive and raised the risk of heart failure.\n\nBut he said the studies called attention to the inconsistent quality of Her2 testing in many small laboratories. Laboratories can use commercially available tests or develop their own.\n\nDr. Soonmyung Paik, who presented the second study at the cancer conference, said the problem might lie not in sloppy testing but rather in the cutoff used to determine which women get Herceptin.\n\nDr. Paik, who is with the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project, said that about 40 percent of women had intermediate levels of Her2. They are now classified as negative but might still derive some benefit from the drug. On the other hand, he said, many women who are Her2-positive do not benefit from Herceptin. So better ways are needed to determine who should be treated.\n\n\u201cTo me, the take-home message is that we don\u2019t have a perfect test, unfortunately,\u201d Dr. Paik said.\n\nDr. Pamela M. Klein, an executive at Genentech, the manufacturer of Herceptin, said the company was continuing to explore how to best identify patients for the drug.\n\nThe fact that this uncertainty is occurring so long after the 1998 approval of Herceptin \u2014 the paragon of \u201cpersonalized medicine\u201d \u2014 suggests that it will not be so easy to tailor other drugs to patients based on gene or protein tests.\n\nIt left some doctors at the conference incredulous and uncertain how to treat their patients.\n\n\u201cHere we are, 10 years into it,\u201d said Dr. Marc L.

They found that the two groups had widespread differences in terms of brain connectivity.\n\nEEG revealed that the children with autism had a reduced short range connectivity, indicating poor function of local brain networks. This was especially true in the left hemisphere regions of the brain responsible for language.\n\nThe children with autism also had increased connectivity between brain regions that were farther apart, which might be a mechanism developed to compensate for reduced short range connectivity, the researchers said.\n\nThe research was conducted at Boston Children's Hospital and was published online June 25 in the journal BMC Medicine.\n\nThe use of EEG-based testing may help diagnose autism in children and may improve early detection in infants, leading to more effective treatments and coping strategies, the researchers said.\n\n\"What was unique about this study is the very large number of children studied,\" Dawson noted. \"Consistent with many previous studies using EEG and functional MRI with both children and adults with autism, these investigators found that, overall, children with autism show reduced coordination (coherence) across brain regions.\"\n\nShe said the findings are important because, \"they help us understand why individuals with autism have difficulty with complex behaviors, such as social interaction and language. As children's brains develop, the different brain regions become increasingly connected, allowing for the acquisition of complex behaviors that require coordination across different brain regions.\"\n\nLanguage, for example, requires coordination across the auditory, visual, and motor brain regions, as well as the participation of the prefrontal cortex, she said.\n\n\"This reduced functional connectivity in the brain helps us understand impairments associated with autism,\" she added. \"The hope is that early behavioral intervention can help mitigate these functional impairments, helping to form the connections that natural develop in typical children.\"\n\n\"Although autism is still principally a clinical diagnosis, this study ... may allow for a new approach to classifying children with autism and may even assist in the early identification of affected children at a younger age,\" said Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven & Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York in New Hyde Park, NY.\n\nThe number of children diagnosed with autism in the United States has recently increased to one in 88.\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more about autism.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Newswise \u2014 Omega-3 fatty acids may lower the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal obese women, according to researchers.\n\nThe protection likely comes from the fatty acids' anti-inflammatory effects, said Dr. Andrea Manni, professor and division chief of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism, Penn State College of Medicine.\n\nObesity is a major breast cancer risk factor in postmenopausal women, and scientists believe increased inflammation is an important underlying cause in this population.\n\n\"Omega-3 fatty acids have an anti-inflammatory effect, so that's one of the reasons why we suspected it may be particularly effective in obese women,\" Manni said.\n\nSome epidemiological data supports the idea that omega-3s protect against breast cancer, but the findings have been inconsistent. Manni suspected that data from normal-weight women obscured the results.\n\nNormal-weight women have less inflammation than heavier women, and are therefore less likely to benefit from anti-inflammatory omega-3s, he said.\n\nTo tease apart the effects, Manni's team, working alongside researchers from Emory University and Colorado State University, looked at the influence of prescription omega-3 supplementation on breast density in different weight women. Breast density is a well-established biomarker for breast cancer risk, and may be an independent risk factor, as well.\n\n\"The higher the breast density, the more likely the woman will develop breast cancer,\" Manni said.\n\nThe study included 266 healthy postmenopausal women with high breast density detected by routine mammograms. The women either received no treatment, the antiestrogen drug Raloxifene, the prescription omega-3 drug Lovaza or a combination of the two drugs.\n\nAt the conclusion of the two-year study, the researchers found that increasing levels of omega-3 in the blood were associated with reduced breast density\u2014but only in women with a body mass index above 29, bordering on obesity.\n\nAlthough Lovaza contains both of the fatty acids DHA -- 375 milligrams -- and EPA -- 465 milligrams, only DHA blood levels were associated with breast density reduction. The researchers plan to test the effect of DHA alone in obese subjects, potentially in combination with weight loss, in a future trial.\n\n\"The finding supports the idea that omega-3s, and specifically DHA, are preferentially protective in obese postmenopausal women,\" Manni said. \"This represents an example of a personalized approach to breast cancer prevention.\"\n\nThese findings may help to support future research looking at the direct effect of omega-3 supplementation on breast cancer incidence in obese women.\n\nManni added that, with obesity-related cancers on the rise, the findings could have implications beyond breast cancer.\n\nThe researchers also made a secondary discovery. Lovaza is an omega-3 drug FDA-approved for the treatment of severe high triglycerides at the dose of 4 milligrams daily. In the current study, the combination of Lovaza and a half recommended dose of Raloxifene at 30 milligrams, was superior to the individual treatments in reducing triglycerides and LDL -- \u201cbad\u201d -- cholesterol and increasing HDL -- \u201cgood\u201d -- cholesterol.\n\nOther investigators on this project were Narinder Sandhu and Carina Signori, Department of Medicine; Susann E.

But within 40 minutes of receiving a ketamine injection, their depressive symptoms improved; the effect persisted for at least three days.\n\nRight now, medications available for treating either major depression or bipolar illness can take weeks, or even months, to work, notes Dr. Carlos A. Zarate Jr. of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, one of the researchers on the study.\n\nAnd as a person waits for their medications to kick in, he added, they will continue to have difficulty working and coping with social and family life; they may even be having thoughts of suicide. \u201cWe want to alleviate the suffering and get them back to their life,\u201d he said.\n\nZarate and his colleagues had previously demonstrated that ketamine shots helped some patients with treatment-resistant unipolar depression, meaning they did not cycle through manic episodes. In the new study, they gave patients with bipolar illness ketamine or a placebo on two test days two weeks apart.\n\nAll of the patients were on lithium or valproate - two drugs commonly used for bipolar illness - but had not responded to treatment. Nearly all were unemployed, Zarate and his team note, and two-thirds were on psychiatric disability.\n\nCompared to placebo, patients showed significant improvement in mood within 40 minutes of receiving the ketamine infusion, using a common depression rating scale. Symptom improvement peaked two days after the injection, but remained significantly greater than for placebo for three days.\n\nSeventy-one percent of the patients responded to ketamine, meaning they had at least a 50 percent improvement in their depressive symptoms. Six percent responded to placebo.\n\nSide effects included anxiety, \u201cfeeling woozy or loopy,\u201d headache, and dissociative symptoms, meaning a temporary sense of disconnection from reality, although there were no serious adverse events. By developing more specifically targeted drugs, Zarate noted, it may be possible to treat patients effectively while avoiding these symptoms.\n\nKetamine appears to work by \u201cresetting\u201d the way nerve cells process glutamate, a brain chemical key for learning, memory, and other functions, according to Zarate. The problem in bipolar illness and depression, he explains, doesn\u2019t appear to be that a person has too much or too little glutamate; instead, it\u2019s likely that the way their neurons release and take up the chemical is out of whack.\n\nFirst introduced in 1962, ketamine is used legally in both human and veterinary medicine as an anesthetic. It\u2019s also a drug of abuse, at much higher doses than those used in Zarate\u2019s research; while patients in the current study received about 50 milligrams during a 40-minute period, a dose too low to induce anesthesia, recreational users of ketamine, known as \u201cSpecial K,\u201d may take hundreds of milligrams per week.\n\nIn 1999, US regulators classified ketamine as a Schedule III controlled substance, meaning it has the potential for abuse but is also useful medically.\n\nKetamine could improve treatment of bipolar illness and depression in a variety of ways, Zarate said; for example, as a means to jump-start standard drug treatment, or as an anesthetic before ECT. \u201cIt\u2019s opened the floodgate of many different directions of research, and all of them are quite encouraging,\u201d said Zarate, who along with a co-author has filed for a patent on the use of ketamine in depression. Those rights would be assigned to his employer, the National Institutes of Health.\n\nEfforts are already underway in Europe to develop guidelines for how ketamine should be used and prescribed to treat bipolar illness and depression, the researcher said.\n\nIn the US, research is continuing on the drug, he added, and some physicians are likely trying the drug in their patients with bipolar illness or depression who aren\u2019t helped by standard treatments. But, according to Zarate, more research is needed on how to use the drug in the safest and most effective way.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The quotes from Zarate are fresh \u2013 clearly not from a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "\u201cIt\u2019s promising that we can see an effect from a single dose,\u201d says researcher Leah Coles, PhD, a research fellow at the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne, Australia. \u201cThat effect might be even greater over the long term if they are drinking it day upon day.\u201d\n\nResearchers say that drop may seem small, but on a public health level a reduction like that would equate to a 10% reduction in deaths due to heart disease .\n\nThe study shows that within hours of drinking it, beet juice lowered systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading) by an average of 4-5 points among a small group of healthy men .\n\nDec. 14, 2012 -- Drinking a glass of beet juice may have an immediate impact on lowering blood pressure , according to a new study.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that beet juice, also known as beetroot juice, can lower blood pressure in a laboratory setting.

The studies simultaneously were published by the New England Journal of Medicine on a day that some experts called the \u201cSuper Bowl of lung cancer immunotherapy.\u201d\n\nThe reports underscore the increasingly important first-line role that immunotherapy, which unleashes the immune system to destroy cancer cells, is taking against the deadliest cancer.\n\n\u201cImmunotherapy is rapidly, in combination with other treatments and on its own, dramatically changing the standard of care for lung cancer,\u201d said Leena Gandhi, an oncologist at NYU Langone Health who led the study on the immunotherapy-chemotherapy combination, called Keynote-189. \u201cInstead of chemo being the backbone on which to improve, immunotherapy is now the backbone on which we build.\u201d\n\nLung cancer is the second-most-common malignancy in the United States, after breast cancer.

But the disease is so lethal that many patients don\u2019t survive long enough to try second- or third-line treatments, so researchers are trying to develop and use more effective approaches earlier.\n\nThe trial that grabbed much of the spotlight Monday is a randomized effectiveness study that involved more than 600 untreated patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer \u2014 a common type of the disease. The patients did not have cancer-causing mutations. One group was treated only with chemo, while the other got an immunotherapy drug called Keytruda plus chemo.

Still, he said, the approach was not a cure and there is a lot of room for improvement. The estimated proportion of patients in the combination therapy group who were alive and whose disease had not gotten worse at a year was about 34 percent, about double the proportion for the chemo-only group.\n\nLast May, the Food and Drug Administration approved the Keytruda-chemo combination based on an early-stage trial. But many doctors did not adopt it because the trial was small and didn\u2019t initially show a survival benefit, Gandhi said.\n\nExperts said it was especially significant that the study showed that patients benefited from the Keytruda-chemo combination regardless of the levels of a protein, called PD-L1, found on their cancer cells. Researchers already had known that patients with high levels of the protein were more likely to respond to immunotherapy.\n\nLast week, in a related development, Merck, which makes Keytruda, reported that a different trial showed that the medication prolonged survival even when used alone, compared with chemo. Experts said they will have to see more details before they can determine whether the medication is better used alone or with chemo.\n\nIn a second study published Monday, researchers used two other immunotherapy medications \u2014 Opdivo and Yervoy, both made by Bristol-Myers Squibb \u2014 to treat newly diagnosed patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with a high number of mutations in their tumors.\n\nThe patients experienced a significantly longer period during which their disease did not worsen, compared with people who received only chemotherapy, said Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center oncologist Matthew Hellmann, who led the study.\n\nHe said the results established the double-immunotherapy combination as a first-line treatment for patients with a high \u201ctumor mutational burden,\u201d but that it was too early to know whether the treatment leads to longer survival. And he said the trial showed that \u201ctumor mutational burden\u201d is a reliable way to predict who will benefit from the medications.\n\nAnother study published Monday used immunotherapy in a different way \u2014 for patients with early-stage lung cancer. Researchers at Johns Hopkins and Memorial Sloan Kettering gave patients two doses of Opdivo \u2014 the first a month before surgery, the second two weeks before the operation \u2014 to try to stimulate anti-tumor activity and reduce the risk of relapse.\n\nNine of the 20 patients who got Opdivo had a \u201cmajor pathologic response\u201d \u2014 a sharp reduction in the number of cancer cells found in the tumors removed by surgery.\n\nDrew Pardoll, director of Hopkins\u2019 Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, said that it is too early to know whether the findings will translate into longer survival. But if future studies show that, he added, then immunotherapy might be used to augment or even replace chemo typically given before surgery.\n\nImmunotherapy moves to the front lines in fight against lung cancer\n\nThe cancer death rate has dropped again.

Consumers have been advised to swap saturated (animal) fats \u2014 found in foods like whole milk, cheese, butter, and fatty cuts of beef and pork \u2014 for unsaturated vegetables oils.\n\nThe new report, which analyzed 40-year-old data from the Minnesota Coronary Experiment, found no association between lower cholesterol levels and longer life, suggesting that reducing the amount of saturated fat in the diet isn\u2019t enough to reduce risk of death from heart disease.\n\nA group of more than 9,000 people were divided into two groups; one group swapped out the dietary saturated fat for unsaturated vegetable fats in the form of corn oil and corn-oil margarine, and the other group continued with their standard daily saturated fat intake.\n\nWhile the diet rich in vegetable oil did lower cholesterol levels over the 4-5 year study period, compared to a control group (who continued to eat saturated fat daily), the researchers found no change in the rate of death from heart-related ailments.\n\nThe original MCE study was conducted between 1968 and 1973 at seven different long-term care facilities. Researchers from the National Institutes of Health and University of North Carolina obtained data from 2,355 of these participants \u2014 information which apparently had not been analyzed \u2014 and discovered that giving up saturated fats didn\u2019t protect against heart disease.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the corn oil or corn oil margarine consumed by the participants contained artery-clogging trans fats or hydrogenated vegetable oils that are now associated with heart disease, or whether the patients had a history of heart disease or genetic risk. All that is known is the participants had a normal cholesterol levels and normal blood pressure.\n\nBut even when their cholesterol levels were lowered by the switch from saturated fats, there was no longevity benefit. In fact, the study found that the lower the cholesterol, the greater the risk of death. But that\u2019s a misleading association because a variety of illnesses can also cause drop in cholesterol, which is unrelated to diet.\n\n\u201cWhat's important here is for us to understand what we know and what we don't know, and the conventional wisdom, the evidence that saturated fat and cholesterol in the diet are the main drivers of heart disease is not supported by the study,\u201d says cardiologist Dr. Steve Nissen, chair of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nWhile this study suggests that cholesterol levels alone are not associated with longevity, it is important to emphasize that many studies show the benefit of statin medications to lower blood cholesterol, that are highly associated with a reduced risk of death. Whether statins have additional properties to reduce risk, in addition to lowering serum cholesterol remain under study.\n\nHow does this translate to what we eat every day?\n\nCurrent worldwide guidelines remain the same, and are modeled after Mediterranean-style eating: a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and fish.\n\nSaturated fats can remain a part of a healthy diet, in limited amounts \u2013 but there are two easy ways to help:\n\u2022 Saturated fats should make up 10 percent of total caloric intake daily. For someone eating 2,000 calories, that\u2019s about 200 calories, or 20 grams of saturated fat\n\u2022 1/3 of the total fat consumed daily allocated for saturated fat; if consuming 60 grams of fat daily, no more than 20 grams should come from saturated fat.\n\nWhile the study has many limitations because it doesn\u2019t take into account genetic or lifestyle factors that are proven important in both heart disease risk and longevity, it suggests that blood cholesterol levels are only one factor.\n\nMadelyn Fernstrom, Ph.D is NBC News Health and Nutrition Editor.

CheckMate-025 is an example of how investigators are examining approved immunotherapy drugs to determine potential impact on other tumor types.\n\n\"Immunotherapy has long been believed to have the potential to make an impact in kidney cancer, but until now we had not been able to demonstrate such a significant survival benefit. We have a real opportunity to change clinical practice for patients when other therapies have failed,\" said principal investigator Padmanee Sharma, MD, PhD, professor, Departments of Genitourinary Medical Oncology and Immunology and scientific director of the Immunotherapy Platform, part of MD Anderson's Moon Shots Program.\n\n\"Through studies such as CheckMate-025, we are learning to target the patients' immune systems to fight cancer rather than targeting the tumor itself. This is a new way forward.\"\n\nIn the randomized phase III clinical trial, patients whose disease progressed on antiangiogenic therapies were treated with either nivolumab or everolimus. Median overall survival was 5.4 months longer with nivolumab (25 months) compared with everolimus (19.6 months).\n\nThe study included 821 patients with advanced RCC across 151 sites in 24 countries in North America, Europe, Australia, South America and Asia. All had previously been treated with one or two antiangiogenic therapies, drugs that inhibit the growth of new blood vessels, a critical component of cancer development. The median duration of treatment was 5.5 months with nivolumab and 3.7 months with everolimus.\n\nIn addition to demonstrating increased overall survival, the researchers showed a higher objective response rate - the number of patients who respond to the treatment - with nivolumab. Of the 821 patients enrolled, 25% responded to nivolumab versus 5% of those treated with everolimus.\n\nAmong these patients, partial responses were observed in 24% of those treated with nivolumab and 5% of patients treated with everolimus; complete responses were observed in 1% (four patients) treated with nivolumab and fewer than 1% (two patients) treated with everolimus.\n\nFurther, among patients who showed a response, the impact was \"durable,\" according to Sharma. While median progression-free survival appeared similar between treatments (4.6 months and 4.4 months with nivolumab and everolimus, respectively), when researchers explored a delayed progression-free survival benefit at six months, they reported 15.6 months with nivolumab and 11.7 months with everolimus. This ongoing response was observed among 44% of those treated with nivolumab and 36% of those treated with everolimus. More than 12 months later, 31% and 27% of patients treated with nivolumab and everolimus, respectively, continued to show a response.\n\nFor some patients, even after treatment with nivolumab ended, response to the drug continued. \"The immune system has a memory, so even when treatment has stopped, the body continues to exhibit a long-term response - meaning these patients can live normal lives without progressive disease.\"\n\nFinally, the investigators observed fewer treatment-related adverse events, including fatigue and nausea, and improved quality of life with nivolumab.\n\nThese results led the trial to be halted early in July 2015 when an assessment conducted by the independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) concluded that the study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating superior overall survival in patients receiving nivolumab.\n\nNivolumab blocks a T cell inhibitory signaling pathway known as PD-1 that controls the immune response and can prevent the immune system from attacking cancerous cells. The drug is approved for metastatic melanoma patients who show no response to other treatments and for advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with progression on or after chemotherapy. Based on the CheckMate-025 findings, earlier this month (September 16) the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to nivolumab for the potential indication of metastatic RCC. The Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of medicines with early signals of clinical benefit in serious diseases to help ensure patients have access to new therapies as soon as possible.\n\n\"The next questions are, 'how do we increase the number of patients who respond?' and 'how do we move immune checkpoint agents into the frontline setting?' - not just using them when other therapies have failed but intervening earlier,\" said Sharma. \"We're studying combination therapies to answer these questions and believe these studies will change the way we treat many cancers.\"\n\nEach year, there are 338,000 new cases of RCC diagnosed worldwide; it is the most common type of kidney cancer among adults and approximately 30% of patients present with metastatic disease at diagnosis, according to the scientific literature. A number of targeted therapies have been approved in recent years for the treatment of advanced RCC, with five antiangiogenic and two mTOR inhibitors (including everolimus; these drugs block a protein that regulates cell growth, proliferation, survival, etc.), showing benefits in pivotal phase III trials.\n\n\"While these treatments have changed the therapeutic landscape for RCC, they are associated with limited survival following emerging resistance to therapy,\" said Sharma. \"The overall survival benefit shown in this study sets a new benchmark for therapeutic strategies for advanced RCC patients in need of a second-line therapy.\"\n\nSharma is scientific director of MD Anderson's immunotherapy platform, which provides immune monitoring expertise to MD Anderson's 85 clinical trials of immunotherapy drugs as single agents or in combinations. Platform investigators conduct research to understand which patients will benefit from immunotherapy, to evaluate effective drug combinations and to identify new molecules that block or stimulate immune response.\n\nThe platform is part of MD Anderson's Moon Shots Program, which is designed to harness scientific knowledge and develop new technologies that will dramatically reduce cancer deaths through prevention, early detection and treatment.", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "The language of the release is somewhat hyperbolic given the small magnitude of the benefit.

[Brown University] -- New results from a clinical trial involving more than 900 military veterans at high risk for keratinocyte carcinoma skin cancer provides evidence that using the generic skin cream fluorouacil 5 percent for two to four weeks may reduce the risk of a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) needing surgery by 75 percent within a year.\n\nThe finding that less than one month's use of fluorouacil 5% (5-FU) appeared to prevent cancer for up to a year is encouraging, said lead author Dr. Martin A. Weinstock, a professor of dermatology in the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University and chief of dermatology at the Providence Veterans Affairs Medical Center.\n\nThe dose is the same as dermatologists currently employ to treat actinic keratosis. In a 2015 study, Weinstock and co-authors showed the up to four-week regimen of 5-FU had a multi-year preventive benefit in reducing the number of actinic keratosis (AK) and the need for treatment. Earlier this year, they also showed that the medicine prevents new AKs from emerging for two to three years.\n\nMeanwhile, current means for preventing new carcinomas in high-risk patients -- sunscreen or oral medications -- cease to work as soon as they are no longer used. But in the new study, 5-FU appeared to provide prolonged protection after discontinuation and could be combined with sunscreen, Weinstock said.\n\nIn the absence of such a long-lasting prevention option, he said, the typical approach to caring for patients with a history of prior carcinomas is to monitor for the next cancer and then remove it surgically -- an effective but imposing strategy often called \"wait and cut.\"\n\n\"People don't appreciate having stuff cut on their face a lot,\" said Weinstock, who led the trial funded by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and conducted at a dozen V.A. hospitals around the country. \"They do it if there is a cancer there, but we want to take a proactive approach where we can give them something to reduce their risk of getting new cancers.\"\n\nThe new results are published in JAMA Dermatology.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2013, the Veterans Affairs Keratinocyte Carcinoma Chemoprevention Trial randomly assigned 932 veterans who each had at least two prior basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) or SCCs to either receive the 5-FU cream or a cream just like it but without the active ingredient as an experimental control. All of the veterans were instructed to apply their cream twice a day to their face and ears for up to four weeks. They also received a 30 SPF sunscreen and received education about skin cancer, sunscreen and sun safety.\n\nThe two groups were both almost exclusively white and male, and they averaged 71 years of age. The experimental and control groups were very similar along all other measured characteristics, including their self- reported degree of prior sun exposure and sunburn. Veterans typically have spent a large amount of time in the sun during their years of service.\n\nBoth groups went to their V.A. center twice a year for two to four years for follow-up exams with a dermatologist. Neither the veterans nor the examining dermatologists knew who received 5-FU and who received the placebo.\n\nAfter the first year, 20 of the 464 veterans in the control group developed a squamous cell carcinoma that required surgery, but only five of the 468 veterans who got 5-FU did, a statistically significant 75 percent reduction in the risk, according to the study. For the subsequent three years, there was no longer a significant difference between the two groups in the number of patients who required surgical treatment for an SCC.\n\nFor BCCs, there was an 11 percent reduced risk after the first year among the group that received 5-FU, but that difference was not statistically significant. In the second year, BCC cases requiring surgery rose in the 5-FU group, but in years three and four, and by the end of the study, there was no significant overall difference in risk of developing a BCC requiring surgical treatment. After four years, 298 of all study the participants had developed at least one BCC, and 108 had developed at least one SCC.\n\nThe study did show a significant decrease in the risk of needing Mohs surgery to treat a BCC in the first year. Mohs surgery is more effective but also more elaborate and expensive than a conventional procedure, Weinstock said. In the study's first year, 36 BCCs were treated with Mohs surgery in 27 participants in the control group, but only 17 BCCs were treated with the procedure among 14 patients in the 5-FU group.\n\n\"This suggests that using the 5-FU can reduce the resources needed to treat these carcinomas,\" Weinstock said.\n\nThe cream does have common side effects including reddened, more sensitive and often crusty skin, effects that resolve when the application of the cream stops, Weinstock acknowledged. After the study's first six months, 21 percent of the 5-FU group rated the side effects as \"severe,\" and 40 percent rated them as \"moderate.\"\n\nBut after six months and again at the end of the four-year trial, 87 percent of participants in the 5-FU group said they'd be willing to repeat the treatment if it proved effective in reducing skin cancer.\n\nIn his clinical work, Weinstock said that for particularly high-risk patients, he has recommended 5-FU treatment. Based on the study results, it could be that patients need to renew their regimen with the cream every year.\n\n\"The most remarkable thing about this study is that now we have something to use that doesn't lose its effectiveness when you stop using it,\" Weinstock said. \"But this is the first study of its type. I'm hopeful there will be other studies that show other sorts of regimens that last longer and do a better job over time as science progresses. This is an important first step.\"\n\nHe and colleagues are planning further studies, including one to determine the cost-effectiveness of 5-FU treatment.\n\nIn addition to Weinstock, the new study has many authors from the VAKCC trial including at each of the study's 12 sites: Boston; Bay Pines, Fla.; Chicago, Ill.; Palo Alto, Calif.; Atlanta; Loma Linda Calif.; Minneapolis; Nashville; Denver; Durham, N.C.; Philadelphia; and Miami.", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "The release does not rely on unjustifiable language.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "The requested URL /usnews/health/articles/070805/13folate.htm was not found on this server.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "Does not appear to rely on a press release", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Amid a dry spell for breakthrough cancer drugs, recent U.S. approval of Eisai Co.'s Halaven represents some vindication for a small group of researchers who believe, contrary to recent pharmaceutical fashion, that molecules from nature hold promise against hard-to-treat diseases.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration's approval of Halaven in November for treating late-stage breast cancer was a triumph of chemistry and tenacious research.

But new tests for breast cancer risk mutations beyond the well-known BRCA genes would offer actionable information for many women and their doctors, a new study finds.\n\nThe BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations put women at high risk for breast, ovarian and other cancers, but mutations of other genes are believed to confer extra risk as well.\n\nEarlier this year, 17 genetic experts argued against testing for a wider panel of breast cancer-related gene mutations until they are proven to be valid and useful in clinical practice (see Reuters story of May 27, 2015 here: reut.rs/1TvOoDf).\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of controversy even among experts,\u201d said the senior author of the new study, Dr. Leif W.

Most of the women had a personal history of breast or ovarian cancer already.\n\nThe researchers found that 40 women, or 4 percent of the total group, did have potentially harmful mutations in other genes. Of those 40 women, 26 had mutations carrying low to moderate risk of breast or ovarian cancer, eight had mutations associated with Lynch syndrome, which increases colon and ovarian cancer risk, and three had high-risk breast cancer genes.\n\nIncluding another 23 patients who were referred into the study at a late stage, there were 63 women positive for non-BRCA mutations. Of those, the researchers decided that 33 would have been considered for additional screening or prevention measures based on their results. And for many, family testing would be recommended for first-degree relatives, according to the report in JAMA Oncology.\n\nEven among all appropriate candidates who are sent for genetic testing, only nine percent will test positive for the BRCA mutations, so an additional four percent who have non-BRCA mutations is a significant number, Ellisen said.\n\nOften these additional women do not have a high risk of breast or ovarian cancer, but some do have a high risk of colon or uterine cancer, and would be referred for additional screening, he said.\n\nMultigene testing is not more expensive than testing for the BRCA mutations alone, he said.\n\nThough these results indicate that additional genetic screening is clinically useful, some genetic test results will be uncertain, and it can be psychologically difficult for patients to deal with this uncertainty, Ellisen said.\n\n\u201cWe do not advocate for broad population-based screening,\u201d he said. \u201cThe interpretation of these tests is not a simple color-by-numbers thing.\u201d The vast majority of uncertain genes will be benign, but a misinterpretation could lead a patient to a drastic, unnecessary surgical procedure, he said.\n\n\u201cMany cancer genetics experts have again urged caution, characterizing the use of multigene testing in the clinical setting as premature,\u201d Dr. Elizabeth M.

August 7, 2018 - Montmorency tart cherries may play a role in improving gut health, suggests a first-of-its kind human trial of nine adults combined with a parallel laboratory study published in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry. An international team of scientists found that Montmorency tart cherries helped to positively impact the gut microbiome - a collection of trillions of bacteria and other microbes that live in the intestinal tract.\n\nThe microbiome has been the focus of multiple studies in recent years due to its potential role in maintaining digestive health, as well as its impact on immunity, heart health, blood sugar control, weight management and even brain health. The gut microbiome holds great promise, especially related to personalized nutrition, although the research is still evolving and larger, long-term human intervention studies are needed. However, the new study does suggest that Montmorency tart cherries can be added to the list of gut-friendly foods.\n\nWhile previous studies on Montmorency tart cherries have ranged from heart health and exercise recovery to sleep, this is the first study to explore the potential gut health benefits. The researchers speculate that it may be due to the polyphenols (anthocyanins and other flavonoids) in Montmorency tart cherries, the varietal of tart cherries grown in the U.S. Polyphenols in plant-based foods are broken down by microbes to stimulate growth of good bacteria.\n\n\"Montmorency tart cherries were a logical food to study due to their unique composition of polyphenols, including chlorogenic acids,\" said principal investigator Franck Carbonero, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Food Science at the University of Arkansas. \"Our results suggest that the unique polyphenol mixture in tart cherries may help positively shape the gut microbiome, which could potentially have far-reaching health implications.\"\n\nResearchers conducted both human and laboratory experiments to determine the impact of Montmorency tart cherries on the microbiome. In the human trial, nine healthy adults, 23-30 years old, drank 8 ounces of Montmorency tart cherry juice (from concentrate) daily for five days. These individuals were non-smokers and had not taken antibiotics (which can affect the microbiome) in the 12 weeks prior and during the study. Using stool samples, the participants' microbiome was analyzed before and after the dietary intervention, and food frequency questionnaires were used to evaluate their overall diet.\n\nThe laboratory experiments were set up to mimic the conditions within the human digestive system, specifically the stomach, small intestine and three regions of the colon, to study how polyphenols are broken down and absorbed. This process of breakdown and absorption can have a significant impact on the body's ability to use the beneficial bioactive compounds in plant-based foods. The researchers tested U.S.-grown Montmorency tart cherries, European tart cherries, sweet cherries, apricots and isolated polyphenols in each simulated region of the digestive tract. They analyzed changes in the mix of bacteria and how these bacteria helped digest the polyphenols over time.\n\nIn the human trial, the microbiome was positively altered (primarily measured by the increase in good bacteria) after just five days of drinking Montmorency tart cherry concentrate, although there were strikingly different responses due to the participants' initial microbiome composition. Individuals who ate a more Western diet (low in fruits, vegetables and fiber) potentially had a lower ability to metabolize polyphenols, thereby reducing bioavailability and any potential health benefits in the tart cherries. Remarkably, in these subjects, instead of Bifidobacterium, Collinsella were the beneficial polyphenol-degrading bacteria stimulated. The individuals who ate a more plant-based diet, with higher intakes of carbohydrates and fiber, responded with an increase in Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium, presumably because of the specific combination of polysaccharides and polyphenols.\n\nWhile more research is needed, these results suggest individuals consuming a more plant-based diet may have a mix of gut bacteria that responds more positively and/or rapidly to tart cherry consumption. Individuals consuming a more Western diet that is lower in carbohydrates and fiber may have a lower/different ability to metabolize polyphenols, thereby altering bioavailability and any potential health benefits.\n\nThe laboratory experiments found that pure polyphenols characteristics of tart cherries increased the amount of Bifidobacterium. However, when concentrated juices were fermented, this bifidogenic effect appeared to be leveled out by the larger increase of polysaccharides utilizing bacteria. Somewhat surprisingly, Carbonero said, chemistry analyses showed that tart cherries polyphenols were not completely converted to smaller phenolic metabolites, suggesting that the full diversity of bacterial species in the human gut is required for efficient breakdown of the polyphenols in tart cherries.\n\nWhile the dietary intervention was based on a limited number of human volunteers and more research is needed to support these conclusions, the results help build the foundation for future research and suggest Montmorency tart cherries can play a role in positively shaping the microbiome and maintaining gut health.\n\nMontmorency tart cherries are the most common variety of tart cherries grown in the U.S., and are available year-round in dried, frozen, canned, and juice forms - including juice concentrate, which was the form used in this human trial. Montmorency tart cherry juice concentrate can be mixed with water or other juices. It can also be consumed straight from the bottle or used as an ingredient in recipes, such as smoothies and other beverages.\n\nThis study was made available online in April 2018 ahead of peer-review and publication this month.\n\nMayta-Apaza AC, Pottgen E, De Bodt J, et al.

Scott Turner, MD, PhD, director of the Memory Disorders Program at Georgetown University Medical Center. Turner, who treats patients at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, cautions that the findings cannot be used to recommend resveratrol. \"This is a single, small study with findings that call for further research to interpret properly.\"\n\nThe resveratrol clinical trial was a randomized, phase II, placebo-controlled, double blind study in patients with mild to moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. An \"investigational new drug\" application was required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to test the pure synthetic (pharmaceutical-grade) resveratrol in the study. It is not available commercially in this form.\n\nThe study enrolled 119 participants. The highest dose of resveratrol tested was one gram by mouth twice daily -- equivalent to the amount found in about 1,000 bottles of red wine.\n\nJohn Bozza, 80, participated in the study. Five years ago, his wife, Diana, began noticing \"something wasn't quite right.\" He was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, but only a year later, his condition progressed to mild Alzheimer's.\n\nDiana, whose twin sister died from the same disease, says there are multiple reasons she and John decided to participate in the resveratrol study, and they now know he was assigned to take the active drug.\n\n\"I definitely want the medical community to find a cure,\" she says. \"And of course I thought there's always a chance that John could have been helped, and who knows, maybe he was.\"\n\nPatients, like John, who were treated with increasing doses of resveratrol over 12 months showed little or no change in amyloid-beta40 (Abeta40) levels in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. In contrast, those taking a placebo had a decrease in the levels of Abeta40 compared with their levels at the beginning of the study.\n\n\"A decrease in Abeta40 is seen as dementia worsens and Alzheimer's disease progresses; still, we can't conclude from this study that the effects of resveratrol treatment are beneficial,\" Turner explains. \"It does appear that resveratrol was able to penetrate the blood brain barrier, which is an important observation. Resveratrol was measured in both blood and cerebrospinal fluid.\"\n\nThe researchers studied resveratrol because it activates proteins called sirtuins, the same proteins activated by caloric restriction. The biggest risk factor for developing Alzheimer's is aging, and studies with animals found that most age-related diseases--including Alzheimer's--can be prevented or delayed by long-term caloric restriction (consuming two-thirds the normal caloric intake).\n\nTurner says the study also found that resveratrol was safe and well tolerated. The most common side effects experienced by participants were gastrointestinal-related, including nausea and diarrhea. Also, patients taking resveratrol experienced weight loss while those on placebo gained weight.\n\nOne outcome in particular was confounding, Turner notes. The researchers obtained brain MRI scans on participants before and after the study, and found that resveratrol-treated patients lost more brain volume than the placebo-treated group.\n\n\"We're not sure how to interpret this finding. A similar decrease in brain volume was found with some anti-amyloid immunotherapy trials,\" Turner adds. A working hypothesis is that the treatments may reduce inflammation (or brain swelling) found with Alzheimer's.\n\nThe study, funded by the National Institute on Aging and conducted with the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study, began in 2012 and ended in 2014.

In a study published this week in mBio\u00ae, an open-access journal of the American Society for Microbiology, the team shows that a live, attenuated version of the Zika virus could form the basis of a new treatment option for this fatal brain cancer.\n\nGlioblastoma kills about 15,000 adults in the US each year and is currently incurable because patients experience a high recurrence rate of their cancer even after the standard treatments of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Scientists suspect this recurrence is due to cancer stem cells, called glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), which hide out in nearby brain tissue even after the combination of therapies.\n\n\"During the Zika epidemic, we learned that the virus preferentially infects neural progenitor cells in the fetus, and causes the devastating microcephaly seen in babies born to infected mothers,\" says Pei-Yong Shi, a virologist at University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. He co-led the current study with tumor biologist Jianghong Man of the National Center of Biomedical Analysis in Beijing and virologist Cheng-Feng Qin of the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences in Beijing.\n\n\"We made the connection that perhaps Zika virus could also specifically infect the GSCs,\" because these cells have similar properties to neural stem cells, says Man. In previous work, Shi and his collaborators at Washington University in St. Louis showed that Zika virus did indeed attack and kill GSCs grown in the lab dish and in a mouse model of glioblastoma. In addition, the Zika virus was much less efficient at attacking the differentiated, healthy brain cells. (image: transmission electron micrograph of Zika virus, NIAID)\n\n\"If we could find a way to specifically target those GSCs that are the source of recurrence, then that might provide an option to prevent recurrence or even a cure,\" says Qin.\n\nThe team's first objective was to determine if there was a safe way to use Zika virus in patients to attack the cancer cells. Shi's lab has developed a promising live-attenuated Zika vaccine candidate called ZIKV-LAV that had been shown to be safe, non-virulent, and effective in protecting against infection in mice and non-human primates. The ZIKV-LAV has a small deletion from the viral genome that prevents it from replicating itself efficiently.\n\nWhen the team injected this ZIKV-LAV into the brains of mice, they saw no health effects on the mice, no weight loss, and no behavioral abnormalities such as loss of appetite, depression, lethargy, or self-injury. The mice also functioned normally in tests for anxiety and motor function.\n\nNext, the team wanted to show whether the ZIKA-LAV could work to infect and kill human patient-derived GSCs in a mouse model. So they mixed GSCs from two different human patient donors with the ZIKA-LAV and injected the mixture into the brains of mice. Mice that got the injection of the GSCs only rapidly developed tumors. Mice that got the ZIKV-LAV injected as well saw a significant delay in tumor development. Co-implanting the virus along with the GSCs also prolonged the median survival time of the treated mice to around 50 days, compared to around 30 days for the untreated mice who received GSCs alone.\n\nQin says that perhaps in the future patients would be given the Zika vaccine at the same time as surgery to \"let the viruses hunt down the GSCs and eliminate them.\"\n\nFinally, the team investigated the cellular mechanisms that the modified Zika virus used to kill the GSCs. They took GSCs treated with the ZIKV-LAV and those GSCs not treated and sequenced all the RNA messages being expressed in these two cell populations. Comparing those profiles, the team found that in the treated cells, the virus triggered a strong antiviral response in the cells, which induced inflammation and eventually cell death.\n\nNext, the team will work with clinicians to develop safety tests of the ZIKV-LAV in glioblastoma patients. They may also modify the Zika virus further to make it an even more potent cancer cell killing machine. For example, Man explains, the researchers could add an immune modulator as a 'cargo' in the viral genome. Then, once such a virus infects a cancer cell and kills it, the immune modulator would be released to alert and activate the patient's systemic immune system against the remaining cancer cells.\n\n\"As a virologist, I see that we should take advantage of the 'bad' side of viruses,\" says Shi. \"They should have a role to play in cancer treatment.\"\n\nThe American Society for Microbiology is the largest single life science society, composed of more than 30,000 scientists and health professionals.

The test is administered like a tuberculin skin test (TST), and results are interpreted by measuring the size of the skin induration two or three days later.\n\nThe TST is the most commonly used test to detect TB infection, with about 50 million tests worldwide each year, according to the World Health Organization. The test is easy to administer but produces too many false positives to achieve the WHO's goal of reducing TB deaths by 95 percent and new cases by 90 percent by 2035, Dr. Ruhwald said.\n\nIntroduced a decade ago, IGRAs have high specificity, producing few false positives, but require blood samples and complicated lab work, which has limited their widespread use. There is also a dramatic price difference between the two diagnostic tests. According to Dr. Ruhwald, a TST costs about $2; an IGRA is 20 to 40 times more expensive depending on setting.\n\nIn the first clinical trial, Dr. Ruhwald and colleagues conducted a double-blinded study of C-Tb in 979 participants enrolled at 13 clinical trial sites in Spain. Participants, all adults, ranged in TB status from presumed uninfected through intermediate and high risk of latent TB to active disease.\n\u2022 Both C-Tb and the IGRA had a specificity of 97 percent.\n\u2022 C-Tb was highly concordant to IGRA in 95 percent of study participants.\n\u2022 The specificity of C-Tb, unlike the TST, was not impacted by the BCG vaccine, the partially effective vaccine that many residents in the developing world receive. TST specificity in this group was only 62 percent.\n\u2022 The sensitivity of C-Tb was comparable to the IGRA in confirmed TB cases (77 percent vs. 81 percent), indicating similar abilities to detect infection.\n\nIn the second double-blinded trial, researchers were primarily concerned with testing how accurate C-Tb was in HIV-positive patients and in young children--populations in which the accuracy of the TST and the IGRA is known to be compromised. The study, conducted in South Africa, enrolled 1,090 participants, including 299 patients with HIV and 402 children as young as 28 days.\n\u2022 Among participants with HIV, the ability of all three tests to detect TB infection was diminished, though the C-Tb appeared more robust in HIV-infected participants with low CD4 T cell counts.\n\u2022 Among children under 5, C-Tb was comparable with the other two tests in identifying those infected.\n\nDr. Ruhwald said another advantage of C-Tb is that the measurement of infection, a 5mm or larger induration, is universal across patients with different risk factors, including HIV infection. With TST, the size of the induration is often adjusted to increase its accuracy in measuring infection in different patient populations.\n\nRegulatory approval for C-Tb is currently being sought and Statens Serum Institute is actively seeking a commercial partner for marketing of C-Tb. The cost of a C-Tb test is to be determined; however, it is expected to be significantly less than an IGRA.\n\nDiagnostic Accuracy of the Novel C-Tb Skin Test for Latent M.tuberculosis Infection; Results from Two Phase III Clinical Trials \n\nM.

C-Tb combines the field friendliness of the PPD-based Tuberculin Skin Test (TST), with the high specificity of the interferon gamma release assays (IGRA).\n\nThis presentation outlines the results from two recently completed phase III trials (TESEC-05 and -06). The results have not previously been published or presented.\n\nThe TESEC-06 trial included 979 participants from 13 clinical trial sites in Catalonia, Galicia and Basque Country (Spain) with various risk profiles of M.tuberculosis infection. The TESEC-05 trial included 1090 participants with symptoms of TB and 100 endemic controls from Cape Town (South Africa).\n\nIn both trials C-Tb and TST were administered in a double-blinded fashion to one or the other forearm. Skin indurations were read 2 to 3 days later. A reading ?5mm was considered positive for the TST and C-Tb (cut off preset in phase II). Blood for IGRA testing (Quantiferon, QFT-GIT) was drawn prior to skin testing.\n\nThe safety profile of C-Tb was acceptable and not different from TST. Test specificity was assessed in 212 presumed unexposed Spanish controls. Here, C-Tb had comparable specificity to QFT-GIT (both 97%, p=1.0, and there was no impact of BCG vaccination). By contrast, previous BCG vaccination subverted TST specificity [62% (67/108) in BCG vaccinated compared to 95% (99/104) in BCG unvaccinated persons; (p<0.001)]. Sensitivity of C-Tb and QFT-GIT was comparable in patients with confirmed TB [77% (235/307) vs 81% (250/307); p=0.08]. In contacts, mirroring the findings with QFT-GIT, there was a strong trend in increasing C-Tb test positivity with M. tuberculosis exposure (figure 1). The impact of age and HIV infection on C-Tb, TST and QFT reactivity was assessed in 1090 individuals with symptoms suspect of TB disease, analysis is ongoing and will be included in the presentation.\n\nThese phase III trial results demonstrate that C-Tb is safe, has comparable diagnostic performance to QFT-GIT and addresses the problem of false positive TST results in BCG vaccinated persons.\n\nThe field-friendliness and high specificity offered by the C-Tb test could allow for improved targeted treatment of M. tuberculosis-infected persons in also in resource-constrained settings, where IGRAs are too complicated to implement.", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "The release does not appear to use any unjustifiable language.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "LONDON (Reuters) - A hormone called DHEA and mostly secreted by the adrenal glands may be able to help women who are going through menopause and could also give them better sex lives, a study found on Tuesday.\n\nItalian researchers writing in the journal of the International Menopause Society, Climacteric, said they had found the first robust evidence that low doses of DHEA can help sexual function and menopausal symptoms, suggesting it may one day become an alternative to hormone replacement therapy (HRT).\n\nBut they stressed that the trial was small, so far larger studies are needed to confirm the results.\n\n\u201cWe must bear in mind that this is a pilot study with a small sample,\u201d Anna Fenton, co-editor of Climacteric, said in commentary on the work. \u201cWe can\u2019t yet say that this study means that DHEA is a viable alternative to HRT, but ... we should be looking to do larger studies to confirm these initial results.\u201d\n\nDHEA, or dehydroepiandrosterone, is a natural steroid hormone mostly made in the adrenal glands and has a variety of therapeutic uses.\n\nHRT, which is a combination of the hormones oestrogen and progesterone, is an approved treatment for women going through the menopause, who often experience unpleasant symptoms such as hot flushes, night sweats, loss of sex drive and mood swings.\n\nBut sales of HRT drugs have fallen sharply since a large study in 2002 found higher rates of ovarian cancer, breast cancer and strokes in women who took the pills, and the search has since been on for alternatives.\n\nAmerican researchers said in January that the antidepressant Lexapro, made by drugmaker Forest Laboratories, significantly cut the number and severity of hot flushes in menopausal women, and other antidepressants including GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s Paxil and the Pfizer drugs Prozac and Effexor also have been found to be effective.\n\nFor this trial, a team of researchers led by Andrea Genazzani of the University of Pisa followed a group of 48 post-menopausal women with troubling symptoms.\n\nOver a year, 12 women took vitamin D and calcium, 12 took DHEA, 12 took standard HRT and 12 took a synthetic steroid called tibolone which is used to alleviate menopausal symptoms.\n\nThe women\u2019s menopausal symptoms, sexual interest and activity were measured using a standard questionnaire that explores factors such as satisfaction with frequency of sex, vaginal lubrication, orgasm, and sexual partner.\n\nAfter 12 months, all the women on hormone replacements had improvements in menopausal symptoms, but those taking vitamin D and calcium did not show any significant improvement.\n\nAt the start of the trial, all groups had similar sexual activity, but after the year, those taking calcium and vitamin D scored an average of 34.9 on the questionnaire scale, while those taking DHEA had a score of 48.6, showing that those on DHEA had more sexual interest and activity.\n\nThe results for the HRT group were similar, and both the HRT DHEA groups showed a higher level of sexual intercourse in comparison to the control group, the researchers said.\n\nGenazzani said the results showed DHEA has potential, especially for those women who may have problems in taking more conventional HRT. \u201cBut this is a small study, a proof of concept.

What's more, the drug carries a risk of bone damage, stunted growth and heart trouble, and can render children impotent.\n\nThese experts contend that Lupron, costing about $5,000 a month but seldom covered by insurance, is one of many treatments that cash in on the desperation of parents trying to cope with an incurable condition for which medicine has few good answers outside of painstaking behavioral therapy.\n\n\"Not only is there no scientific backing whatsoever for Lupron treatments, there are several major concerns for the children's health,\" said neurologist BethAnn McLaughlin, an adviser to the Dan Marino Foundation autism group in Weston and the mother of two developmentally disabled children.\n\n\"These people are preying on the fears of parents. We cannot be using these children who are so vulnerable as guinea pigs in a medical experiment.\"\n\nUntested autism treatments have flourished while science struggles to explain the disorder, which disrupts the abilities to speak, concentrate, connect with people and control impulses.\n\nFor unknown reasons, autism has been on the rise for the past few decades, with an estimated 675,000 children \u2013 about one in 100 \u2013 now having mild to severe symptoms. Scientists believe it stems from genetic defects that may only cause problems after an environmental trigger.\n\nA vocal subset of parents and activists blame vaccines, especially those with the mercury-based preservative thimerosal, which has been banned from virtually all as a precaution. Numerous studies have found no connection between autism and vaccines or thimerosal.\n\nLupron therapy grew from the mercury camp. Baltimore researcher Dr. Mark Geier started using the drug in 2005 on the theory \u2013 disputed by mainsteam doctors \u2013 that testosterone binds mercury in the body and that many autistic kids have high levels of the hormone.\n\nLupron halts production of the female hormone estrogen, which the body uses to make testosterone. The drug mainly is used to treat endometrial cancer in women and prostate cancer in men, and sometimes to chemically castrate sex offenders.\n\nGeier's promotional materials said he has treated hundreds of children with Lupron and has launched nine ASD Centers in eight states. In his latest, he teams with Dr. David Clayman, a Boca Raton radiologist who has an autistic teen son and is opening an ASD office beside his MRI center in Tamarac.\n\nClayman said he would not comment until he treats patients with Lupron therapy for a year. Geier could not be reached for comment despite several attempts by phone. He told one parent he did not plan to comment for this story.\n\nThe medical group began recruiting Florida patients in March when Geier spoke at a Fort Lauderdale conference for parents of children with autism.\n\nTeresa Badillo was at the meeting. Her family has searched in vain for a way to help their autistic son, Marco, 18. Badillo said he has little speech or interaction with others, but is doing OK in high school. Lately, though, Marco has grown more aggressive, physical and rebellious.\n\n\"We were basically under seige in this house,\" Badillo said. \"This kind of behavior is more scary at 18 [than] at 3. I had choices to make. If you see there is another option out there that can help your child, most parents are going to choose that option.\"\n\nAlso, Marco had discovered sex and sometimes touched himself inappropriately in public, a common problem among those with autism.\n\n\"The kids don't understand. They have impulses. It's what happens when you have high testosterone,\" Badillo said.\n\nThe family put Marco on Lupron about six weeks ago. He gets two injections a month at a dosage larger than used on adult cancer patients, plus a small daily shot.\n\n\"The therapy immediately stopped the aggression,\" Badillo said. \"This is not castrating a kid. It's just lowering the [testosterone] levels enough to normal range so the kid is not aggressive.\"\n\nShe said Geier plans to continue the Lupron for several months to see if it helps Marco's other autistic behavior. She said she knows the drug has risks but believes Lupron critics do not fully grasp the hard realities of life with an autistic child.\n\nLupron critics said autism parents may not understand the dangers.\n\nThe drug is not approved for children \u2013 except a rare few with premature puberty \u2013 because it can impair bone development crucial to growth, said Dr. Gary Berkovitz, chief of pediatric endocrinology at the University of Miami medical school.\n\nIt's not recommended for people with heart disease, kidney disease, asthma, depression or seizures because it can worsen those conditions. Autistic children are prone to seizures.\n\n\"It has not been tested so there's no way to know if it has adverse effects in the long run,\" Berkovitz said.\n\nSaid neurologist McLaughlin: \"We have very significant concerns about irreversible damage to sexual function and the brain and sex organs of these children.\"\n\nIn addition, the Food and Drug Administration is investigating complaints that Lupron causes diabetes in adults.\n\nGeier published a 2006 study contending that 11 autistic children taking Lupron did better on tests of awareness, sociability and behavior. He has since issued other studies finding that mercury leads to excess testosterone and that autistic children have excessive levels of the hormone.\n\nOther doctors said Geier's studies were small, were not scientifically sound and were published in journals that do not follow the standard practice of having experts review the methods.\n\nThe area's largest autism treatment center jointly run by the University of Miami and Nova Southeastern University, as well as another at Florida Atlantic University, frown on Lupron and other untested therapies, officials at the centers said.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "This story did not rely on a news release.\u00a0 Strong enterprise reporting.

Peled of Peled Plastic Surgery, San Francisco. He hopes his new technique will \"lower the bar to adoption\" of effective surgical treatment for patients with this debilitating headache condition.\n\nIn recent years, surgery has emerged as an effective treatment option for selected patients with chronic, severe headaches. Developed by plastic surgeons who noticed that some migraine patients had fewer headaches after cosmetic forehead-lift, these procedures address \"trigger sites\" linked to certain headache patterns.\n\nSevere temporal headaches can result from muscle spasms or enlarged blood vessels putting pressure on specific nerves located on the side of the head--specifically, the zygomaticotemporal branch of the trigeminal nerve (ZTBTN) and sometimes the auriculotemporal nerve (ATN). During these operative procedures, surgeons seek to relieve pressure on these nerves or to disconnect the nerves in order to prevent them from triggering future headaches.\n\nThe technique is a new use of an approach that many surgeons are already familiar with: the Gillies incision, used for surgical repair of cheekbone fractures. Dr. Peled found that this short incision, placed in the temple behind the hairline, provides direct access to the ZTBTN and ATN. He describes his initial experience with the new approach in 19 patients.\n\nAll patients had chronic temporal headaches that did not improve with medications. They also had a positive result on preoperative testing--either injection of botulinum toxin (Botox) to temporarily block muscle activity, or local anesthetics to temporarily block the involved nerve. Before and after surgery, headache symptoms were assessed using a standard score, the Migraine Headache Index (MHI).\n\nAs in previous studies, surgery provided significant relief from chronic temporal headaches. Average MHI score decreased from about 132 points before surgery to 52 points afterward. Of the 19 patients, 16 had at least a 50 percent reduction in headache symptoms.\n\nIt's unclear why the three remaining patients didn't have good improvement, although Dr. Peled notes that two of the three had had temporal headaches for decades before surgery. None of the patients experienced complications, and there was little or no visible scarring.\n\nThe experience supports a growing body of research showing good outcomes with surgery for chronic temporal headaches. Most recently, a study in Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery reported similar results whether the nerve is decompressed or disconnected. However, previous studies have used technically more complex approaches to access the ZTBTN.\n\nThe simplified approach using the Gillies incision combines the advantages of other approaches to chronic temporal headache surgery while minimizing the disadvantages, Dr. Peled believes.

Surgery, radiation, or some combination of both may lead to miserable side effects such incontinence, impotence and rectal damage. Doctors usually can\u2019t predict whether a man will suffer all or none of those side effects. While some risk factors are well-known -- including age, diabetes and poor cardiovascular health -- whether a man suffers harsh side-effects is often chalked up to random luck.\n\nSo what if it were possible to know before treatment which men might be more likely to suffer complications?\n\nNew research, published Thursday in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology, discovered a set of genetic markers that appear to indicate a significantly greater risk of collateral damage from radiation treatment for prostate cancer. Knowing a man\u2019s susceptibility to fallout from radiation may steer a doctor toward surgery instead of other potentially damaging therapy.\n\n\u201cMore often than not, it\u2019s not clear-cut which way to go,\u201d explained Barry Rosenstein, professor of radiation oncology at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. \u201cIf you see a surgeon, he\u2019s likely to say surgery is best. If you see a radiation oncologist he\u2019ll say oncology.\u201d\n\nDetermining what type of treatment a man should receive is only part of the dilemma of prostate cancer. The debate whether to even test for it is ongoing. This early-stage study represents a big step toward doctors and their patients making that decision.\n\nThe researchers started with a pool of 841 men treated with radiation for prostate cancer. Patients were assessed every three to six months for signs of sexual dysfunction for up to five years. The number of men studied was eventually winnowed down to 260 patients with erectile dysfunction and 205 controls.\n\nThe scientists then performed DNA analyses on the men, looking for genetic variations called single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs (pronounced snips), slight differences in the \u201cspelling\u201d of our DNA. After sifting through hundreds of thousands of SNPs, they settled on 12 suspect genetic variations.\n\nIt turned out that when the SNPs were combined to create a score that could be used to measure individual risk of treatment complications, having just one of the 12 SNPs more than doubled the risk. The more of the 12 a man had, the greater his chances of radiation therapy complications.\n\n\u201cIt is cumulative,\u201d Rosenstein explained. \u201cIf a man has five or six, it increases his chances quite a bit.\u201d\n\nThe research is still in the early stages, so doctors aren\u2019t likely to be using the genetic markers to determine treatment any time soon. \u201cThis is still not nearly good enough, yet\u201d he said.\n\nBut he\u2019s part of an international consortium that is trying to make that very scenario a practical reality. The next step, he said, is for group members to validate the predictive power of the markers his team found.\n\nIf they can, then doctors really will be \u201cable to assign patients to treatments and see if we maintain the same level of control of cancer and lower the incidence of complications,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if we can do that, then there\u2019ll be enough confidence to put it into use in the clinic.\u201d\n\nEven better, he suggested, it may one day be possible to use drugs to target the SNiPs, or the biological processes they influence, as a way to prevent damage from therapy.\n\nThat hope is evident to other researchers, such as Dr. Ithaar Derweesh, a urologic oncologist and associate professor of surgery at the University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center.\n\n\"This is a study that in certain ways is groundbreaking and also elegantly performed,\" Derweesh said.\n\nWhile Derweesh agreed with Rosenstein that such a technique will take time to validate, and be used to steer patients toward a particular therapy -- something he called the \"holy grail\" -- he suggested that in the nearer term, such markers might be used as a trigger to pre-emptively begin erectile rehabilitation or to take measures that might lessen the potential damage.\n\nThis kind of work is important not just for prostate cancer, but all cancers. While there has been greater success in treating cancer, survivors may live many years with side effects after treatment. If Rosenstein\u2019s hopes are fulfilled, it may one day be possible to prevent some of the damage before it\u2019s done, and still effectively treat the cancer.\n\nBrian Alexander (www.BrianRAlexander.com) is co-author, with Larry Young Ph.D., of \"The Chemistry Between Us: Love, Sex and the Science of Attraction,\" (www.TheChemistryBetweenUs.com), now on sale.\n\u2022 Pregnant women with cancer on the rise.

The study included a liquid pharmaceutical formulation of CBD, called Epidiolex, which is manufactured by GW Pharmaceuticals and has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. GW Pharmaceuticals funded the clinical trial.\n\nFor the study, 120 children and adolescents with Dravet Syndrome between the ages of 2 and 18 years were randomized across 23 sites in the United States and Europe to receive either CBD 20 mg/kg or placebo added to their existing treatment over a 14-week period. Seizure frequency was tracked for one month prior to the study for baseline readings, and during the course of the study.\n\nSpecifically, seizure frequency dropped in the CBD-treated group by 39 percent from a median of nearly 12 convulsive seizures per month before the study to about six; three patients' seizures stopped entirely. In the placebo group, there was a 13 percent reduction in seizures from about 15 monthly seizures to fourteen.

Eight participants from the CBD group withdrew from the trial due to side effects compared to one participant in the placebo group.\n\nThe new study confirms results from a December 2015 open-label expanded access program led by Dr. Devinsky that reported reductions in seizure frequency. In that program, both the researchers and patient's families knew they were receiving CBD, which may have introduced a bias into the results.

The experimental technology, developed by Cedars-Sinai and NeuroVision, scans the retina using techniques that can identify beta-amyloid protein deposits that mirror those in the brain.\n\nAccumulations of neurotoxic beta-amyloid protein can be detected with positron emission tomography, or PET scans, and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid, but these are invasive, inconvenient and costly, making them impractical for routine screening and follow-up evaluation.\n\n\"This is the first study demonstrating the potential to image and quantify retinal findings related to beta-amyloid plaques noninvasively in living patients using a retinal scan with high resolution. This clinical trial is reinforced by an in-depth exploration of the accumulation of beta-amyloid in the retina of Alzheimer's patients versus matched controls, and a comparison analysis between retina and brain pathologies. Findings from this study strongly suggest that retinal imaging can serve as a surrogate biomarker to investigate and monitor Alzheimer's disease,\" said Maya Koronyo-Hamaoui, Ph.D., an associate professor of Neurosurgery and Biomedical Sciences and a research scientist at the Maxine Dunitz Neurosurgical Institute at Cedars-Sinai, and a co-founder, inventor and scientist at NeuroVision.

Therefore, screening and early detection may be crucial to our efforts to turn the tide against the growing threat of this devastating disease.\"\n\nSteven Verdooner, NeuroVision CEO, said the imaging system leverages the company's expertise in autofluorescence imaging of the retina using a specialized ophthalmic camera and sophisticated image processing software. \"It's exciting to see these studies demonstrating the power of the technology applied to the Alzheimer's field. Our goal is to develop a product that is easy to use, affordable and widely accessible. We look forward to the potential of retinal imaging playing a vital role in solving the problem of Alzheimer's, both in identifying and monitoring those who may be affected by the disease.

They also provide detailed analyses and several new findings on Alzheimer's pathology in the retina, results of research with donated eyes and brains of 37 deceased patients, 23 with confirmed Alzheimer's disease and 14 controls.\n\nAmong key findings, the researchers report a 4.7-fold increase in retinal plaque burden in patients with Alzheimer's, compared to controls, and they provide observations regarding geometric distribution and layer location of amyloid pathology in the retina. With the imaging technology's ability to detect autofluorescence signal related to retinal beta-amyloid, these findings may lead to a practical approach for large-scale identification of the at-risk population and monitoring of Alzheimer's, the researchers say.\n\nThe article provides new insights into the disease's manifestations in the retina and information on the optical imaging system. Here are several highlights:\n\u2022 The first histologic quantitative analysis of retinal plaque clusters, or \"hot spots,\" containing the most toxic forms of beta-amyloid with specific distribution patterns in superior peripheral regions that were previously unexplored.\n\u2022 The first report of certain Alzheimer's-related pathologies in the retina, including vascular amyloid pathology.\n\u2022 The demonstration of a significant correlation between retinal and brain plaques, and coexistence of neuronal loss.\n\u2022 The first feasibility study for noninvasively detecting presumed amyloid deposits in retinas of living patients.\n\u2022 The demonstration of a fully automated calculation quantifying retinal autofluorescence that showed a 2.1-fold increase in patients with Alzheimer's, compared with controls.\n\nResearchers from NeuroVision, Cedars-Sinai, the Doheny Eye Institute, Retina Vitreous Associates Medical Group, Retinal Consultants Medical Group, Sutter Neuroscience Institute, UCLA, Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, Veterans Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, and the University of Southern California contributed to the research and article.

Kazley and colleagues from the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston emphasize in a report released today.\n\n\u201cAnyone who thinks they are having a stroke should seek care at a hospital immediately. Individuals should not wait to seek care for stroke,\u201d Kazley told Reuters Health by email.\n\nThe current study, she added, shows that \u201chigh quality (stroke) care is available in hospitals on the weekends and weekdays.\u201d In fact, care might even be more aggressive on weekends.\n\nWhy? On weekends, even though hospitals have lower levels of staffing, stroke patients arriving at the hospital may have greater access to equipment and doctors who might be busier during the week than they are on weekends. Elective surgeries are not usually scheduled on weekends, leading perhaps to \u201cdecreased traffic and waiting times\u201d for diagnostic equipment, culminating in quicker and more efficient diagnosis and determination of treatment.\n\nWith less road traffic and job obligations on weekends, stroke patients may get to the hospital quicker \u2014 within the three hour window when guidelines recommend that clot-busting drugs for stroke be given.\n\nKazley and colleagues analyzed data on 78,657 patients admitted to Virginia hospitals between 1998 and 2006 with acute ischemic stroke \u2014 the most common type of stroke, which is caused by a blood clot in the vessels supplying the brain. Of these, 20,279 were admitted on weekends and 58,378 during the week.\n\nPatients admitted on the weekends were 20 percent more likely than those admitted during the week to get the clot-busting drug tissue plasminogen activator, or tPA \u2014 a drug that can improve patient outcomes following stroke. A total of 543 weekend stroke sufferers got the drug versus only 229 weekday stroke patients.\n\nYet stroke patients admitted on the weekends were no more likely to die than stroke patients admitted during the week: 1,420 patients admitted on the weekend died versus 3,993 patients admitted on a weekday, which worked out to roughly the same rate of death.\n\nPutting those figures together could suggest that the clot-buster tPA wasn\u2019t doing much good. In fact, that authors note that patients who received tPA were more likely to die in the hospital. Dr. Lawrence B. Goldstein, director of the Duke Stroke Center in Durham, North Carolina, and spokesperson for the American Heart Association said the results were not surprising, since \u201cno clinical trials ever showed that treatment with a (clot buster) improves survival.\u201d\n\nBut Kazley said that the additional deaths among patients who received tPA is likely because doctors are more likely to give the drug to those with severe strokes, who have a higher risk of death in any case.\n\nOverall, Kazley added, this study offers \u201cgood news that indicates that the quality of care is similar regardless of when patients present at the hospital for treatment. This is an indication of the standardization of hospital care regardless of the time/day that patients seek care.\u201d\n\nStudies on the potential for a \u201cweekender effect\u201d in care and outcome for urgent conditions such stroke and heart attack have yielded mixed results.\n\nFor example, in one study examining stroke outcomes in Canada, researchers found that patients with stroke admitted to the hospital on weekends were at greater risk of dying than those admitted on weekdays. \u201cEven in a country with universal health insurance coverage (such as Canada), disparities in resources, expertise, or the number of healthcare providers working during weekends\u201d may affect the stroke mortality rate, the researchers concluded. (See Reuters Health report, March 8, 2007).\n\nIn a prior US study, researchers found that people who were admitted to the hospital on a weekend for a heart attack were less likely to receive potentially life-saving procedures than their peers who were admitted on a weekday. In this study, weekend admissions for heart attack were associated with much higher death rates, leading the researchers to conclude that more appropriate hospital staffing or regionalized care of heart attack patients may prevent some of these deaths.

The patients' cognitive performance, life quality and life expectancy is also affected by having the condition.\n\nThe research team has developed and delivered cooling treatment, known as therapeutic hypothermia, for newborns who suffer lack of oxygen during birth. For up to eight years, the researchers followed 165 infants who were born in the south west and who received cooling therapy at St Michael's Hospital, Bristol, part of University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust. The study examined how many babies were diagnosed with epilepsy and how many are on regular antiepileptic drug treatment at two and four to eight years of age.\n\nThe research found that babies, born after 2007, who received the cooling treatment, had much less epilepsy than before cooling treatment was introduced. At two years, seven per cent of the children had an epilepsy diagnosis, however, far fewer, only two per cent, were on regular antiepileptic drugs.\n\nThe study showed that more children had epilepsy when they reached the age of four to eight years with seven per cent on regular medication. However, these are very low numbers needing antiepileptic treatment compared to before cooling treatment was introduced as standard of care.\n\nBefore therapeutic hypothermia was introduced, poor outcome meaning death or moderate or severe disability was around 66 per cent (32 per cent death and 34 per cent surviving with disability).\n\nIn this cohort born after 2007, the number of children with poor outcome is lower at 34 per cent (11 per cent death and 23 per cent survived with disability). Also, the severity of cerebral palsy is milder and seven out of ten are able to walk. Even if a lesser severity of perinatal asphyxia is accounted for, cooling therapy has increased the number of healthy survivors and there are very few children with epilepsy needing drug treatment.\n\nProfessor Marianne Thoresen said: \"Even if we account for a lesser severity of perinatal asphyxia, our research has shown that therapeutic hypothermia reduces the number of children who develop epilepsy later in childhood. Cooling treatment also reduces the number and severity of cerebral palsy and increases the number of patients who survive normally.\"\n\nThe research was funded by Sparks UK; University of Bristol's Alumni Foundation; The Laerdal Foundation for Acute Medicine, Norway; University of Oslo, and a private donation.\n\n'Reduced infancy and childhood epilepsy following hypothermia-treated neonatal encephalopathy' by Xun Liu, Sally Jary, Frances Cowan and Marianne Thoresen in Epilepsia", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "No unjustifiable language here.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Newswise \u2014 Faced with the negative quality-of-life effects from surgery and radiation treatments for prostate cancer, low risk patients may instead want to consider active surveillance with their physician, according to a study released Tuesday by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).\n\nThe Vanderbilt University Medical Center study led by Daniel Barocas, M.D., MPH, associate professor of Urologic Surgery, compared the side effects and outcomes of contemporary treatments for localized prostate cancer with active surveillance in order to guide men with prostate cancer in choosing the best treatment for them.\n\nSurgery is considered by some to be the most definitive treatment, and there is evidence from other studies that it has better long-term cancer outcomes than radiation for higher-risk cancers, but it has more sexual and urinary side effects than radiation.\n\n\u201cPatients who were treated with surgery or radiation had side effects, while those who were managed with active surveillance, for the most part, did quite well,\u201d Barocas said.\n\n\u201cIt is best to avoid treatment if you have a prostate cancer that is safe to observe. This is why most doctors recommend \u2018active surveillance\u2019 for low-risk cancers,\u201d he said.\n\nThree-year survival from prostate cancer was excellent in the study at over 99 percent for patients regardless of whether they chose surgery, radiation or active surveillance. Barocas did caution that prostate cancer tends to be slow growing and patients would need to be followed for 10 years or more to find differences in mortality.\n\n\u201cThis study shows that, despite technological advances in the treatment of prostate cancer, both surgery and radiation still have a negative effect on quality of life,\u201d said co-author David Penson, M.D., MPH, Paul V.

But these \u201cextended criteria\u201d organs \u2013 those from older donors or from donors who have two or more risk factors - do not tolerate current \u201ccold storage\u201d methods for organ preservation well.\n\nThis can result in greater injury to the kidney, or in a \u201csleepy kidney\u201d which functions poorly at the beginning, requiring dialysis until it recovers days or weeks later. This early delayed function also impacts its longer-term survival.\n\nIn Ontario, about 20 per cent of all transplanted kidneys are expanded criteria donor kidneys. This means donors are on average older than 60 years, or younger than 60 years and likely have hypertension, higher BMI (body mass index), diabetes, or died due to stroke.\n\nEx vivo organ perfusion is an innovative organ preservation technique that seeks to overcome the limitations of current \u201ccold storage\u201d method of preservation.\n\nDeveloped in the laboratory of UHN transplant surgeon Dr. Markus Selzner, with the help of UHN transplant surgeons Drs. David Grant and Anand Ghanekar, as well as Drs. Lisa Robinson and Darius Bagli from The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), it took four years to perfect the solution for the donor kidney and to modify the heart-lung machine for use in the warm perfusion technique.\n\nThis technology has advantages over the usual cold storage method in which a deceased donor kidney is cooled on ice to about four degrees Celsius, with no oxygen, slowing down its metabolism, and inhibiting the repair process.\n\nThe kidney cannot survive longer than 30 hours in cold preservation. The new warm preservation technique avoids the damage of cold storage and instead allows the donor organ to improve and repair itself, potentially leading to better outcomes for patients.\n\nUsing a heart-lung bypass machine, with customized tubing adapted to the kidney\u2019s smaller blood vessels - and a specially blended preservation solution of blood, nutrients, minerals, amino acids, oxygen, glucose, antibiotics and drugs \u2013 surgeons, nurses and perfusionists at TG prepared a deceased donor kidney in a transplant operating room to be placed in a warm preservation solution before transplantation into a patient in late November, 2017.\n\nThe aim was to enhance kidney function, minimize injury and avoid a \u201csleepy kidney\u201d from an extended criteria kidney. About 30-40 per cent of deceased donor kidneys do not work immediately, requiring longer hospitals stays for the patients and dialysis.\n\nZhao Xiao, 53, received the deceased donor kidney, which was placed on the device for 3.5 hours at body temperature.\n\n\u201cI feel great,\u201d says Xiao, through an interpreter. He was able to get up and walk two day after his transplant. Xiao says he was happy to volunteer to become the first patient to receive a kidney that was improved by the new technology.\n\n\u201cThis can make a difference to other patients, so I am glad to be the first one helping them with my experience.\u201d\n\nAs soon as the donor kidney was reattached to the patient, it turned ruby-red and started to pour out urine, indicating that it was functioning well.\n\n\u201cIt is a champion!\u201d says an elated Dr. Selzner, who has done about 500 kidney transplants in the past 14 years. \u201cIt behaved like a normal kidney, despite it being an extended criteria donor kidney.\u201d\n\nHe points out blood tests within 48 hours showed that the kidney was removing wastes and excess fluid from the blood normally. Since the kidney did not \u201cstruggle\u201d after transplant, there is a greater likelihood that its long-term outcome will be better, he adds.\n\n\u201cThis technique will change the landscape of organ donation by improving organ preservation, allowing us to better assess and regenerate the donor organ on the device before we transplant it into a patient. We will know how healthy that organ is before the transplant operation,\u201d says Dr. Markus Selzner, co-investigator of the clinical trial.\n\nDr. Selzner, a clinician-scientist at the Toronto General Hospital Research Institute and Associate Professor of Surgery at the University of Toronto, previously modified the preservation solution and supervised the research on a successful warm perfusion technique for the deceased donor liver organ.\n\n\u201cWorking on this project has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my professional career,\u201d says Dr. Lisa Robinson, Division Head of Nephrology at SickKids. \u201cIt is exciting to see this work be transformed from an idea to experimental research, and now to directly impacting patients.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven with the shortage of donor organs, we have to decline some of our donor organs because of the damage they sustain in the retrieval process,\u201d says Dr. David Grant, Surgical Director of the Multi-Organ Transplant Program, UHN. He is also co-investigator of the clinical trial and transplanted the donor kidney, which was on the modified heart-lung bypass machine, into the recipient.\n\n\u201cThis new technology can help us answer the critical question, \u2018What\u2019s the best way to improve function and recover and repair the kidney before transplantation to get the best results for our patients?\u2019\u201d\n\nDr. Grant, who is also Professor of Surgery at the University of Toronto, emphasized that high-impact research projects such as this require strong collaborative teams \u2013 including researchers, surgical residents, nurses, Canadian Blood Services, perfusionists, colleagues at SickKids - working together on experimental and clinical trials.\n\n\u201cUHN is one of the few places in the world where you can have a good idea and then find the right people to make something like this happen.\u201d\n\nOther collaborators on the research and clinical trial at UHN include: Drs. Joseph Kim and Anand Ghanekar, co-leads of the kidney transplant program at UHN and transplant nephrologist Dr. Istvan Mucsi.\n\nDr. Grant also praised the strong support and efforts of Trillium Gift of Life, which co-ordinates organ and tissue donation across Ontario, in helping to ensure that the transplant team could begin their clinical trials with this new technique.\n\nThe technique of warm organ perfusion outside the body was pioneered by the Toronto Lung Transplant Program at TG in 2008 by Drs. Shaf Keshavjee and Marcelo Cypel to better treat, repair and assess high-risk donor lungs outside the body. The lungs are placed in a protective dome in which a system continuously pumps a bloodless solution of oxygen, proteins and nutrients into the injured donor lungs, mimicking normal physiological conditions.\n\nThis makes it possible for the injured cells to begin repairing themselves, and sets the stage for more sophisticated repair techniques to be applied to donor lungs. Since 2012, there has been an unprecedented 63 per cent increase in lung transplants at TG as a result of this system.\n\nAt any point in time, there are about 1,500 patients waiting for a transplant in Ontario. About 1,000 people wait for a kidney transplant across the province, usually about four years. About five per cent of people on kidney waiting lists die every year.\n\nResearch for the ex vivo kidney perfusion project was supported by the Canadian National Transplant Research Program (CNTRP), a national research network designed to increase organ and tissue donation in Canada and enhance the survival and quality of life of Canadians who receive transplants.\n\nGenerous philanthropic support, made through Toronto General & Western Hospital Foundation, has played and continues to play an integral role in the development of ex vivo technology and its impact on patients\u2019 lives.\n\nToronto General Hospital is a partner in University Health Network, along with Toronto Western, the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto Rehabilitation Institute and the Michener Institute of Education. The scope of research and complexity of cases at Toronto General Hospital have made it a national and international source for discovery, education and patient care. It has one of the largest hospital-based research programs in Canada, with major research in transplantation, surgical innovation, cardiology, infectious diseases, genomic medicine and liver disease.

Such regular use of low-dose aspirin reduced the risk by 20 percent of estrogen or progesterone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer, which is the most common breast cancer subtype.\n\n\"The study found an interesting protective association between low-dose aspirin and breast cancer,\" said lead author Christina A. Clarke, Ph.D., M.P.H., from the Cancer Prevention Institute of California. \"We did not by and large find associations with the other pain medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. We also did not find associations with regular aspirin since this type of medication is taken sporadically for headaches or other pain, and not daily for prevention of cardiovascular disease.\"\n\nThis study differed from other studies that have looked at aspirin and cancer risk because it focused on the dose levels of the aspirin women had taken and tracked the frequency of the use of low-dose aspirin as opposed to regular aspirin. It was also able to look in detail at subtypes of breast cancer.\n\n\"We already knew that aspirin is a weak aromatase inhibitor and we treat women with breast cancer with stronger aromatase inhibitors since they reduce the amount of estrogen postmenopausal women have circulating in their blood,\" said Bernstein. \"We thought that if aspirin can inhibit aromatase, it ought to reduce the likelihood that breast cancer would develop and it could also be an effective way to improve breast cancer patients' prognosis once they no longer take the more potent aromatase inhibitors.\" Bernstein added, \"Aspirin also reduces inflammation, which may be another mechanism by which aspirin taken regularly can lower risk of breast cancer developing or recurring.\"\n\nAs part of the study, researchers analyzed data recorded in questionnaires submitted by 57,164 women in the California's Teacher's Study. In 2005, participants answered questions regarding family history of cancer and other conditions, use of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), menstrual and reproductive history, use of hormones, weight and height, living environment, diet, alcohol use and physical activity. In the ensuing years before 2013, 1,457 of these participants developed invasive breast cancer.\n\nThe team of researchers chose to focus on low-dose \"baby\" aspirin, because not only is it inexpensive and readily available as potential means of prevention, but because there are already a lot of people already taking it for prevention of other diseases such as heart disease and even colon cancer.\n\nNow that we have some data separating low-dose from higher-dose aspirin, more detailed research can be undertaken to understand the full value of low-dose aspirin for breast cancer prevention,\" said Clarke.\"\n\nOther collaborating authors include Alison J.

Patients who received treatment endoscopically had shorter hospital stays and lower costs than those who had laparoscopic surgery.\n\n\"Obesity continues to be a problem in America and it is an epidemic rapidly spreading around the world,\" said Reem Z. Sharaiha, MD, MSc, assistant professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and attending physician at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, the study's lead author. \"Our research -- the first to compare these treatments -- demonstrates that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is safe and effective in helping patients lead healthier lives. It should be considered as another tool available to clinicians and patients in the fight against obesity.\"\n\nDr. Sharaiha followed 278 patients who underwent ESG (91 patients), laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (120 patients) or laparoscopic banding (67). During the one-year follow-up period, patients went to an academic bariatric center of excellence as part of their treatment.\n\nAt one-year follow-up, patients who chose laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery achieved the greatest percent total body weight loss at 29.28 percent, compared to 17.57 percent for endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty patients and 14.46 percent for laparoscopic banding patients. Researchers found that patients who received endoscopic treatment had lower complications (1 percent) than those who received surgical treatment (10 percent for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and 11 percent for laparoscopic banding).\n\nDr. Sharaiha noted that these findings do not suggest that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty will replace the two surgical treatments as weight-loss interventions. Instead, these results show that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is another possibility that patients and health-care providers should consider when discussing options.\n\nWhile endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is performed with an endoscopic device through the mouth, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy involves a small surgical incision in the belly to place a tube in the abdomen, allowing doctors to reduce the stomach's volume. With laparoscopic banding, doctors insert a tube through an incision in the belly to place a band around the stomach, restricting food intake.\n\nThe team also reported that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty patients customarily left the hospital on the same day of treatment, while laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy patients stayed for about three days and laparoscopic banding patients for a day and a half.\n\nWhen examining cost, researchers reported endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty resulted in the lowest-cost, with an average institutional procedure cost of $12,000, compared to $22,000 for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and $15,000 for laparoscopic banding.\n\n\"For years, patients seeking weight-loss interventions had limited options because they could not tolerate or did not want surgery, or it was not even an option for them,\" added Dr. Sharaiha. \"Our research shows that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty can be the treatment they've been looking for.

University of Pennsylvania researchers Rebecca Ashare and Heath Schmidt saw potential for a permanent cessation solution in a class of FDA-approved medications used to improve cognitive impairments from Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn a study consisting of a rat trial and a human trial, Ashare and Schmidt studied the effects of two acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, or AChEIs, called galantamine and donepezil on overall nicotine intake. The rat component showed that pretreating the rodents with an AChEI decreased their nicotine consumption. Consistent with these effects, clinical trial participants taking the AChEI, not the placebo, smoked 2.3 fewer cigarettes daily, a 12 percent decrease, and noted feeling less satisfied with the cigarettes they did smoke.\n\n\"We're very interested in screening potential efficacy of anti-addiction medications in our models,\" said Schmidt, a professor in Penn's School of Nursing and Perelman School of Medicine. \"For this study, we looked at potential smoking-cessation medications.\"\n\nThe research itself took a translational approach, what Ashare, a professor in Penn Medicine's psychiatry department, calls bi-directional. In other words, the preclinical data informed the clinical study and vice versa.\n\nAt Penn's Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Nicotine Addiction, work on smoking cessation has been ongoing since 2001. Specifically, research from Caryn Lerman, CIRNA's director and the Mary W. Calkins Professor in Psychiatry, concluded that people who quit smoking often report a decrease in what's commonly called their executive functions.\n\n\"They feel fuzzy. They're forgetful,\" Ashare said. \"Those deficits are related to their ability to quit smoking. It was this clinical aspect of smoking cessation we thought would be useful to take further.\"\n\nThat's when they turned to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.\n\nIn the brain, the neurotransmitter called acetylcholine is important to cognitive functions like learning and short-term memory. When nicotine enters the body, it binds to the same receptors in the brain that acetylcholine binds to, resulting in smoking's rewarding and reinforcement effects. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors increase acetylcholine levels in the brain and, in effect, substitute nicotine's effects.\n\nSchmidt had successfully employed such a model with other addictive substances like cocaine. He divided a group of rats into galantamine and donepezil cohorts. To mirror voluntary drug taking in humans, the rats self-administered nicotine using a lever pushed at will. Once nicotine-taking stabilized, the rats were pretreated with one of the two AChEIs.\n\nFor both drugs, \"we were able to show a reduction in total nicotine self-administered,\" Schmidt said; however, there was a caveat.\n\n\"We know from the literature that upward of 30 percent of patients will report nausea and vomiting [when taking these drugs], and this will limit their compliance,\" he said. \"We had seen that these drugs reduced nicotine self-administration, but we wanted to make sure it wasn't because the rats were sick.\"\n\nUnlike humans who can verbally report when they don't feel well and whose bodies react to nausea, rats lack the reflex to vomit. In previous research, Matthew Hayes, who has appointments in Penn Medicine and Penn Nursing, had shown that in rats kaolin clay consumption coats the stomach like an antacid and quells any ill effects. Collaborating with Hayes, Schmidt offered the animals kaolin clay, then compared how much they ate normally and with the addition of the AChEIs.\n\n\"At the doses shown to reduce nicotine self-administration, the AChEIs did not make our animals sick,\" Schmidt said. The findings sparked the CIRNA clinical trial, which has to date studied 33 smokers ages 18 to 60.\n\nPeople who were interested in quitting smoking signed on for 23 days. For the first two weeks, they continued to smoke but also took either galantamine or a placebo. Before the trial began, researchers assessed the smokers' cognitive function to get a baseline. Participants followed the regimen for two weeks and then were asked to not smoke for one full day. Two more assessments took place: after the two weeks on the cigarette-drug combination and again after that initial smoke-free day. Finally, the researchers asked the study subjects to do their best to not smoke for seven straight days, a time during which the participants still took either galantamine or a placebo.\n\n\"That week-long period is a proxy for longer-term cessation. The ability to quit smoking the first week after you make a quit attempt is highly predictive of long-term success,\" Ashare said.\n\nShe's still actively recruiting for the trial, with an aim of 80 people total. Once the trial reaches that number, she'll dig into overall quit data. What she's learned so far -- that smokers who used the FDA-approved galantamine smoked fewer cigarettes per day and enjoyed them less -- is promising, particularly given that those who don't smoke during that first crucial week are 32 times more likely to quit smoking permanently.\n\n\"Our goal in investigating these different repurposed medications is not to replace the medications that are already available,\" she said. \"We know that they're effective. Our goal is to target different populations of smokers who may be more likely to experience these cognitive deficits.\"\n\nThere's no data to suggest that a clinician treating a smoker should prescribe one of these AChEIs now.

Half the women received standard therapy, which avoids surgery and consists of a combination of chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and targeted therapy, while the other half first had surgery to remove their primary breast tumor, followed by the standard therapy.\n\nAt about 40 months after diagnosis, the women who received the surgery plus standard therapy lived an average of nine months longer than their counterparts who received standard therapy alone. Nearly 42 percent of the women who received surgery lived to five years after diagnosis, compared with less than 25 percent of the women who did not receive surgery.\n\nThe trial also showed that surgery in younger women with less aggressive cancers resulted in longer average survival than in women with more aggressive cancers that had spread to the liver or lungs.\n\n\"Our thinking is similar to how you might approach a battle against two enemies,\" said Dr. Soran. \"First you quickly dispatch one army--the primary tumor--leaving you to concentrate all your efforts on battling the second army--any remaining cancer.\"\n\nThis research was primarily funded by the Turkish Federation of Societies for Breast Diseases.

Siliq users with a history of suicidality or depression had an increased incidence of suicidal ideation and behavior compared to users without this history. A causal association between treatment with Siliq and increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior has not been established.\n\nBecause of the observed risk of suicidal ideation and behavior, the labeling for Siliq includes a Boxed Warning and the drug is only available through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Siliq REMS Program. Notable requirements of the Siliq REMS Program include the following:\n\u2022 Prescribers must be certified with the program and counsel patients about this risk. Patients with new or worsening symptoms of depression or suicidality should be referred to a mental health professional, as appropriate.\n\u2022 Patients must sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement Form and be made aware of the need to seek medical attention should they experience new or worsening suicidal thoughts or behavior, feelings of depression, anxiety or other mood changes.\n\u2022 Pharmacies must be certified with the program and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive Siliq.\n\nSiliq is also approved with a Medication Guide to inform patients of the risk of suicidal ideation and behavior, and that because Siliq is a medication that affects the immune system, patients may have a greater risk of getting an infection, or an allergic or autoimmune condition. Patients with Crohn\u2019s disease should not use Siliq. Health care providers should also evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with Siliq. Health care providers should not administer Siliq to patients with active TB infection, and should avoid immunizations with live vaccines in patients being treated with Siliq.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions reported with the use of Siliq include joint pain (arthralgia), headache, fatigue, diarrhea, throat pain (oropharyngeal pain), nausea, muscle pain (myalgia), injection site reactions, influenza, low white blood cell count (neutropenia) and fungal (tinea) infections.\n\nSiliq is marketed by Bridgewater, New Jersey-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

The outcome was excellent, but the recovery was long and horrible. The orthopedist wouldn\u2019t let me drive for six weeks, or run, swim or lift weights for three months. I suffered through weeks of torturous physical therapy. It was nearly six months before I felt normal again.\n\nSo in 2014, after a nurse improperly administered a vaccination that resulted in chronic pain and an MRI revealed another rotator-cuff tear, I vowed I would not go through shoulder surgery (or its aftermath) again.\n\nCortisone injections and physical therapy didn\u2019t help, so I decided to try something else: platelet-rich plasma, a therapy that uses the body\u2019s natural healing properties to mend injuries. Its practitioners believe it will transform orthopedics. Based on my experience with it, I think they are right.\n\nIt may not work for every condition, or for everyone. But it worked for me.\n\n[PRP therapy is popular for sports injuries, but does it work?]\n\nBefore undergoing PRP treatment, I read quite a bit about it, learning that it holds promise for healing soft-tissue injuries such as tearing of the rotator cuff (the group of tendons and muscles that provide stability to the shoulder), tennis elbow, plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendinitis, patella tendinitis and hamstring tears; it may even provide relief for mild to moderate osteoarthritis.\n\n\u201c[PRP] works, and the results have been amazing,\u2019\u2019 says John Ferrell, the sports medicine physician who treated me. \u201cThere still needs to be more research done to perfect the process, but [it] will change the way orthopedics is practiced in the future. We will be more preventive. We will be able to treat ailments noninvasively, and at an earlier stage.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe procedure involves collecting several ounces of blood from a patient\u2019s arm, spinning the blood in a centrifuge to concentrate the platelets and injecting the concentrated platelets into the injury site to stimulate healing. Platelets, the blood cells that promote clotting, contain hundreds of proteins, called growth factors, that are important in repairing injuries.\n\n\u201cPRP works by acting like a stem-cell magnet,\u2019\u2019 says Ferrell, who practices at Regenerative Orthopedics & Sports Medicine, which has several offices in the Washington area. \u201cIt releases growth factors that signal stem cells to come [and] help regenerate the injured area. Rotator-cuff tendon partial tears are notorious for not healing because of the poor blood supply there. PRP actually creates new blood vessels that feed the tendon the proper nutrients it needs to heal.\u2019\u2019\n\nA recent pilot study conducted at the Glen Sather Sports Medicine Clinic at the University of Alberta on rotator-cuff tears supports this. It showed tissue healing in five of seven of the patients who received PRP, as well as improvements in their pain and function.\n\nThe researchers call the results \u201cclinically relevant,\u2019\u2019 despite the study\u2019s small size, and say the next step should be a larger, controlled clinical trial. \u201cI\u2019ve heard some skeptics call PRP a cure looking for a disease, but it is being used in so many areas of medicine now with promising outcomes,\u201d says Marni Wesner, a sports medicine physician at the clinic and one of the study\u2019s authors. \u201cThe potential for benefit from PRP is real.\u2019\u2019\n\nI had my first appointment with Ferrell last October to find out whether PRP might help me. By then, my painful shoulder had been keeping me up nights for more than a year. It bothered me while swimming and lifting weights, and while getting dressed. By performing several tests to assess my strength and range of motion, Ferrell discovered that my left shoulder \u2014 the site of the tear \u2014 was considerably weaker than my right.\n\nHe then used ultrasound to find the tear and showed it to me on a monitor. It turned out to be larger than indicated in the static MRI pictures I had obtained earlier.\n\nBefore deciding whether PRP was right for me, he had to be sure that the tear was the source of my pain and weakness. He injected an anesthetic into the tear, then he ran the strength tests again. My strength was significantly better. This meant that the tear was causing my problems, and fixing it probably would restore strength and function to my shoulder and end my pain.\n\nI had the first PRP injection on Oct. 23. It was painful, and the aching persisted for about 36 hours. I had one bad night, followed by an uncomfortable day. After that, the pain stopped. Still, Ferrell advised me to baby the shoulder \u2014 to use my other arm when holding a dog leash and to skip swimming and weights for two weeks. Running was fine. He also recommended physical therapy after two weeks.\n\nAfter what I went through in 2008, those were restrictions I could live with.\n\nFerrell told me not to use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, such as ibuprofen, for a week after the injection because the goal is to encourage, not stifle, inflammation. Other pain relievers such as acetaminophen were okay. \u201cWe want to stimulate an acute inflammatory reaction, which will trigger the healing cascade to start to work,\u2019\u2019 Ferrell says.\n\nBecause there is not yet enough research on PRP \u2014 and because some studies have shown mixed results \u2014 insurance will not cover it.\n\nStill, \u201cit has significant cost savings\u201d compared with surgery, Ferrell says. The average treatment is two injections, which costs about $1,000 at his practice, whereas rotator-cuff surgery runs about $13,000, he says, although insurance often covers most of the costs of surgery.\n\nWith additional research, insurance may ultimately pay for PRP. Unfortunately, there is little financial incentive to conduct such studies because there is nothing for the Food and Drug Administration to approve, such as a drug or device. The centrifuges already are licensed, and the procedure uses a patient\u2019s own blood, which is regarded as safe. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons \u2014 which says PRP \u201cholds great promise\u2019\u2019 \u2014 describes the risk as minimal.\n\nThose who seek this treatment must look for a clinician with considerable PRP experience \u2014 someone who does the procedure several times a day, not once or twice a month \u2014 and who has a good success rate, Ferrell says.\n\nMoreover, \u201cyou see the greatest results when the injections are done under direct visualization with ultrasound,\u201d he adds.\n\nBy February, the ultrasound showed my tear to be about 80 percent healed. The remaining tear was quite small. Ferrell recommended a second injection to finish the job.\n\nI had it on March 4.\n\nWhen I returned to see him on April 12, I was feeling pretty good. No pain, no problems. He rolled in the ultrasound machine, and I was not surprised by the results.

The team used this opportunity to see how stimulating the brain affects memory.\n\nThey focused on an area of the brain called the entorhinal cortex, which helps form and store memories.\n\n\u201cThe entorhinal cortex is the golden gate to the brain\u2019s memory mainframe,\u201d Dr. Itzhak Fried, professor of neurosurgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, who worked on the study, said in a telephone interview. The research was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nFried said sensory experiences that eventually become memories pass through this hub before they are stored in the hippocampus, the brain\u2019s chief memory center.\n\nFor the study, patients played a video game in which they had to shuttle people around in taxis to different shops in a virtual city. The team tested whether stimulating the entorhinal cortex or the hippocampus while they were learning their way around the city improved their recall.\n\n\u201cWhen we stimulated the hippocampus itself, there was not an effect. It was really stimulation in the gateway to the hippocampus - the entorhinal cortex - where we got the beneficial effect in terms of memory,\u201d Fried said.\n\nCompared to testing before stimulation, zapping this part of the brain helped people recognize landmarks and navigate the virtual city more quickly. Fried said the findings suggest stimulating the brain just as memories are forming is key.\n\nIn Alzheimer\u2019s disease, this area of the brain is affected early on, when signs of dementia begin to appear.\n\nFried said the study might have implications for treatments for patients with early Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but he cautioned that the results are very preliminary.\n\n\u201cThe question would be whether this can help memory in patients with memory impairments,\u201d he said. Scientists are increasingly focused on ways to treat the memory-robbing disease, which affects more than 5 million Americans.\n\nDespite costly efforts, no drug has been found that can keep Alzheimer\u2019s from progressing, and policymakers are growing increasingly worried about the swelling ranks of dementia patients as the population ages.\n\nSuzanne Haber, a neuroscientist at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York who was not involved in the study, said she was \u201cvery excited about the finding,\u201d but she cautioned that the treatment is very invasive, very expensive and unproven in Alzheimer\u2019s patients.\n\nThe Obama administration said on Wednesday it plans to spend an additional $156 million over the next two years to help find an effective treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nOne team has already tried deep brain stimulation in Alzheimer\u2019s patients. In a study published in the Annals of Neurology in 2010 researchers tested deep brain stimulation in six patients over the course of a year and found the treatment to be relatively safe. They also saw signs the treatment might have an effect on memory.\n\nDr. Sandra Black, a brain researcher at the University of Toronto who wrote an editorial on the current study, said the findings could have implications for early stage Alzheimer\u2019s disease if tests were developed to identify this process early through imaging or genomics.\n\n\u201cAlthough the current evidence is preliminary, is based on small samples and requires replication, the potential application of deep-brain stimulation in amnestic disorders is enticing,\u201d Black wrote.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "This story includes direct quotes from an interview with an author of the researcher report so it\u2019s clear that it did not rely solely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "(CNN) The headlines about football players and chronic traumatic encephalopathy - commonly known as CTE - seem endless. The most recent diagnosis of the neurodegenerative brain disease was given to former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez. But one of the biggest obstacles in understanding CTE has been the inability to diagnose it in the living. New research released Tuesday may make that possible. Published in the journal PLOS One, researchers have found a protein that can be a marker of this devastating disease.\n\n\"This is something new,\" said Dr. Ann McKee , a neuropathologist and senior author of the studyMcKee has performed many of the high profile diagnoses of CTE among former pro-football players and is director of the Boston University CTE Center.\n\nAn early step in the right direction\n\nMcKee also cautioned that this is still early research. \"The next step -- is repeating, validating our findings, and seeing if we can detect it in blood, and of course doing it in living subjects. These are critical next steps,\" she said.\n\nCTE causes Alzheimer's-like symptoms, including memory loss, confusion, aggression, rage and, at times, suicidal behavior. It is believed to result from repeated trauma to the head, which causes a buildup of the abnormal protein tau which clumps in the brain.\n\nIn this new study, researchers found an increased amount of the protein CCL11 in patients previously diagnosed with CTE. CCL11 is a protein commonly associated with inflammation, a process which McKee said can be a trigger for the disease. \"Inflammation is normally a very helpful response in the brain, but when it goes on and persists for a long time, and gets out of control -- that's what we think happens in CTE,\" said McKee.\n\nMore exposure to football increases likeliness of CCL11\n\nThe paper evaluated the brains of 23 deceased football players with CTE, and compared them to the brains of 50 deceased people diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and the brains of 18 deceased non-athletes. When compared to the brains without CTE, researchers found those brains with CTE had significantly higher amounts of CCL11, even when compared to those brains with Alzheimer's, another degenerative brain disease. Furthermore, they found that the more years someone played football, the higher amount of the protein. However, contrary to the popularly held belief that a greater number of concussions are linked to CTE , no connection was found between levels of CCL11 and reported number of concussions. In addition, the number of reported concussions tend to be an unreliable indicator in general, because they are usually self reported.\n\nAlthough there are different stages of the disease that indicate how far it has progressed, this study was unable to determine any connections between levels of CCL11 and severity of CTE.\n\n\"The findings of this study are the early steps toward identifying CTE during life. Once we can successfully diagnose CTE in living individuals, we will be much closer to discovering treatments for those who suffer from it,\" said McKee.\n\n\"It is a good step forward but I will be very conservative about the interpretations of the possible application to diagnosis,\" said Dr. Bennet Omalu, the neuropathologist credited with making the first diagnosis of CTE among professional football players. Omalu found traces of the disease in the brain of legendary Pittsburgh Steelers player and pro Hall of Famer Mike Webster in 2002.\n\nWhile Omalu was cautiously optimistic about the development, he also noted that CCL11 isn't unique to the brain disease. \"This is an inflammatory marker that may be non-specific and may not be diagnostic of CTE,\" he said.\n\nWhile it is hoped that this will be one avenue to help detect the disease in the living, McKee believes that it will just be one part of a larger process. \"This may be one of the abnormalities [of the disease], but it may take 2-3 to be useful to diagnose CTE,\" said McKee.\n\n110 of 111 former NFL players found with CTE\n\nA recent analysis by BU found evidence of CTE in 110 of 111 brains of former NFL players. However, there is a potential bias in that study, as relatives of these players may have submitted their brains for diagnosis due to clinical symptoms noticed while the players were alive.\n\nCTE has been detected in veterans, as well as players of other contact sports; however, it has become most associated with football. Along with Hernandez, CTE has been diagnosed in San Diego Charger and Hall of Famer Junior Seau, as well as the Philadelphia Eagles' Kevin Turner and the Oakland Raiders' Ken Stabler, to name a few.\n\nIn 2015, a federal judge approved a class-action lawsuit settlement between the NFL and thousands of former players who accused the league of hiding the dangers of concussions and repeated head trauma.

Brown rice also has a lower glycemic index than white rice, which means it doesn\u2019t cause blood glucose levels to rise as rapidly.\n\nNow a new study from researchers at Harvard reports that Americans who eat two or more servings of brown rice a week reduce their risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by about 10 percent compared to people who eat it less than once a month. And those who eat white rice on a regular basis \u2014 five or more times a week \u2014 are almost 20 percent more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes than those who eat it less than once a month.\n\nJust replacing a third of a serving of white rice with brown each day could reduce one\u2019s risk of Type 2 diabetes by 16 percent, a statistical analysis showed. A serving is half a cup of cooked rice.\n\nThe study, which was published in The Archives of Internal Medicine and used data from two Harvard nurses\u2019 health studies and a separate study of health professionals, isn\u2019t the first to point a finger at foods like white rice as a culprit in Type 2 diabetes. A 2007 study of Chinese women in Shanghai found that middle-aged women who ate large amounts of white rice and other refined carbohydrates were also at increased risk for diabetes compared to their peers who ate less.\n\nBut the Harvard study is one of the first to distinguish between brown rice and white rice consumption in the United States, where rice is not a staple food and relatively little is eaten overall, said Dr. Qi Sun, an instructor in medicine at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, which is affiliated with Harvard Medical School. Many food studies simply lump brown and white rice together.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is we showed evidence that increased consumption of white rice \u2013 even at this low level of intake \u2014 is still associated with increased risk,\u201d said Dr. Sun, who was at the Harvard School of Public Health when the study was done. \u201cIt\u2019s really recommended to replace white rice with the same amount of brown rice or other whole grains.\u201d\n\nThe researchers who did the study analyzed rice consumption among 39,765 men and 57,463 women who participated in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and the Nurses\u2019 Health Study I and II; participants in the three groups ranged in age from 26 to 87.\n\nThey had filled out food frequency questionnaires when the studies started \u2014 in 1986, 1984 and 1991, respectively \u2014 and updated their diet information every four years subsequently, through 2005 and 2006. They were also asked about their medical histories. During the course of the studies, more than 10,000 participants developed Type 2 diabetes.\n\nSuch food studies can be unreliable, since they rely on self-reported surveys. And correlation does not necessarily mean a cause-and-effect relationship, since factors other than brown rice consumption may have accounted for the decreased diabetes risk that was observed. The researchers tried to control for the fact that Americans who eat brown rice tend to be more healthy overall \u2014 they eat more fruits and vegetables and less red meat and trans fats, and they also tend to be thinner, more active and less likely to smoke than those who don\u2019t eat brown rice.\n\nBut, Dr. Sun said, there were many possible explanations for why brown rice eaters are at lower risk for Type 2 diabetes. In addition to having a lower glycemic index than white rice, brown rice also contains important nutrients like magnesium that are stripped during the refining process; it also contains much more fiber. Earlier studies have found that having these nutrients in the diet protects against diabetes, Dr. Sun said.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misidentified the amount of cooked rice in a serving.

The data review did not look at any health outcomes associated with pasta consumption except for the ones specified below.\n\nFrom the analysis, researchers identified a number of key positive nutritional dietary patterns associated with children and adolescents who eat pasta as part of their diet compared to those who don't eat pasta. They are:\n\n-Better overall diet quality (as measured by USDA's Healthy Eating Index-2010 scale) -Greater intake of key shortfall nutrients like dietary fiber, folate, iron, magnesium and vitamin E -No significant associations were seen with body weight, waist circumference and body mass index\n\nPasta has long been celebrated as one of America's favorite foods and is advocated by nutritionists for its good nutrition.\n\n\"Good nutrition is critical to the developing minds and bodies of children and adolescents. Certain grain foods, like pasta, are a great complement to a healthy well-balanced meal and provide plenty of opportunities for improving the diet,\" explains registered dietitian Diane Welland, Nutrition Communications Manager for the National Pasta Association. \"Think of pasta as a canvas from which you can add nutrient-dense, fiber-rich foods like fresh vegetables, fruits, cheese, lean meats and legumes, when creating meals for your family.\"\n\nFor more information, recipes and facts about pasta, please visit http://www. .

This research builds upon previous studies demonstrating that art, music, and other similar therapies can effectively reduce symptoms of dementia without medication. By using tablet devices to employ these therapies, however, patients and providers also benefit from a computer's inherent flexibility.\n\n\"The biggest advantage is versatility,\" said Vahia. \"We know that art therapy can work, music therapy can work. The tablet, however, gives you the option of switching from one app to another easily, modifying the therapy seamlessly to suit the individual. You don't need to invest in new equipment or infrastructure.\"\n\nResearchers loaded a menu of 70 apps onto the tablets for the study. The apps were freely available on iTunes and varied greatly in their cognitive complexity--from an app that displayed puppy photos to one that featured Sudoku puzzles.\n\nThe researchers found that tablet use was safe for every patient, regardless of the severity of their dementia, and that with proper supervision and training, the engagement rate with the devices was nearly 100 percent. The study also found that the tablets demonstrated significant effectiveness in reducing symptoms of agitation, particularly--but not exclusively--among patients with milder forms of dementia.\n\nVahia cited several examples of the tablet's potential to improve a patient's condition. One particular patient, who only spoke Romanian, was very withdrawn and irritable, and medications were ineffective in controlling his symptoms.\n\n\"We started showing him Romanian video clips on YouTube, and his behavior changed dramatically and instantaneously,\" said Vahia. \"His mood improved. He became more interactive. He and his medical support team also started using a translation app so that staff could ask him simple questions in Romanian, facilitating increased interaction. These significant improvements are a clear testament of the tablet's potential as a clinical tool.\"\n\nBased on such promising outcomes, the Geriatric Psychiatry Outpatient Services clinical team is expanding the use of tablet devices as a means to control agitation in dementia patients at McLean.

Once a woman hits puberty the number drops to 300,000 and by age 30 the amount decreases by 90 percent. In her mid-30\u2019s Alyssa worried how many eggs she had left.\n\nTurns out there\u2019s a simple blood test that could tell her.\n\nFor years, it\u2019s been a staple in fertility clinics; it\u2019s officially called the Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) test. Some doctors are now offering it as an option to healthy women to assess what they call their ovarian reserve.\n\nIt\u2019s now being called the \u201cbaby deadline test.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are some young, healthy women who are living their lives in shape and taking very good care of themselves who might not know that their reserve strength of their ovaries is lower than it should be.\u201d said Dr. Joshua Hurwitz a reproductive endocrinologist and infertility specialist with Reproductive Medical Associates of Connecticut. \u201cIt's a question of having the knowledge and awareness of keeping your options open.\u201d\n\nThe test is a simple blood analysis that usually costs less than $100. It measures the amount of AMH circulating in a women\u2019s bloodstream. This hormone is released by follicles in the ovaries and predicts the amount of possible eggs a woman has. The higher the result the more eggs, the lower the result the fewer eggs. The test doesn\u2019t measure the quality of the eggs and it\u2019s not a guarantee of fertility. The test has traditionally been offered to women who are struggling to get pregnant and helps assess the possible next steps, such as getting pregnant sooner or freezing eggs.\n\nFor Alyssa Gold, the AMH test was a wakeup call. At her regular gynecology visit, Gold took the AMH test and received news she didn\u2019t wanted to hear but it helped her take the next right step for her.\n\n\u201cI took the AMH test and I'm glad I did because the results were not what I was hoping them to be,\u201d said Gold. \u201cMy tests were really below normal and that was an indicator to me that I needed to move ahead with taking control of my fertility at that time and doing something, which was egg freezing.\u201d\n\nGold finished her graduate studies, and soon after met her future husband.

Julia Belluz will sift through the research and consult with experts in the field to figure out how science can help us live happier and healthier lives.\n\nHave a question? Use our submission form or ask @juliaoftoronto on Twitter.\n\nIs running really a better form of exercise than walking, given that running can lead to more injuries?\n\nAt Vox, I sit near health reporter Sarah Kliff, who trains for half-marathons and triathlons with a casualness most people reserve for grocery shopping. But Sarah\u2019s also suffered with plantar fasciitis and a stress fracture. At times, she's hobbled around in running shoes for months because everything else hurt too much, and even sported a big blue brace on her left leg to help cushion the tiny cracks in the bones of her foot brought on from too much wear and tear.\n\nIn many ways, Sarah is a perfect case study in how to think about the benefits and risks of running versus walking. Running has greater health benefits than walking (Sarah is super fit), but it also carries a much bigger risk of injury (see Sarah\u2019s foot brace).\n\n\n\nSo which effect dominates? To find out, I first searched for \"randomized control trials\" and \"systematic reviews\" on running, walking, and exercise at PubMed health (a free search engine for health research) and in Google Scholar. I wanted to see what the highest-quality evidence \u2014 trials and reviews are the gold standard \u2014 said about the relative risks and benefits of these two forms of exercise.\n\nIt was immediately apparent that running can lead to more injuries, and the risk goes up as running programs get more intense. Studies have found that runners have significantly higher injury rates than walkers (one study found that young men who run or jog had a 25 percent higher risk of injuries than walkers), and that ultramarathoners are at an even greater risk. The main running-related injuries include tibia stress syndrome, Achilles tendon injuries, and plantar fasciitis.\n\nOverall, more than half of people who run will experience some sort of injury from doing so, while the percentage of walkers who will get hurt is around 1 percent. Interestingly, it seems you can walk pretty much endlessly without any increased risk of hurting yourself.\n\nThat running hurts people shouldn't be surprising. As this study described, \"Running produces ground reaction forces that are approximately 2.5 times body weight, while the ground reaction force during walking is in the range of 1.2 times body weight.\" You're also more likely to trip and fall while running than you are during a walk.\n\nJogging even 5 to 10 minutes per day can reduce the risk of death from all causes I also learned about some of the incredible health benefits of going fast: Even five to 10 minutes per day of jogging at around 6 miles per hour can reduce the risk of death from cardiovascular disease and other causes. Joggers have been found to live longer than non-joggers even after adjusting for other factors \u2014 a difference of 3.8 years for men and 4.7 years for women.\n\nThat said, research has found that walking carries significant health benefits, as well. Some studies suggest that you can extend your life and stave off disease by simply walking \u2014 and the more, the better.\n\nAll this research, while illuminating, didn\u2019t offer up any clear conclusions on whether running or walking was better for you overall. So I asked some of the world\u2019s leading researchers in this area. Their conclusion? You need to consider the trade-offs.\n\n\"Running moderately prolongs life more than walking does,\" said Peter Schnohr, a clinical cardiologist who has researched many aspects of exercise and health. The key word there is \"moderately.\" Schnohr warned of the emerging research that doing a lot of endurance exercise over the long term (like triathlon training) can lead to heart problems. Overall, there's a U-shaped association between running and mortality, he said. Too little isn't helpful for health, but too much might be harmful.\n\n\n\n \"The most favorable regimen is two to three running days per week, at a slow or average pace\"\n\n\"The most favorable [regimen] is two to three running days per week, at a slow or average pace,\" Schnohr advised. \"Running every day, at a fast speed, more than 4 hours per week is not as favorable.\" And for those who don't like running, he noted, \"Fast walking, not slow, also prolongs life. I can\u2019t tell how much.\"\n\nDutch researcher Luiz Carlos Hespanhol pointed out that in general, running simply delivers health benefits more efficiently than walking does. This study, for example, found that five minutes of running per day is as beneficial as 15 minutes of walking. Hespanhol also said that after one year of training just two hours a week, runners lose weight, reduce their body fat, lower their resting heart rates, and drive down their blood serum triglycerides (fat in the blood). There's even evidence that running can have positive effects on tension, depression, and anger.\n\nEven so, Hespanhol wasn't a total cheerleader for running. A good walking regimen can have similar benefits, he noted. So on running versus walking, it really depends on your values and preferences: \"One could choose walking instead of running as a mode of physical activity based on injury risks, since walking is less risky than running,\" he explained. Or alternatively: \"One could choose running because the health benefits are larger and come faster, in a shorter period of time.\"\n\nTo recap: Running improves your health more efficiently than walking does and has greater health benefits per time invested. But even a small amount of running carries more injury risk than walking. And a lot of running (i.e., ultramarathon training) can well be harmful, while the same is never true for walking.\n\nWhere does this leave us? All the exercise researchers seemed to agree on one thing: that the best exercise routine is the one you'll actually do. So the answer to the running versus walking question will probably vary from person to person. If you prefer one over the other, stick with that. And if you still can't decide, Hespanhol suggested this: \"Why not do both \u2014 running and walking \u2014 in order to get the best of each?\"\n\nSend your questions to Julia via the submission form or @juliaoftoronto on Twitter.

Both studies are published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology on Dec. 1.\n\nThe Johns Hopkins group reported that psilocybin decreased clinician- and patient-rated depressed mood, anxiety and death anxiety, and increased quality of life, life meaning and optimism. Six months after the final session of treatment, about 80 percent of participants continued to show clinically significant decreases in depressed mood and anxiety, with about 60 percent showing symptom remission into the normal range. Eighty-three percent reported increases in well-being or life satisfaction. Some 67 percent of participants reported the experience as one of the top five meaningful experiences in their lives, and about 70 percent reported the experience as one of the top five spiritually significant lifetime events.\n\n\"The most interesting and remarkable finding is that a single dose of psilocybin, which lasts four to six hours, produced enduring decreases in depression and anxiety symptoms, and this may represent a fascinating new model for treating some psychiatric conditions,\" says Roland Griffiths, Ph.D., professor of behavioral biology in the Departments of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and of Neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. He notes that traditional psychotherapy offered to people with cancer, including behavioral therapy and antidepressants, can take weeks or even months, isn't always effective, and in the case of some drugs, such as benzodiazepines, may have addictive and other troubling side effects.\n\nGriffiths says his team's new study grew out of a decade of research at Johns Hopkins on the effects of psilocybin in healthy volunteers, which found that psilocybin can consistently produce positive changes in mood, behavior and spirituality when administered to carefully screened and prepared participants. The study was designed to see if psilocybin could produce similar results in psychologically distressed cancer patients.\n\n\"A life-threatening cancer diagnosis can be psychologically challenging, with anxiety and depression as very common symptoms,\" says Griffiths. \"People with this kind of existential anxiety often feel hopeless and are worried about the meaning of life and what happens upon death.\"\n\nFor the study, the investigators recruited 51 participants diagnosed with life-threatening cancers, most of which were recurrent or metastatic. They were chosen from a total of 566 individuals reached through flyers, web advertisements and physician referrals. Most participants had breast, upper digestive, GI, genitourinary or blood cancer, and each had been given a formal psychiatric diagnosis, including an anxiety or depressive disorder.\n\nHalf of the participants were female with an average age of 56. Ninety-two percent were white, 4 percent were African-American and 2 percent were Asian.\n\nEach participant had two treatment sessions scheduled five weeks apart, one with a very low psilocybin dose (1 or3 milligrams per 70 kilograms) taken in a capsule and meant to act as a \"control\" placebo because the dose was too low to produce effects. In the other session, participants received a capsule with what is considered a moderate or high dose (22 or 30 milligrams per 70 kilograms).\n\nTo minimize expectancy effects, the participants and the staff members supervising the sessions were told that the participants would receive psilocybin on both sessions, but they did not know that all participants would receive one high and one low dose. Blood pressure and mood were monitored throughout the sessions. Two monitors aided participants during each session, encouraging them to lie down, wear an eye mask, listen to music through headphones and direct their attention on their inner experience. If anxiety or confusion arose, the monitors provided reassurance to the participants.\n\nIn addition to experiencing changes in visual perception, emotions and thinking, most participants reported experiences of psychological insight and often profound, deeply meaningful experiences of the interconnectedness of all people.\n\nThe researchers assessed each participant's mood, attitude about life, behaviors and spirituality with questionnaires and structured interviews before the first session, seven hours after taking the psilocybin, five weeks after each session and six months after the second session. Immediately after the sessions, participants completed questionnaires assessing changes in visual, auditory and body perceptions; feelings of transcendence; changes in mood; and more.\n\nStructured clinical interviews, such as the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, and patient questionnaires, like the Beck Depression Inventory and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, assessed depression and anxiety. Other questionnaires assessed quality of life, death acceptance, meaningful existence, optimism and spirituality -- generally defined as a search for the meaning of life and a connection to something bigger than one's self. To measure the changes in attitudes, moods and behavior over time, the researchers administered a questionnaire that assessed negative or positive changes in attitudes about life, mood and behavior.\n\nWith regard to adverse effects, Griffiths says 15 percent of participants were nauseated or vomited, and one-third of participants experienced some psychological discomfort, such as anxiety or paranoia, after taking the higher dose. One-third of the participants had transient increases in blood pressure. A few participants reported headaches following the session.\n\n\"Before beginning the study, it wasn't clear to me that this treatment would be helpful, since cancer patients may experience profound hopelessness in response to their diagnosis, which is often followed by multiple surgeries and prolonged chemotherapy,\" says Griffiths. \"I could imagine that cancer patients would receive psilocybin, look into the existential void and come out even more fearful. However, the positive changes in attitudes, moods and behavior that we documented in healthy volunteers were replicated in cancer patients.\"\n\nUp to 40 percent of people with cancer suffer from a mood disorder, according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.\n\nAnticipating wide interest in the psilocybin research from scientists, clinicians and the public, the journal solicited 11 commentaries to be co-published with the study results written by luminaries in psychiatry, palliative care and drug regulation, including two past presidents of the American Psychiatric Association, a past president of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology, the former deputy director of the U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy, and the former head of the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority.

Uslaner is director of In Vivo Pharmacology at Merck & Co., which funded the study.\n\nMerck already has one such drug, suvorexant, under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nMore than 30 million Americans struggle to get a good night's sleep, and about one-third of these use drugs to help the process, the study authors pointed out.\n\nBut widely prescribed sleep medications such as Ambien (zolpidem) and Lunesta (eszopiclone) can leave people feeling hung over and inattentive the next day. So much so that the FDA recently cut recommended doses of Ambien and other drugs that contain zolpidem for fear that their use, even the night before, might impair driving or other activities the next day.\n\nLunesta and Ambien affect GABA receptors, which are found throughout the brain and are associated with side effects, including thinking disturbances, and deficits in attention and memory, explained Uslaner.\n\nAbout 15 years ago, scientists discovered chemical messengers known as orexins, which are released by a relatively small brain region known as the lateral hypothalamus. This area of the brain releases orexins during the day to keep us awake and lowers levels at night so we can sleep.\n\nThe appeal of orexin antagonists, said Dr. Michael Thorpy, director of the Sleep-Wake Disorders Center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, is that they \"target a system that's more specific for sleep.\"\n\nThat means, theoretically, fewer side effects and perhaps less of a tendency to be habit forming, Thorpy explained.\n\nUslaner and his colleagues investigated a compound called DORA-22, which has the same mechanism of action as suvorexant, to see how it fared alongside not only Ambien and Lunesta but also diazepam (Valium) in rats and rhesus monkeys.\n\nDORA-22 did not lead to the same mental impairments as the other three drugs. Rhesus monkeys and rats performed just as well on memory and attention tasks shortly after being administered DORA-22 as they did on an inactive placebo.\n\nIn each case, the minimum dose to achieve sleep was compared with the minimum dose that altered memory and thinking. DORA-22 promoted sleep at lower doses than those that impaired mental skills when compared with the \"control\" drugs.\n\nThis is the first time in years that scientists have targeted a totally different receptor in the quest to combat insomnia, said Dr. Alexandre Abreu, co-director of the UHealth Sleep Center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.\n\nBut many questions remain: Do the drugs truly have fewer side effects? Will they be habit forming? And will they change the quality of sleep in any way?\n\nThose questions will only be answered with more testing and use in humans, he said.\n\nExperts note that findings from animal studies do not always hold up in human trials.\n\nThe U.S. National Institutes of Health has more on insomnia.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The comments from the two unaffiliated experts demonstrates the story did not rely solely on a press release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Nobody looks forward to having a cavity drilled and filled by a dentist.

So it's routine for patients to take clot-preventing drugs for some time afterward.\n\nSome doctors choose powerful anti-clotting drugs like heparin (Lovenox) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto), but it hasn't been clear whether these expensive prescription drugs work any better than cheap, readily available aspirin.\n\n\"Aspirin alone may provide similar protection compared to anticoagulation treatments,\" says Brian R. Hallstrom, M.D., an orthopaedic surgeon and associate chair for quality and safety at the University of Michigan Department of Orthopaedic Surgery.\n\nHallstrom is the lead author of a new study published in JAMA Surgery that found few patients developed a blood clot after surgery, and those patients on aspirin fared just as well as those on anticoagulants.\n\nDuring the two-year study period from 2013 to 2015, aspirin use rose from 10 percent to 50 percent among the patients cared for by orthopaedic surgeons in the Michigan Arthroplasty Registry Collaborative Quality Initiative, a statewide effort to give patients the best possible recovery and outcomes after hip and knee replacements.\n\nSince then, the shift has become even more distinct: Aspirin prescribing has risen to 70 percent among Michigan surgeons, says Hallstrom, who is co-director of the initiative and a health services researcher at U-M's Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation.\n\nBased on the experience of 41,537 Michigan patients undergoing knee replacement, the study may further the debate about the routine use of aspirin for clot prevention.\n\nA recent Canadian study looked at the issue, but the analysis had a caveat: Each of the more than 3,400 clinical trial patients received rivaroxaban the first five days after surgery. After that, they continued with the drug or switched to aspirin.\n\nThe new U-M study suggests patients may be adequately protected if they take aspirin alone from day one.\n\n\"This study is truly a real-world experience of what happened in Michigan when the majority of surgeons switched to aspirin,\" Hallstrom says. \"The incidence of blood clots, pulmonary embolus and death did not increase despite this dramatic change in practice.\"\n\nOver the past decade, surgeons have turned away from powerful anticoagulants and toward aspirin used in addition to nondrug improvements such as compression devices for thwarting clots.\n\nThese days, most patients have a generally low risk of blood clots after knee replacement for a number of reasons. Those reasons include shorter surgical times, less invasive procedures and use of regional anesthesia that allows early mobilization after surgery, Hallstrom says. Some patients are even going home the same day.\n\n\"The most important way to prevent blood clots is getting moving,\" says Hallstrom, noting that people are at risk for blood clots when they sit or lie in one position for too long, such as on an airplane or a hospital bed.\n\nThe critical care specialists who make up the American College of Chest Physicians favor heparin to reduce the risk of blood clots, while the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guidelines state that no one drug is better than another for preventing clots.\n\nThe U-M study involved patients undergoing knee replacement surgery at any of the 29 Michigan hospitals in the surgical quality group. One-third of the patients took aspirin alone; 54 percent took only an anticoagulant; and 13 percent took an aspirin/anticoagulant combination.\n\nOver three months, just 1.16 percent of aspirin patients developed a serious blood clot. That was true for 1.42 percent of anticoagulant patients, according to the Michigan study. This was not statistically different.\n\nSo, neither drug appeared better than the other -- but aspirin has some obvious advantages.\n\n\"Aspirin is easy to take and much less expensive,\" Hallstrom says. \"Patients can get it over the counter for pennies, while the other anticoagulants require monitoring, injections, frequent dose adjustments and are extremely expensive.\"\n\nThe reported cost for a 30-day supply of rivaroxaban is approximately $379 to $450; heparin is estimated at $450 to $890. Although warfarin costs a few dollars for a 30-day supply, its cost approaches that of the other anticoagulants when doctor visits for monitoring are factored in, Hallstrom says.\n\nThe study suggests most patients can have just aspirin without increasing the risk for venous thromboembolism, but doctors need to consider factors such as a patient's history of clots, obesity and ability to mobilize after surgery when determining the best measure for clot prevention, Hallstrom adds.", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "Although the release paints a rather rosy and benign image of \u201cgood old aspirin,\u201d the release is clear that this study found that there was no statistical difference in outcomes between patients taking aspirin versus anticoagulant drugs\u2026and it pointed out that doctors need to consider a patient\u2019s history of blood clots, obesity and other factors.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "TUESDAY, March 13, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- A pill that combines three blood pressure-lowering drugs improves people's chances of lowering their high blood pressure, researchers report.\n\nThe pill contains low doses of the three medications -- telmisartan, amlodipine and chlorthalidone.\n\nThe finding stems from a study of 700 people, who averaged 56 years old.

Campos, lead author of one of two papers appearing in the February issue of the Archives of Surgery.\n\nGastric bypass and lap-banding are the two most common surgical weight-loss procedures performed in the United States. The former involves stapling the stomach so food has to bypass a section of the small intestine, meaning you get full faster and less food gets absorbed into the gut.\n\nLap-banding, introduced in 2001, involves separating the stomach into two sections with a band so, simply speaking, eating too much becomes more difficult. \"It's a diet with a seatbelt,\" said Dr. Mitchell Roslin, chief of bariatric surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City and Northern Westchester Hospital in Mt. Kisco, N.Y.\n\nIn a third type of weight-loss procedure, known as sleeve gastrectomy, surgeons remove part of the stomach.\n\nThe study led by Campos compared weight loss and diabetes outcomes in 100 patients who underwent gastric bypass surgery with 100 patients who underwent lap-banding. Gastric bypass is considered riskier and more technically demanding than the band.\n\nAll patients were morbidly obese (with a body-mass index higher than 40), and 34 in each group had type 2 diabetes.\n\nAlthough Campos is now an associate professor of surgery at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison, he conducted the study while at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nIn the bypass group, patients lost an average of 64 percent of their excess weight, vs. 36 percent for those in the lap-banding group. Three-quarters of those undergoing gastric bypass surgery saw their diabetes improve or resolve, vs. only half in the other group.\n\nThe average cost of a bariatric surgery is nearly $30,000, according to a recent study from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nLike all surgeries, weight-loss surgery carries its own set of possible risks, including bleeding, blood clots, infection and leaks from sites where body tissues are sewn or stapled together, according to the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Later complications may include malnutrition, hernias and a tendency in about one in 10 people to regain much of the weight they lost as a result of the procedure.\n\nIn Campos' study, roughly equal numbers of patients in each group experienced complications after one year (12 percent in the gastric bypass group compared to 15 percent in the lap-banding group); these included infection, internal bleeding and blood clots, but no deaths. More people in the bypass group had complications right after the surgery. More of those undergoing lap-banding, however, needed repeat surgeries (13 percent vs. 2 percent).\n\nThe second study, conducted in Taiwan and led by Dr. Wei-Jei Lee of the Min-Sheng General Hospital, involved randomly assigning 60 obese (but not morbidly obese) patients with type 2 diabetes to receive gastric bypass surgery or sleeve gastrectomy.\n\nAlmost all of those undergoing gastric bypass surgery (93 percent) had their diabetes resolved, vs. only half in the other group (these numbers declined to 57 percent and 0 percent after a year).\n\nThose in the gastric bypass group also lost more weight, and there were no serious complications in either group.\n\nThere are various theories to explain why gastric bypass may be superior, including one that attributes the success to changes in hormones that control the metabolism of blood sugar.\n\nAnd certain procedures may still be preferable for certain patient populations, added Roslin, such as bands for patients with lower BMI who don't have so many metabolic challenges.\n\n\"Everyone thinks that all weight-loss operations are the same, even the doctors and the surgeons.

The 24-year-old from Dublin, Ohio, was in an accident six years ago that left his arms and legs paralysed. But now, thanks to computer software that decodes his thoughts and sends the signal to his hands, he's been able to pick up small objects, swipe a credit card, and even play Guitar Hero \u2013 albeit in a science lab. This is the first time a person with paralysis has regained movement in their hands and individual fingers using signals from their brain. Details of the system that allows him to do this, developed by scientists at Ohio State University and Battelle Memorial Institute, are published in the journal Nature today. The study builds on previous work in which humans have been able to move computer cursors and robotic arms using their own brain signals, and a study in which monkeys with paralysed arms were able to move them again thanks to a similar intervention.\n\nIt was the summer after his freshman year of college when Burkhart lost the ability to move his arms and legs. \"I was 19 years old, really independent, and I didn't think anything like this would happen in my life that would slow me down and set me back this much,\" Burkhart said during a press briefing. \"I dove into a wave that then pushed me down into a sandbar \u2013 the water wasn't as deep as I thought. I was lucky to have friends with me who were able to pull me out of the water and get medical attention.\" The injury in his spinal cord means he doesn't have any movement below his elbow, so he is missing the fine motor movement in his hands that would allow him to grasp or pick up objects. Burkhart's thoughts and brain signals work in the same way as they did before the accident, but his spinal cord injury means they never reach his hand, leaving him unable to move it. He has some residual movement in his shoulders, and can use those working shoulder muscles to move his arms about. \"That's how I do pretty much everything in my daily life when I'm not hooked up to the system,\" he says.\n\nThe system works by bypassing Burkhart's spinal cord injury. A device implanted in his brain records signals from neurons that fire when he thinks about a movement \u2013 picking up a cup, for example. This signal is passed to a computer that decodes it, and the resulting instruction is then sent to a sleeve he wears on his forearm that stimulates the muscles that move his wrist and fingers. In June 2014, in the early stages of the trial, Burkhart moved his hand again for the first time after his accident. \"It was a flicker of hope, knowing that this was something that was working, knowing I will be able to use my hand again,\" he said. After three sessions a week for over a year, he is able to use the system to do things he couldn't do on his own, like pick up a mug and pour its contents into another container, swipe a credit card, and play Guitar Hero.\n\nSo far he's been able to make isolated finger movements and six different hand and wrist movements. To test how useful this would be in a normal situation, the scientists had Burkhart pick up a container, empty its contents into a jar, then pick up a stick and stir the contents of the jar. It was a struggle at first, but by the end of the trial he was able to complete the action three out of five times in a 10-minute period.\n\n The setup currently requires a 10\u201315-minute training period at the beginning of every session. Burkhart watches videos of different hand movements he's going to perform that day and thinks about the movements, so the computer learns what the brain signals for each movement looks like. \"The machine is actually learning, and Ian is learning how to refine his thought patterns,\" Chad Bouton, lead author on the paper, said in a press briefing. \"So the machine and the person are learning together, and after that 10\u201315-minute period there's a dramatic improvement, it's been really amazing to watch.\" \"Initially, we'd do a short session and I'd feel completely mentally fatigued and exhausted,\" said Burkhart. \"But just like anything, with more and more practice it's become easier.\"\n\n\"This technology is possible because there's about 50 years of basic neuroscience that has been looking at how signals in the brain encode information about movement,\" Dr Andrew Jackson, a neuroscientist at Newcastle University who was not involved with the work, told BuzzFeed News. \"What we're seeing now is all of that basic research which was driven by purely scientific questions coming to fruition in terms of enabling new treatments, but there's still a lot we need to learn.\" There are still many challenges to be overcome to bring this work out of the lab and into the lives of the millions of people who are paralysed. \"We have to be realistic about this, there's still quite a long way towards turning this into something that would be feasible for widespread use in large numbers of people,\" Jackson said. For starters, the device that records the brain signals will need to be much smaller so it's fully implanted under the paralysed person's skin. \"One of the directions the field is moving towards,\" Jackson said, \"is to develop implanted devices that can be positioned under the skin and communicate wirelessly or route signals to the muscles completely under the skin.\"\n\nOur understanding of how brain signals change will also be crucial to making this technology usable on a large scale. \"The recordings we get from these electrodes in the brain can be quite unstable from day to day,\" Jackson said. That's why the device requires training every time Burkhart uses it. \"What we'd really like is a system that's plug and play and will work daily without needing to be recalibrated.\" That could come from better electrode designs or looking for different signals that are more stable. Dr Jonas Zimmerman, a neuroscientist at Brown University in the US, who was also not involved with the study, echoed Jackson's point. \"Brain signals change from day to day (even hour to hour), the signals may be different depending on context (am I trying to lift a full or an empty glass, do I watch someone draw or do I want to draw myself), and brain signals change while we learn a new task,\" he told BuzzFeed news. \"We need to understand a lot more about the brain before we will make really meaningful improvements in this direction. \"It will be years until a paralyzed patient will be able to control neural prostheses independently from caregivers, but there is nothing that should make this improvement impossible.\"", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story includes comments from independent sources and does not rely solely on a news release.\n\u00a0", "answer": 1}, {"article": "It's pretty well known to doctors that the most successful treatment for obesity is surgery, especially the gastric bypass operation. But here's something the medical world is just realizing: that the gastric bypass operation has other even more dramatic effects. It can force type 2 diabetes into almost instant remission and it appears to reduce the risk of cancer.\n\nSurgeons have been performing bariatric, or weight loss operations since the 1950s, but they're much safer than they used to be. They're typically done laparoscopically now, where doctors use tiny surgical tools and video cameras instead of making big, deep incisions.\n\nDespite the increase in obesity, only a small number of people have had the gastric bypass operation.\n\nmet some people who were once morbidly obese.\n\nThere was Tony Sideman, who underwent surgery in April 2007 and has lost 140 pounds; there was Janet Rovak, who lost 90 pounds in the eight months since her surgery; and there was Travis Goodbou, who lost 260 pounds in the seven months since he underwent the operation.\n\nDr. Neil Hutcher from Richmond, Va. has performed more than 3,000 bypass surgeries. Asked how many people gain the weight back, Dr. Hutcher tells Stahl, \"You know I think when you're dealing with an incurable disease that kills many people, if you have an 85 to 90 percent success rate, that's pretty darn good.\"\n\n\"Is that what you have?\" Stahl asks.\n\nThere's no diet, no exercise regimen, and no pill with a success rate like that. These patients lose a ton of weight and keep it off.\n\nHere's how Hutcher does the surgery: first, he sections off a small pouch of the upper part of the stomach, which is then attached to a lower part of the small intestine, bypassing most of the stomach, so that there's not a lot of room for food.\n\nIt used to be that roughly one in 100 people died from this operation. Hutcher says it's now about one in 1,000, which makes it less deadly than most major surgeries.\n\n\"It's less than gall bladder surgery. It's about one-tenth of cardiac surgery,\" he explains.\n\nIt's safer because of new surgical techniques which have also made it more effective. For instance, they can make the stomach pouch smaller than they used to.\n\n\"Even if I wanted to eat a whole cheesecake, my stomach is very tiny. It holds four ounces max, stretched to the max. And that's not even one piece of cheesecake,\" a female patient explained.\n\nA big reason the operation works is because it seems to suppress appetite. \"If you listen to your patients, they come back and they say, 'Doctor, you put the fire out,'\" Hutcher says.\n\n\"When you see a sign for fast food or\u2026she's already shaking her head at me,\" Stahl asked a patient.\n\n\"Don't want it,\" the female patient replied. \"I used to crave sweets all the time. I couldn't go past the gift shop at work without getting a candy bar. Now I go past it and I never give it a thought.\"\n\nPaul Delios of Saugus, Mass. has lost 90 pounds. He owns a doughnut shop with his siblings, but he's able to resist the cravings. \"Before I'd have cravings for everything. Now I really don't,\" he told Stahl.\n\nFor most patients the cravings really do disappear. One theory is that's because the operation suppresses the levels of a stomach hormone called \"grelin\" that activates the sensation of hunger.\n\nYet most people who have this operation do not get skinny. Dr. David Cummings, an expert on appetite at the University of Washington, says as a rule these patients end up just one third lighter.\n\n\"Most people with severe obesity who undergo gastric bypass do not become fully normal, in terms of body weight. They go from severely obese to mildly obese, or from obese to overweight. But nevertheless it's an enormous change,\" Dr. Cummings explains.\n\nAnd not just in terms of weight loss. Dr. Hutcher says the operation itself can take type 2 diabetes - which has ballooned in this country - and throw it into complete remission.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "There is no evidence the report is based on a press release. \nMany previous news reports have been done on the link between the surgery and reduced incidence of diabetes independent of weight loss, however.

Most researchers agreed that there was something in the wine that offered protection, and a few years later, even the highly cautious federal dietary guidelines say that moderate consumption of red wine can be beneficial.\n\nAs 60 Minutes reported in January, scientists across the country have identified a substance in red wine called resveratrol that they believe might do more than just protect the heart, but could in very high concentrations significantly extend life by preventing a number of age related illnesses.\n\nIf they're right, we all may soon be taking a pill that could give us an extra decade or two of healthy old age.\n\n\"If the promise holds true, I think this has the chance to change healthcare,\" Dr. Christoph Westphal tells\n\nDr. Westphal says we all may soon be taking a drug that just might beat the clock, a simple pill that could delay the inevitable. \"Our goal is to prevent and forestall many of the diseases that strike us as we reach 50, 60, and 70. All with one pill.\"\n\nAsked if he's suggesting that it's some kind of a rejuvenation drug that would turn a 70-year-old into a 35-year-old, Westphal tells Safer, \"That might be pretty hard to do. But I think if we're on a train heading one direction, we can slow down that train. I think we can slow down these genes that control the aging process.\"\n\nThat quest to put death on hold began in 2003 when Westphal met David Sinclair, a biochemist at Harvard who was studying the genetic components of aging. \"Five years ago I met David. And he had shown that you could extend life span in yeast. That's pretty exciting,\" Westphal recalls.\n\nYeasts are one thing, human beings are more complicated. So Sinclair focused on a gene present in almost all life forms: the sirtuin gene. It's normally inactive, but when it is active, Sinclair believes it triggers a survival mechanism that extends life. \n\nConvinced that something in nature could activate that gene, Sinclair randomly tested thousands of compounds and got a hit: resveratrol.\n\n\"When I Googled this resveratrol, I was shocked to find that red wine was the top hit,\" Sinclair remembers.\n\nRed wine is brimming with resveratrol. It is found in high concentrations in the skin of the grape, and seems to play a role in protecting it from invading bacteria and fungi.\n\nSinclair says he was aware of research into red wine and certain health benefits. \"I mean, that's why I almost fell off my chair when the link was made. And I thought that this was a potential explanation for the benefits of red wine.\"\n\nConvinced they were on the verge of a major scientific breakthrough, Sinclair and Westphal launched Sirtris, a Cambridge, Mass. research company. They, along with a handful of other cutting-edge biotech companies, are developing resveratrol-based drugs that they believe zero-in on the longevity gene.\n\n\"The important news here is not that we'd found something in red wine. The important thing is that we passed a milestone where we can now make drugs based on this knowledge and we can potentially slow down aging itself,\" Sinclair explains.\n\nEveryone from plastic surgeons to your friendly snake oil salesman have been promising a ticket to eternal youth for some time, so the prospect of a prescription pill based on red wine that could trigger a longevity gene sounds too good to be true. And yet scientists have actually known for years of one surefire of doing that: stay hungry.\n\n\"Eating a lot of food turns that off. Dieting, extreme dieting turns it on,\" Sinclair says.\n\nIn one experiment, a group of rhesus monkeys is on a major diet.

To maintain their sterile environment, the 60 Minutes team had to suit up to visit them with Ricki Colman, the \"project leader.\"\n\nThe control animals are nearing the end of a typical monkey lifespan, about 27 years, and major differences in their overall health are becoming clear. The skinny monkeys actually look younger, their coats are shinier, and fewer have arthritis.\n\nAnd the chunky monkeys?

A lack of knowledge about cellular pathways critical to the development of dementia, however, has stood in the way of significant clinical advance. But now, researchers at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University (LKSOM) are breaking through that barrier. They show, for the first time in an animal model, that tau pathology - the second-most important lesion in the brain in patients with Alzheimer's disease - can be reversed by a drug.\n\n\"We show that we can intervene after disease is established and pharmacologically rescue mice that have tau-induced memory deficits,\" explained senior investigator Domenico Pratic\u00f2, MD, Scott Richards North Star Foundation Chair for Alzheimer's Research, Professor in the Departments of Pharmacology and Microbiology, and Director of the Alzheimer's Center at Temple at LKSOM. The study, published online in the journal Molecular Neurobiology, raises new hope for human patients affected by dementia.\n\nThe researchers landed on their breakthrough after discovering that inflammatory molecules known as leukotrienes are deregulated in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. In experiments in animals, they found that the leukotriene pathway plays an especially important role in the later stages of disease.\n\n\"At the onset of dementia, leukotrienes attempt to protect nerve cells, but over the long term, they cause damage,\" Dr. Pratic\u00f2 said. \"Having discovered this, we wanted to know whether blocking leukotrienes could reverse the damage, whether we could do something to fix memory and learning impairments in mice having already abundant tau pathology.\"\n\nTo recapitulate the clinical situation of dementia in humans, in which patients are already symptomatic by the time they are diagnosed, Dr. Pratic\u00f2 and colleagues used specially engineered tau transgenic mice, which develop tau pathology - characterized by neurofibrillary tangles, disrupted synapses (the junctions between neurons that allow them to communicate with one another), and declines in memory and learning ability - as they age. When the animals were 12 months old, the equivalent of age 60 in humans, they were treated with zileuton, a drug that inhibits leukotriene formation by blocking the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme.\n\nAfter 16 weeks of treatment, animals were administered maze tests to assess their working memory and their spatial learning memory. Compared with untreated animals, tau mice that had received zileuton performed significantly better on the tests. Their superior performance suggested a successful reversal of memory deficiency.\n\nTo determine why this happened, the researchers first analyzed leukotriene levels. They found that treated tau mice experienced a 90-percent reduction in leukotrienes compared with untreated mice. In addition, levels of phosphorylated and insoluble tau, the form of the protein that is known to directly damage synapses, were 50 percent lower in treated animals. Microscopic examination revealed vast differences in synaptic integrity between the groups of mice. Whereas untreated animals had severe synaptic deterioration, the synapses of treated tau animals were indistinguishable from those of ordinary mice without the disease.\n\n\"Inflammation was completely gone from tau mice treated with the drug,\" Dr. Pratic\u00f2 said. \"The therapy shut down inflammatory processes in the brain, allowing the tau damage to be reversed.\"\n\nThe study is especially exciting because zileuton is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of asthma. \"Leukotrienes are in the lungs and the brain, but we now know that in addition to their functional role in asthma, they also have a functional role in dementia,\" Dr. Pratic\u00f2 explained.\n\n\"This is an old drug for a new disease,\" he added. \"The research could soon be translated to the clinic, to human patients with Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\nOther researchers contributing to the study include Phillip F.

This is easy and painless and does not require highly trained health professionals to administer, and that makes it an inexpensive solution for developing nations,\" he said.\n\nThe next step is more testing for effectiveness against different strains of Chlamydia and in different formulations.

If the experimental medication is eventually approved for use, it would be only the second oral MS drug available to patients, alongside a number of long-standing injectable options.\n\n\"The injectables aren't going to go away,\" commented Dr. Scott S. Zamvil, a professor of neurology and faculty member in the program in immunology at the University of California, San Francisco. \"We went 17 years with injectables before we got our first oral option, 'Gilenya', just last year. But there's a lot of excitement about this new option and these results, because even though the injectables are safe and effective in terms of convenience and patient compliance, oral drugs are much better than shots.\"\n\n\"And with the one oral option we have today, there has been a lot of concern over a possible risk for immune suppression and also an increased risk for cancer,\" added Zamvil, who was not a part of the current study team. \"That does not seem to be the case with this new drug. So this appears to be a significant advance forward.\"\n\nThe current research was funded by Teva Pharmaceuticals, the maker of laquinimod.\n\nThe lead study author is Dr. Giancarlo Comi, director of the department of neurology and the Institute of Experimental Neurology at the Scientific Institute and University Vita-Salute San Raffaele in Milan, Italy. He is slated to present his team's findings this week in Honolulu at the American Academy of Neurology meeting.\n\nIn the two-year, double-blind Phase III trial, participants were randomly divided into two groups: those who were given a daily dose of laquinimod (0.6 milligrams) and those who were given a sugar-pill (placebo); neither the researchers nor the participants knew who received the medication or the placebo.\n\nThe annual rate of MS relapse was 23 percent lower in the laquinimod group compared with the placebo group.\n\nIn addition, disability progression was reduced by 36 percent and brain atrophy by 33 percent compared with those getting the sham treatment.\n\nAdverse events, including serious events, were comparable to those in the placebo group, according to the researchers. The incidence of liver enzyme elevation was higher in patients treated with laquinimod, according to Comi, but he added that the elevations were temporary, reversible and did not lead to any signs of liver problems.\n\nLaquinimod was not, however, tested against currently existing treatment alternatives, the authors stressed. The team added that the new medication appears to tackle MS by a different type of mechanism than other available options, and apparently works by curtailing the onset of permanent tissue damage while limiting acute inflammation.\n\n\"Each of the medications we have has a different mechanism of action,\" explained Dr. Gary Birnbaum, director of the MS Treatment and Research Center at the Minneapolis Clinic of Neurology. \"And MS is probably not a single disease. So different medications may work better for some and not others, which is why this new drug could end up being an important addition to the armamentarium.\"\n\n\"However, we still need to have a head-to-head comparison with other drugs,\" cautioned Birnbaum, who was not part of the study team. \"This is not that. And it's also important to note that this is not a cure. It achieved a reduction in the annualized relapse rate, and people on this medication did not have as many attacks per year as people on a placebo. But a 23 percent reduction is not a cure. This didn't stop MS.\"\n\n\"But, this is extremely hopeful research,\" he added. And if it is approved, it'll be a valuable adjunct to the array of treatment options now available.\"\n\nSince the study is being presented at a medical meeting, it should be considered preliminary until the findings are published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nFor more on multiple sclerosis, visit the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not rely solely on the news release from the American Academy of Neurology solely, but we were troubled by\u00a0how closely some of the sentences in the\u00a0story mirror\u00a0sentences in the news release.

Taking tamoxifen for five years after diagnosis reduces breast cancer mortality by about one-third.\n\nIn the new study, women with early tumors who took tamoxifen for 10 years cut their risk of dying from breast cancer by another 29%, compared to women who stopped after five years.\n\nIn absolute terms, 12% of women on tamoxifen for 10 years died of breast cancer within five to 14 years after diagnosis, compared to 15% of those who stopped at five years.\n\nOverall, women who take tamoxifen for a decade cut their risk of dying from breast cancer nearly in half, compared with those who don't take it at all, says study co-author Richard Gray of the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.\n\nThat's significant, given that tamoxifen is used by hundreds of thousands of women worldwide, says Gray, whose study was presented Wednesday at the annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Oxford funded the study, which included more than 6,800 women from 36 countries, While tamoxifen delays tumor growth in some women, it appears to cure others, Gray says.\n\n\"This is a dream come true for women,\" says V. Craig Jordan, a researcher who led tamoxifen's development, but who wasn't involved in the new study. \"It's very exciting.\"\n\nTamoxifen, which has been used for decades, is far cheaper than most new chemotherapies and biological drugs, which cost thousands of dollars a month. A generic version costs about $100 a month in the USA, according to Susan G. Komen for the Cure.\n\nIn the U.K., tamoxifen costs only $5 a month. In India, it's 2 cents a pill, says Jordan, scientific director at Georgetown's Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nJordan says the new findings will quickly change care for some patients.\n\nYounger women with more aggressive tumors may want to extend their tamoxifen use, says Jennifer Litton, an assistant professor at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who wasn't involved in the study.\n\nTamoxifen is the only hormonal option for women before menopause, Litton says.\n\nDoctors may not want to change the care of older patients, however, she says. That's because postmenopausal women have the option of tamoxifen or another class of hormonal therapies, called aromatase inhibitors, or AIs. These drugs are slightly more effective than tamoxifen, although they don't work before menopause, Litton says.\n\nBecause the study didn't include AIs, doctors can't say how whether tamoxifen would benefit women who've taken them, Litton says. Other researchers are conducting trials comparing five versus 10 years of AIs, although these results won't be out for several years.\n\nGray noted that tamoxifen has risks. In his study, doubling the length of treament also doubled the risk of endometrial cancer, which affects the uterine lining, to about 3%. However, because this cancer is very treatable, death rates were low: 0.4% of those on tamoxifen for 10 years died of endometrial cancer, compared to 0.2% of those taking it for five years.\n\nDoctors saw no increase in strokes, which has long been a concern with tamoxifen, Gray says.\n\nBreast cancer survivors have mixed reactions to the results.\n\nSome women will be glad to have another treament option, says breast cancer survivor Lillie Shockney, 59, administrative director of the Johns Hopkins Cancer Survivorhip Program in Baltimore.\n\n\"Patients get very nervous when they stop any hormonal therapy, because they feel like now they aren't doing anything,\" says Shockney, 59. \"The opportunity to 'do something' might be appealing, despite the side effects.\"\n\nShockney says she'd like to see research on other ways to prevent recurrences, such as weight loss. \"If someone lost 40 pounds, would that do as much as another five years on tamoxifen?\" Shockney asks.\n\nSome patients may be reluctant to prolong their use of a drug that causes so many side effects, says Boston breast cancer survivor Alicia Staley.\n\nStudies show that only 80% of women take tamoxifen for five years, Litton says. Some switch to an AI, although these drugs can also cause problems, such as joint pain and osteoporosis.\n\nStaley say she tamoxifen gave her \"many, many side effects,\" including severe hot flashes. \"Dry eyes, joint pain, weight gain \u2014 you name it, I had it,\" she says.\n\nAfter 2\u00bd years, Staley and her doctor stopped the drug \"to regain a measure of quality of life.\"\n\nFor Shockney, tamoxifen took a heavy toll on her marriage, causing dryness that made sex unbearably painful.\n\nPatients and their partners need to have honest talks with doctors about how extended treatment will affect their relationship, she says.\n\n\"If we are going to look at giving women tamoxifen for 10 years, by golly, we better get the partners involved,\" Shockney says.\n\nYet Shockney says her husband of nearly 35 years would have wanted her to do everything possible to survive.\n\n\"If someone said to my husband, 'I know this has been a rough road for you, and a big impact on your sex life, but if she stays on it another five years. it could affect her survival,' he would have said, 'Please, please, take the pill.' \"", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "It\u2019s clear that the story did not rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Newswise \u2014 Multiple myeloma is the second most common type of blood cancer in the United States, impacting more than 25,000 people each year and disproportionatly affecting African-American men.

Currently many women with a gene mutation choose surgical removal of their breast tissue and ovaries to reduce their chance of developing breast and ovarian cancer.\n\nBy pinpointing the cells that give rise to breast cancers in women who have inherited a faulty version of the BRCA1 gene, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute researchers have identified that the drug denosumab may have potential to prevent breast cancer from developing. If confirmed in clinical studies, this would provide a non-surgical option to prevent breast cancer in women with elevated genetic risk.\n\nUsing samples of breast tissue donated by women carrying a faulty BRCA1 gene, Ms Emma Nolan, Professor Jane Visvader and Professor Geoff Lindeman were able to pinpoint the cells that give rise to breast cancer. The research, which also involved researchers at the Australian familial cancer consortium kConFab and US biotechnology company Amgen was published today in Nature Medicine.\n\nCancer precursor cells in BRCA1-mutant breast tissue had many similarities to aggressive forms of breast cancer, said Ms Nolan, who is a PhD student at the institute enrolled through The University of Melbourne's Department of Medical Biology. \"These cells proliferated rapidly, and were susceptible to damage to their DNA - both factors that help them transition towards cancer,\" she said. \"We were excited to discover that these pre-cancerous cells could be identified by a marker protein called RANK.\"\n\nProfessor Lindeman, who is also a medical oncologist at The Royal Melbourne Hospital, said the discovery of RANK as a marker of cancer precursors was an important breakthrough, because inhibitors of the RANK signalling pathway were already in clinical use. \"An inhibitor called denosumab is already used in the clinic to treat osteoporosis and breast cancer that has spread to the bone,\" he said. \"We therefore investigated what effect RANK inhibition had on the cancer precursor cells in BRCA1-mutant breast tissue.\"\n\nThe research team showed that RANK inhibition switched off cell growth in breast tissue from women with a faulty BRCA1 gene and curtailed breast cancer development in laboratory models.\n\n\"We think this strategy could delay or prevent breast cancer in women with an inherited BRCA1 gene mutation,\" Professor Lindeman said. \"A clinical trial has already begun to investigate this further.\"\n\n\"This is potentially a very important discovery for women who carry a faulty BRCA1 gene, who have few other options. Current cancer prevention strategies for these women include surgical removal of the breasts and/or ovaries, which can have serious impacts on people's lives. To progress this work, denosumab would need to be formally tested in clinical trials in this setting as it is not approved for breast cancer prevention,\" Professor Lindeman said.\n\nProfessor Visvader said the discovery had its basis in more than a decade of investigations of breast stem cell function. \"By thoroughly dissecting how normal breast tissue develops, we have been able to pinpoint the precise cells that are the culprits in cancer formation,\" she said. \"It is very exciting to think that we may be on the path to the 'holy grail' of cancer research, devising a way to prevent this type of breast cancer in women at high genetic risk.\"\n\nThe research team worked closely with Mrs Avis Macphee, a patient advocate, through the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute's consumer-researcher buddy system.

It's crazy enough to laugh off.\n\nBut here's the thing: BYU researchers have discovered certain compounds found in cocoa can actually help your body release more insulin and respond to increased blood glucose better. Insulin is the hormone that manages glucose, the blood sugar that reaches unhealthy levels in diabetes.\n\nOf course, there's a catch.\n\n\"You probably have to eat a lot of cocoa, and you probably don't want it to have a lot of sugar in it,\" said study author Jeffery Tessem, assistant professor of nutrition, dietetics and food science at BYU. \"It's the compound in cocoa you're after.\"\n\nWhen a person has diabetes, their body either doesn't produce enough insulin or doesn't process blood sugar properly. At the root of that is the failure of beta cells, whose job it is to produce insulin. The new study, published in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, finds beta cells work better and remain stronger with an increased presence of epicatechin monomers, compounds found naturally in cocoa.\n\nTo discover this, collaborators at Virginia Tech first fed the cocoa compound to animals on a high-fat diet. They found that by adding it to the high-fat diet, the compound would decrease the level of obesity in the animals and would increase their ability to deal with increased blood glucose levels.\n\nThe BYU team, comprised of graduate and undergraduate students in Tessem's lab and the labs of Ben Bikman and Jason Hansen (BYU professors of physiology and developmental biology), then dove in and dissected what was happening on the cellular level -- specifically, the beta cell level. That's when they learned cocoa compounds named epicatechin monomers enhanced beta cells' ability to secrete insulin.\n\n\"What happens is it's protecting the cells, it's increasing their ability to deal with oxidative stress,\" Tessem said. \"The epicatechin monomers are making the mitochondria in the beta cells stronger, which produces more ATP (a cell's energy source), which then results in more insulin being released.\"\n\nWhile there has been a lot of research on similar compounds over the past decade, no one has been able to pinpoint which ones are the most beneficial or how exactly they bring about any benefit -- until now. This research shows the epicatechin monomers, the smallest of the compounds, are the most effective.\n\n\"These results will help us get closer to using these compounds more effectively in foods or supplements to maintain normal blood glucose control and potentially even delay or prevent the onset of type-2 diabetes,\" said study co-author Andrew Neilson, assistant professor of food science at Virginia Tech.\n\nBut rather than stocking up on the sugar-rich chocolate bars at the checkout line, researchers believe the starting point is to look for ways to take the compound out of cocoa, make more of it and then use it as a potential treatment for current diabetes patients.

Despite a substantial risk of complications, most patients are satisfied with the outcomes of RTSA at follow-ups of a decade or longer.\n\nStable Long-Term Results of RTSA in Patients Younger than 60\n\nThe researchers analyzed the long-term outcomes of RTSA in 20 patients, average age 57 years. All had \"massive, irreparable\" tears of the rotator cuff muscles, causing shoulder \"pseudoparalysis,\"with little no ability to lift the arm.\n\nThis group of patients typically gets limited benefit from shoulder replacement with conventional implants, which rely on the rotator cuff muscles to provide shoulder movement. The RTSA technique--using an implant in which the natural locations of the shoulder \"ball and socket\" are reversed--uses other muscles to move the shoulder, providing an alternative when the rotator cuff is severely damaged or destroyed.\n\nWhen first introduced, RTSA was performed mainly in elderly patients who placed low demands on the shoulder. With refinements in technique and components in more recent years, the procedure has been used in younger, more active patients. But there are concerns about how well the results of RTSA will hold up over time in this group of patients.\n\nThe new study focused on long-term outcomes of RTSA in patients under age 60. The patients underwent follow-up examination between eight and 19 years after surgery (average 11.7 years). Three patients had RTSA in both shoulders, for a total of 23 procedures.\n\nCompared to their preoperative status, most patients had substantial long-term improvement after RTSA. The average Constant score--a standard assessment accounting for shoulder motion, strength, daily activities, and pain--at the time of final-follow-up improved from 24 to 59 (out of a possible 100).\n\nPatients' ratings of \"subjective shoulder value\" improved from 20 percent to 71 percent (compared to 100 percent for a normal shoulder). Shoulder movement and strength increased, while pain decreased. The improvement was similar for patients with and without prior shoulder surgery.\n\nHowever, complications occurred in 39 percent of the shoulders. Further surgery was required in six shoulders; in two cases, the RTSA procedure was considered a failure.\n\nWhen complications occurred, long-term shoulder functioning was not as good but even with the high complication rate, 72 percent of patients rated their satisfaction level as excellent or good.\n\nThe results alleviate concerns that the clinical benefits of RTSA might not hold up over time in younger, more active patients. Despite its high complication rate, Dr. Gerber and colleagues conclude that RTSA \"provides substantial and lasting improvement\" in shoulder function and pain, in a group of patients with limited treatment options.\n\nClick here to read \"Reverse Total Shoulder Arthroplasty for Massive, Irreparable Rotator Cuff Tears Before the Age of 60 Years: Long-Term Results.\"\n\nAbout The Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery\n\nThe Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery (JBJS) has been the most valued source of information for orthopaedic surgeons and researchers for over 125 years and is the gold standard in peer-reviewed scientific information in the field.

The number of women taking them early in pregnancy is unknown but probably is small, the study suggests.\n\nACE inhibitors are the second-most commonly prescribed class of pharmaceuticals in the United States, with 149 million prescriptions dispensed last year. They came on the market 25 years ago.\n\n\"It would be important for a pregnant woman and her health-care provider to be aware of this, so they can identify an alternative medicine to treat her hypertension,\" said William O.

But this is important enough and impressive enough to tell people about,\" said Robert Temple of the Food and Drug Administration, who spoke to reporters about the findings.\n\nThe agency will consider broadening the \"black box\" warning against taking ACE inhibitors late in pregnancy, he said. The message is that women trying to get pregnant should switch to a different blood-pressure drug, Temple said.\n\nOne-third of the defects involved the heart, one-quarter the limbs or face, and one-tenth the brain or spinal cord, the study found. Many defects, especially the heart problems, are curable with surgery or other treatment. Others, however, cause permanent disability or retardation.\n\nCooper and his colleagues looked at 29,507 births to women covered by Medicaid in Tennessee between 1985 and 2000.\n\nOf that group, 209 babies were born to women who took an ACE inhibitor, and 18 had birth defects. Among 202 babies born to mothers taking some other blood-pressure medication, four had defects. The fraction of babies with defects was 7.1 percent in the ACE-inhibitor group; 1.7 percent in the other anti-hypertensive group; and 2.6 percent in the group taking no blood-pressure medication.\n\nThat such an effect was first noticed a quarter-century after ACE inhibitors arrived on the market points up the lack of data about the effect of drugs in pregnancy.\n\nAll new drugs are tested on pregnant animals to see whether they cause malformations, but those tests can be misleading. It's considered unethical to include pregnant women in studies of new drugs unless the medication is intended to treat pregnancy-related conditions.\n\nAs a consequence, the labels on nearly all medications carry a statement saying their safety to fetuses has not been established.\n\n\"I think it is safe to say that not a lot is known about the options for women in pregnancy,\" said Sandra L.

It paid for the ACE-inhibitor study with help from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

Studies Say Meditation May Help\n\n\u201cThe main finding [of our research] is that, added on top of usual medical care, intervention with a mind-body technique \u2014 transcendental meditation \u2014 can have a major effect on cardiovascular events,\u201d says Robert Schneider, lead author on the study published in Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes and a professor at the Maharishi University of Management, an institution in Iowa that was founded by the creator of transcendental meditation.\n\nHe and his colleagues followed 201 African American men and women, who are at higher risk of heart disease than whites, but who also had addition reason to worry about heart attacks and strokes since they were also diagnosed with coronary heart disease. The participants were randomly assigned to participate in either a health education class about heart-friendly diet and exercise, or to attend a transcendental meditation program. Transcendental meditation involves shutting out the outside world and focusing thoughts inward, or resting while remaining alert. All of the participants continued to receive their normal medical care as well, including appropriate medication.\n\nMORE: Medical Meditation: Say Om Before Surgery\n\nAfter roughly five years of follow-up, the researchers found a 48% reduction in the overall risk of heart attack, stroke, and death from any cause among members of the meditation group compared to those from the health education group. The meditating group enjoyed an average drop of 4.9 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure compared to the control group and also reported less stress and less anger. \u201cIt\u2019s like discovering a whole new class of medications,\u201d Schneider says of the power of meditation in improving the patients\u2019 health.\n\nBut while the magnitude of those results is remarkable, the study involved a relatively small number of participants, and did not reveal how meditation may be lowering heart disease risk. On the surface, it\u2019s intuitively obvious that stress management can affect heart health for the better; anxiety and stress cause blood pressure to shoot up and leave us on edge, triggering spikes in heart-harming stress hormones like cortisol.\n\nBut many experts are skeptical of the alleged benefits of techniques such as transcendental meditation that claim to reduce stress by a substantial amount. In the past, these benefits have been hard to test scientifically, largely because study participants who volunteered for meditation programs may have been biased to see them succeed. Practitioners have also made strong and essentially unsubstantiated claims about the powers of meditation, leading heart experts and scientists to be especially skeptical. In fact, in 2005, more than 500 brain researchers signed a petition (albeit an unsuccessful one) to protest a scheduled lecture on the neuroscience of meditation by the Buddhist spiritual icon, the Dalai Lama, at a major conference organized by the Society for Neuroscience.\n\nMORE: Mind Over Matter: Can Zen Meditation Help You Forget About Pain?\n\nThe great lengths to which the researchers of the Circulation study went to make their trial scientifically rigorous, however, should reinforce the results in the eyes of some skeptics. The scientists adjusted for the effects of weight, smoking behavior, and diet, all of which can influence heart attack, stroke and early heart death rates. And while the participants in both groups exercised more and cut back on alcohol during the study, they did so at similar rates, making these changes unlikely to be responsible for the differences in health outcomes either.\n\nWhile the findings aren\u2019t likely to resolve questions over whether meditation should become a standard part of heart disease care, the results should give more doctors confidence in discussing the practice with their patients and giving them some scientifically based information that\u2019s an improvement over the advice that \u201cit can\u2019t hurt to try.\u201d", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story didn\u2019t rely inappropriately on this\u00a0press release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "LOS ANGELES (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUG. 14, 2017, AT 10 A.M.

Both groups of aged rats were compared to a group of young rats with an average age of 4 months.\n\nBaseline heart function was measured in all rats, using echocardiograms, treadmill stress tests and blood analysis.

But an updated look at the study indicates that heart disease patients who follow this advice may actually increase their risk for death.\n\nThe original \"Sydney Diet Heart Study,\" was initially conducted between 1966 and 1973, at a time when the cholesterol-lowering benefits of all polyunsaturated vegetable acids (PUFAs) were touted with a broad brush.\n\nBut in the ensuing years, researchers have come to understand that not all PUFAs are alike, with key biochemical differences -- and perhaps varying cardiovascular impacts -- observed among multiple types of omega-3s (found in fish oils) and omega-6 linoleic acids.\n\n\"There is more than one type of polyunsaturated fatty acid,\" explained Dr. Christopher Ramsden, who headed the re-analysis and is a clinical investigator with the laboratory of membrane biophysics and biochemistry at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.\n\n\"And so, we were interested in trying to evaluate just one of these compounds, linoleic acid, by looking at this old trial using modern statistical methods, and also by re-including some original data that had gone missing from the first analysis,\" Ramsden explained.\n\nThe findings appeared online Feb. 5 in the BMJ.\n\nThe 458 male participants in the original study had been between the ages of 30 and 59 at enrollment, and all had a history of heart disease, with most having survived a heart attack.\n\nThe men were placed into two groups. The first group was told to consume linoleic acid, in the form of safflower oil and safflower oil polyunsaturated margarine, at levels equal to 15 percent of total calorie intake. This, said Ramsden, is equivalent to roughly twice the amount that Americans currently consume.\n\nWhile omega-3 consumption was not affected, the men were also asked to lower their saturated fat intake so that it made up less than 10 percent of their diets. They did so by substituting safflower oil for animal fats, common margarines and shortening oils, salad dressings, baked goods and other products, according to the study.\n\nThe second group continued their routine nutritional habits, and both groups kept food diaries and underwent regular assessments during the three-year-plus study period.\n\nBy newly crunching all the original data the NIH team found that, compared to the no-dietary-change group, the linoleic acid group faced a higher risk of death, from both heart disease specifically as well as from all causes overall.\n\nIn turn, Ramsden's investigators included their Sydney conclusions in a new review of all studies to date exploring the impact of omega-6 consumption.\n\nDespite the fact the American Heart Association (AHA) currently recommends that 5 percent to 10 percent of all calories come from polyunsaturated fat (principally from omega-6), the NIH team found no evidence to support the notion that linoleic acid confers health benefits. The review highlighted the possibility that boosting omega-6 consumption may actually increase the risk for developing heart disease.\n\nRamsden acknowledged that the Sydney study had been narrowly focused on a specific group of people: middle-aged men with a history of heart disease, who were asked to consume linoleic acid in quantities far exceeding both AHA guidelines and the dietary habits of most Americans.\n\n\"So, yes, one of the limitations of this kind of study is always the question of its generalizability to other populations,\" he cautioned.\n\nBut he also suggested that his team's rigorous look back offered valuable insights into how nutritional science has evolved.\n\n\"What to many people had at one time seemed pretty straightforward in the 1960s has turned out to form a much less black-and-white picture,\" he said. \"Polyunsaturates are not just involved in cholesterol-lowering. They may also be involved in inflammation, oxidation or clotting. So, it's a very complex picture. And though our goal is not to come up with diet advice, it may be that our conclusions will have important implications for nutritional guidelines.\"\n\nOn that score, American Heart Association spokesperson Penny Kris-Etherton, a registered dietician and professor of nutrition at Pennsylvania State University, suggested that the controversy concerning linoleic acid is not new and will continue.\n\n\"But I don't think this is going to change AHA recommendations,\" she said. \"Because there's very robust evidence showing the cardiovascular benefit of linoleic acid. The AHA science advisory board did not just look at one study or a couple of studies. There are lots of studies that form the basis for their guidelines.\"\n\n\"So, I don't think anybody should get alarmed and change their diet,\" Kris-Etherton said. \"Those who are concerned should wait for more research to come out on this topic before taking any drastic measures to change their eating habits in a way that could be harmful.\"\n\nFor more on AHA guidelines regarding linoleic acid, visit the American Heart Association.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "There is enough original reporting that we can be sure the story didn\u2019t rely on a press release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Eating tomatoes in your daily salad or regularly enjoying a healthy red sauce on your spaghetti could help reduce your risk of stroke, according to research published this week in the journal Neurology.\n\nTomatoes contain a powerful antioxidant that is good for brain health, the researchers say, and cooked tomatoes seem to offer more protection than raw.\n\n\"This study adds to the evidence that a diet high in fruits and vegetables is associated with a lower risk of stroke,\" says study author Jouni Karppi, of the University of Eastern Finland in Kuopio. \"A diet containing tomatoes... a few times a week would be good for our health. However, daily intake of tomatoes may give better protection.\" \n\n \n\n Karppi says it's the chemical lycopene that gives tomatoes and other fruits/vegetables their rich red color, that is helping to protect the brain. Tomatoes are particularly high in the powerful antioxidant that acts like a sponge, soaking up rogue molecules called free radicals that if left unchecked can damage cells.\n\nResearchers tested the level of lycopene in the blood of more than 1,000 Finnish men aged 46 to 65, starting in 1991. Scientists then followed the men on average for more than a decade to record the number who had strokes.\n\nThe scientists found that those with the highest levels of lycopene were 55% less likely to have a stroke than those with the lowest amounts in their blood.\n\nThough the study looks promising, experts say that we can't necessarily give all of the credit to lycopene.\n\n\"It's a compelling study and it fits with other data that we have about risk of stroke and vegetable and fruit consumption,\" explains Dr. Daniel Labovitz, director of the Stern Stroke Center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York. \"But it's not proof that if you eat tomatoes you're going to have less risk of stroke.\"\n\nLabovitz also points out that the group of men who had fewer strokes were younger, had lower blood pressure and smoked less than the group more prone to stroke. Though the researchers tried to take these lifestyle factors into account when calculating their findings, it may be that these things influenced the outcomes.\n\nIn other words, perhaps better health habits - not necessarily just the lycopene - lead to fewer strokes.\n\nLycopene has attracted a lot of attention in recent years because it's such a powerful antioxidant. If we don't eat enough lycopene-packed foods, experts suspect too many free radicals get left in the body, damaging blood vessels by helping to form fatty deposits. When these deposits build up, a blockage forms. If that vessel is in the brain, the blockage can cause a stroke.\n\nBut the foods we eat are complex and filled with many nutrients, making it tough to prove what is really providing benefits.\n\n\"Eating tomatoes is a good thing, but we don't know if there is really anything unique about tomatoes apart from other fruits and vegetables that reduce stroke risk,\" explains Dr. Walter Willett, chair of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nTomatoes could contribute to reducing stroke in other ways, Willett says, because they are a good source of potassium, which is known to reduce blood pressure. Elevated blood pressure is major risk factor for stroke.\n\nSo are lycopene packed tomatoes really the magic fruit? It seems the jury is still out, but researchers suggest we eat healthy as they continue to search for answers.\n\n\"This is one more reason to consume fruits and vegetables - at least 5 a day - and it's good to include tomatoes in that mix,\" Willett said.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "There is enough independent perspective in this piece that we can be sure it wasn\u2019t based on a press release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "ROSEMONT, Ill.

This new research analyzed data from multiple trials to determine the relative effectiveness of various nonsurgical treatments for knee OA. The treatments that were compared and ranked included acetaminophen; ibuprofen; intra-articular (IA) or joint injections of cortisone; platelet-rich plasma (PRP); hyaluronic acid (HA); several NSAIDs, such as naproxen, celecoxib, and diclofenac; and both oral and IA placebo.\n\n\"This is the first comprehensive mixed-comparison analysis comparing best-evidence scientific research and excluding lower quality studies that can bias the outcomes,\" said lead author and orthopaedic surgeon David Jevsevar, MD, MBA. \"Using a statistical ranking technique, we worked to provide evidence regarding which of the most common NSAIDs are most likely to decrease pain and improve function, and we attempted to fill in the gaps in evidence for more inconclusive treatments such as HA, PRP, and corticosteroids.\"\n\nAuthors analyzed 53 randomized controlled trials that examined knee OA treatments for at least 28 days and included a minimum of 30 participants per study group. Knee OA treatments were ranked on a scale of one to five, with one being the most effective. They found the following:\n\u2022 For pain reduction, cortisone injections provided the greatest short-term (4 to 6 weeks) pain relief, followed by ibuprofen, PRP injections, naproxen, and celecoxib.\n\u2022 Naproxen ranked the highest for probability for improving function, followed by diclofenac, celecoxib, ibuprofen, and PRP injections.\n\u2022 Naproxen was ranked the most effective individual knee OA treatment for improving both pain and function followed by cortisone injections, PRP injections, ibuprofen and celecoxib.\n\u2022 HA injections did not achieve a rank in the top five treatments for pain, function, or combined pain and function. An analysis of 12 articles also found that results with HA are not significantly different from those with IA placebo for treatment of knee OA.\n\n\"Because knee OA has both a high disease burden and high treatment costs, additional prospective studies using similar outcomes, timelines, and measures of clinically important changes are needed,\" explained Dr. Jevsevar. \"While the information in this analysis is helpful to physicians, patients also can benefit from these findings and use it with their doctors to weigh all possible treatment options.\"\n\nAlthough the use of NSAIDs for arthritic conditions such as knee OA has potential risks, including heart attack and stroke, existing evidence indicates that naproxen has less potential for adverse cardiovascular events.\n\nMore information about the AAOS and JAAOS\n\nFollow the AAOS on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram \n\nFollow the conversation about JAAOS on Twitter\n\nFrom the Department of Orthopaedics, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH (Dr. Jevsevar), American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, Rosemont, IL (Mr. Shores, Mr. Mullen, Ms. Schulte, and Dr. Cummins), and Franciscan Orthopedic Associates, Tacoma, WA (Dr. Brown).

Moreover, the study showed that the blood test detected symptoms of concussions, even when brain injuries were not visible on the CT scan.\n\nThe team then tested blood serum from the same patients, which was taken less than 6 hours after their injuries. \"With our blood test, we were able to identify the presence of brain injuries 94 percent of the time,\" said Papa. \"This simple blood test was nearly as accurate as a state-of-the-art CT scan.\"\n\nEven more impressive, the blood test also gave doctors an indication of how severe the brain injury was. \"We were looking at different types of brain lesions detected by the CT scans, ranging from mild to serious injuries, and found that the biomarker we tested for actually corresponded to the injuries. Levels of the biomarker were lower in mild cases, and were much more elevated in severe case,\" said Papa.\n\nThe biomarker this particular blood test looks for is known as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). These proteins are found in glial cells, which surround neurons in the brain.\n\nWhen there's an injury to the brain cells, the GFAP are released. What makes them unique is that they pass the blood-brain barrier and enter the bloodstream, which makes them easy to detect with this particular test.\n\nCurrently, almost all concussions in children are diagnosed only by symptoms, which are either observed, like vomiting or balance problems, or symptoms that are reported by the child, like headaches, blurred vision or feeling groggy. Neither scenario gives doctors an objective indication of the severity of the injury.\n\nCT scans can provide a more definitive profile of the injury, \"however, they are expensive and are associated with radiation exposure,\" said Papa. \"You really want to minimize the amount of CTs you do to your patients, especially children, who are a lot more sensitive to radiation and the side effects that can come with it.\"\n\n\"If there was a simple diagnostic tool like a blood test that can tell us quickly and accurately if a brain injury has occurred, and how severe it might be, that would be ideal,\" said Papa. \"That's what we are striving for with this project.\"\n\nIn fact, Papa envisions the development of mobile devices that could diagnose concussions on the spot, much like the devices diabetics use to test their blood with a simple finger prick and a drop of blood.\n\n\"The idea is to get a point-of-care test that could be used on the field, to help the coaches, the trainers and the athletic directors, make a decision then and there about whether the child should go back to play,\" said Papa.\n\nIt's estimated nearly a quarter of a million children a year are treated in hospitals for traumatic brain injuries like concussions, that occur while playing sports. That's an average of nearly 700 children a every day.\n\n\"If we could find a simple test that takes the guess work out of diagnosing these kids, that would completely change the way we approach concussions and would certainly give parents greater peace of mind,\" said Papa.\n\nResearchers plan to do more studies with the blood test, but they hope it will be commercially available within the next 5 years.", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "The release calls the test \u201csimple\u201d in several places whereas our review shows that it would be anything but.

There have been other articles [stating] that alcohol might be protective,\" said Dr. Guy Fiocco, assistant professor of internal medicine at Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine and director of rheumatology at Scott & White in Temple, Texas. \"[But] I don't think we're going to be advocating alcohol to prevent rheumatoid arthritis.\"\n\nNor do the study authors advise drinking as a cure for arthritis. \"We would wish to point out that, at the moment, that our findings are preliminary, and would not recommend that patients drink alcohol with the specific purpose of treating their arthritis,\" said Dr. James Maxwell, lead author of the study and a consultant rheumatologist at The Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust in England.\n\n\"We would also remind patients to observe recommended government limits for alcohol consumption,\" he added.\n\nAccording to background information in the study, published online July 28 in Rheumatology, previous studies were mostly conducted in mice. The benefit of ethanol exposure for these rodents seemed to be due to higher levels of testosterone, the researchers wrote.\n\nFor this study, the authors compared 1,004 healthy participants to 873 people with rheumatoid arthritis. Both of those groups were divided into four groups: nondrinkers, those who drank 1 to 5 days a month, the ones who drank 6 to 10 days a month, and those who drank more frequently.\n\n\"We found that arthritis was progressively less severe as alcohol frequency increased, with a definite difference compared to nondrinkers even in the least frequent alcohol consumption group,\" Maxwell said.\n\nThe teetotalers had quadruple the risk of having rheumatoid arthritis compared with those who drank in the highest category.\n\nAnd the more often one drank, the less damaging the rheumatoid arthritis tended to be, including healthier joints as shown on X-rays and less inflammation.\n\nThe association was seen in both men and women, though it was stronger in males.\n\nAlthough no one can pinpoint a reason for the link with certainty, \"essentially we think that alcohol may be having an effect by reducing the immune response, which leads to joint inflammation, and also that it may have a mild pain-killing effect,\" said Maxwell.\n\n\"There's a little information that alcohol can suppress the immune system,\" added Fiocco. \"What's been reported is that people who drink excessive alcohol actually have higher levels of the cytokines that lead to the inflammation and moderate amounts of alcohol actually may lower these levels.\"\n\nThis finding is slightly different than what is reported in the current study (that the severity of the disease decreased with more alcohol).\n\nBecause the researchers assessed drinking frequency, rather than the amount of alcohol consumed, it is not clear how much alcohol might be helpful, they said.\n\nAnd Maxwell stressed that their preliminary findings need to be replicated in the future.\n\n\"There are limitations to any research which asks patients to report their exposure to something (such as alcohol) over a period of time,\" Maxwell added. \"We would therefore recommend that a future prospective study should be performed to further assess the impact of alcohol consumption on rheumatoid arthritis, a study recording alcohol consumption at the time rather than asking about it later.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases has more on rheumatoid arthritis.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "Does not appear to have relied on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "For years, research has shown that babies born by cesarean section are more likely to develop health problems. Now, a groundbreaking study suggests that not all C-sections are equally risky.\n\nThe research looked at all full-term, firstborn births in Scotland over a 15-year period and tracked the babies\u2019 long-term health. It is one of the largest and longest studies to explore how planned C-sections differ from other deliveries.\n\nSurprisingly, the data showed more health problems among babies born by planned C-section than among those delivered by emergency C-section or vaginal birth, even though the planned surgery is done under more controlled conditions. The finding suggests that the arduous experience of labor \u2014 that exhausting, sweaty, utterly unpredictable yet often strangely exhilarating process \u2014 may give children a healthy start, even when it\u2019s interrupted by a surgical birth.\n\nThe new findings, published in JAMA this month, are important because the number of babies born by C-section has increased tremendously. In the United States, nearly one in three babies are born by C-section. Cesarean births that had no medical indication increased, to 5.5 percent of low-risk women in 2001, up from 3.3 percent of such women in 1991.\n\nDr. Mairead Black, the University of Aberdeen obstetrician who led the study, said that as cesarean births had increased in Scotland and worldwide, the researchers wondered what, if anything, children born by C-section \u201care missing out on.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur thinking was: If a baby is born naturally, it comes into contact with bacteria from the mother, which might help with immune system development,\u201d Dr. Black said.\n\nEven attempted labor may provide some exposure to bacteria, she said. But babies delivered by a planned C-section, which is usually scheduled to take place well before the first pang of labor, may miss out entirely.\n\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t wait for labor to begin on its own, you cut short all kinds of physiological changes and preparations for birth that are taking place toward the end of pregnancy,\u201d said Carol Sakala, the director of the nonprofit Childbirth Connection programs at the National Partnership for Women & Families. \u201cWhat is the effect of cutting off those processes so casually on such a large scale?\u201d\n\nStudies have consistently found that children born by C-section are at higher risk for health problems like obesity and allergies. C-section birth has also been associated with a higher risk for Type 1 diabetes.\n\nThe Scottish study took advantage of the small country\u2019s rich trove of linked birth and medical databases to track the long-term health of 321,287 babies. Nearly 4 percent were born by planned C-section and 17 percent were delivered by emergency surgery. The remaining 252,917 were vaginal births.\n\nThe researchers compared a range of health outcomes among the babies, including asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, Type 1 diabetes, early death and cancer.\n\nOver all, the differences between a scheduled C-section and an emergency C-section were slight. However, the data do begin to shed light on why babies born through vaginal birth may have fewer health risks than babies born by C-section.\n\nThe biggest difference between babies born by scheduled and unscheduled C-section appeared in risk for Type 1 diabetes. The results showed that babies born by planned C-section had a 35 percent higher risk of Type 1 diabetes compared with babies born by emergency C-section, after adjusting for differences among the mothers.\n\nAll of the babies born by C-section were slightly more likely to use an asthma inhaler at age 5: 10.3 percent of planned C-section babies and 10.19 percent of unscheduled C-section babies wound up using an inhaler, compared with 9.6 percent of vaginally born babies. Asthma hospitalization rates were also higher for babies born by planned C-section with a statistically significant increase of 22 percent over vaginally born babies.\n\nAlthough all of the C-section babies were more likely to be obese at age 5, the differences were not statistically significant after adjusting for differences among the mothers. There were no significant differences in cancer and irritable bowel disease among any of the types of births.\n\nNo one knows exactly why labor may be protective, but the spontaneous onset of labor prompts fluid to clear from a baby\u2019s lungs, said Dr. Aaron Caughey, who helped draw up 2014 guidelines for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that urged providers to let women spend more time in labor and avoid an unnecessary C-section.\n\nThe step is just one of a cascade of physiological changes that take place in mother and baby during the labor process, including surges in stress hormones and reproductive hormones like oxytocin that may help the fetus adapt during labor, preserve blood flow to the organs, and keep the baby alert and prepared for breast-feeding.\n\nDuring labor, a newborn absorbs maternal microbes into its mouth and gastrointestinal tract, said Dr. Josef Neu, a neonatologist at the University of Florida who has written about C-section babies and the hygiene hypothesis.\n\nThe theory is that maternal microbes \u201ctrain\u201d the infant\u2019s immune system, so it doesn\u2019t overreact or become destructive and precipitate autoimmune disorders like Type 1 diabetes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an education process that says, \u2018Calm down, you\u2019re going to be seeing this antigen again, you don\u2019t have to be so aggressive,\u2019\u201d Dr. Neu said.\n\nDr. Neu said the broad-spectrum antibiotics prescribed to the mother before a surgical delivery were another concern; the antibiotics can be transmitted to the baby through breast milk if not before birth, decreasing the diversity of natural bacteria.\n\nThe findings are a reminder that although C-sections are appropriate in some circumstances, they are a poor substitute for labor.\n\nChildbirth and labor are \u201ca physiological process that we\u2019ve evolved to over millions of years,\u201d Dr. Caughey said. \u201cIt\u2019s been really well-designed by evolution.\u201d\n\u2022 Does Frequent Sex Prime the Immune System for Pregnancy?\n\n\n\n For more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story did not rely on a news release.\u00a0There is evidence of independent reporting.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "A widely anticipated study suggests that hormone therapy started soon after menopause can ease depression, anxiety, hot flashes and other adverse symptoms that many women face, without increasing risks for cardiovascular disease.\n\nThere was no increase in breast cancer, stroke, heart attack or blood clots, but the study's researchers said the sample size was too small and the study time too short to draw firm conclusions.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story does not appear to rely on a press release, as there is evidence of original reporting with the two quotations.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "LONDON (Reuters) - First results from a human trial of an Ebola vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline show it is safe and generates an immune response, scientists said on Wednesday, but larger trials are needed to see if it protects and if a booster is needed.\n\nThe vaccine is being developed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and GSK against the Zaire strain of Ebola \u2014 the one circulating in West Africa \u2014 and the first doses for a larger trial arrived in Liberia last week.\n\nThat trial is the first of several mid-stage studies planned for West Africa and aims to test GSK\u2019s vaccine and one from Merck and NewLink.

Though there were observational studies, those may be biased because men who opt to hold off on treatment may be those whose tumors are lower risk to begin with, he said.\n\nThe study is published in the June 6 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nWatchful waiting -- which does not involve cancer treatment -- means having regular exams while keeping an eye on the tumor to see if it grows or spreads. It is usually recommended when doctors feel someone's advanced age will allow them to outlive the generally slow-moving cancer or when someone has other conditions that are more likely to prove lethal.\n\nMen who are diagnosed with early prostate cancer -- meaning it's confined to the prostate gland and has not spread -- are confronted with a bewildering array of options for treating it: surgery; radiation; drugs to deprive the tumor of the hormone androgen that may drive its growth; or watchful waiting.\n\nIn 2008, AHRQ also commissioned a review of studies on other prostate cancer treatment options, but that report could not draw conclusions on the best approach either.\n\n\"What all of these analyses have found is there is very limited data that allows us to determine which of these approaches in the best approach,\" said Dr. Durado Brooks, director of prostate cancer for the American Cancer Society.\n\nBrooks said more comparative effectiveness research, which compares different kinds of treatments, is needed.\n\nIn the meantime, what are men diagnosed with early prostate cancer to do?\n\nMen and their doctors need to consider what the tumor looks like under the microscope, which can help gauge how aggressive it may be. They should also consider age and overall health status, including whether or not the patient has other conditions more likely to cause death than the prostate cancer.\n\nFinally, patients and their doctors should weight the potential debilitating side effects of the treatments, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction, against how comfortable the man is with holding off on treatment, experts say.\n\n\"Men need to learn as much as they can about the possible outcomes and benefits of the various treatments and the potential side effects, and choose which direction they are most comfortable with,\" Brooks said.\n\nIn the current review, researchers found several trials that compared different doses of radiation and different types of radiation therapy, including external beam radiation therapy, in which a radiation is delivered through a beam through the skin, or brachytherapy, in which radioactive isotopes are delivered via injection into the prostate.\n\nFor those methods, too, there was too little research to say with confidence which method was superior in preventing deaths from prostate cancer, the researchers said. Retrospective studies, however, found that radiation treatments were associated with increased urinary or bowel problems, compared with no treatment or no initial treatment.\n\nThere was also \"moderate strength evidence\" that a higher external beam radiation was more effective than a lower dose.\n\nTaken together, the review \"does point out that based on current evidence, doctors should not be telling their patients that this form of radiation is better than that form,\" Brooks said. \"Some of the distinctions being made are not really supported by the evidence.\"\n\nProton beam therapy in particular is expensive, but according to this report, there isn't enough evidence to show it's any better than other option.\n\nRadiation, he noted, may be the best option for men whose tumors have spread outside the gland, since simply removing the prostate gland surgically is not likely to be as effective, he said.\n\nThe American Cancer Society estimates that in 2009, approximately 192,000 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer and approximately 27,000 men died of the disease.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute has more on prostate cancer.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story did not rely solely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Ever since she was an infant, Reagan Roberts could not tolerate being anywhere near cow's milk.

The approach, known as oral immunotherapy, involves slowly desensitizing the immune system by painstakingly ingesting increasing amounts of whatever triggers the reaction.\n\n\"It's pretty encouraging,\" said Robert A. Wood, chief of pediatric allergy and immunology at Johns Hopkins, who led the study that Reagan participated in at the Hopkins Children's Center in Baltimore. \"We've still got a long way to go, but I never thought we'd get this far.\"\n\nAlthough the approach appears to be highly effective for some children with milk and peanut allergies, the researchers conducting the studies and others caution that much more research is needed to prove and perfect the approach and that it is far from ready for widespread use. No one should try the approach on his own, because the treatments themselves can trigger potentially life-threatening reactions.\n\n\"It's still very investigational,\" said Wesley Burks, chief of the division of pediatric allergy and immunology at Duke University, who has produced promising results in children with peanut allergies. \"We're very hopeful. But there are lot of things we need to do to understand it better, make it more effective and make sure it's safe.\"\n\nThe strategy is being tested in a handful of small studies that are part of a surge of research in a field that for years showed little progress.\n\n\"There's been a substantial uptick in the amount of research,\" said Marshall Plaut of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which has more than doubled the funding for food-allergy research since 2007. \"I think it's time to be cautiously optimistic.\"\n\nIn addition to the oral immunotherapy studies, scientists are in the early stages of testing an experimental suppository, a Chinese herbal remedy and variations of oral immunotherapy that might be safer and more effective.\n\n\"There's definitely been a spike in the amount of work going on,\" said Hugh A. Sampson, a professor of pediatrics, allergy and immunology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York who leads a federally funded consortium studying food allergies. \"Five years ago there was almost nothing going on in people with respect to therapies, whereas now there are a variety of different therapies being looked at.\"\n\nThe spike in research has been driven by increasing evidence that food allergies are becoming more common, occurring earlier in life and lasting longer. About 12 million Americans are estimated to suffer from food allergies, including about 3 million children. Some evidence suggests that peanut allergies may have doubled in children in the past decade.\n\nThe reason for the trend is the subject of intense research and debate. There are several theories, including changes in how food is processed and children's not being exposed to certain foods early in life. Evidence has also been mounting for the \"hygiene hypothesis,\" which blames growing up in increasingly sterile homes, making the immune system overreact to ordinarily harmless substances, including food.\n\nWhatever the cause, researchers have long struggled to develop therapies. Food allergies can trigger symptoms ranging from rashes and hives to responses believed to cause perhaps 200 deaths each year in the United States. Currently, food-allergic people have only two options: to avoid the substance that causes their reaction or to try to stop a reaction with an injection of epinephrine.\n\nThat leaves parents of allergic children scouring food labels, avoiding restaurants, sending their children to school and parties with specially made food and snacks, and still worrying about inadvertent contact with peanuts, milk, eggs and other ubiquitous foods.\n\n\"It's hard to live,\" said Angie Duty of Durham, N.C., whose 9-year-old son, Sam, was intensely allergic to peanuts before undergoing the therapy as part of one Burks's studies. \"Sam doesn't like to be different, but of course he is different and we have to explain that to him.\"\n\nAlthough doctors have long used shots to desensitize people allergic to pollen and other substances, early attempts to do the same for food allergies ended in failure.\n\n\"The side effects were so great that they were as bad if not worse than the disease itself,\" Burks said.\n\nBut a small number of researchers in recent years have begun trying the approach again, this time by orally administering the protein in the food that triggers the allergic reaction.\n\nWith doctors standing by in case of a severe reaction, each study subject undergoes careful testing to determine the maximum dose he or she can safely tolerate. Once that is established, the participants are sent home to sprinkle that amount of purified protein on their food for a week or two; then they return to the research center in to see if the dose can be increased. The procedure is repeated for months or even years to slowly raise the amount they can safely consume.\n\n\"It's a way of sort of rerouting or tricking the immune system to no longer be allergic to that food,\" said Stacie Jones, chief of allergy and immunology at the Arkansas Children's Hospital, who has been working Burks to test the approach for peanut allergies.\n\nIn a study involving 19 children who were severely allergic to milk, Wood found that within four to six months most of the children significantly increased the amount of milk protein they could tolerate. After between about nine months and two years, about half of the children could safely consume as much milk or food containing milk as they wanted.\n\n\"These are children who could have died from a teaspoon of milk before,\" Wood said.\n\nIn March, Burks and Jones reported the results of a pilot study involving 33 children with peanut allergies. The children started by ingesting peanut protein powder equivalent to one one-thousandth of a peanut. Four of the children had to drop out because of allergic reactions, but six of nine children who underwent the treatment for 2 1/2 years have been able to stop the peanut powder and have now gone six to eight months without reacting to eating peanuts. \"It's fabulous,\" said Janet Vande Berg of Durham, N.C., whose 9-year-old daughter, Caroline, can eat peanuts for the first time in her life. \"It makes a huge, huge difference in the quality of life for both the kids and the families. It just takes the stress away.\"\n\nThe researchers are tracking the remaining children in the study to see if any others achieve similar results and have followed up with a more stringent study in which 13 children received a similar treatment and seven received a placebo.\n\nAfter about 10 months, all seven children on the placebo were still allergic, whereas none of the 13 on the peanut powder had reactions when they were challenged. All the children are now receiving the treatment and are being followed to see if they remain desensitized and perhaps become \"tolerant,\" meaning they no longer need to consume daily doses of peanuts or peanut protein to maintain their ability to eat peanuts freely.\n\n\"I think it's an important advance in the field,\" said the NIH's Plaut. \"It's a small number of subjects, so it's hard to draw full-blown conclusions. But it's the first data that suggest you may be able to achieve something like this in food allergies.\"\n\nIt remains far from clear, however, what proportion of children will benefit, how long the benefit might last and what proportion will need to continue to consume at least some milk or peanuts every day to maintain their protection. While some children, such as Vande Berg, appear to completely lose their allergies, others seem to just be able to eat more of the milk or food before reacting. But even that can be helpful.\n\n\"We know this therapy at least protects them from accidental ingestion so they won't have a life-threatening reaction,\" said Jones, the Arkansas researcher. \"At the very least it's providing some security for these families.\"\n\nBurks and Jones are part of the federal consortium, which is studying the same approach for eggs at research institutions across the country, including Johns Hopkins, and conducting detailed immunological studies to try to get a better understanding of how the treatment works.\n\nMeanwhile, researchers in London are studying 640 babies at high risk for food allergies to see if exposing them to peanuts early in life reduces their chances of developing the allergy in the first place.\n\n\"There are a lot of people putting ideas out there and producing some promising preliminary data,\" Plaut said. \"That makes me think there will be some important developments in the future.\"", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "Does not appear to rely on a press release.\u00a0 ", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Previous studies have shown that nitrites \u2014 also found in high concentrations in celery, cabbage, and other leafy, green vegetables like spinach \u2014 widen blood vessels, but researchers say this was the first to find that nitrites also increase blood flow to the brain .\n\nBeet roots contain high concentrations of nitrates, which are converted into nitrites by bacteria in the mouth .

And blood tests before and after breakfast confirmed nitrite levels in the body.\n\nOn the third and fourth days, researchers switched diets and repeated the process for each person.\n\nMRI scans showed that after eating a high-nitrate diet, the older adults had increased blood flow to the white matter of the frontal lobes, which are the areas of the brain most commonly associated with the degeneration that leads to dementia and other cognitive conditions.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The story was nothing more than a rewrite and a rearrangement of a Wake Forest University news release.", "answer": 0}, {"article": "A daily supplement of pharmaceutical grade chondroitin is as good as celecoxib (Celebrex) at relieving arthritic knee pain and doesn\u2019t have dangerous side effects, researchers say.\n\nDr. Jean-Yves Reginster of Liege State University in Belgium and colleagues recruited 604 people over age 50 with knee osteoarthritis from five European countries and randomly assigned them to take 800 mg of the extra-pure chondroitin sulfate (Chondrosulf), 200 mg of celecoxib (Celebrex) or a placebo every day for six months.\n\nThose who took chondroitin sulfate or celecoxib had similar levels of pain relief at the end of the study, and in both groups the improvement was greater than for those taking just a placebo, according to the report in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases.\n\nReginster told Reuters Health the findings are in line with earlier studies showing pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate could significantly decrease the progression of knee osteoarthritis over a period of three years.\n\nHe stressed that pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin is not the same as over-the-counter supplements, which are made differently and can\u2019t get into the joint in high enough concentrations to combat the causes of cartilage degradation and pain.\n\nEuropean regulatory bodies recommend pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate as well as pharmaceutical-grade glucosamine sulfate as first-line treatments for osteoarthritis, Reginster said by email, because of the side effects associated with celecoxib and other non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including stomach ulcers, bleeding, liver and kidney problems.\n\nDr. Michael Shepard of Hoag Orthopedic Institute in Orange, California, noted that the study had a relatively low number of participants and that most U.S. studies of this type would run two years rather than six months.\n\nIn addition, U.S.-based studies of chondroitin have had mixed results, said Shepard, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. Some have found the supplements to be as effective as ibuprofen (also an NSAID), and some have found that chondroitin sulfate is no more effective than placebo, he told Reuters Health.\n\n\u201cI tell my patients, \u2018buyer beware,\u2019\u201d Shepard said in an email. \u201cI tell them about the mixed results of chondroitin in the literature. I tell them to try chondroitin for one month as a trial and if they like it and feel better with it, then keep taking it.\u201d\n\nIf chondroitin doesn\u2019t work for them, he suggests taking an NSAID \u201cperiodically,\u201d and to be aware of the side effects.\n\n\u201cIf you are going to stay on an NSAID for a prolonged period then you need regular follow up with your doctor,\u201d Shepard cautioned.\n\nDr. Rachel Wolfe of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, agreed that chondroitin is \u201creasonable to try\u201d for some people, especially those with contraindications to NSAIDs.\n\n\u201cHowever, it should not replace other therapy such as quad strengthening exercises, and weight loss, which we know will provide benefit. It should be used in conjunction with these measures,\u201d said Wolfe, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\n\u201cChondroitin is not a miracle pill, but if it allows people to feel less pain and be more active, thereby losing weight and strengthening muscles, then I think there may benefit,\u201d Wolfe told Reuters Health by email. \u201cStudies like this highlight that medicine is still an art - we do not have perfect answers, and we have to individualize for each patient.\u201d\n\nThe study was sponsored by IBSA Institut Biochimique SA, a pharmaceutical company based in Lugano, Switzerland, that makes the chondroitin sulfate supplements used in the test.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2rcPLh0 Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, online May 22, 2017.", "question": "Does the story appear to rely solely or largely on a news release?", "explanation": "The article does not appear to rely on a news release.", "answer": 1}, {"article": "Indiana University researchers have found that magnesium intake may be beneficial in preventing pancreatic cancer.\n\nTheir study, \"Magnesium intake and incidence of pancreatic cancer: The VITamins and Lifestyle study,\" recently appeared in the British Journal of Cancer.\n\nPancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in both men and women in the United States. The overall occurrence of pancreatic cancer has not significantly changed since 2002, but the mortality rate has increased annually from 2002 to 2011, according to the National Cancer Institute.\n\n\"Pancreatic cancer is really unique and different from other cancers,\" said study co-author Ka He, chair of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the IU School of Public Health-Bloomington. \"The five-year survival rate is really low, so that makes prevention and identifying risk factors or predictors associated with pancreatic cancer very important.\"\n\nPrevious studies have found that magnesium is inversely associated with the risk of diabetes, which is a risk factor of pancreatic cancer. But few studies have explored the direct association of magnesium with pancreatic cancer; of those that did, their findings were inconclusive, said Daniel Dibaba, a Ph.D. student at the School of Public Health-Bloomington, who led the IU study.\n\nUsing information from the VITamins and Lifestyle study, Dibaba and the other co-authors analyzed an enormous trove of data on over 66,000 men and women, ages 50 to 76, looking at the direct association between magnesium and pancreatic cancer and whether age, gender, body mass index, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs use and magnesium supplementation play a role.\n\nOf those followed, 151 participants developed pancreatic cancer. The study found that every 100-milligrams-per-day decrease in magnesium intake was associated with a 24 percent increase in the occurrence of pancreatic cancer. The study also found that the effects of magnesium on pancreatic cancer did not appear to be modified by age, gender, body mass index or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, but was limited to those taking magnesium supplements either from a multivitamin or individual supplement.\n\n\"For those at a higher risk of pancreatic cancer, adding a magnesium supplement to their diet may prove beneficial in preventing this disease,\" Dibaba said. \"While more study is needed, the general population should strive to get the daily recommendations of magnesium through diet, such as dark, leafy greens or nuts, to prevent any risk of pancreatic cancer.\"\n\nIn addition to He and Dibaba, other contributors included Pengcheng Xun, a faculty member in IU's Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics; Kuninobu Yokota of The Jikei University School of Medicine in Tokyo, Japan; and Emily White of the University of Washington in Seattle.", "question": "Does the news release include unjustifiable, sensational language, including in the quotes of researchers?", "explanation": "The release doesn\u2019t come right out and say that taking magnesium will reduce pancreatic cancer risk but it comes close.
